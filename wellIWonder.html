<div class="userstuff">
<p>Westview fucking New Jersey.</p><p>Rio had spent the last twenty years building a life elsewhere, and yet here she stood–</p><p>In her childhood home, in Westview fucking New Jersey.</p><p>A place she had vowed herself never to return to, and to be fair, she hadn’t.</p><p>Every holiday for the past two decades, her mom visited her in New York, knowing Rio wouldn’t cross the Westview town limits unless there was a gun pointed at her head.</p><p>Or-</p><p>Until her mom got sick.</p><p>So Rio dropped her life in New York, her friends, the casual sex, her mildly successful career. She dropped it all without hesitation to stay at her mom’s hospital bedside, talking and reminiscing.</p><p>Her mom was fifty-nine and died on some random Tuesday, at some random hospital, of some random fucking disease that decided to attack her body.</p><p>And Rio-</p><p>Rio didn’t have anyone, not really, she never had besides her mom. She’d always been a loner. So, she dealt with it alone.</p><p>She drowned in the hospital bills, alone.</p><p>She handled the burial, alone.</p><p>And now, she was standing in her childhood home, alone.</p><p>It had barely changed at all since she was eighteen, her mom kept the tacky floral couches, the god-awful vinyl countertops, and the beige carpeting. Her mom was a sweet woman, but jesus fucking christ, Rio didn’t remember the house being this fugly.</p><p>She let out a bitter chuckle and sipped straight from the bottle of shitty tequila clutched in her grasp. Half of the house was in boxes, the other left in disarray. Her mom knew she wasn’t seeing sixty from the moment she received her diagnosis, so she decided to be proactive about packing up the house for Rio in case she wanted to sell it.</p><p>“Mija, I told you, I can feel it. And I don’t want to make more work for you when I’m gone.” Her mom explained as she shuffled boxes across the hardwood, her skin had paled and she was skinnier than Rio had ever seen her.</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere, and even if you were, I’m not selling this place.” Rio demanded through tears, looking back now, she was in denial. Her mom had been a nurse for decades, so yeah, she could fucking feel it.</p><p>Seeing as Rio was staying here for the foreseeable future, she should make an effort to make the home, well, homier. It was a cozy little two bedroom bungalow that her mom had scraped and saved for, probably the cheapest house one could afford in one of the most prestigious school districts in the state.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>This house was the only thing her mother even had to leave to Rio, it would stay as is until hell froze over. Taking another pull off the bottle of liquor that she definitely should’ve shelled out more for, Rio gracelessly stumbled to sit on the carpet of the living room. She thought about her mom, about New York, about how the hell she’d pay off that medical debt during her lifetime. Her mind swirled until the most depressing thought of all made its way to the front:</p><p>She’d have to see the people she went to high school with.</p><p>They weren’t so much people, as they were mouth breathing cunts.</p><p>Yes, harsh, but well fucking deserved.</p><p>Rio purposefully kept odd hours so that she wouldn’t cross paths with any of them, who of course never left this suburban hellscape. Doing her grocery shopping at nine o’clock at night or checking the mailbox at one in the morning, anything to not be seen by one of the three bitches that made her loathe ever existing.</p><p>Admittedly, Alice Wu-Gulliver was the nicest of the dark triad. She never called Rio a slur, which seems like the bare minimum, but Rio was a grunge, out lesbian at a public high school in 2005. She regularly wiped ‘dyke’ off her locker throughout her academic career. Alice mostly just passively agreed with the other two as they reigned terror down on the unsuspecting student body. Rio always thought Alice was a little too quick to agree with whatever the hell Jen had planned, but still, Alice never stopped the other two, so fuck her.</p><p>Next, Jennifer Kale, and Rio would love to know what she was up to nowadays. Rio hoped she was trapped with the most incompetent man and losing all her money in an MLM, only time would tell. Rio didn’t have Facebook because well, fuck Mark Zuckerberg, so she was completely blind as to what Jen’s actual fate was, still she could fantasize. Jen was a cruel bitch, she was head fucking cheerleader, and probably the one who wrote on Rio’s locker so often. Not that Rio could ever prove it, Jen made sure of that. Although Rio wasn’t special, Jen verbally eviscerated and harassed anyone who pissed her off, she was an equal-opportunity hater.</p><p>Last, the woman who haunted her dreams. No, not dreams, nightmares. She didn’t dream of Agatha Harkness. That’d be impossible because Rio felt no rage course through her bloodstream like the rage she felt for Agatha fucking Harkness. Where Jen was cruel, Agatha was vicious. Not because she tortured Rio at school, but because she was most unfortunately Rio’s first love. It made her sick to think about now, her first everything was with Agatha under the dark cover of those bleachers next to the football field. Her first kiss was underneath those bleachers with Agatha, her first time, her first heartbreak. All the while, Agatha hung off the arm of some perfect jock because of course she fucking did.</p><p>Rio didn’t know exactly what Harkness Inc. did, but they owned the town. Residential and commercial properties, all bought by the Harkness’ and then sold or rented for a ridiculous profit. All of this to say, Agatha’s family was revered and well known in the tiny little town of Westview, meaning Agatha was under a microscope at all times. Rio knew how it made her feel, she’d held a sobbing Agatha in her arms enough times to know that much. It was her mom, Evanora. Obsessed with image, wealth, social standing. Last Rio heard, post-college Agatha married that perfect jock and popped out a kid.</p><p>Well fucking mazel tov.</p><p>Rio supposed she should have more empathy for her ex. She was trapped in Westview with a man Rio knew she wasn’t attracted to, and probably working for her wife-of-satan-himself mother, and closeted. Yeah, Rio should have more empathy, but the thought of how miserable Agatha must be made a lazy grin form across her very drunk features.</p><p>Had she drank too much?</p><p>She held up the bottle and inspected it. The brand new bottle was only a third of the way gone.</p><p>Nah, she’s good.</p><p>Right?</p><p>For sure.</p><p>Come morning, Rio was pretty decidedly not good.</p><p>She woke up on the living room floor, the booze sat atop the coffee table, almost halfway gone. The curtains did nothing to block out the stream of sun that was burning into Rio’s very hungover, tequila soaked brain. Sitting up felt like running a 5K and her mouth tasted like death personified. The only benefit to being unemployed? She could spend the day recovering at her own pace. Her pace being that of a snail’s, because Rio basically crawled her way down the hall, to the bathroom, and into the shower. Standing meant balancing, and balancing meant nausea, and nausea meant vomiting.</p><p>After a shower that'll atrociously spike her next water bill, Rio got dressed in baggy jeans and fitted t-shirt, tying up her still damp hair. Fuck drying it, fuck make up, she’ll wear sunglasses and nobody in town will notice her, but she needed food and coffee, of which she had none in the house. Slipping on a pair of boots and walking out to her car, Rio checked the mail. House bills, medical bills, utility bills, she tucked her tongue in her cheek as she filed through the stack of envelopes. That last one made her want to set herself on fire, something addressed to Rio from the Westview High School Alumni Committee. Yeah, that one got directly tossed into the blue recycling bin she had been letting rot on her curb since the last trash pick-up six days ago.</p><p>She said a silent prayer as she turned the key into the ignition of her car, the Civic had been her mom’s and it was on its last leg. This was the same car Rio was driven to school in, it was old enough to drink if it was a person. The engine sputtered to life and Rio exhaled the breath she always held before backing down the driveway and driving the ten minutes to the townsquare, where almost every local business was located. Where almost every business was inadvertently owned by her ex-first love’s family. No, it would be fine. She’d get coffee and a breakfast sandwich and no one would be the wiser that Rio was even back in town.</p><p>So that was a fucking pipedream.</p><p>As Rio stood at the cute local coffee shop, tapping away on her phone, waiting for her order, she felt a chill up her spine. Someone in the room had activated her fight or flight, the question is, which member of unholy trinity was it? Rio felt the hairs on her neck stand as she looked up from her phone, trying to subtly survey the room behind her sunglasses.</p><p>All clear.</p><p>Maybe she was paranoid, inflating her own ego, as if any of them would remember her-</p><p>“Rio Vidal, as I live and breathe.” A voice behind her and right next to her ear almost mocked in that passive-aggressive tone that women do when they hate one another.</p><p>She yelped and jolted, her face whipping around to see which nemesis was goading her in the middle of a goddamn coffee shop at ten in the morning on a Sunday.</p><p>“Jen.” Rio stated as she met her gaze.</p><p>Ah, fuck, she looked amazing. Her skin was glowing, she had a designer purse dangling from her perfectly manicured hand. Oh, wedding ring, hopefully Rio at least got the incompetent man part right.</p><p>“I had no clue you were back in town!” Jen smiled, it had to hurt her face from how fake it was.</p><p>“Have I done something in a past life to deserve this, right now?” Rio deadpanned. She had no reason to play nice anymore. She was hungover, grieving, and feeling vengeful.</p><p>Jen gave a polite smile and an artificial chuckle. “I’ve missed that sense of humor! Alice is going to die when I tell her you’re back.”</p><p>“Alice? What’s she even up to now?” Rio’s curiosity piqued.</p><p>“She owns the music store down the street. Sells instruments, gives lessons, stuff like that.”</p><p>“The one with the massive pride flag?”</p><p>Yes, vindication.</p><p>She always knew Alice had a crush on Jen.</p><p>Friend of fucking Dorothy.</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Jen responded, eyebrows scrunched.</p><p>“And you still speak to her?”</p><p>“Yuuup.” Jen drawled.</p><p>“How politically correct of you, Jennifer.”</p><p>Maybe she could build a bridge with Alice, let all the water flow under it. Queer women friends were hard to come by in any place that wasn’t a major metropolitan area.</p><p>“Well, it would be hard to ignore my wife.” Jen emphasized the last word and raised her left hand and wiggled her ring finger.</p><p>Okay, now that she was really looking at Jen’s manicure, two nails were left much shorter than the other three on her hand.</p><p>Damnit, she was 0 for two in her revenge fantasy of Jen’s life.</p><p>“Since when?”</p><p>“2013.”</p><p>“Oh.” Well, so much for vindication.</p><p>“What are you doing back? You don’t strike me as the reunion type.”</p><p>“Reunion?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Jen answered like Rio was the dumbest person alive. “The twenty year high school reunion?”</p><p>That fucking alumni envelope in the mail this morning.</p><p>“I’m uh, definitely not going to that.”</p><p>“So then, what brings you back?” Jen asked, and Rio knew she was just looking for gossip.</p><p>“The death of my mom, mainly.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened, jaw dropped.</p><p>Good, Rio hoped she felt like an asshole for prying.</p><p>Just then, Rio’s name was called out by the emo twink behind the bar.</p><p>“Gotta run, Jen, but keep in touch, m’kay?” Rio said in her best valley girl voice, hoping Jen felt antagonized.</p><p>When Rio approached the barista holding her food and iced coffee, a wave of recognition flooded over her. He looked like someone. Who the fuck did he look like?</p><p>“What’s your name, kid?” Rio pushed her sunglasses up to the top of her head.</p><p>“I’m sixteen.”</p><p>“Sorry, what the fuck is your name, teen?” Rio bit out.</p><p>“Billy.”</p><p>Rio just stared at him.</p><p>“Maximoff.”</p><p>Maximoff! That’s who the kid was, Wanda’s son. Rio knew he looked like someone.</p><p>The boy standing in front of her reminded her of when she had met Wanda during junior year. She had just moved to Westview and she had this thick eastern European accent and even thicker eyeliner.</p><p>She was the poster child for Hot Topic.</p><p>Rio looked Billy up and down.</p><p>Like mother, like son, then.</p><p>“Huh.” Rio replied, turning and leaving the shop, covering her eyes with her sunglasses once again.</p><p>As she stepped out onto the sidewalk, a body collided with hers. She felt hands steady around her waist to keep her from being knocked over. Rio swore to god, if those hands belonged to a man, she was about to commit homicide. As her balance was steadied again, the hands on her waist came into view.</p><p>Oh, definitely a woman’s.</p><p>Long fingers, a little veiny, kind of bony, secure.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>Okay, this day was looking up.</p><p>Rio finally raised her line of sight to see the mystery woman, and-</p><p>Brown eyes locked onto the clearest blue she’d ever seen. A blue she had gazed into a hundred times before. Rio raised her sunglasses again to make sure she wasn’t hallucinating.

</p><p>Agatha also didn’t seem to realize who she had bulldozed into and then subsequently caught until just that moment.</p><p>Westview fucking New Jersey.</p><p>Agatha’s face looked sheet-white, not expecting her secret ex back in her picture-perfect little Hallmark life.</p><p>Rio couldn’t not fuck with her, not after all this time.</p><p>“Boo.” Rio dramatically widened her eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s hands finally left her waist.</p><p>Rio missed the warmth of the grip almost instantly.</p><p>Agatha squared her jaw, hardened her eyes.</p><p>As she prepared to walk away, Agatha uttered one word.</p><p>“No.”</p>

<p>Agatha looked good.</p><p>It’s not checking her out if Rio just happens to notice.</p><p>As much as Rio had hoped otherwise, time had been kind to Agatha.</p><p>She somehow got hotter. Her hair was still wild and her lips were so full, and god, her jawline, her hands-</p><p>No. She’s evil and Rio would stop thinking about her, even as she watched Agatha walk in the opposite direction down the sidewalk.</p><p>Sill had a great ass, too.</p><p>Fuck, Rio immediately folded, damnit.</p><p>Her waist still felt the phantom sensation of being held.</p><p>Agatha had literally always been beautiful, it’s why she was popular despite being the antichrist. Well, that and her wealth. She always had this confidence about her, this coldness, a guard always up. She was hard to read, and mean, and strangely magnetic. Rio had avoided her like plague for most of high school until senior year when she had gone where she had always gone during her free period. The bleachers next to the football field. She liked being in nature and without people, it was the one break in her day. It was barely a month into the new school year when she approached her sacred spot and discovered that someone was already there.</p><p>Agatha was laying down on one of the equipment crates that the school stored under the bleachers, with her iPod nano on her stomach and earbuds in. She had on this tight polo and a skirt that wasn’t quite mini, but definitely not school appropriate. Her eyes were closed and she had a cigarette perched between her lips.</p><p>And no, this was not happening, Rio stormed towards her and kicked the crate beneath her, jostling it and causing those beautiful blue eyes to snap open.</p><p>“What the fuck, t.A.T.u?” Agatha spewed out as she sat up and ripped out the earbuds.</p><p>She was referring to that band with the two lesbians who always made out with one another.</p><p>Funny.</p><p>And yes, Rio did love ‘All The Things She Said’ and did own the CD, but not the point.</p><p>“This is my spot, has been for four years.” Rio countered. “Why the fuck are you here smoking?”</p><p>“If I let you bum one, will you promise not to rat on me?” Agatha groaned, looking almost bored.</p><p>“One, I’m not a snitch. And two, yes, gimme.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and opened the pack, passing a cigarette and a lighter to her. Rio lit it and sat on the crate next to Agatha, leaving a healthy distance between them.</p><p>Rio inhaled and scrunched her face. “Menthol? I know you have the money for the reds, at least.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re staying?”</p><p>“It’s my spot.” Rio repeated, “If you don’t like me here, leave.”</p><p>“You’re so abrasive.”</p><p>Rio exhaled a puff of smoke. “I’m abrasive? You tortured our principal to such an astonishing degree, she banned senior pranks this year.”</p><p>“Mrs. Heart overreacted.” Agatha rolled her eyes and took another drag.</p><p>“Mrs. Davis,” Rio corrected. “Did not overreact to you and your cronies pulling the fire alarm and then blockading her in her office.”</p><p>“She’s fine.”</p><p>“She thought she was gonna die.”</p><p>“Yeah, that was kinda the whole point of the prank.”</p><p>“But, I’m the abrasive one here?”</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>Rio flicked the excess ash from the butt of her cigarette. “Why are you?”</p><p>“Bad day.” Agatha simply said.</p><p>“Didn’t sacrifice enough virgins?”</p><p>“No.” She huffed. “My mother is pissed I didn’t make captain over Jen.”</p><p>“You being the prom queen isn’t enough for her? Or homecoming queen? Or spring fling queen? Fuck, this school has so many dances.”</p><p>“Those are all empty titles, without skill or merit, according to my mother.” Agatha bitterly informed. “Won’t look as good on a college application, or something.”</p><p>“Your mom sounds like a bitch.” Rio was blunt.</p><p>Agatha looked at her with wide eyes, like Rio had just said something sacrilegious, like she might be smited right then and there.</p><p>Then a smile broke out across her face and she let out a chuckle. “No shit.”</p><p>“Do you even care that you didn’t get captain? You seem more torn up about your mom than the title.”</p><p>“God no, I fucking hate cheerleading. It’s weirdly…”</p><p>“Homoerotic?” Rio finished. Because it was, it was women in short skirts groping and throwing each other around.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head and furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p>“Is that why you’re always at the games with a camera?” She asked Rio earnestly.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Like, it's some kind of turn on for you?”</p><p>“...I’m on the yearbook staff.”</p><p>Agatha just blinked, the cigarette in her fingers almost burned down to the filter.</p><p>“I have to take those photos…for the yearbook.”</p><p>“Mmh.” Agatha seemingly satisfied with that answer.</p><p>Why’d she even notice Rio at those games? There were always hundreds of people in the stands.</p><p>“You believed I was taking photos of you and jacking off to them, and you were just…cool with that?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t be the first time someone jacked off to me, I’m sure.” Agatha smirked, flicking the cigarette onto the grass.</p><p>Rio laughed, and she had opened her mouth to respond, but Agatha was already standing up and stomping out the last of her cigarette.</p><p>“This never happened.” Agatha stated, her tone dismissive out of nowhere. It wasn’t a request or a demand, so much as a promise. A promise that if Rio told anyone about this exchange, she’d regret it.</p><p>“Oh no! What’ll I write about in my diary tonight?” Rio called after her as Agatha left.</p><p>“Fuck off, Rosie.” Agatha shouted with her middle finger raised, walking back towards the main building of the school.</p><p>Rosie?</p><p>Did Agatha not even know Rio’s name?</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Ohhhhh, O’Donnell.</p><p>Rosie O’Donnell.</p><p>Ha. Ha.</p><p>If she could turn back time, Rio would do many, many things in her life differently. She’d change her college major to something that would actually make her some money, maybe marketing or some other made up bullshit. She’d spend more time with her mom, she’d stop her drunk twenty-something self from getting a thigh tattoo. And she, without a fucking doubt, would never have set foot under those bleachers on some stupid day in September of 2004.</p><p>She was lounging on the couch in the living room, several hours after her run-in with she-who-shall-not-be-named, scrolling job listings on her laptop. She had a bachelors degree from NYU and yet she didn’t seem to be qualified for anything more than a position as a barista. Not that there was anything wrong with that, Rio had been a barista before. But, she thought she had made it out of the service industry years ago. Back in New York, she had a steady job as a photographer's assistant. She’d also pick up side gigs whenever possible, she made next to nothing, but it was enough to pay her bills and absolutely nothing else.</p><p>She was about to swallow what little pride she had left and apply for a minimum wage job, when there was a knock on her front door. Rio briefly considered imitating a rabid dog, hoping to scare away whatever intruder was on her doorstep. But her heart wasn’t in it, so she hoisted herself up and opened the front door.</p><p>“Alice?” Rio questioned. The woman looked, well, edgier? She had red dyed throughout her wolf cut and winged eyeliner on her lids. A far cry from the Ambercrombie and Fitch all three of them used to dawn two decades ago.</p><p>“Hey.” Alice smiled.</p><p>Rio gave an artificial smile back before promptly slamming the door shut in her face. She had already dealt with Jen and Agatha today, Rio wasn’t trying to go for the trifecta.</p><p>“Wait, Rio!” Alice’s muffled voice came through the door as she frantically knocked again.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and opened the door once more, making sure to scowl.</p><p>“What.” It came out as more of a bark than a question.</p><p>“Jen told me you were back and I just wanted to, uh, clear the air.” Alice revealed a gift basket she had been hiding behind her back and extended her hand. “Consider it an apology-welcome back- my condolences- peace offering.”</p><p>Rio took the basket and examined it, sprawling with various pink rectangular packages engrained with gold lettering. “Kale Care?”</p><p>“Jen’s a dermatologist. Mostly botox and filler, but skincare too. It’s good stuff.”</p><p>“So you came to my home at seven o’clock at night to give me ‘revitalizing plumping serum’” Rio picked a random box and read what it was. “And to say you’re sorry for my mom being dead?”</p><p>Alice frowned. “No, well yes, that too. But, I’m sorry for being a dick in high school, Jen and Agatha too. I doubt they’ll ever admit it, but I know they feel just as guilty. I was going through my own shit, and I took it out on everyone else. Including you.” She looked down like she was genuinely ashamed. “I’m just really fucking sorry, Rio. But, I totally get it if you don’t forgive me. I just felt like I should say something, take accountability and all that.” Alice finished and gave a sad smile.</p><p>See? The nicest one of the bunch.</p><p>Rio had to admit, it took some balls for her to come here like this.</p><p>“I appreciate that, but in the future, I only accept gifts in the form of expensive alcohol, cash, or weed.” Rio dropped the gift basket on the coffee table like it was worthless, cause to her, it was.</p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows, rooted around in the pocket of her black cargo pants, and produced a joint. “Wanna share?”</p><p>“How did you just have that on you?”</p><p>Alice shrugged. “It’s legal.”</p><p>“Eh, fuck it.”</p><p>It let Rio procrastinate applying to a soul-sucking job, calling back debt collectors, or thinking about her ex.</p><p>They went to the detached garage that Rio had made into her home studio back in high school.</p><p>An hour later, they were pushing forty, high, and sprawled across decades old beanbags, giggling.</p><p>“Dude, why the fuck did you marry Jen?” Rio asked through the now thick haze of smoke in the garage, she could feel how watery her eyes were.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Alice said, over enunciating, probably due to dry mouth.</p><p>“She’s just such an…” How was Rio’s fried brain going to put this? “Unbearable cunt?”</p><p>Alice turned to look at Rio. “Hey man, that’s my wife.” But it didn’t come out intimidating in the slightest. “Also I kind of like that about her.” She smirked.</p><p>“So why aren’t you with her tonight?”</p><p>“She’s with Agatha and Wanda. They claim they have a book club, but really they just drink and gossip. And since I already hear everything at home…” Alice trailed off, leaving Rio to fill in the blank. “Also Jen doesn’t smoke, I usually have to rope in Agatha.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness smokes weed?” Rio’s eyes widened. Cigarettes? Sure. Booze? Definitely. But, pot? God, Rio wondered what Agatha was like while high.</p><p>“Oh, please. Westview has one dispensary, and Agatha is their top customer.”</p><p>“I don’t blame her. If I had married a moronic ken doll, I’d wanna green out too.” Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Who, Ralph?” Alice raised one eyebrow.</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Nah, they got divorced, like, years ago.” Alice says, completely oblivious to the bomb she just dropped.</p><p>“Really?!” Rio says it a little too excitedly. And she shouldn’t be excited, it doesn’t change anything. Or at least it shouldn’t change anything. “Expand and explain, Alice. Expand and explain!”</p><p>“Not my monkeys, not my circus.”</p><p>Oh fuck her, she can’t just slip in that lore and then give no context. But Rio knew if she kept pushing, Alice would get suspicious. Nobody knew about what happened between Rio and Agatha, and she was not in the business of outing someone, even someone she hated.</p><p>Fine, she’d switch gears, which is so fucking hard right now. Her brain feels smooth and fuzzy, and she smoked too much, good god.</p><p>“How does Evanora feel about her perfect little daughter getting high as shit?”</p><p>“She doesn’t know, so don’t tell her!” Alice almost slurred.</p><p>“Yeah, won’t be a problem. I’m not itching to talk to the harpy.” Rio had unfortunately met Evanora before, and she vowed that if she ever met her again, she’d make the bitch pay.</p><p>“Eh, now that your mom’s…gone, Evanora will probably try to buy this place. Ya know, swoop in, manipulate you to sell, flip it for an obscene profit.”</p><p>“I’d gouge my own eyes out before selling anything to her.”</p><p>Alice cackles, too far gone to realize Rio’s true feelings about that fucking crone. Even after all these years, the way Evanora chose to treat her own daughter still left a burning feeling in Rio’s chest. Agatha deserved so much better than the mother she was dealt, even as a dumb eighteen year-old, Rio recognized that. She hated that she never did anything about, never stood up or defended Agatha, she should’ve.</p><p>No, she was a kid. She was just as scared as Agatha, and they had no idea things would end as badly as they did.</p><p>Rio had to remind herself of that, she clung to it.</p><p>“Hey, Jen told me you’re not going to the…thing.” Alice trailed off like she was trying to find the right word.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You know, the thing, at school.” She was snapping her fingers like that would help her remember. “Twenty years.”</p><p>Rio gasped in victory at finding the right word. “Reunion!”</p><p>“That’s it! That’s the fucking word.” Alice let out a breath of relief. “Why aren’t you going?”</p><p>“You just apologized for ruining my adolescence, and you’re going to ask me why I wouldn’t want to attend an event filled with everyone else who ruined my adolescence?”</p><p>“C’mon, it’s 2005 themed, it’ll be fun!”</p><p>“Alice, I say this with love and light. It’s either a really lame party for everyone to relive their glory days, the type of days which I never had. Or, you’re fucking with me and it’s not actually themed and you’re trying to get me to show up looking ridiculous.”</p><p>Alice looked slightly offended. “I’m not fucking with you. Agatha, Jen and I are all wearing matching velour sweatsuits, I can assure you, it’s themed.”</p><p>“Nope.” Rio wasn’t budging on this, no matter how much she’d like to see that velour sweatsuit on Agatha.</p><p>Alice wiggled her way out of the crater she had created in her beanbag, and stood. “Just think on it, okay?” She checked her phone. “I gotta go, Jen’s going to be home soon. Also, I need to scarf down a whole bag of cheetos or I fear I will legitimately die.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Are you good to get home?”</p><p>“Yeah, I walked.”</p><p>“You walked?”</p><p>Alice scoffed. “I live like, five doors down from you.”</p><p>“Tiny fucking town.” Rio Muttered.</p><p>“Goodniiight.” Alice sing-songed out of the garage, closing the door behind her, and drowning the room in silence.</p><p>Rio fully reclined in her bean bag chair, her arms tucked over her head, eyes closed.</p><p>She had been in this exact same position on top of a fucking storage crate twenty years ago. It was the very next day after Rio and Agatha’s first impromptu chitchat. Rio was laying down, earbuds in, blasting some god-awful shitty 00’s rock, when the crate beneath her was jostled. Rio opened her eyes to see Agatha standing over her and smiling.</p><p>Utterly fucking confused, Rio yanked her earbuds out and looked up at Agatha, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>“I’ve thought about it,” Agatha sighed, feigning nonchalance. “And, I guess, I’d be willing to share it.”</p><p>Rio still looked confused.</p><p>“The spot.” Agatha explained, gesturing to the space below the bleachers.</p><p>“You’d share my own spot with me?” She acted grateful, as if Agatha wasn’t offering to split something Rio already had.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Our spot.”</p>

<p>Rio was standing at her locker in between periods, minding her own business, when someone bumped into her. She caught herself before checking behind her to see who it was.</p><p>“Watch it, RuPaul.” Jen sneered as she glared at Rio.</p><p>“Wrong letter of the acronym, dumbass.” Rio shot back.</p><p>Jens nostrils flared in anger, like she was rearing up to dole out another insult, when a hand on her back started pushing. Indicating that Jen should keep walking.</p><p>The hand belonged to Agatha, who was standing next to Jen, with Alice behind both of them.</p><p>“Leave it alone, Jen.” Agatha said it casually, but had it been a month earlier, she probably would’ve joined Jen’s verbal assault.</p><p>Jen whipped her head to look at Agatha in confusion, but kept walking, leaving Rio alone at her locker once more.</p><p>Rio tried not to let that go to her head, every day for the past month her and Agatha met at their spot and talked. Usually about nothing, but Agatha defusing Jen in that moment made her wonder if it was more.</p><p>Today was no exception, fourth period, she walked to the football field and there sat Agatha. She had a textbook in her lap, a notebook with loopy handwriting next to her. Rio approached, sat down next to her, reached into her backpack and started filing through photos.</p><p>The silence had become strangely…comfortable, like this was normal. Which, at that point, Rio guessed it was.</p><p>After a few minutes Agatha closed the textbook and set it aside, turning her attention to Rio.</p><p>“What are these?” Agatha looked down at the photos.</p><p>“Uh, my work from my independent study. Mrs. Calderu didn’t have enough people sign up for black and white photography, so it’s just me.” Rio mumbled while still arranging the pictures.</p><p>“They look kinda grainy.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh and looked up. “Yeah, they’re shot on film. It’s a bitch to get them developed but at least I have the darkroom to myself.”</p><p>“This school has a darkroom?” Agatha scrunched her face.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha. It’s across from the digital photo lab.”</p><p>Agatha’s face only scrunched further.</p><p>“In the art wing?”</p><p>Still no recognition.</p><p>“Have you never taken an art class?” Rio cocked her head.</p><p>“Maybe, like, freshman year because it’s a required credit.”</p><p>“So what classes are you in?” Rio never saw Agatha anywhere except under the bleachers or in the hallway during passing periods.</p><p>“AP calc, AP chem, Shakespearean English,” Agatha raised the textbook beside her for emphasis. “Poli sci,” She took another breath to keep going, when Rio stopped her.</p><p>“You’re in AP fucking calculus, and you’re dating Ralph ‘Bonerrific’ Bohner? That guy failed sophomore geometry.”</p><p>“Yeah, which how’d he fucking get that nickname? There’s nothing terrific about boners, I’ve had enough of his pressed against me to know.”</p><p>Rio shuddered and faked a gag. “Oh, that’s fucking disgusting.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Tell me about it.”</p><p>“Correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t you supposed to like…that?” Rio did not want to say the word ‘boner’ again.</p><p>“I’m convinced that most women are lying about liking…that.”</p><p>That set off tiny alarm bells in Rio’s head.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to like the dude you’re having sex with. Like, I’m fairly certain some women like men. God knows why, but..” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“Yeah well, maybe those other guys don’t finish in like thirty seconds, and suck at making out.” Agatha snarked as she looked at Rio.</p><p>“How does he suck at making out? Isn’t it kind of straightforward?” Rio asked, but clearly, this was out of her depth.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes bore deep into Rio’s, like she was analyzing her.</p><p>“Have you actually ever made out with someone before, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s face turned red, she cleared her throat, and looked back down at the photos sprawled across the equipment crate.</p><p>Agatha gasped. “You haven’t!” She nearly jumped at the realization. “Oh my god, you’ve never even kissed a girl!”</p><p>Rio groaned and placed her head in her hands, attempting to physically shield herself from embarrassment. “Please.”</p><p>“Why not? I’m sure any friend of Ellen would be lucky to play tonsil hockey with you.” Agatha was teasing her, but not like the years before, it wasn’t malicious.</p><p>“We’re in a town of 3,000 people, there are no other friends of Ellen, Agatha.” Rio deadpanned as she removed her hands from her face and looked at the woman sitting across from her.</p><p>Agatha shrugged and leaned in. “I could help you out.”</p><p>And that set off big, massive, gargantuan alarm bells off in Rio’s head.</p><p>“Wh-” Rio suddenly had no oxygen in her lungs. “What?”</p><p>“You’re almost eighteen and never been kissed, at this rate, you’ll die a virgin.” Agatha smirked. “I’ll help.”</p><p>“You’re fucking with me.” Rio brushed off the offer, because there’s no way it was real. There’s no way that the fucking prom queen was offering to kiss her.</p><p>“I’m not.” Agatha said quietly, keeping eye contact with Rio.</p><p>“I swear to god, if you’re trying to, like, ‘Carrie’ me or some shit right now, Agatha.”</p><p>“I would, but I’m fresh out of pig's blood.” Agatha scooted closer, shuffling the photos out of the way so she was right in front of Rio. “Kiss me.”</p><p>Rio sat there, paralyzed.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, grabbed Rio’s hand, placed it on the side of her own face, and slid her grip back down to Rio’s wrist.</p><p>“C’mon, before I have to sit through another lesson on stoichiometry and wanna blow my brains out.” Agatha was almost whispering with how close her face was now. “Kiss me.”</p><p>Rio nodded dumbly and leaned in, because what else was she going to do? Turn her down? Agatha was pretty, and her skin was so soft, and she smelled like lilacs and rain.</p><p>Her heart pounded against her ribs, so much so, she thought it might burst out of her chest cavity. She felt herself shaking a little, trying to will her muscles to relax again. She rubbed her thumb gently along Agatha’s cheekbone and closed the distance.</p><p>Their lips met tentatively at first, nothing more than a peck, but it was everything Rio had dreamed about. She thought that would be it, simple, innocent. Until Agatha kept going, kissing her with more fervor, interlocking their lips. Rio’s hand dropped to her jaw, cradling it. Agatha’s hand found Rio’s knee and lightly squeezed, telling her to keep going.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>She angled her head, kissing Agatha a little deeper. She let out an absent minded groan as she slithered her hand into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Fuck, her hair was soft too.</p><p>Still eons from a full on makeout session, there wasn’t even tongue, but Rio could’ve stayed there forever and been more than content with how she had spent her life.</p><p>Then the bell that rang at the end of each period called out and Agatha pulled back.</p><p>Rio wanted to protest, tell Agatha to skip and stay with her. But that wasn't what this was.</p><p>When they both opened their eyes, Agatha’s pupils were blown wide, nearly completely black.</p><p>“Not bad.” Agatha whispered, her hands leaving Rio’s body. She stood, collected her things and turned to speak before she left. “You’re really good, by the way.” Agatha pointed to the photos that had long since been forgotten.  “Bye.”</p><p>“Te veo.” Rio’s brain was a mess, so she reverted back to her first language, Spanish.</p><p>With that, Agatha walked away, like nothing had just transpired.</p><p>Rio sat there, wide-eyed, and let out the first breath in what felt like a very long time.</p><p>And that’s how Rio had her first kiss, under the bleachers, on a fall day in October, with the fucking prom queen.</p><p>She’d forever be haunted by the fact that her and Ralph fucking ‘Boneriffic’ Bohner pulled the same girl. She thought about that a lot, even now as she made her way through the grocery store, barely paying attention to what she was putting in her cart.</p><p>Alice just hurled that very interesting divorce tidbit and left without any explanation in her garage almost a week ago. How was Rio supposed to go about her day, when Agatha was single? Was she out? If she was out, then why did she still hate Rio? She didn’t exactly welcome Rio back to town with a warm greeting.</p><p>She was lost in that deep mind-spiral when her cart crashed into another. Jesus, she had to stop wallowing in public.</p><p>The owner of the cart turned and smiled when she saw Rio.</p><p>“Rio!” She engulfed the younger woman into a hug.</p><p>“Mrs. Calderu.” Rio hummed softly against her shoulder, sinking into the embrace.</p><p>“Honey, you're thirty-eight, you can call me Lilia.”</p><p>Lilia was one of the very few positives of Rio’s high school experience, always encouraging her to do more, want more, work harder. She was the only art teacher at Westview High, and Rio’s favorite. Most days Rio ate lunch in her classroom and worked on whatever project was assigned at the time. Lilia would blast showtunes and bring in ziti or baked goods. The art wing and Lilia were Rio’s safety nets, where nobody bugged or taunted her.</p><p>Lilia released her hold on Rio. “I was so sorry to hear about your mom, she was such an amazing woman.”</p><p>“Thank you, Lilia.” That felt fucking weird, calling her former teacher by her first name.</p><p>“I heard you were back but I haven’t seen you, you’ve been a hermit.” Lilia gawked as she looked Rio up and down.</p><p>“Haven’t wanted to socialize much, I guess.”</p><p>“Well, it’s a good thing I ran into you, we need to catch up. Are you going to the reunion this weekend?”</p><p>If one more person mentioned that fucking reunion, “No.”</p><p>“Yes you are.” Lilia said it as a statement rather than an encouragement.</p><p>“Mrs. Calderu...”</p><p>“Lilia.” She corrected. “And I will be there and would like to catch up with you.”</p><p>“We can catch up right now.” Rio pleaded.</p><p>“No, I have a branzino in this cart that I’m not letting spoil.”</p><p>“Then we’ll get coffee some other time.”</p><p>“No, you’ll go to the reunion this weekend and we’ll talk there.” Lilia said it in that mom tone, like she was gentle-parenting a thirty-eight year old.</p><p>“Why do I need to go to this reunion so damn bad?” Rio responded like a petulant child.</p><p>Definitely not helping her case.</p><p>“Call it a gut feeling.” Lilia winked.</p><p>Okay, what the fuck.</p><p>Rio deeply exhaled. “Fine.” She gritted out.</p><p>“Wonderful! I’ll see you Saturday.” She hollered as she sauntered away with her cart.</p><p>This is why up until now, Rio had been running errands under the cover of night. She always seemed to run into someone when she followed a normal circadian rhythm.</p><p>As she made her way to check out, she saw a familiar head of hair down one of the aisles. She stopped dead in her tracks and zeroed in on the sight, staring openly in the local Piggly Wiggly.</p><p>Agatha seemed to feel eyes on her and looked up. She was in a sleeveless dress, kind of conservative but clinging to her silhouette. She’d obviously come straight from work because Rio doubted Agatha grocery shopped in heels.</p><p>She looked Rio up and down, and scowled. “Are you following me?”</p><p>Oh, Rio wasn’t expecting her to speak.</p><p>But was so elated that she did.</p><p>“Small town.” Rio quipped.</p><p>“You look like shit.” And to Agatha’s credit, Rio did. She was in a battered NYU hoodie, sweatpants, and her hair that she hadn’t washed in three days was clipped up.</p><p>“You look like your mother.” Rio knew that would sting, and she could see that it did by the way Agatha’s knuckles tightened so much around the handle of her basket, they were white.</p><p>“I will strangle you.”</p><p>“Gotten kinky in your old age?”</p><p>“I’m leaving now.” Agatha stated, maybe only slightly flustered at Rio’s ‘kinky’ comment.</p><p>“See you Saturday!” Rio grinned.</p><p>Agatha stopped walking and probably almost broke her neck turning back to look at Rio.</p><p>“Jen and Alice said you weren’t going to that.”</p><p>“Change of heart.”</p><p>“You don’t have a heart.” Agatha spat.</p><p>And how could Rio fluster Agatha more, how could she fuck with this woman who she felt such a deep hatred for? Who she wanted to punish. Who she didn’t want to admit still took up a corner of her mind.</p><p>“Yes I do.” What would she say if she was still that angsty teenager under the bleachers? “It’s black, and it beats for you.”</p><p>And there it was, Agatha opened and closed her mouth a few times, blinked more than a human should.</p><p>Flustered.</p><p>Rio winked. “Te veo.”</p><p>She made her way out of the grocery store feeling like a fucking god, she rarely ever knocked Agatha off balance like that. Agatha always had something to say, a defense, a retort, but Rio could find a way to weasel in when she really tried.</p><p>She learned that back in her youth, a week after their first kiss. They were still under those bleachers every day but neither brought up the kiss. Agatha was talking and Rio couldn’t understand how she was acting so normal, so controlled, talking about her Halloween costume for some party. She felt like she was going insane.</p><p>“...So we agreed to go as The Spice Girls, well three out of the five unless Wanda wants to be our Ginger Spice. And Jen got offended when Alice called Sporty and I called Posh. She thought-”</p><p>“That you guys assumed she’d be Scary?” Rio was listening, but she kept staring at Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“Yes! I told her that I’d rather slit my throat than be Baby, and said she could be Posh and I’ll be Scary.” Agatha took another breath. “But she didn’t want Posh, so-”</p><p>She couldn’t fucking take this anymore.</p><p>Rio grabbed her face and kissed her, threading her hands into that fucking mane Agatha had.</p><p>She half expected Agatha to pull away in horror, maybe slap her for being so bold. But instead, she moaned, honest to god moaned, and grabbed Rio’s waist. This kiss wasn’t like the last one, it was hungrier, opening her mouth further and inviting Rio to slip in some tongue. Which Rio did, even though she had no fucking clue how much was appropriate.</p><p>They sat there, making out during fourth period, like-</p><p>Well, like horny teenagers.</p><p>Rio needed air, she backed off to inhale, and Agatha just looked at her.</p><p>Panting, mouth opening and closing as if finding something to say, blinking too much for a normal human.</p><p>Rio smiled victoriously as she breathed in and out.</p><p>Agatha was as into this as Rio, so much so that she toppled Agatha off that perfect pedestal she seemed to live on.</p><p>Out of control.</p><p>Flustered.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>That’s what Agatha had said after they had made out for the rest of fourth period that day.</p><p>For Rio not to fucking tell anyone.</p><p>It had crushed her stupid adolescent heart.</p><p>To kiss a girl, a girl who seemingly liked her, and then be violently shoved into the closet out of Agatha’s own self-preservation?</p><p>Yeah, it fucking sucked.</p><p>As Rio dug through the boxes of her attic, looking for her old clothes from the early aughts, she pushed away that bitter memory. The reunion was 2005 themed, which one: A little too on the nose, unoriginal, and uncreative. And two: How did Rio’s mom ever let her leave the house in these clothes?</p><p>There had been numerous occasions where Rio’s mother took a look at her daughter’s clothing choice for the day, and just stared at her with abject horror. But she never said anything to Rio, though.</p><p>She had finally found the right box, filled to the brim with bargain-bin tank tops, thrifted flannels, and self-cropped band tees. It might’ve been fine had Rio ever buttoned up those flannels, but she knew she didn’t. She’d get dressed every morning in a paper-thin tank top that barely reached the middle of her stomach, an XL flannel, and jeans.</p><p>Fuck, the jeans.</p><p>So, so incredibly low rise.</p><p>Rio lifted a pair out of the box and examined them.</p><p>She had been a virgin for most of high school, but now through the lens of her almost forty-year old mind, she’s shocked she didn’t get laid sooner. Why did none of her old clothing actually aim to clothe her? Poor little eighteen-year old Rio must’ve been so cold.</p><p>Why did nobody offer her a sweater, or something that actually covered her?</p><p>Oh, because she definitely would’ve told them to eat shit and die.</p><p>Yeah, no, this one’s on her.</p><p>Not that Rio dressed like a nun now, far from it, but she’d be lying if she said she wasn’t judging her past self’s sense of style just a little. At the bottom of the box, she found her old docs that she had worked weekends to save for, she wore them every day of her life up until graduation. They were clunky and obnoxious, and she knew Agatha always hated them.</p><p>So, she was definitely wearing those tonight.</p><p>As for the rest of the wardrobe…maybe?</p><p>No, this would be fine, she’d dress like her slutty eighteen year-old self, and face a room full of the worst people on earth.</p><p>She grabbed a random assortment of clothes and fled back down to her old bedroom. Or technically, her current bedroom. It didn’t look like it belonged to an adult though, the walls were still plastered with old posters. Mostly just different bands and musicians but there was one artifact that Rio still treasured. It was a poster that said ‘I Love Bush’ and then in parentheses ‘No, not that Bush’ with George W. Bush’s face exed out. Rio considered framing it and moving it into the living room for every potential guest to view.</p><p>She threw on a black tank top, a green and black men’s flannel, and those awful low rise jeans. Rio had to do that trick where she lays flat on her bed and sucks in as she zips her pants closed, she has more ass and thigh now than her teenage self did. But she succeeds, by the grace of whatever cruel god is out there, she gets on the frayed bootcut jeans that are old enough to be a sophomore in college.</p><p>She looks at herself in the full-length mirror and visibly cringes at her appearance. Not because she looks bad, she looks hot, but because it brings her back to the reality of facing everything she’s avoided. Facing Agatha, for several consecutive hours this time, not a fleeting moment.<br/>
She quickly applies makeup, not the kind she used to wear though, she’s not smoking out her lash line like she used to every day at 7am. All she’s missing to complete the ensemble is the nose stud she had up until junior year of college.</p><p>Rio debated taking a shot before she left, but decided against it. She needed to stay sharp just in case she needed to spar with Agatha, verbally or physically.</p><p>No.</p><p>Nothing physical.</p><p>Rio had to remind herself of that, under no circumstances would she touch Agatha in any capacity.</p><p>Platonic or otherwise.</p><p>No.</p><p>It shouldn’t be hard, Rio had gone twenty years without touching Agatha, but something about her goddamn touch always melted Rio. The days following their makeout session, Rio spent her time in the darkroom during her free period. Not wanting to face Agatha or admit that she was so badly wounded after a few kisses. Rio didn’t want to look less experienced, even though she was. She didn’t want to look overly-invested, even though she was. She didn’t want Agatha to think she was desperate, even though she fucking was. Whatever they were, didn’t matter enough to Agatha, she had made that more than clear. So, Rio acted like it didn’t matter to her either.</p><p>It had been three days since she had last seen Agatha, she was in the darkroom, hanging the last of the photos she had just painstakingly developed. The darkroom had speakers mounted, and Rio was very loudly playing music that matched the bottomless pit of despair she felt at that moment. Her back was turned, humming along to the lyrics, focused on making sure none of the photos smudged during the drying process. She was at peace, in this room, the entire world didn’t exist.</p><p>“I didn’t know you listened to Avril Lavigne.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body went cold and jumped at the intruder. “Jesus fuckin-!” She turned and looked behind her, and- ah fuck.</p><p>“Isn’t she a bit mainstream for you?” Agatha grinned.</p><p>“What the hell, Agatha?!” Rio’s heart was racing, not from being scared at Agatha’s entrance, but because of simply being in Agatha’s presence. She made her way over to the CD player and turned down the volume of the music, which was not helping her look cool.</p><p>“Fuck, these are good too.” Agatha’s attention was on the photos, still wet from the chemicals, currently drying on the clothesline. She tilted her head with every picture, trying to get the right perspective. “Seriously, you’re talented.”</p><p>“What are you doing here, Agatha?” Rio was quite frankly, a little pissed.</p><p>“You stopped coming to our spot.” Agatha mumbled, still roaming her eyes over the photos.</p><p>“Yeah, I did that on purpose. You were supposed to take the hint.”</p><p>“Well, I didn’t.” Agatha finally looked at her.</p><p>“How the hell did you even find me?”</p><p>“The better question is, how the hell did I even find the art wing? I didn’t realize it was the only part of the school that they didn’t renovate in the 90’s.” She snorted, but upon seeing Rio’s unamused face, she corrected. “You told me about the darkroom, I figured if you wanted to go somewhere that wasn’t our spot, it would be here.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Because Rio was thoroughly fucking confused as to why she was here.</p><p>“I wanted to see you.” Agatha says, a little too earnestly, because it makes Rio’s pulse stutter.  All of her anger washes away at Agatha’s confession.</p><p>“Why’s that?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p>“I don’t know, you’re weird and I like talking to you.” Agatha blushed a little at her own admission.</p><p>“I like talking to you too.” Rio agreed, and Agatha beamed. “But, you have a boyfriend and you’re straight. So I don’t know what you’re hoping to get out of this, but I don’t want to be like, your experiment or whatever.”</p><p>Agatha’s once confident posture seemed to deflate at Rio’s words, her smile faded and she looked down at her hands rather than at Rio.</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>Rio knitted her eyebrows together. “Huh?”</p><p>Agatha took a breath and met Rio’s gaze. “I’m not.”</p><p>“Not what?”</p><p>Agatha crossed the room to meet her, not stopping until she was standing face to face with Rio. With little hesitation, she grabbed at Rio’s hips, not tugging, just resting. “Rio…” Agatha said it and it sounded pained, like her throat was closing. Her eyes were glassy, she was blinking back tears, refusing to let them fall.</p><p>And Rio shuffled closer into Agatha’s grip, the simple touch set Rio’s skin ablaze. She wanted to be closer, get closer, burrow away in this darkroom forever and pretend only her and Agatha existed.</p><p>Her resolve was crumbling, she reached out to cup Agatha’s face before asking again. “Not what, Agatha?”</p><p>She felt those long fingers contract and finally tug Rio closer, pulling them flesh against each other. Rio wanted to hear Agatha admit it, but their faces were so close, she could feel the soft exhale from Agatha fan across her lips.</p><p>“Straight.” Agatha mumbled out, her head dipping forward, catching Rio’s lips with her own.</p><p>And even back then, Rio was smart enough to know that this couldn’t end well. But, teenagers are stupid, and naive, and hope beyond hope for their dreams to become reality. So she let Agatha kiss her in the darkroom, hell, she kissed her back. Agatha touched her, and she just-</p><p>Melted.</p><p>So, no touching Agatha tonight. That had to be rule number one.</p><p>Rule number two: Find Lilia, speak to her and absolutely no one else.</p><p>Rule number three: Stay sober.</p><p>Who the fuck was she kidding, she wasn’t staying sober for this shit. If she didn’t have a drink in her hand upon arrival, she was going to commit arson. And she could do it too, she knew where the photo chemicals were and she had a lighter.</p><p>Rule number four: Do not swing at someone. No matter how much they deserve it.</p><p>She could do this, she felt absolutely no anxiety in her brain, bones, muscles, tendons, veins or soft tissue. She was fine. She had her rules and was going to stick to them, and the night would be bearable.</p><p>As she made her way into her old high school’s auditorium, Rio’s deja vu kicked into overdrive. The room was absent over the normal overhead lighting, instead strobe and party lights flashing everywhere, like it was fucking prom. The DJ obviously didn’t know his shit because he plays ‘Sexyback’ which came out a full year after they all had graduated. She swept her gaze across the room at her old classmates, most of them looked like the past twenty years had lobotomized them. The majority were now boring suburban parents, high school had been their peak. Well, that brought the tiniest sliver of comfort to Rio. She kept looking, hoping to find Lilia, instead locking eyes with someone else.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, get your ass over here!” That fucking ginger was already drunk, and it made everyone snap their eyes to Rio at the entrance.</p><p>Wanda was standing at a table with her husband, Vision. What was the man’s real name? Rio never knew. Vision was a nickname he got at a party during junior year, something about beer goggles, blah blah, something something, and everyone called him Vision from then on.</p><p>Rio hadn’t spoken to Wanda since, maybe graduation? But unlike everyone else, it wasn’t out of spite. Rio and Wanda were friends ever since she moved to the states, junior year. They bonded over the both of them being so deep and niche that nobody could ever understand them. Yeah, they were insufferable. Then, Wanda met Vision during the summer in between junior and senior year, and kind of got absorbed into his friend group. That group included numerous other nameless and faceless jocks, Ralph, and the trio from hell.</p><p>There had been no fall out, they just weren’t as close, but they still saw each other from time to time during that final year of school. Rio even told Wanda when she lost her virginity. Obviously not who she had lost it with, but Wanda was always there when Rio called. She tried not to accuse Wanda of being a poser when the redhead had showed up to school on the first day of senior year, devoid of any eyeliner or black clothing or ripped tights. Apparently, dating Vision meant she had to de-emo herself. Rio joked that an angel had lost its wings that day.</p><p>However tonight, Wanda seemed to embrace her past. She had a cropped red leather jacket, loose black dress, heeled boots, about a thousand layered necklaces, and ripped black stockings. Oh thank god, the eyeliner has made a comeback.</p><p>“Wands,” Rio smiled and accepted the hug the Wanda was already pulling her into. “How the hell are you?”</p><p>So much for rule number two, then.</p><p>“So much better now that you’re here! Agatha told me you were coming, but I didn’t really believe it.” Wanda let go and took in Rio’s attempt at the theme. “Oh my god, it’s like no time has passed at all. Are those the same boots?” Green eyes widened.</p><p>“Is that the same jacket?” Rio asked, knowing it definitely was. “Emo Wanda lives.”</p><p>“She never died.” Wanda grins.</p><p>“Is that why your kid looks the way he does?”</p><p>“You’ve met Billy?” Wanda looked surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, he was my barista.” Rio explains. “How the fuck do you have a kid that old.”</p><p>“Two kids. Twins.” Vision chimes in, and Rio doesn’t acknowledge his presence.</p><p>“Hey how’s the photography going? I remember you were gonna like, change the world with your work.” And Wanda means it as a genuine question. But to Rio it feels a little like taking a bullet. Because she didn’t change the world like she thought she would, she didn’t get the girl like she thought she would.</p><p>Rio’s aware most people do not live up to what their teenage self imagines the future to be. However, that doesn’t stop it from hurting like a bitch.</p><p>“Uh,” Rio grabs a cocktail off one of the trays that passes by and drinks. “Still working on it.”</p><p>Well, she knew she wasn’t going to stick to number three, so this hardly counts as breaking a rule.</p><p>Vision says something that Rio tunes out as she makes the horrible mistake of innocently glancing at the entrance, where Westview’s very own Charlie’s fucking Angels are walking in.</p><p>And Rio is going to find and murder this DJ because he, yet again, plays a song from 2006, Nelly Furtado’s ‘Promiscuous’.</p><p>Oh, Alice was very much not lying about the velour tracksuits.</p><p>Alice’s is red, and no surprise, Jen’s is pink.</p><p>Okay, maybe she’d forgive the DJ, because the background music as Agatha walks in is really working for her.</p><p>Agatha’s is this deep royal blue-ish purple. The hoodie is half zipped and stops right at the slope of Agatha’s waist, a simple white t-shirt layered underneath. But the pants, those fucking pants. They cling to Agatha’s thighs, molding to her, the waistband sits right on her hip bones so there’s a strip of lower abdomen exposed that Rio wants to lick.</p><p>No, remember rule number one, dipshit.</p><p>Then Agatha briefly turns around to say something to Jen, and Rio nearly faints.</p><p>‘NAUGHTY’ is bedazzled across Agatha’s perfectly sculpted  ass.</p><p>Rio subconsciously grips her glass tighter since she can’t grope Agatha.</p><p>Or, maybe she could.</p><p>At this point she’s already broken half of her own rules,</p><p>What’s one more?</p>

<p>Did Agatha need a dog?</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Because Rio could bark.</p><p>“Hey, Rio.”</p><p>She could definitely get on her knees.</p><p>“Rio, honey!”</p><p>She snapped back to reality and realized Lilia was standing next to her.</p><p>Damnit, she was trying to ogle Agatha, was nothing sacred anymore?</p><p>“You free to talk?” Lilia asked with a sly smile on her face.</p><p>Rio looked at Wanda and Vision before nodding to Lilia. “Yeah, perfect timing.” Rio’s sarcasm was thinly veiled.</p><p>Lilia grabbed her arm and pulled her to the edge of the auditorium, but Rio’s eyes stayed locked on her ex.</p><p>“So, I see you listened.” Lilia said, smugly.</p><p>“You didn’t give me a choice!” Rio replied, motioning her hands and almost spilling some of her drink.</p><p>Damn, she’d only taken one sip.</p><p>“Ralph!” Agatha shouted from the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Ralph was laughing, he obviously had just smacked Agatha’s ass, his drink sloshing around.</p><p>Now, Rio had thought about groping Agatha, but she had meant consensually, whilst making out and/or fucking. Preferably, in a broom closet or some other confined space.</p><p>“I wanted to speak with you about an opportunity I have for you.” Lilia said, and Rio nodded, only half listening.</p><p>“Sure, yeah.” Rio agreed.</p><p>“I know you’ve been looking for a job…”</p><p>“You do that again, I swear to god, I will cut it off.” Agatha scolded while motioning to Ralph's crotch. “We both know how small it is, I doubt you’ll miss it.”</p><p>“Aggie, you were my wife for twelve years, I think that entitles me to certain privileges.” He said, slightly slurring.</p><p>“So, I’ve been thinking…” Lilia kept going.</p><p>Rio nodded at Lilia again before glancing across the room again.</p><p>“You’re drunk and acting douchier than normal, walk it off, Ralph.” Agatha barked.</p><p>“You’re acting bitchier than normal, how were we ever married?” Ralph said over the brim of his drink.</p><p>“I must’ve had brain damage.” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>Ralph seemingly took the hint and wandered off.</p><p>“...So, what do you say?” Lilia finished, oblivious to the scene unfolding across the auditorium and to Rio’s inner turmoil.</p><p>“Sounds great, Lilia.” Rio said, still keeping an eye on that stupid fucking man.</p><p>“Really? I didn’t think you’d agree so easily!” Lilia chuckled.</p><p>“Yeah, no…great.” Rio stared at Ralph who was now making his way back over to his ex-wife.</p><p>Fuck, Rio was going to do something stupid.</p><p>“Sorry, Lilia, excuse me.” Rio gave an insincere apology and started storming across the auditorium.</p><p>Agatha was oblivious to the fact that Ralph was winding his hand up again. She was facing away from him, standing at a table with Jen and Alice who also  weren’t paying attention.</p><p>Fuck. She was about to do something really fucking stupid.</p><p>She briskly crossed the room, dropping off her drink at a random table, and caught his wrist just shy of making contact, stopping it mid-motion.</p><p>“Dude, it’s not actually 2005, you can’t go around sexually harassing women.” Rio tried to keep her tone even.</p><p>Agatha turned, suddenly becoming aware of what was happening.</p><p>Ralph’s hazy eyes seemed to recognize her. “Rita, right?” He grinned.</p><p>Rio didn’t bother responding, dropping his wrist.</p><p>He raked his gaze over her body. “Damn, what a shame.”</p><p>“Ah, fuck.” Agatha muttered from behind Rio.</p><p>“Fucking, ‘scuse you?” Rio shouted, very aware that they had several sets of eyes on them.</p><p>“Weren’t you the class dy-”</p><p>Rio knew it was stupid, but her body acted on its own accord. Her fist shot out before she knew she was doing it.</p><p>Huh, she broke rule number four before rule number one, almost forty years old and still surprising herself.</p><p>Okay, but he deserved it.</p><p>Ralph was on the floor, clutching his face and crying out in agony. Rio looked down at her dominant hand, which now had the knuckles split open. Oh, she had done something really, very stupid.</p><p>“No fucking way!” She heard Alice giggle.</p><p>“Damn, finally.” Jen added.</p><p>Ralph was not a small guy, he used to play football, even now he was wearing his old jersey.</p><p>Rio felt a sick twinge of pride throughout her body, or maybe that was the adrenaline.</p><p>“What the fuck!?” Ralph wailed, his drink now spilt on the dancefloor. “Vis, help me up, man.” He held out his hand.</p><p>There was now a crowd of prior classmates surrounding the scene, Wanda and Vision included. He started extending his hand towards Ralph, when Wanda stopped him.</p><p>“You help him, you’re finding yourself a new wife.” Wanda placed a hand on her husband’s arm. Vision rescinded his hand.</p><p>Smart man.</p><p>Agatha just looked between Ralph and Rio in horror before grabbing Rio’s wrist and yanking her away.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio didn’t feel like receiving a verbal lashing from her ex.</p><p>“Come on, Rambo, we’re going to the nurse’s office.” Agatha sounded enraged.</p><p>Fuuuuck.</p><p>All Rio had to do was mind her own damn business and she would have been fine. Agatha was a big girl, she could’ve handled Ralph by herself. But something about watching Ralph manhandle her like that? It made Rio’s blood boil and her teeth clench. Not only because of how he was treating Agatha, but because Rio knew Agatha actively chose that over a potential future with her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak or look back as she dragged Rio and her bloody hand through the halls of their alma mater. They reached the abandoned nurses office, Agatha closing the door behind them.</p><p>“Sit.” Agatha’s tone was cold as she pointed to the twin sized nurse’s bed.</p><p>Rio obliged, not wanting to anger the beast any further.</p><p>Agatha inhaled a big breath before yelling. “WHAT IN THE EVERLIVING FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to defend herself but Agatha raised her hand to indicate that she should stay quiet.</p><p>“Rhetorical question.” Agatha turned and rifled through the drawers, collecting gauze, antiseptic, and a roll of bandages. “That was so fucking stupid, Rio. I know you think you’re tough, but you’re a fucking toothpick compared to him.”</p><p>Rio just nodded along, because she knew better than to try to interrupt.</p><p>“What if you hadn’t of knocked him down? Hmm? What if he had swung back? Did you even think about that before you acted?” She knelt down and grabbed Rio’s hand that now felt increasingly tender and for sure bruised. She seeped up the excess blood from Rio’s knuckles and threw away the gauze.</p><p>“I was trying to protect you.” Rio whispered, looking at Agatha who was now opening the antiseptic.</p><p>Agatha looked up from where she knelt, her face was tense but her eyes said something else. They were soft like they were decades ago. “This is going to sting like a bitch.” Agatha said and held a cotton ball soaked in antiseptic to Rio’s open knuckles.</p><p>Rio hissed at the contact. “Fuuuuuuuuck! Agathaaa!”</p><p>“Told you so.”</p><p>Rio exhaled at the pain. “Does he do that a lot?”</p><p>Agatha was looking down at Rio’s hand. “Do what?”</p><p>“Give you a hard time? Like, are you safe? Is that why you guys divorced?” Rio didn’t know how to ask any of this delicately, so it just came out all at once.</p><p>Agatha huffed a bitter laugh and looked up. “He might be a douchebag, but he’s not an abusive douchebag, if that’s what you’re asking.” Agatha returned to the task with the cotton ball. “Couldn’t even choke me in bed when I asked him to.”</p><p>Okay, not fucking fair, she was trying to drive Rio up the walls.</p><p>“So you have gotten kinky in your old age.” Rio shot back.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“You brought it up.”</p><p>“Oh my god, shut up.” Agatha said and blew on Rio’s knuckles, soothing the sting.</p><p>“Ahh, that feels good.” Rio whispered out before she could think, her voice breathy.</p><p>Agatha seemingly buffered for a second in her actions, quickly darting her eyes up and down. She composed herself and picked up the roll of bandages and quietly wrapped it several times around Rio’s knuckles and palm before finishing it off.</p><p>“Okay well.” Agatha exhaled and gathered the materials. “You’ll live.”</p><p>“Are you sure? Don’t you wanna take my temperature or administer a sponge bath, doctor?”</p><p>“I think it’s nurses who do the sponge baths.”  Agatha rolled her eyes and put everything back from their assigned drawers. “And, no.”</p><p>“You’ve gotta admit, the hand wrap is kind of hot.” Rio raised her now bandaged hand. “Makes me look like I get into fights.”</p><p>“You did get into a fight.”</p><p>“Don’t think it counts as a fight if the other guy stays down after one blow.”</p><p>“I get it, Rio. Your dick is bigger.” Agatha scoffs.</p><p>“Baby, you have no clue.” Rio chuckles, the pet name just slipping out.</p><p>Agatha’s face flickers with something Rio can’t quite pinpoint. It’s not sadness, but not necessarily desire. She’s looking at Rio with-</p><p>Longing.</p><p>It’s longing.</p><p>She clears her throat. “I should, uh, find an ice pack for Ralph.” And begins shuffling around the office, opening cabinets and drawers with no luck. “Why is there no fucking ice pack?” Agatha grumbles.</p><p>Rio stands, walks to the minifridge in the corner of the room, and grabs an ice pack. “Agatha.” She looks to Rio, sees the ice pack, and huffs.</p><p>“Should’ve thought to look there.” Agatha says, she sounds defeated, almost like she’s tired of pretending. Pretending that Rio doesn’t affect her, pretending that she’s still that perfect daughter, pretending she once loved her ex-husband.</p><p>Rio wonders if she’s right, if Agatha is exhausted from living against her own grain.</p><p>So, she tests the theory.</p><p>She walks it over to her, handing off the ice pack and maintaining eye contact. “I like your pants.” Rio husks.</p><p>“I hate those fucking boots.” Agatha bites out and sets the ice pack down.</p><p>“I wore them for you, mi amor.”</p><p>“You remembered?” She softens.</p><p>And Rio isn’t sure if she’s referring to the boots, or the term of affection that Rio hadn’t used since Agatha. Even with numerous casual girlfriends or flings, Rio never used the term, it was too intimate. Those other girls might’ve been a love, but they weren’t Rio’s love, her love, they weren’t Agatha.</p><p>Doesn’t matter which one Agatha means, Rio’s answer is the same regardless.</p><p>“I remember everything. I remember how you snort when you find something really, genuinely funny. I remember how you fold the corners of the books that you read because you always lose your bookmark. I remember how you hate scary movies, but watched them for me.”</p><p>Rio takes a step closer to Agatha and hears the other woman’s breath hitch in response, like she’s hanging on to every last one of Rio’s words. “I remember what your lips felt like, and how if I graze my teeth right on the soft spot under your ear it drives you crazy.” Rio pushes some of Agatha’s hair aside and gently cups her hand around the back of Agatha’s neck, her thumb now resting on the spot behind her ear. “I remember what your moans sounded like, your pleas, I remember how you felt in my arms.”</p><p>And rule number one is out the window. Well, she put up a valiant effort.</p><p>“I remember the nights in my studio under those stupid glow-in-the-dark stars I had on the ceiling. I remember how you used to sneak out to get away from your mother, and that I’d let you in everytime. I remember the time you stole my camera and took a perfect, in-focus, crystal clear photo of me on your first try.”</p><p>This wasn’t supposed to get sappy, but now Rio can’t stop.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were glassy, but she hadn’t moved or interrupted.</p><p>“I remember when you broke things off. Down to every fucking word. I could tell you what you were wearing, the season, the month, hell, the day. I remember how I sobbed and begged for you not to do it.” Rio felt herself getting worked up.</p><p>“I remember that I went through it all alone, because I couldn’t tell anyone. I remember seeing you and him in the hallway together the next day.” She didn't expect to feel so bitter, but now that she’s thinking about it, it’s like she had reopened the wound.</p><p>“I remember all of it, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest was heaving, like she couldn’t get air, maybe Rio’s declaration knocked it all out of her.</p><p>“Rio.” And it’s broken, her voice wavering. She brings her hands to Rio’s face, cradling her, and looking at her the way she did at eighteen. Rio swears she sees that girl she used to know trying to make her way out to tell Rio something, tell her anything.</p><p>Rio brings her hands to Agatha’s wrists, holding.</p><p>Agatha brings her face closer, letting her eyelids get heavier.</p><p>And Rio knows that if she lets this go on, it’s over, Agatha will have gotten her. She will have melted Rio down to the fucking bone.</p><p>She doesn’t want Agatha like this, drunk on nostalgia, trying to make up for the suffering of the past.</p><p>So, Rio pulls away, it physically pains her, more so than the split open skin on her hand, but she does it. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes open a little, but she’s still leaning in.</p><p>“That boy in the auditorium needs his ice.” Rio whispers.</p><p>And that girl is gone, replaced by the much more cynical almost forty year old woman that hates Rio.</p><p>The whiplash hits Rio like a gut-punch.</p><p>Agatha smiles a cruel, disingenuous smile, and drops her hands away like she’s been burned. Wordlessly, she picks up the ice pack, brushes past Rio, and leaves the nurses office with a soft click of the door.</p><p>Rio lets her eyes close, taking a beat to absorb the fact that she was just so close to everything she imagined.</p><p>Just not in the way she wanted.</p>

<p>She was eighteen when she learned a very simple truth.</p><p>That there is one thing both meat-headed jocks, and social outcast lesbians cannot resist:</p><p>Agatha in her cheerleading uniform.</p><p>Or at least Rio seemed to enjoy the uniform very much, if the way she was pawing at Agatha right now was any indication.</p><p>Ever since the darkroom, Agatha and her have been– whatever they are. Every free period for sure, some stolen moments after school, and every single night after a football game.</p><p>It just made sense, Agatha had to be there to cheer, Rio had to be there to shoot for the yearbook. So, she started offering to drive Rio home. And if during the drive, she pulled over and climbed on top of her not-girlfriend in the backseat…who would know?</p><p>Nobody, that's who.</p><p>She’d almost lost track of the time, she’d been so singularly focused on kissing Rio. Breathing in as much of her as she could, feeling her skin, looking into those big brown doe eyes that made Agatha’s pulse spike. Not only was Rio the most beautiful girl Agatha’s sure she’s ever seen, but she never wore a whole shirt. Rio’s toned stomach was out at all hours of the day and Agatha wants nothing more than to–</p><p>Time is of the essence here.</p><p>“I only have five minutes, I gotta study for a calc test I have tomorrow.” Agatha’s voice was gravely as she straddled Rio in the backseat, her hands tangled in Rio’s hair as she tipped her head to allow more access.</p><p>Rio accepted the invite, trailing her already swollen lips down Agatha’s neck, teeth skimming the skin right below her ear.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha moaned passionately, Rio’s hands were trailing underneath the skirt of her uniform.</p><p>“Mierda, estás caliente.” Rio growled as her mouth kept pressing at Agatha’s neck, hands now gripping Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Breathlessly, Agatha responded, “You know I don’t speak spanish, baby.” But fucking hell, did she love to hear it from Rio.</p><p>“I’ll have to teach you, that way, you can understand the dirty things I’m saying.” Rio looked up at Agatha on her lap and grinned. “Like… No tienes idea de las cosas que quiero hacerte.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself flush, even while not having a damn clue what Rio had just said. Her stomach was pooling with heat and she was just about ready to jump Rio’s bones right here, in the back of her Mercedes.</p><p>“You need to stop that.” Agatha damn near whimpered it, and she never fucking whimpered.</p><p>“Why?” Rio’s fingertips squeezed just the slightest bit as she asked the question.</p><p>“Because I’m not losing my virginity in the backseat of a car, two minutes before I have to go home and study.”</p><p>That seemed to sober Rio from her hormone-induced sex haze. “You’re a virgin? I thought you said you and Ralph-”</p><p>“You assumed, I just didn’t correct you.”  Agatha said. “You think I’d let that neanderthal touch me?” The very thought made her skin crawl. “I’ve never let him past second base.”</p><p>“So why do you keep him around?” Rio’s hands dropped from under her skirt.</p><p>“Obligation, I guess. My mother loves him, says he ‘comes from good breeding’, which is just her way of saying his family’s rich.”</p><p>“So you keep your beard to make your mom happy?” Rio squinted.</p><p>“Yeah, exactly.”</p><p>“Is that why you won’t call me your girlfriend? Or come out? Or be seen with me in public?” Rio didn’t even sound angry, just hurt.</p><p>And, in short, yes.</p><p>Agatha didn’t call Rio her girlfriend, or come out of the closet, or spend time with Rio in public, because of her mother.</p><p>Evanora Harkness.</p><p>Where to begin–</p><p>Some people have kids who shouldn’t, some people end up being awful caregivers despite their best efforts, and some people can’t hide their indifference to their own children.</p><p>Agatha wishes her mother was even just a fraction like those other people.</p><p>Because Evanora hated her daughter. Ever since Agatha left her body, she felt her mother’s disapproval of her very existence. It wasn’t indifference, it was vitriol. Pure, unadulterated contempt, no matter what Agatha did.</p><p>Agatha got an A on her test in elementary school?</p><p>Evanora said it should’ve been and A+.</p><p>Agatha made class treasurer in middle school?</p><p>Evanora said she should've been student body president.</p><p>Agatha got on the varsity cheer squad as a fucking sophomore?</p><p>Evanora asked why she wasn’t captain.</p><p>All of this to say, her mother had standards for Agatha on how she was to conduct herself in life.</p><p>Agatha was meant to be the best. To be perfect. To make the family look good.</p><p>And Rio did not fit into those standards.</p><p>But, Ralph did.</p><p>Didn’t matter that Rio was kind and listened to Agatha, or made her laugh her real laugh, the one where she snorted. It didn’t matter that Agatha never found herself bored around Rio, and she was bored around most people. Didn’t matter that Rio was insanely talented, driven, and one of the only people Agatha felt safe to be herself with.</p><p>Because Rio wasn’t Ralph.</p><p>And Agatha had spent so many nights, wishing, and hoping, and praying to a god she doesn’t believe in, to change that.</p><p>Change her.</p><p>Fix her so that she felt what she was supposed to feel with Ralph, but only ever felt with Rio.</p><p>And now she’s on Rio’s lap, in the backseat of her car, looking into those honey colored eyes with the little golden flecks in them…and her heart breaks. It breaks because if she were any other person, maybe she could give Rio everything she deserves.</p><p>“Where’d you go?” Rio strokes Agatha’s cheek, face twisted in concern.</p><p>“I’m right here.” Agatha gives her practiced smile.</p><p>“No, in your head just now, you checked out.” Rio doesn’t say it as an accusation, her tone is gentle.</p><p>And that makes Agatha break more, because in all her eighteen years on this planet, she has only ever been accused.</p><p>Accused of not being good enough.</p><p>Accused of not being good, period.</p><p>And Rio only wants to understand, not accuse.</p><p>She’s too good for Agatha and she’s not even aware.</p><p>Agatha has to give her something before she realizes.</p><p>“Just thinking.” Agatha says in a hushed tone, suddenly a little bashful. “What’s spanish for girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio blinks in shock. “Uh, mi novia.”</p><p>“Okay, if I cut Ralph loose, can you live with the rest?” Agatha can’t give her much, but she can give her this.</p><p>Oh, her mother is going to be pissed.</p><p>“You’d do that for me?” Rio says, like she’d never expect Agatha to do the bare minimum when it comes to treating her with respect.</p><p>Fucking, ouch.</p><p>“You could be my novia.” Agatha grins.</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Watch my mouth, MI novia.”</p><p>“Mi novia.” Agatha repeats.</p><p>“Muy bien.” Rio responds, pressing a gentle kiss to her lips.</p><p>After what’s definitely longer than five minutes, Agatha separates herself from Rio’s lap and drives her home. Kissing her one last time as a goodnight, and making her own way home.</p><p>She entered into the foyer, trying to make as little noise as possible.</p><p>“Agatha?” Is called from the drawing room.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Her stomach drops and her palms start sweating.</p><p>It’s not even past her curfew, she just avoids speaking to her mother at all costs.</p><p>“Yes, mother?” Agatha asks when she reaches Evanora reading some first edition of something, wine in her hand, primly sitting on the antique settee.</p><p>She looks Agatha up and down, as if she didn’t see her when she left for the game.</p><p>She’s in her cheer uniform, a light jacket over the top, hair tied up in a ponytail, and her backpack slung over her shoulder.</p><p>“Where were you?” It’s not asked out of concern, it’s asked out of malice. Trying to find something she can punish Agatha for.</p><p>“The game.” Agatha doesn’t elaborate unless explicitly asked.</p><p>“That ended almost an hour ago, and since the school is only a ten minute drive away, that leaves almost forty minutes unaccounted for.” Evanora’s eyes are piercing into Agatha, trying to find a fault or a flaw.</p><p>“I stayed back to take some team photos, the yearbook staff needed them.” And Agatha is a good enough liar at this point in her life, she has to be.</p><p>“Then I expect you to call next time.” She hisses at her daughter. “Unless of course you’d rather me take your phone away all together.”</p><p>“No. I’m sorry. You’re right, it was inconsiderate of me.” Agatha says in shame, because it’s easier than fighting, and ultimately losing.</p><p>“Have you gained weight?” But it’s not actually phrased as a question, more of an opinion turned fact.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Make sure to get a run in before school tomorrow. Just because Jen’s captain, doesn’t mean you can let yourself go, Agatha.”</p><p>And here comes the finale, what the weight-loss conversations always ended with.</p><p>“Honestly, I was half your size when I was your age.”</p><p>Agatha doubts that’s even possible, but–</p><p>“Yes, mother.” It’s like autopilot.</p><p>Evanora looks back down at her book. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodnight, mother.” Agatha says, and books it down the hall, up the stairs, and to her room.</p><p>All things considered, that interaction could've been worse. For some reason, Agatha was sure Evanora would take one look at her and know she had been making out with a girl less than an hour earlier. Because her mother always knew, and if she didn’t know, she’d find out. She’d rip Agatha apart for the answer, unravel her with little digs until Agatha was so unsure of herself, she caved.</p><p>So, she couldn’t ever know about Rio or what Agatha felt for her, how good she felt with Rio.</p><p>How good it would always feel with Rio.</p><p>Now, as a thirty-eight year old divorced single mother, things still felt good with Rio. Even as Rio rejected her in that nurses office, it felt better than anything in the last twenty years.</p><p>It felt fucking phenomenal watching Ralph finally get what he had coming to him.  And the fact that it was Rio who put him on his ass was, well, incredibly fucking hot.</p><p>Whenever men ‘defended a woman’s honor’ Agatha found it unbearable, disgusting, chauvinistic.</p><p>Seeing Rio do it?</p><p>She had to hold herself back from diving between Rio’s thighs as she knelt and wrapped the bruised hand. She wanted to lick the blood off of Rio’s knuckles and show her just how grateful she was.</p><p>But no, she wouldn’t do it.</p><p>And that almost kiss was just a…lapse in judgement.</p><p>Because for all intents and purposes, Agatha hates Rio Vidal.</p><p>She’s been hating Rio for twenty years, ever since she broke up with Rio at their spot.</p><p>Hated Rio.</p><p>Hated those boots.</p><p>Hated that fucking pet name.</p><p>Rio acted like she’s the only one who remembers everything, but Agatha remembers it all too.</p><p>Remembers the very atoms that create her strain against her every action and word as she decimated Rio’s heart.</p><p>Remembers going home that day and soaking her pillows through with her tears, staying as silent as can be so as to not alert her mother.</p><p>Remembers wearing that practiced smile the next day as Ralph grabbed her by the waist in the hallway, how she struggled to not cringe away at the contact.</p><p>Agatha walks through the halls back to the auditorium, pausing for a minute to collect herself.</p><p>She needs to put on a performance, show indifference, the picture of neutrality, the pinnacle of control.</p><p>That practiced smile graces her face as she strides through the auditorium doors, heads snapping in her direction at her entrance.</p><p>Ice pack in hand, she walks over to Ralph who is now sitting up, but still on the floor, clutching the side of his face. Agatha squats down beside him, surveying the damage.</p><p>“Let me see.” Agatha swats away his hand,</p><p>And jesus, Rio really fucking decked him. He’s not bleeding, but the very bottom of his eye socket and top of his cheek are already starting to bruise. Oh, he’s going to have to walk around with Rio’s fury on him for at least a week or two.</p><p>She gently applies the ice pack to the point of impact and Ralph winces.</p><p>Little bitch.</p><p>“I can’t believe that cun-” Ralph starts, like he’s the victim here.</p><p>Agatha pushes the ice pack against the tender area with more force, hoping it hurts, dipping her head to whisper in his ear.</p><p>“You fucking deserved it, Ralph.” And he’s groaning, maybe at the pain, maybe at Agatha’s scolding. “You have no right to me.” Agatha makes sure he hears just how venomous her tone is. “You have no right to throw slurs around and act like your actions don’t have consequences.” Agatha pulls back and looks at him dead in the eye. “Now, you’re going to go home, ice your face, and thank god she stopped at one punch and didn’t turn you into a fucking ken doll. Understood?”</p><p>Ralph looks pitiful, like a kid who just got put in timeout . “Yeah. I got it.”</p><p>Agatha smiles brightly, as if nothings wrong. “Great!”  She looks around and calls over Vision.</p><p>“Vis, would you be a dear and give him a ride home?” She says it in her best neighborly voice.</p><p>Vision looks to Wanda for permission, which she grants with a nod of her head. He helps Ralph off the ground and out of the auditorium.</p><p>As she stands, Jen, Alice and Wanda swarm her.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Alice asks.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha doesn’t let her smile crack.</p><p>“How’s Rio?” And of course it’s Wanda asking that.</p><p>“She’ll be alright, her hand’s a bit fucked, but nothing serious.”</p><p>“She’s my hero, I’ve been wanting to do that since high school.” Jen actually sounds genuine, and Agatha can’t remember a time where Jen has said anything positive about Rio.</p><p>“Haven’t we all?” Alice chuckles.</p><p>“Well, I don’t know about you all, but after that, I’m getting drunk. Care to join?” Agatha teases, but only to hide the fact that she is fucking drowning in her own emotions at that moment.</p><p>“You don’t have to ask me twice.” Wanda grins and bee lines it to the bar.</p><p> "Alice, you holding?" Agatha asks, to which Alice smiles and nods. "Perfect, mama's getting cross-faded tonight."

</p><p> Agatha can break down later, right now, she’s drinking to forget.</p><p>She follows after Wanda. “Hey, Ginger Spice, wait up!”</p>

<p>Mid December, 2004, Rio has Agatha curled into her side on the shitty little couch in her makeshift garage studio. It’s Friday night, the lighting is low and soft, only sources of it are the horror flick, twinkling fairy lights, and of course those glow-in-the-dark stars.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whips her head into the crook of Rio’s neck as yet another character is violently murdered. Her hand is clutching at the the sleeve of Rio’s flannel as if that’ll protect her from the fictitious killer.</p><p>Rio laughs and shuffles on the couch to further engulf Agatha. “Baby, it’s fake.”</p><p>“Yeah, I'm aware, doesn’t mean I wanna see it!” Agatha says against her neck.</p><p>“You said you’d try.” Rio reminds Agatha of when they planned this date. Rio invited her over the day before, having just picked up a copy of Saw on DVD, and asked Agatha if she wanted to watch it with her. Agatha grumbled, but agreed despite her loathing of the horror genre.</p><p>“You’re so fucking weird for liking this stuff.”</p><p>“Maybe it was a ploy to get you scared and wrapped up in my arms.” Rio jokes.</p><p>Agatha leaves her neck to look at Rio, “Trust me, you never need an excuse for me to touch you.” And it’s soft, it’s true.</p><p>“You’re not getting out of this by sweet talking me.” Rio smirks and looks back at the screen.</p><p>Agatha sits up, finds Rio’s camera on the side table and starts fiddling with it, taking off the lens cap and pushing on random things. Distracting herself from the grotesque actions happening on the tiny TV in the corner.</p><p>Rio sits up too. “Careful, that’s school-issued.”</p><p>“You don’t own your own camera?” Her hand playing with the focus ring.</p><p>“Those things cost more than my mom makes in a shift, so no.”</p><p>Agatha looks down at the camera, and then smiles like she has an idea, looping the neck strap over her head. She pushes Rio down, flat on her back and climbs on top of her.</p><p>“Okay, I’m liking wherever this is heading.” Rio says as her head hits the arm of the couch and her hands rest on Agatha’s clothed thighs.</p><p>Rio usually likes winter, but the cold weather has retired Agatha’s almost-miniskirts for the season, and it’s a damn shame.</p><p>Agatha chuckles as she brings the camera to her face, pointing it down at Rio.</p><p>“Let me show you how-” Rio tries to reach up and explain how to use it.</p><p>Agatha swats her hand away. “Yeah, yeah, aperture, shutter speed, all that shit.” She says with the camera still covering half her face.</p><p>“You can’t just use technical jargon and expect a good photo.”</p><p>“Smile.” Agatha mumbles, now adjusting the focus.</p><p>“At what?” Rio deadpans.</p><p>Agatha huffs, moves the camera momentarily to bend down and kiss Rio. It’s quick and simple, but when she pulls away, Rio is beaming. She lifts the camera and takes the shot, a shutter sound rings out.</p><p>“There’s no way that’s coming out.” Rio says, referring to the photo now burned into the roll of film.</p><p>“Then the photo and I have something in common.” Agatha retorts, lifting the camera strap off her neck and placing it back on the table.</p><p>“Please, keep in mind that there are worse things in life than you being gay.”</p><p>Even though Agatha had broken up with Ralph and called Rio her girlfriend, Rio had been less than subtle about wanting Agatha to come out. Sprinkling it into conversation whenever possible, and it didn’t slip past her that Agatha always deflected.</p><p>“Please keep in mind that there’s nothing worse in life than my mother.” Agatha is still on top of her.</p><p>And Rio knows she can’t force Agatha out from the closet when it’s not safe, but that doesn’t stop her selfish teen impulses.</p><p>“But I’m so funny and hot.” Rio pouts. “I’m a catch,” Rio lifts her head to ghost over Agatha’s lips. “Please keep me in mind.” And surges her mouth forward.</p><p>Agatha smiles into the kiss, reciprocating immediately.</p><p>“I’ll always keep you in mind.” Agatha mumbles before sliding her tongue against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio develops the photo at school on Monday, and son of bitch, of course Agatha took a perfect photo her first try.</p><p>When it’s dry, Rio scribbles on the back of it something cute and cheesy, signing her name and adding a little black heart. She intends to give it to Agatha when she walks into the darkroom during their free period, but when Agatha enters, something's off.</p><p>Her posture is different, her head isn’t held as high, her eyes aren’t bright like the sky on a summer morning, more cloudy like a thunderstorm. Her undereyes are kind of puffy, attempted to be covered by concealer.</p><p>Rio had just folded the photo into quarters when she looked up. “Hey, what’s wrong?” She tucks the photo in her back pocket, crosses the room and loops her hands around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“Got a bad grade.” Agatha croaks. “My mother…” She doesn’t go on, doesn’t need to. Rio pulls her in.</p><p>“It’s okay, I get tons of those.” Rio quips, hoping it takes away whatever pain Agatha’s mother inflicted for her to be crying over one grade.</p><p>“It was a B plus.”</p><p>That’s a bad grade in the Harkness household? Rio’s mom would celebrate a B+ with streamers and balloons, that is if Rio ever got those in anything not art related.</p><p>“Fucking hell.”</p><p>Agatha backs away, wiping the rogue tears off her face, and opens her backpack. Rooting around until she produces a box wrapped in festive paper.</p><p>“I know we won’t see each other during Christmas break since my family always spends it in New York, so I figured I’d give you this now.” She extends the gift towards Rio with a sad smile on her face.</p><p>Rio didn’t know they were doing presents, if she had, it would’ve given her time to sell a kidney to afford something Agatha would like.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“You don’t have to-” Rio starts.</p><p>“I want to.” She shoves the box further towards Rio.</p><p>Rio begrudgingly takes the gift and starts ripping the wrapping paper. As the box underneath comes into her view, her body freezes.</p><p>“Agatha, this is too much.” Rio whispers, mesmerized by what the box has printed across it.</p><p>“You can’t use a school-issued camera at NYU next year.”  And Agatha’s smile turns into a real one.</p><p>Rio looks at the box holding a Canon film camera, one of the fanciest and most expensive models.</p><p>“I-” Rio blinks. “How’d you get this so quick?”</p><p>“I have a guy.” Agatha chuckles at Rio who looks like, well, like a kid on Christmas.</p><p>“How’d you even afford this?”</p><p>“I have a credit card with no limit that my mother doesn’t even look at before she pays it off.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Open it.” She says mischievously, there’s more to the gift.</p><p>So, Rio does. She pulls out what is possibly the most extravagant gift she’s ever been given, and looks it over.</p><p>Then she sees it, in the very bottom corner of the camera is a small engraved ‘R.V.’, Rio’s initials.</p><p>“I-” Rio feels the tears welling. “Thank you, mi amor.” Rio doesn’t even realize she said it.</p><p>“My love?” Agatha asks for confirmation.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t taught her that word, so Agatha must be brushing up on her spanish.</p><p>Rio’s not sure if the warm feeling coursing through her is because of the camera or Agatha taking time to learn more of a language for her.</p><p>“Is that okay?” Rio returns, they haven’t said the ‘L’ word yet.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha breathes out, her eyes are bright blue again, the storm parted.</p><p>They spend the rest of the period setting up the camera, lacing through the nice leather neck strap Agatha had bought with it, loading in the film. Rio tries not to let the guilt of not getting Agatha a gift eat her alive, her photo now seems shitty in comparison. So she slips it into the front pocket of Agatha’s backpack when she’s not looking, hoping she’ll find it randomly one day and smile. Maybe on a bad day, when she needs it most. Maybe during Christmas break, maybe months from now. Either way, it’s a small comfort Rio can offer.</p><p>That camera had stayed with Rio even after their break up, through college, through every shoebox apartment in New York. It sat on her desk even now as she tossed and turned in her old childhood bed after the reunion.</p><p>She kept replaying what happened in the nurse's office, she could feel Agatha’s pulse racing when Rio’s hand was sitting against the side of her neck. Maybe she should’ve let Agatha kiss her, maybe she should’ve shut up about the past.</p><p>She looked over to the clock on her nightstand and read the time,</p><p>11:53PM.</p><p>Fuck, she wasn’t going to sleep tonight.</p><p>She turned over, attempting yet again to will her body into REM, when she heard the faint tapping against glass.</p><p>She shot up, looked around, and saw a shadow outside her bedroom window.</p><p>“FUCK!” She turned on a lamp and jumped out of bed, looking for a weapon to defend herself against the presumed axe murderer, picking up an old bat from when she played middle school softball.</p><p>Now, with the light on, Rio made out the figure, catching her breath and walking over, opening the window.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck?!”</p><p>Agatha stood there grinning, still dressed from the reunion, and started climbing through. “You never reacted like that in high school!”</p><p>“I was expecting you back then! Now you’re just a stranger breaking and entering!”</p><p>“It’s hardly breaking and entering when you opened it for me.” She reasoned and closed the window behind her, turning to look at Rio. “And we both know we’re not strangers.”</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing here, Agatha?”</p><p>“You sleep pantsless now, hm?” Agatha was locked onto Rio, standing before her in an old band tee and underwear.</p><p>“In the privacy of my own home? Yeah.” Rio felt like she should cover herself, but it’s not like Agatha hadn’t seen her pantsless before, or naked for that matter.</p><p>“Were you going to hit me with that?” She pointed to the bat still clutched in Rio’s grip.</p><p>“I still might.”</p><p>“Ohh, now who’s gotten kinky?”</p><p>Rio let out a deep breath. “I ask again, why are you here?”</p><p>“I wanted to see you.” Agatha pouts. “I tried to drown my sorrows in cheap wine at the reunion but I only got through two glasses before I bailed. Barely hit Alice’s pen.”</p><p>Rio faked a gasp. “Wow, you must really be tortured.”</p><p>“Baby, you don’t know the half of it.” Agatha purred and took the bat from Rio, resting it against the wall. “I might like some questionable stuff, but I think the bat is a hard limit.”</p><p>Rio recognized that voice, and she would not let Agatha get to her. “How’s Ralph’s face?”</p><p>“Completely fucked,” Agatha reached out and fisted her hand into Rio’s shirt. “Thanks to you.”</p><p>Rio felt the tug, pulling her closer. “Agatha…”</p><p>“I just want to show my gratitude.” She waited until they were flush against each other to bring her hands to Rio’s hips, fingers playing with the hem of her shirt.</p><p>“You should leave.” Rio tried to say it with conviction, but it came out quiet.</p><p>“So tell me to go.” Agatha whispered, her face dropping into the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>She felt the press of those lips she had missed, they felt the same, like no time had passed.</p><p>Rio knew she should shut this down, nothing had changed, they were still the people they  were a couple of hours ago in the nurse's office. But that didn’t stop her hands from shooting up to thread through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Fuck, it was still soft.</p><p>And she still smelled like lilacs and rain.</p><p>“Tell me to go.” Agatha challenged as she bit down on Rio’s neck, sucking the same way she always did.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut, she twisted her fingers tighter into Agatha’s locks, and let her head fall back.</p><p>“Fuck.” She moaned.</p><p>Agatha took that in stride, drifting her hands under Rio’s shirt and grabbing her waist.</p><p>Rio swore she’d been set on fire by how hot the touch felt, how familiar all of this felt.</p><p>“That’s not an answer.” Agatha taunted and nipped at her ear.</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“That’s what I’m angling for.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio pulled back and looked at her.</p><p>And her eyes still look the same as they always did when she was turned on, her lips looked just as puffy as they did in the backseat of that car after a game, her grip was still as intense as it was twenty years ago.</p><p>“I hate you.” Rio said as she yanked Agatha forward by the roots of her hair, clashing her mouth with the other woman’s.</p><p>Agatha had gotten to her.</p>

<p>A moan rang out into the room, Rio wasn’t sure if it was from her or Agatha, but at this point she didn’t fucking care. She couldn't remember the last time someone had kissed her with the intent to swallow her whole, like Agatha currently was. The woman snaked her tongue into Rio’s mouth and devoured her, angling her head and dragging Rio impossibly closer. It was raw and carnal, like Agatha was making up for lost time.</p><p>Maybe she was.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, Agatha bunched Rio’s shirt and ripped it over her head, flinging it into a dark corner of the room. Her eyes locked on Rio’s now exposed chest.</p><p>“God.” Agatha said it like she was pleading to a higher power, ducking down and mouthing down Rio’s neck, collarbones, and sternum before taking one of Rio’s nipples into her mouth and sucking.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whined at the contact, one of Agatha’s hands groping her ass, the other palming the neglected breast. Rio’s mind was hazy as her ex-girlfriend fucking consumed her, invading her senses.</p><p>“I’ve missed this.” Her confession was muffled with her head buried in Rio’s tits, not bothering to come up for air.</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted in anger at that, at Agatha saying ‘missed this’ instead of ‘missed you’, it made her feel vengeful.</p><p>Did Agatha even miss her?</p><p>She ripped her away with the hold she still had on Agatha’s hair, turned them, and pushed her first love as hard as she could onto the bed.</p><p>The force didn’t seem to bother Agatha, who immediately propped herself up on her elbows with a shit-eating grin as Rio climbed on top of her. “You have too much on.” Rio husked as she worked at the zipper of the stupid velour hoodie. She needed Agatha to feel her rage in this moment, she needed to destroy this woman. And since Agatha took away her bat, sex was the next best option.</p><p>Rio threw the hoodie behind her, and reached for the hem of the t-shirt, when Agatha’s hand covered hers, the body beneath her going ridgid, stopping her. “Wait, wait, wait.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Rio snapped her head up.</p><p>“I don’t look the same, how I used to.” Agatha almost sounded apologetic, looking strangely vulnerable for what they were about to do.</p><p>“Yeah, I would hope not.”</p><p>She didn’t want eighteen year-old Agatha, she wanted her now.</p><p>“No, Rio, I had a kid…” Agatha trails off.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“And it’s been twenty years.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio was wondering if Agatha had a point here.</p><p>“There’s stretch marks.” She warned.</p><p>Was that supposed to discourage Rio? Jesus fucking christ, is this what heterosexuality does to women? Agatha was quite possibly the most beautiful, attractive, ethereal, piece of ass that Rio had ever laid her eyes on.</p><p>“Hot.” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Rio, you say that but-”</p><p>“Ever heard of a MILF, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, laughing and looking up at Rio, the tension in her body seemingly evaporating.</p><p>“So, we doing this?” Rio started tugging at the shirt again, this time meeting no resistance.</p><p>Agatha nodded and raised her arms to help Rio discard the fabric, quickly reaching around to undo her own bra.</p><p>Rio pushed her back down so she was flat against the mattress, raking her gaze over the new expanse of skin that wasn’t actually that new.  The constellation of freckles that she had mapped out decades ago were still there, splattered across Agatha’s chest. However, she did notice that Agatha’s tits were bigger than they had ever been in high school.</p><p>She felt like god himself was smiling down on her, rewarding Rio in that moment.</p><p>“Perfect.” She breathes out, intending to start lavishing the most glorious set of tits she had ever seen, when Agatha’s hands pushed her aside. Swiftly switching their positioning on the bed, her arms bracketing Rio's head.</p><p>Motherfucking god damnit-</p><p>“Did you think the time had made me go soft?” Agatha taunted, slipping a toned thigh between Rio’s.</p><p>And yeah, of course she assumed that Agatha had become some docile soccer mom after withering away in suburbia for this long.</p><p>Clearly, Agatha hadn’t withered, and she sure as fucking hell wasn’t docile.</p><p>And Rio really didn’t want to cave, but her body didn’t seem to agree, her hips instantly grinding down on those stupid fucking sweatpants. She hated how good it felt, how wet she felt herself getting from minimal pressure. Fuck, she hadn’t used another persons leg to get herself off since high school, with the same woman and the same thigh.</p><p>She tensed her thigh, causing Rio to moan out. “We both know how desperate you’d get for me.”</p><p>Good god, the dirty talk was new. Head bitch in charge, cheerleader, mean girl Agatha made her spine shiver. But this version of Agatha? The one on steroids? She aimed to rip Rio’s spine out with her teeth.</p><p>“I thought the whole asking to be choked in bed thing might’ve- Oh, fuck,” She’d found just the right spot against Agatha’s leg. “Might’ve meant something.”</p><p>“Well I wouldn’t have gotten off on choking him, now would I?” Agatha trailed her fingers down Rios throat at that exact moment.</p><p>She groaned at the insinuation and jutted her neck into the grasp, letting her eyes close. Her hips snapped faster as she waited for a vice grip around her throat, but it never came. In fact, she felt Agatha move off of her all together.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>She whimpered at the loss and opened her eyes, a new wave of spite flooding her.</p><p>“What the hell!” Rio damn near shouted.</p><p>Agatha, looking all too pleased with herself, gazed down at Rio. “The first time I make you come after twenty years is not going to be by you rubbing your needy cunt all over my leg.”  She dropped to her knees, ripping Rio’s soaked underwear down her legs. “You’re coming on my tongue.”</p><p>Her breath hitched.</p><p>Once a munch, always a munch, then.</p><p>“Mmh, I like this.” Agatha skated her nails across Rio’s drunken mistake tattoo on her outer thigh. The death tarot card, carved into her skin forever, all because she was twenty-four and angsty. Agatha yanked her to the edge of the bed, and she tried not to focus on the flex of Agatha’s forearms and the demonic look in her eyes.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio groveled as teeth sunk into the soft flesh of her inner thigh. The other woman took her time, biting, sucking, kissing. For someone who hasn’t gotten properly laid in decades, Agatha was drawing this shit out.</p><p>Rio fisted her fingers into the head of hair that already looked thoroughly fucked, and tried to pull Agatha closer to where she needed her, where she was aching for her. But she wouldn’t budge.</p><p>“Either do something, or climb back out the fucking window.” She finally snapped. Her legs were covered in hickeys, her cunt was clenching around nothing, and heart was banging against her chest, trying to remind how fucking stupid she was for this.</p><p>“Ask nicely.” Agatha’s breath ghosting over Rio’s clit.</p><p>Her body involuntarily twitched, her hips canting upward. “Fuck off, I’m not begging.”</p><p>“You used to be compliant.” She insincerely pouted.</p><p>“You used to be straight,” Rio bit out. “Things change.”</p><p>With that same shit-eating grin, Agatha pulled back. “That’s a shame.”</p><p>“Where are you going?” Rio sat up, her still-spread legs now devoid of her ex.</p><p>“Climbing back out the window.” Agatha said, acting as though it was no inconvenience for her to just leave Rio here, completely naked and dripping. “Where’d I throw my bra?”</p><p>Rio had a choice.</p><p>Let her leave, furiously masturbate to the image of Agatha topless, maybe keep some of her dignity, and wake up tomorrow only feeling marginally stupid.</p><p>Or-</p><p>“Agatha, wait.”</p><p>She spun around, bra in hand. “Yes?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>She dropped her bra, walked back over, and stood between Rio’s legs. Placing a gentle hand on Rio’s chin, forcing her to look up. “Please, what?”</p><p>Fickle bitch.</p><p>“Please fuck me.” Rio whined.</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless chuckle, sliding her thumb over Rio’s bottom lip. She didn’t think twice, she wrapped her lips around the digit and sucked. “Are you gonna be good for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded as her cheeks hollowed, she’d let this woman do whatever the fuck she wanted to her at this point, as long as she just did something.</p><p>Agatha smiled like a predator that had just trapped its prey, victorious. “You’re so pretty when you have your mouth occupied for something useful.”</p><p>Rio moaned around her thumb, dumbly agreeing, and watching as Agatha re-positioned herself on the floor.  Her hand slid from Rio’s mouth, gingerly picking up one of Rio’s legs and slinging it over her shoulder.</p><p>When Rio’s hips involuntarily lifted closer to Agatha’s face, she took it upon herself to pin her hips down with that stupid fucking forearm, Rio could see the outline of muscle, the appearance of faint vein as flexed..</p><p>“Behave.” Agatha’s voice was low and controlled as she finally, thank fucking god, finally ducked her head down and ran her tongue teasingly through Rio.</p><p>Rio might’ve moaned, but it was drowned out by a louder one from Agatha. As soon as her mouth made contact, Rio’s back arched, trying to get more, but Agatha didn’t let up on her hips, forcing them still against the mattress.</p><p>“You taste even better than I remember.” She husked before diving back to Rio’s cunt.</p><p>No, she didn’t get to say that, because it was equally endearing as it was sexy.</p><p>This time her tongue wasn’t light, or cautious.</p><p>This time, when Agatha’s mouth made contact, it was commanding. She firmly pressed her tongue down on Rio’s clit and dragged, causing Rio’s hips to buck, which only seemed to piss off Agatha and result in her adding more pressure.</p><p>“Baby…” Rio whimpered, clutching the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just stayed between her thighs, eating her out like a woman starved. Her tongue momentarily leaving Rio’s clit to dip inside of her and thrust, at the same time, Agatha’s nails bit into the ink of her tattoo.</p><p>Rio was convinced in that moment that her pussy must be some kind of fucking delicacy with how Agatha refused to come up for air or part from her.</p><p>Her thighs started tensing against her will, her stomach felt that familiar twist as she barreled towards the edge. “Please, Agatha.” Rio begged. “Pleasepleaseplease..” She was babbling, she knew she was, and she didn’t give a damn, not with how Agatha bobbed her head, took Rio’s clit into her mouth, and sucked.</p><p>Her forearm finally gave way to Rio’s hips, allowing her to buck up into Agatha’s mouth, increasing the level of pressure. Agatha sucked harder in retaliation, ever so slightly grazing her teeth, and -</p><p>Rio was gone.</p><p>“Mi amor!” She gasped at the convulsions of pleasure slamming into her. Her nails scraping against Agatha's still-moving head, and her legs clamping around Agatha’s ears. Her abs tensed as she threw her head back, panting and letting her eyes shut as her orgasm ebbed.</p><p>She looked back down to find Agatha cleaning her with her tongue, licking every last bit of the now sticky skin between Rio’s thighs, she was fucking posessed.</p><p>When familiar blue eyes finally locked on her own, Agatha pulled away, her face shiny. She climbed on top of Rio again, pushing her flat on her back. And Rio’s hands, out of muscle memory, rested on her thighs. They’d always come back to this position, it didn't matter that all the time had passed, they’d come back to one another.</p><p>It was a comforting thought, until Rio remembered that that’s not what she should be thinking about. That’s not what this was. They were just two exes making a mistake that they’d regret as soon as their clothes were back on.</p><p>Post-nut clarity is not supposed to be this melodramatic.</p><p>Distracting herself, Rio pulled Agatha down into a filthy kiss, groaning at the taste of herself on Agatha’s lips, on her tongue.</p><p>“Where the fuck did that come from?” Rio asked.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha’s hand that was digging into her tattoo shifted and started teasing Rio’s entrance.</p><p>“You never ate me out like that in high school.” It was petty, but until now Rio assumed she was the only woman Agatha had been with. “Who taught you that?”</p><p>Agatha dipped two of her fingers in, only to the first knuckle, and Rio mewled. “Are you jealous, baby?”</p><p>She should really learn to not assume about Agatha.</p><p>“You’re distracting me.” But, fuck, she needed more.</p><p>“Too horny to think?” Her fingers sank to the second knuckle.</p><p>Yeah, actually, she was.</p><p>“Uh, I-” She felt those long, lithe fingers sink all the way. “Ohhhh-”</p><p>Her free hand came up to Rio’s throat, immediately squeezing.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers pumped, and Rio’s eyes glassed over, making some unintelligible noise that did not resemble real words.</p><p>“You have no idea how many times I fucked myself over the years to the sounds I remember you making.” She lowly whispered in Rio’s ear.</p><p>Picking up the pace, pumping faster and curling.</p><p>“You have no idea how many times I wished my fingers were yours.”</p><p>Oh, she was gonna combust,</p><p>In her childhood bedroom underneath her ex.</p><p>There were worse ways to go.</p><p>“Harder.” Rio dug her digits into Agatha’s thighs, hoping it was enough to leave bruises.</p><p>Agatha obviously didn’t know if she meant the hand choking her or the one fucking her, so she amped up both.</p><p>The hand on her neck contracted tighter, the one inside her drove faster.</p><p>She was fluttering around Agatha’s fingers, she could hear the crude sounds of herself being fucked, the creaking of the old matress frame on each thrust.</p><p>Rio had never experienced euphoria, but this must be close.</p><p>“I can't-” She gasped. “I, I need-”</p><p>“Shh, I know, love. I remember.” Agatha replied, quickly adding her thumb down on Rio’s clit and pressing.</p><p>Love? No, no, no, there was no love here. All of this was decidedly not love. Rio was not her love, not anymore.</p><p>But her body didn’t know that, it just responded. Clamping down on Agatha’s fingers, her walls pulsed, sending her careening into another orgasm.</p><p>Her back arched as she let out a breathy, pitiful sound that even in the moment, she judged herself for, it sounded like a pornstar’s attempt at pleasure. But as her ex kept fucking her as she came, pleasure was all she felt. Violent, unadulterated ecstasy, mixing with pure hatred for the woman causing it.</p><p>Which reminded her, she was going to fuck Agatha, and still hadn’t. She quickly sat up, nearly knocking the other woman off balance, and started pulling at the waistband of the pants that Agatha still had on.</p><p>She chuckled at Rio. “Eager are we?” She rapidly stood, took off her pants and underwear, and straddled Rio once again.</p><p>Rio didn’t dignify her with a response, just gathered the ridiculous amount of arousal dripping from Agatha’s cunt, and roughly inserted two fingers.</p><p>Hurt like a bitch with her injured hand, but she’d play through the pain.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Agatha screeched, her hands now clasped onto Rio’s shoulders, eyes slammed shut.</p><p>Rio missed this, Agatha was warm, and tight and she couldn’t believe she hadn’t had this for the last two decades. Hadn’t had Agatha.</p><p>She buried her fingers and started moving them at a vicious pace, forcing Agatha to keep up. Rio’s free hand wrapped around her waist, pulling her flush against Rio, her hips rolling to meet the thrusts.</p><p>And finally, fucking finally, Rio ducked her head and started mouthing at Agatha’s tits. Making sure to leave hickeys so that Agatha had something of her even after they were done, if only temporarily.</p><p>Agatha, always the overachiever, started riding faster, nails now clawing at down Rio’s back. The scratches burned but it only pissed her off more, slamming her fingers faster.</p><p>“I missed you, fuck, I missed you.” It was breathless and barely coherent as Agatha rolled her hips again.</p><p>Rio would’ve said ‘fuck you’ if she was not already quite literally doing that, so she settled for the alternative. “Agatha,” She opened her eyes to look at Rio. “Shut the fuck up.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in return, but Rio felt her clench around her, her body getting more rigid as she rode.</p><p>“Are you already about to come?”  Rio asked in a condescending tone.</p><p>She didn’t respond, just whined.</p><p>“Has nobody fucked you properly since me?”</p><p>Another whine.</p><p>Rio used the arm around her waist to fist her hand at the base of Agatha’s neck, pulling her hair and snapping Agatha’s head back. She thrust harder.</p><p>“Answer me.”</p><p>She whimpered, her thighs started shaking. “Nobody, nobody, no-” And she came as she screamed, hips stuttering, her cunt seizing around Rio’s fingers.</p><p>No, not good enough.</p><p>Rio kept moving, adding a third finger, and forcing Agatha to take it. The other woman whimpered and buried her face into the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p>She curled her fingers against Agatha’s g-spot and pumped. “And I'm the desperate one? That was fucking pathetic.”</p><p>Agatha lewdly moaned in her ear, trying and failing to speak.</p><p>So degradation was definitely on the table, good to know.</p><p>“Did you think about me while you fucked him? Did you think about my cock inside you instead of his?”</p><p>Digits hitting that perfect spot everytime, Agatha clenched again, her back stiffened. “Yes.” She barely got the broken word out before she spasmed, coming again and ripping the skin of Rio’s back to shreds.</p><p>Still not good enough, if Agatha could still speak, Rio wasn’t done.</p><p>Fuck, her hand was aching, but this was more important.</p><p>“Rio, baby, I can’t.” Agatha sounded like she was on the brink of tears as Rio kept thrusting after her orgasm.</p><p>“One more.” Rio whispered. “You can take one more.”</p><p>And Agatha’s hips weakly rolled again, silently agreeing.</p><p>Good, she was struggling to answer.</p><p>She wanted Agatha boneless after this, she wanted her spent knowing it was Rio who had done it.</p><p>She flexed her palm, grinding it on Agatha’s clit, and heard her ex sob at the contact.</p><p>“Good girl, you can do it. Come all over my hand for me.”</p><p>And for all the times that Agatha never fucking listened to her, this time she did.</p><p>Praise too, apparently.</p><p>Agatha made a desperate sound and came again, her body going limp afterwards like a ragdoll. Rio peppered small kisses to her head, gently combing her fingers through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“You did so well, baby.” Rio slowly removed her fingers and felt Agatha twitch.</p><p>Oh her hand was already fucked, but after that? Pain shot throughout her bones worse than it did when she threw the punch.</p><p>She laid Agatha down on the bed, pulling her into her side, onto her chest. How they always used to when they slept in the same bed, and pulled the sheets over them.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked after a minute of silence.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, looking delirious. “Never been better, hot stuff.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and threw her arms around her first love and engulfed her, letting herself enjoy however fleeting of a moment this was.</p><p>She didn’t remember falling asleep, just remembered embedding herself against Agatha afterwards. When she woke up the next morning, she rolled over to check on her ex.</p><p>The other side of the bed was empty, no trace of anything that happened last night.</p><p>Well, what the fuck was she expecting?</p><p>Maybe they’d get breakfast and talk through the teenage adolescent trauma and start over again? Clean slate?</p><p>Fucking idiot.</p><p>Then a bang on her front door reminded her why she had woken up in the first place. Who the fuck had the audacity to come to someone’s house at-</p><p>8:22AM.</p><p>On a Sunday?</p><p>Rio grumbled and put on the first shirt and pair of pants she could find, making her way to the door at a glacial pace.</p><p>“Morning.” Lilia chirped, coffees in hand.</p><p>“Why?” Was all Rio choked out.</p><p>She brushed past Rio, handing her a coffee and opened her comically large teaching bag.</p><p>“I know you only agreed last night, but August is almost over, so I need you to sign the onboarding paperwork.”</p><p>“Onboarding?”</p><p>Lilia smirked as she took in Rio’s disheveled appearance. “Have a good night?”</p><p>Okay too many things happened in a too short span of time.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You got a little…” Lilia motioned to her own neck, and Rio shot a hand to cover her own.</p><p>Fucking fickle ass soccer mom marked her.</p><p>Distract, distract.</p><p>“Lilia, what do you mean onboarding?”</p><p>“When you took the job last night.”</p><p>When did Rio accept a job offer?</p><p>“Before you punched that tool who was harassing your girlfriend.”</p><p>Ohhhh, that’s right, Rio was too distracted to-</p><p>Girlfriend?</p><p>“My girlfriend?” Rio asked, eyes wide in alarm.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Yes, I know who Agatha is, I’m asking why you think she’s my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Because she was in high school, and now you have a hickey on your neck, and your hair looks like someones been pulling it.” Lilia teased.</p><p>“How-” She was processing.  “Wait. How’d you…” Rio sputtered.</p><p>“You guys weren’t subtle,” Lilia sipped her coffee nonchalantly about Rio’s biggest secret. “I mean, maybe to the other students because teens are self absorbed and all that bullshit.” She smiled. “But did you think I wouldn’t notice Agatha Harkness suddenly appearing in the art wing every day? Or the several hundred dollar camera slung around your neck out of the blue?”</p><p>Yes, that’s exactly what she thought.</p><p>“Why’d you think I insisted on you coming to the reunion? She finally divorced that asshole and you were in town. My Sicilian matchmaking senses were tingling.”</p><p>“We’re not.” Rio took a breath. “We’re not together, never were.”</p><p>Lilia cackled at that. “Oh honey, it’s endearing that you thought that was believable.” She turned and lifted the paperwork. “Now, I need you to sign this and then we’ll get you enrolled in an online course for certification. I have my old syllabus, you can use that as a template for lesson plans.”</p><p>“What are you on about, woman?” Rio set down the coffee and took the stack of paper from Lilia. She read over what was printed.</p><p>Fuck, no.</p><p>No, no, no, no, no-</p><p>This was a contract to teach at Westview High School.</p><p>She agreed to be a fucking teacher at the most special place in hell?</p><p>No, please god no, no, no, no, no-</p><p>Lilia gave a sweet smile.</p><p>“Oh, and Rio?”</p><p>“Huh?” She strained out.</p><p>“In the future, it’s frowned upon for faculty to punch a student’s parent.”</p>

<p>Okay so, another lapse in judgement.</p><p>Well several.</p><p>The lapse in judgement in the nurse’s office, then when she went to Rio’s house. Then when she hit on her, then kissed her, then fucked her, then let Rio fuck her.</p><p>And Rio had fucked her so incredibly well.</p><p>How many was that? Six?</p><p>This was a classic six consecutive lapses in judgement type of situation. It could happen to anyone.</p><p>She tried to remember what the fuck she was thinking as she climbed in Rio’s window last night, but she came up blank.</p><p>She hadn’t been fucking thinking, if she had, she would’ve been a responsible adult and gotten cross-faded in the auditorium of her old high school.</p><p>But no, Rio made her feel...soft. She wanted to see her, and actually talk to her. But as it turns out, meaningless sex is way more fun and so, so much easier.</p><p>It’s not like she wanted Rio back or anything. She didn’t want to make amends and drone on about the past. She didn’t want to come out, and win Rio back, and wake up with her every morning. Make breakfast together and talk about mundane plans and work, maybe argue over how to load the dishwasher properly. Have family dinners where Rio and Nicky got along and made each other laugh. Pretend to be upset when Rio watched a new episode of their show without Agatha. Kiss her just because she could, whenever she felt like it. Go out, like in actual public, and hold hands as they walked back to the car. Fall asleep on Rio’s chest just like she had last night, just like she used to twenty years ago.</p><p>No, she didn’t yearn for that.</p><p>Because she couldn’t have it.</p><p>So toxic ex sex it was.</p><p>She got home the morning after, around eight, and sprinted upstairs to shower. She needed Rio off of her body. Luckily, Nicky spent every weekend at Ralph’s, per their custody agreement, so Agatha did not have to walk-of-shame past her sixteen year old son as he ate his cheerios.</p><p>But even underneath scalding hot water, Rio was still on her. The hickeys on her chest, the knots in her hair, the very faint bruises outlining fingers splayed across her thighs. The only thing that brought comfort is believing that Agatha had given as good as she got, knowing Rio probably didn’t have any other choice but to wear a turtleneck in August after last night.</p><p>Oh, and now that she thought about it, Rio’s back was definitely fucked from Agatha clawing at it. She doesn’t think she drew any blood, but in the moment she wasn’t really paying attention.</p><p>Had she drawn blood?</p><p>Not that there would be a next time, but if there was, Agatha would need to make sure to check her handiwork. And her hand, the way she had fucked Agatha last night must’ve been brutal on her hand.</p><p>Rio was content to further worsen her hand, the hand she fucked up from punching Agatha’s ex-husband, all to make Agatha come over and over again.</p><p>Why the fuck is that hot?</p><p>No, because it was actually pissing Agatha off, the fucking nerve of that woman-</p><p>She heard the front door open downstairs, and turned off the shower, grabbing a robe and hastily drying her hair. She assumed it was Ralph dropping off Nicky early, like he did most Sundays when he didn’t feel like being a parent any longer. However, when she descended the staircase, Alice was standing in her foyer, looking like she’d seen a ghost.</p><p>“I used the spare key. We need to talk.” Alice stated. “Walk with me.” And took off towards the kitchen.</p><p>“Good morning to you too.” Agatha muttered and followed behind, reaching the kitchen and watching Alice start brewing coffee.</p><p>Alice, Jen, and Wanda were always over, so it made sense that she was so comfortable helping herself, but the energy was off. Like, she was nervous.</p><p>“So you know how when I smoke too much I get really existential.” Alice said as she clicked the button on the outrageously expensive coffee maker and turned to look at Agatha.</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha agreed, and leaned against the marble kitchen island.</p><p>“And then I have to take a walk around the neighborhood while I ponder?”</p><p>She smiled. “Yeah, you ponder whilst you wander.”</p><p>“Exactly. So I might’ve hit my pen a little too frequently last night, and I naturally kept trying to answer life’s heaviest questions. And Jen was trying to sleep, so…”</p><p>“You wandered.” Agatha finished.</p><p>“Yeah, and I was making my way around the block last night, when..” Alice’s face twisted.</p><p>“Well don’t leave me hanging, when what?”</p><p>“Ya know how I live on the same street as Rio?”</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha kept her tone light.</p><p>“I was, uh, passing by her house when-” She cleared her throat. “I saw you, climbing through her window.”</p><p>This is not happening.</p><p>“Do you think the cart was laced with something?” Agatha asked, feigning genuine concern.</p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows. “I did consider that, because it's so far-fetched. Like you two never got along, so why would you be there? I really thought I was seeing things.” Okay, so she was in the clear, she had successfully manipulated her friend of three decades. “Until I made another lap around the block.”</p><p>Sweet mother of god, this woman was going to kill her.</p><p>“You did?” Agatha gave a tense smile.</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“And what did you see?” It was fine, Agatha could spin this. She’d lie through her teeth and nobody would be the wiser.</p><p>“I don’t know how to say this delicately.” Alice reached into the cabinet for two coffee mugs.</p><p>“Well then it can’t be that bad, probably just a product of your drug-addled mind.”</p><p>Please let it go, please let it go, please let it go.</p><p>“Agatha, you two were fucking.”</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>“Okay so it was definitely the drugs, because that is nuts.” She forced out a laugh. “Alice, you sound cuckoo for coco puffs.”</p><p>“I can see the hickey on your collarbone, dude.” Alice sipped her out of her own mug and sat the second one on the counter in front of Agatha.</p><p>She snapped her head down to look, and sure as shit, right at the opening of her robe was the indentations of Rio’s teeth.</p><p>Oh, she’d make her pay for that next time.</p><p>“That could be from anybody.” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Alice took a frustrated breath. “I saw you eating box last night, in Rio’s house, between Rio’s legs, because you two were having sex.”</p><p>That was just crass.</p><p>“I’m sure you saw someone.” Agatha was going down swinging. “But seeing as there are numerous brunette white women in this town-”</p><p>“You were in your naughty sweatpants.” Alice deadpanned.</p><p>She’d burn those fucking sweatpants.</p><p>“Fucking voyeur!” Agatha finally snapped.</p><p>“I’m the voyeur? Close the damn blinds next time, exhibionist!” She yelled. “I mean, what the fuck, Agatha? Were you really trying to gaslight me into thinking I didn’t see what I clearly saw!”</p><p>“Well it was worth a try!”</p><p>“Are you having some late in life sexual awakening? Are you bi? Please say you are, Jen has too much bi pride shit in our home. Not that I’m biphobic, it’s just a fuck ton of clutter, and I’d love to unload some of it.” Alice rambled.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god, you told Jen?!”</p><p>“No! I wanted to talk to you first.”</p><p>Okay, at least this secret ended with Alice.</p><p>“You cannot tell Jen.”</p><p>“No, Agatha, don’t make me hide this. Jen loves gossip and it gives me heartburn to keep things from her.” Alice started rubbing her sternum like the heartburn was flaring up.</p><p>“Well you should’ve thought about that before you had the audacity to walk around your own neighborhood.” Agatha picked up the mug and took a sip.</p><p>“How long has it been going on?”</p><p>Fuck it, she was here, and she figured it out.</p><p>“Twenty-one years, give or take.”</p><p>“TWENTY YEARS?” Alice’s mouth was agape.</p><p>“GIVE OR TAKE.” Agatha repeated, throwing her hands around wildly.</p><p>“You and Rio were together in high school?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Just like all of senior year.”</p><p>“Oh my god, poor Rio.”</p><p>Right, poor Rio.</p><p>“Yes, I get it, I’m the heinous bitch and Rio is a saint. Believe me, I’m aware.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m sorry.” Alice grabbed Agatha and hugged her. “I’m sorry you felt like you had to hide it for so long.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled, no she was not going to cry. “Don’t make it weird, it’s kinda gay.”</p><p>Alice chuckled and pulled away. “Why haven’t you said something? Come out? I mean I understand hiding it in 2005, I did too, but we’re grown now.”</p><p>Because it's not that easy.</p><p>“Alice, I don’t even tell my mother I smoke, I’m not telling her when I’ve been out ‘eating box’, as you so eloquently put it.”</p><p>“But you deserve to be happy.” She said it like it was obvious.</p><p>And maybe if Agatha wasn’t Evanora’s daughter, that would be true.</p><p>Okay, time to pivot.</p><p>“Hey did I look hot?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“From behind, when I was… ya know…” Agatha smirked. “Like from behind?”</p><p>“I didn’t linger!” Alice looked offended.</p><p>“I pay a lot of money for pilates, I just wanna know it’s doing something!” And it was meant to distract, but Agatha did also wonder what she looked like when she gave Rio head. But placing a mirror behind Rio, and then another behind herself just to watch seemed like a lot of effort.</p><p>Or,</p><p>She could just eat Rio out in front of a mirror and make Rio take a picture. Now that was an idea, one to keep in mind for later.</p><p>“So what are you and her?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha said, because she truly didn’t know.</p><p>“Are you getting back together?” Alice raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha smiled.</p><p>Alice just blinked back in surprise.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Alice scrunched her face.</p><p>“It’s hard to say-”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“Hey, you want straight answers, ask a straight lady.”</p><p>Alice chuckled and turned her head when the front door opened.</p><p>“Mom, I’m home! Dad got his shit rocked so he dropped me off early.” He called down the hall.</p><p>“We’re in here, honey!” Agatha shouted back and pulled her robe tighter, covering any evidence.</p><p>Nicky walked through the archway connecting the kitchen to the hallway and smiled. “Aunt Alice, hey!” He gave Alice a short hug before doing the same to Agatha.</p><p>“Hey bud.” Alice smiled.</p><p>“How was your dad’s?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Fine, but he has to find a new place, that apartment is sad.”</p><p>Good, she hoped he was rotting away in that shitty little gray box.</p><p>“Oh and I finally got my class schedule emailed to me, turns out black and white photography is running this year.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched, Nicky had so much of Rio in him and they didn’t even know one another.</p><p>“Mrs. Calderu thought they were gonna scrap it since she had too many classes as it is, but they got another teacher.” He was beaming the same way Rio used to when she talked about Mrs.Calderu and photography.</p><p>“That's great, hon. Who’s the teacher?” She grinned.</p><p>Nicky pulled out his phone and opened the email. “Uh, Miss Vidal. Must be new.”</p><p>No. No, he must suddenly be illiterate. He fucking better be illiterate.</p><p>“Let me see.” And Nicky handed over the phone.</p><p>Right there, clear as day-</p><p>Miss Vidal.</p><p>Agatha looked over to Alice, who had an equally horrified face.</p><p>So, just to recap- She had fucked both her secret ex-girlfriend and her kid’s teacher.</p><p>Lapse in judgment her ass.</p>

<p>“What’d she do this time?” Rio asked from where she sat, doing homework at her desk at the end of February 2005. For about the past month, Agatha has been sneaking out a few times every week and sleeping at Rio’s. Usually after her mother berated her for something that most parents would praise their child for. It drove Rio up the fucking walls to hear Agatha explain it. That is, on the rare occasions that she would go into detail.</p><p>Agatha was in the middle of flinging herself through the window as she answered. “Got on my ass about college.”</p><p>“My mom’s at work right now, I texted saying you could use the front door.”</p><p>Closing the window and curtains behind her, Agatha smirked. “Yeah but it’s hotter to sneak in.”</p><p>“Why is she on your ass? You’re going where she wanted you to go.” Rio said then pouted. “Even though it’s inferior to New York.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, shrugging off her jacket and walking over to sit on Rio’s lap. “I’m sorry if Princeton doesn’t have the same street cred as NYU.”</p><p>“So what was the wicked witch of Westview’s problem this time?” Rio started skating her fingers along Agatha’s arm, waiting for the answer.</p><p>“Well, we were talking about college next year, and she went on her tangent about how the last however many generations of women in our family graduated from Princeton.”</p><p>Rio faked a cough. “Nepotism.”</p><p>Agatha playfully nudged her elbow into Rio’s ribs in retaliation. “Anyways, she told me that all of the women in my family met their future husband on campus, and that if I want to be married by twenty-two then I should be engaged by junior year.” She let out a bitter chuckle. “And that I should have children as soon as possible, so that way I can leave them with the nanny and focus on my career, which of course will be taking over the family business.”</p><p>And yeah, Rio had a vague idea of what Evanora demanded of her daughter, but she never thought that deeply about it. About the reality of not living in the same town as Agatha next year, about Agatha having the expectation of a husband and kids placed upon her. They never mentioned what they would do when they inevitably went off to college in different states, and in all honesty, Rio had been avoiding it.</p><p>“And, I don’t know, I just snapped. Seeing my whole life laid out like that for me? Without even asking me what I might want? It made me so fucking angry, so I said something stupid and she…”</p><p>Rio gave her arm a gentle squeeze. “And she what?”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head. “Not worth it, I don’t wanna talk about it.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio nodded, placing a kiss to Agatha’s neck.</p><p>She didn’t pry, just trusted that if it was something serious, Agatha would tell her.</p><p>“Did you know that NYU and Princeton are only an hour and nine minutes away from each other by car?” Agatha stared at her.</p><p>Did Agatha look that up for her?</p><p>“Are they now?” Rio smiled.</p><p>“I MapQuested it.” She said it so casually. “There’s also the train or the bus, but you know how I feel about public transportation.”</p><p>“I know, mi amor, you hate it.”</p><p>“Well I wouldn’t hate it if they just invested money into maintaining it, I mean honestly, I know the government has the funds-” Agatha started ranting.</p><p>And Rio just stared. Stared at this girl who was going on and on about the need for federal funding for adequate public transportation, knowing Evanora would drop dead if she heard her daughter spewing such liberal blasphemy. Stared at the girl who sat down and fucking MapQuested how far apart they would be next year. Stared at the girl who obviously hadn’t considered college splitting them up. Stared at the girl who Rio-</p><p>“I love you.” She absentmindedly commented mid-way through Agatha’s tangent.</p><p>Agatha, who never was at a loss for words, stopped speaking and just blinked at Rio.</p><p>Oh, she might’ve fucked up.</p><p>“I’m sorry if that was, like, too much or too sappy or something. And you don’t have to say it back.” The words tumbled out so quickly, she wasn’t even sure they were coherent. “But I just wanted to say it because I mean it. I love you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>And the way Agatha asked it was so earnest, it felt like someone reached into Rio’s chest and squeezed.</p><p>Who asks that?</p><p>Someone who’s never heard it before.</p><p>“Because of all the quiet parts of you, the ones you don’t let people see. Who you are, despite the facade. You’re warm, and caring, and never shut the fuck up.” Agatha chuckled. “You’re witty, and too fucking intelligent for ninety percent of the people in this cesspool of a town. You’re stubborn, like super fucking stubborn.” Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek. “And you act like it’s not true, but you’d take a bullet for the people you really care about.” Another kiss to the other cheek. “And you try to hide it, but you’re such a stupid softie with a huge heart.” Rio started rapidly placing kisses all over her face.</p><p>“Ri-” Agatha snorted at the onslaught but couldn’t get a word out through Rio’s attack. “Rio!”</p><p>“Because you MapQuested how far we’d be from each other next year. Because despite your mother, you’re nothing like her. Because you’re good.” Rio said, and sealed the promise with a kiss to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Rio hoped Agatha felt her love in that kiss, her honesty.</p><p>“I love you, too.” Agatha whispered against Rio’s lips, so faint that if she hadn’t been listening for it, she might never have heard it at all.</p><p>They had spent the entirety of their college careers an hour and nine minutes apart and never saw one another. Hell, post-college, they were still only two hours and some change away from one another.</p><p>Less than a hundred miles.</p><p>Four years later, Rio graduated with her degree and Agatha was married to Ralph with a kid on the way, working for her mother.</p><p>Another sixteen, and she was hanging that very same college degree on the wall of her classroom, which is gross, she had a fucking classroom. Wondering what could’ve been if they had stayed together through college. Would Rio have moved back to Westview with Agatha? Maybe become a teacher regardless?</p><p>Probably would’ve bought a cute little house with vaulted ceilings, and a garden out back with enough space for a swingset. Married Agatha, had a couple of kids, come home from work to the sounds of children’s happy screams and Agatha starting dinner. Helped the kids with their homework and poured Agatha a glass of wine when that homework inevitably gave her a headache. Kissed her and took care of the dishes as thanks for the meal. Put those kids to bed and drift off to sleep with her wife on her chest…</p><p>Oh yeah, and violently murder and dismember Evanora.</p><p>No, what the fuck was she thinking? She did not want suffocating domesticity, especially not with Agatha of all people.</p><p>Just because she and Agatha backslid into bed together did not mean anything, if it had, Agatha would’ve contacted her in the ten days that had passed since the reunion.</p><p>To be fair, Agatha doesn’t have her phone number.</p><p>But she does have her address.</p><p>And it’s been radio silence.</p><p>Was the sex bad? Is that why Agatha hadn’t called or come over? Like, did Agatha not enjoy it as much as it seemed like she did? That can’t be it, Rio was uncertain about a lot of things in life, but her ability to fuck Agatha was not one of them.</p><p>In those last ten days, Rio got her teaching certificate from a very sketchy looking online course, received her class schedule, and B.S.’d her way through several lesson plans. To top it all off, her classroom was in the old art wing that still had not been renovated since before the 90’s, the same one she had spent her days in as a teenager.</p><p>She considered backtracking and telling Lilia she changed her mind, but Lilia had guilted her into the position. Said that if Rio didn’t take over these classes, then they wouldn’t run, and Lilia was too busy to handle any independent studies. So, Rio agreed. She needed the money anyways, property tax is definitely a fucking scam and not fucking cheap.</p><p>Rio turned to survey her classroom, it was as cute as she could make a giant off-white rectangular room. She had put up those calming light covers, the ones that looked like a cloudy sunset. If she was going to be in the place five days a week, the fucking fluorescent lights had to go, or at the very least be muted. She hung different art prints along the brick wall, and brought in as many plants as she could physically fit in her car. She already hated the job, but she’d do everything in her power to make it bearable, including surrounding herself with foliage.</p><p>“I love what you’ve done with the place.” Lilia glided in.</p><p>Rio’s new classroom was Lilia’s old classroom since it had the darkroom attached to it.</p><p>“I think it looks like a prison cell masquerading as an art room.” Rio said in disdain, eyeing the ugly linoleum floors.</p><p>“Honey, that's all the art rooms.” Lilia grumbled.</p><p>“First day of school tomorrow, get excited ladies!” Mrs. Davis poked her head in the room before continuing down the hall.</p><p>“Holy shit, she’s still alive?” Rio had assumed she would’ve long since been dead.</p><p>“Yup, and she refuses to retire.” She said, “Hey, how are things with you and the girlfriend?”</p><p>Lilia refused to stop referring to Agatha as her girlfriend even though Rio kept denying it.</p><p>“Not great.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“That can’t be true.”</p><p>And she was tired, and bitter, and Lilia caught her at a bad time.</p><p>“You want the truth? Fine, here it is.” Rio turned her body to fully face Lilia, her back now to the door. “I haven’t heard from her in a week and a half, my hand is still fucked, and according to you her kid is apparently in my class. Do you know what that means, Lilia? It means I decked one parent of my student, and screwed the other.”</p><p>“Honey,” Lilia tried to interject.</p><p>“No, and here’s the worst part; I still want her. We dated in high school, and I genuinely fucking loved her. But then she smashed my heart into a million pieces, so now when I look at her all I feel is this longing. Longing for a future I might’ve had, one where I’d be happier. Maybe I still could be happy if Agatha ever got her head out of her ass! Maybe Agatha could be happy too if she just grew a fucking backbone!” Oh, she was spiraling. “But I can’t see or talk to her because I don’t have her address or her fucking number! So now I’m just left pining and confused, and god, it feels good to finally be able to vent to somebody about this.” Rio finished.</p><p>Lilia stayed silent.</p><p>“C’mon, oh wise Sicilian matchmaker, tell me what to do, gimme some advice.” Rio goaded.</p><p>“You could’ve just asked Wanda for my number.” She heard the voice of her ex say.</p><p>The universe hated her.</p><p>Rio turned around, and saw Agatha standing there in her doorway looking pissed. She was holding a very expensive looking plant and wearing a button up, slacks, and heels.</p><p>Damnit, she looked hot.</p><p>Agatha started walking in. “Or Alice, or Jen, or Mrs. Calderu,” Agatha pointed to Lilia.  “Or you could’ve looked it up in the school directory which I’m sure you have access to now.”</p><p>“How are you, dear?” Lilia asked with a smile.</p><p>“Been better.” Agatha bit out and kept eye contact with Rio.</p><p>“Okay, well that’s my cue to leave. You kids try not to kill each other.” Lilia muttered as she left the room and swung the door closed behind her.</p><p>“Why didn’t you reach out to me?” Rio asked as soon as Lilia was out of ear shot.</p><p>“That’s what I was doing right now. You fucking told Lilia?” Agatha hissed.</p><p>“No.” Rio was taken aback. “I wouldn’t do that.”</p><p>Agatha set the plant down on Rio’s desk and gave a solemn chuckle. “Right.”</p><p>What the fuck was that for?</p><p>“Lilia figured it out. I’d never out you, Agatha.”</p><p>Without missing a beat, Agatha striked. “Why not? You did twenty years ago.”</p><p>So now she was trying to manipulate Rio? Replace real memories with whatever lie served her?</p><p>“Does it ever get tiring?” Rio asked, voice sharp as a blade.</p><p>“What?” She barked.</p><p>“The stories you tell to make yourself feel better.”</p><p>“Fuck you!”</p><p>“No one in history has gotten special treatment from me the way you did. The way you still do! I’m a grown woman having a love affair with my closeted ex.”</p><p>Rio would never put up with half that shit that Agatha did if she were anyone else.</p><p>“You call what you did ‘special treatment’?” Agatha’s voice was cold. “All you did was push and demand.”</p><p>And sure, Rio had pushed for Agatha to come out, numerous times. But she never told anyone.</p><p>“I pushed because you were suffocating in that closet, Agatha! You still are! All because you’re so fucking terrified of your mother!”</p><p>Rio hoped that Agatha felt her rage in her voice, her anguish.</p><p>“Stop!” Agatha demanded and looked like Rio’s words may as well have been an actual physical blow.</p><p>No, she didn’t get to play the victim when she was the instigator in the first place.</p><p>“You hide me because you’re nothing more than a scared little girl with mommy issues.” Her tone venomous.</p><p>“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Don’t I? You’re still living a lie because you’re desperate for your mother’s approval.”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw. “Good thing my life is of no concern to you anymore.” She turned towards the door. “I trust that our relationship won’t interfere with my son’s education.”</p><p>And of course she was running, she always fucking ran when things got hard.</p><p>“Are you fucking serious?” Rio was stunned that it was that easy for her. That their relationship and what they had done ten days ago meant so little to Agatha, she had no problem just cutting the cord right then and there.</p><p>“Goodbye, Miss Vidal.” Agatha didn’t look back as she uttered it.</p><p>She stormed out, slamming the door behind her. Rio heard the receding of her heels click-clacking down the hall, getting further and further away.</p><p>Twenty years ago she would’ve chased after Agatha, professed her undying love to the woman. Twenty years ago she’d break down and cry over something like that. Twenty years ago she’d beg for Agatha to reconsider.</p><p>But now, she just felt numb.</p><p>Agatha would always choose her mother, her reputation, her social standing, everything over Rio.</p><p>Rio could wait around for centuries, and Agatha would still never choose her.</p>

<p>‘No, and here’s the worst part; I still want her.’</p><p>It ran through Agatha’s head on a loop.</p><p>‘I still want her.’<br/>
‘I still want her.’<br/>
‘I still want her.’</p><p>Rio had said it without knowing Agatha was there, so she had no reason to lie.</p><p>‘I still want her.’</p><p>She fucking willed her brain to shut off as she exited the school and got in her car. She went to put the key in the ignition, but her hands were shaking. She hadn’t noticed. How long had they been shaking?</p><p>And her breathing, it was-</p><p>She couldn’t fucking catch her breath, her lungs weren’t functioning.</p><p>Why was her vision blurry? She lifted a few trembling fingers to her face to wipe whatever was hindering her from being able to see, and-</p><p>Tears.</p><p>When had she started fucking crying?</p><p>‘I pushed because you were suffocating in that closet, Agatha! You still are! All because you’re so fucking terrified of your mother!’</p><p>Agatha threw her head back and looked up at the roof of the car, trying to blink back whatever tears she’d produced.</p><p>Jesus, she needed air and her body wasn’t intaking any.</p><p>‘You hide me because you’re nothing more than a scared little girl with mommy issues.’</p><p>Her chest weighed a thousand fucking pounds right now, she was sure of it. Every muscle in her body was tensed, her lungs were being held in chokehold by her ribcage.</p><p>‘Longing for a future I might’ve had, one where I’d be happier.’</p><p>She was going to lobotomize herself if this damn organ in her skull didn’t stop thinking about what just happened with Rio. She ended it, things were over. Rio was free despite some initial pain. It was better this way, Rio just didn’t know  it. And if Agatha just kept her shit together, then Rio would never know.</p><p>‘Maybe Agatha could be happy too if she just grew a fucking backbone!’</p><p>Through her hyperventilation, Agatha knew Rio was right, she would be happier.</p><p>She’d be happy, period.</p><p>‘I still want her.’</p><p>She wanted Rio too.</p><p>But there was too much. Too much baggage. Too much to apologize for. Too much to say. Too much time wasted.</p><p>And her fucking mother.</p><p>‘You’re still living a lie because you’re desperate for your mother’s approval.’</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Agatha had lost any chance at her mother’s approval in the spring of 2005, when she confronted-</p><p>Her hands, which she didn’t fully recognize she was in control of, had been banging against the steering wheel.</p><p>Quite violently, if the pain and the redness were any indication.</p><p>And they were still fucking shaking.</p><p>Agatha had a reason for living this lie, but her mother’s approval was not it.</p><p>Her cheeks were seeped with tears, her breath was shallow, her hands were basically fucking vibrating.</p><p>She needed something else, soothing thoughts.</p><p>‘But I just wanted to say it because I mean it. I love you.’</p><p>She sniffled, taking deep breaths. Her lungs opened.</p><p>‘Because of all the quiet parts of you, the ones you don’t let people see.’</p><p>She balled her hands into fists, grounding herself.</p><p>‘Because despite your mother, you’re nothing like her.’</p><p>She wiped her cheeks of any stray moisture.</p><p>‘Because you’re good.’</p><p>She wasn’t, but she could pretend if it meant she calmed down.</p><p>With one final sniffle, Agatha started her luxury sedan and made her way home.</p><p>After a full day at work, seeing and then subsequently crushing Rio, and a panic attack in the parking lot of her old high school; Agatha was ready to crash. She’d throw in a frozen pizza for dinner, open a bottle of wine, and sneak a cigarette after Nicky had gone to bed.</p><p>It was just before 6pm when she walked in her front door, she heard Nicky’s voice carrying from the living room. Seeing as it was the last day of summer, Agatha assumed he was playing some stupid video game with Billy and Tommy. But the absence of the TV made her stop and listen.</p><p>“Oil’s a bit more difficult, but anything’s better than acrylic. I also really like working with charcoal, but honestly, photography is my favorite.” He rambled to whomever he was speaking to.</p><p>From the time Nicky had fine motor skills, the kid had a crayon in his clutches. Agatha had no clue where he’d gotten his talent and skill for artistic pursuits.</p><p>Yeah, Agatha was high school valedictorian and graduated from an ivy with honors, but she also couldn’t draw a fucking stick figure if there was a gun pointed to her head.</p><p>And Ralph was worse because he only barely graduated from University of New Jersey-Westview, and couldn’t comprehend the damn color wheel.</p><p>She always liked to think that despite how science fucking works, she was able to slip a little bit of Rio into Nicky’s genetics.</p><p>“Have you thought about what you want to study in college, Nicholas?”</p><p>Fuck, she knew that voice.</p><p>Evanora.</p><p>“I was thinking about something in photography or film.” Nicky replied, sounding optimistic.</p><p>“My boy, those would be a waste of time and more importantly, money. You’ll study something useful, like business or marketing.” Evanora told rather than suggested.</p><p>Her mother mainly worked and lived in New York now. Harkness Inc. had expanded across the entire eastern seaboard; they had development properties in every one of the original thirteen colonies. It was decided years ago that Evanora would travel state to state as needed while Agatha ran things from homebase in Westview.</p><p>Doesn’t mean that the bitch still didn’t pop up out of nowhere from time to time, though.</p><p>Anyways, she was now on a mission to save her son from the dream crushing reality of his grandmother.</p><p>She hauled ass down the hall into the living room, not even bothering to take off her heels, practiced smile already plastered on.</p><p>“Mother, I thought I heard you.” Agatha greeted in a measured tone.</p><p>Evanora rose off the couch from where she was speaking with Nicky. “Well, I thought I’d swing by,” She was putting on her soft voice, the one she always did in front of Nicky. “I haven’t seen my daughter or grandson since Christmas.”</p><p>Yeah, she was aware, and it had been so nice.</p><p>“I was just showing Nana my portfolio from last year.” Nicky beamed, the various photos and prints secured in a leather folder.</p><p>“Yes, it’s quite impressive, the skill Nicholas displays.” Evanora said, looking at Nicky, then snapping her gaze at Agatha. “All things considered.”</p><p>That dig told Agatha what she already expected, Evanora was pissed at her for something. What that was, who the hell knows. What she did know, is that her mother was here to either slap, threaten, or scream at Agatha. Although she hadn’t hit Agatha in years, she was old now, frail even.</p><p>So easy to push down a flight of stairs.</p><p>No, no matricide.</p><p>“Is there something you’re here for, in particular?” Agatha casually asked.</p><p>“Let’s speak in your study.” She said, striding to the other side of the first floor of the house, where Agatha’s home office was located.</p><p>Agatha quickly ran her hand through her son’s hair, giving it a ruffle.  “Be right back, hon.”</p><p>And it killed her that he even knew she was in trouble, she could see it on his face. “Everything okay?”</p><p>She gave a sad smile. “Grown up stuff, nothing to worry about.” Agatha soothed.</p><p>Each time her mother did this, it felt like a death march. The last time this happened, it was when Agatha had divorced Ralph. That day, Evanora had yelled to the point where her voice gave out. Agatha only remembers thinking ‘finally’.</p><p>She closed the door to her office and turned to her mother. “What is it?”</p><p>Evanora was standing at the large wooden desk, nonchalantly picking up different pieces of paperwork Agatha had left out. “Your friend is back.” She muttered without looking up.</p><p>She knew her mother would find out eventually, Rio had moved back almost a month ago.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha said cautiously.</p><p>“Have you seen her?”</p><p>And Agatha knew what she meant, she was asking if Agatha had seen Rio…biblically.</p><p>Which, fucking duh.</p><p>“Nope.” She lied breezily.</p><p>“Keep it that way.” Evanora finally looked up, burrowing a hole through her daughter. “Same incentive still stands.”</p><p>She wanted to laugh at the use of the word ‘incentive’, it was extortion.</p><p>So threaten it was.</p><p>“You know I could fuck any woman, right? It’s not just Rio.”</p><p>“She’s the only one that makes you delusional enough to think you should tell people about your…proclivities.”</p><p>Yeah because she was the only one, period. Agatha had been so traumatized after high school, she had seldom one-night stands throughout college before settling down into a life of performed heterosexuality. She never let another woman close to her, not like Rio.</p><p>”You’re referring to my lesbianism, yes?” She was goading Evanora and they both knew it.</p><p>Maybe it was how crass she had been, her language, maybe it was her speaking Rio’s name or the term ‘lesbian’. Either way, Evanora tilted her hand, showing her cards.</p><p>“Did you know she’s four months behind on the mortgage of the pathetic little house that’s now in her name?” Evanora rounded the desk and approached Agatha.</p><p>Ah fuck, there it is.</p><p>“I can assure that you did since I checked the financial history of that property. Her mother fell behind on the mortgage two separate times over the last twenty years.” She cocked her head. “And yet each time, she miraculously caught up. A mysterious benefactor, an act of god, a concerned neighbor…” Evanora trailed off, knowing she’d caught her daughter red-handed.</p><p>Which, yes, Agatha had anonymously paid the mortgage on the Vidal’s house once or twice over the decades. But only because she knew how much that place meant to Rio, to Rio’s mom. Turns out, banks don’t care who’s paying the bill, as long as it’s paid. And Agatha didn’t check often, just like every six months for the past twenty years. They owned a development company, looking up what houses were about to be foreclosed on was part of the business. They knew before the homeowners did. Not entirely ethical, but neither is artificially inflating the price of housing for profit.</p><p>“So, whether it’s that girl,” She said ‘girl’ like it was a placeholder for the slur that she considered herself too classy to utter. “Or any other. I will not hesitate to pull some strings.”</p><p>Agatha knew she could do it too. She had connections across the east coast, someone had to be morally bankrupt enough to comply with her mother.</p><p>“I also hear she’s teaching at Westview High now, it’d be so unfortunate if she was fired  when she’s already drowning in debt.”</p><p>The thing about Evanora Harkness was, she didn’t stop once a scorched-earth policy was initiated.</p><p>“She’s lucky her mother died, less leverage.” Evanora smiled, but it was vacant of any empathy, just like always. “So, are we clear, Agatha?”</p><p>Those five words brought her back to her childhood bedroom, sobbing for her mother to let her keep Rio. She still remembers the way she begged. How her mother didn’t even flinch at the pain she was inflicting.</p><p>Her answer was the same then as it was now, fucking beaten into submission. “Yes, mother.”</p><p>“Wonderful.” Evanora brushed by her daughter, opening the door. “Always such a treat to catch up.”</p><p>Agatha just stood there, paralyzed. She heard her mother say a farewell to Nicky, playing the sweet doting grandmother.</p><p>The front door clicked shut, and she finally caved, her shoulder hunching, her eyes welling. She bit her lip to muffle any sounds.</p><p>It was the same deal they’d made twenty years ago.</p><p>Agatha’s silence for Rio’s quality of life.</p><p>She’d held up her end of the bargain. Married well enough, worked for the family business, stayed in the closet.</p><p>Unfortunately, that also meant making Rio hate her.</p><p>And ‘hating’ Rio in return.</p><p>She had gone to see Rio today hoping against hope that they’d reconcile, even though that was clearly a pipedream.</p><p>Fuck, she needed that cigarette now.</p><p>Steadying her voice, she called out to Nicky. “Hey, hon, could you preheat the oven? I’m thinking we do pizza tonight.”</p><p>“Sure, ma!” He replied.</p><p>She found her purse, grabbed the pack, and sat on the steps of her front porch.</p><p>The smoke burned in a way that she needed, but it wasn’t enough, maybe she’d chief on her pen when the coast was clear late tonight and slump into a self-induced coma. She could work from home tomorrow.</p><p>The front door creaked open, producing her son. She tried to hide what she was doing, but Nicky wasn’t dumb.</p><p>“I know you smoke, mom.” He said playfully, sitting down next to her.</p><p>“Just cigarettes, occasionally.” Agatha quipped, smirking. There had been a few incidents of Nicky finding her stash.</p><p>“Right.” He smiled.</p><p>Nicky let out a deep breath. “I hate the way she treats you.”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-puff. “You heard that?” Her eyes bugged.</p><p>“I didn’t have to.”</p><p>Oh thank god, she’s not ready to have the gay mom talk with her son.</p><p>He continued. “I see how you act around her, you’re like, not actually you.”</p><p>This child was going to be the death of her, he was breaking her heart.</p><p>“Your grandmother and I, we-” How to put this, “We-” C’mon think. “Our relationship is just complicated.” Not the worst she could do on the fly.</p><p>“Doesn’t seem complicated, just seems like she’s hard on you.”</p><p>Understating it, but-</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha choked out, ashing her cigarette.</p><p>“For what it’s worth, I think you’re doing great.” His big brown eyes and his lopsided smile were like a balm to her internal injuries. “What happened to your hands?” He asked, looking down at the bruises now forming from Agatha’s earlier tantrum.</p><p>She took a drag. “Kid, you ask too many questions.” And nudged him. “I love you.”</p><p>The only good thing about Agatha, was Nicky. How she raised him.</p><p>“I love you too.” He leaned into his mother’s side.</p><p>They stayed there for a minute in comfortable silence.</p><p>She put out her cigarette and looked at her son.</p><p>“Did you preheat the oven?”</p><p>Nicky thought for a moment before realizing he definitely hadn’t.</p><p>“Oh, shit.”</p>

<p>Rio was topless, her back against the bed, grinding against her girlfriend's thigh. Her very beautiful, and very horny girlfriend. Agatha was hovering over her, the Ralph Lauren polo she had been wearing long since discarded, leaving her in a lacy white bra.</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon and the house was empty, so naturally Agatha came over under the guise of ‘studying’ together. That lasted all of about twenty minutes before Agatha stuck her tongue down Rio’s throat and basically mounted her. Not that she was complaining, she’d take anything her girlfriend offered. They hadn’t had sex, but they had done everything else, and suddenly Rio understood the completely made up concept of blue balls. Because they had gotten so close so many times, and yet each time they never crossed that line.</p><p>The exposed thigh tensed, and the feeling of it mixed with friction of her jeans was making Rio tremble. Thank god for the return of March, and consequently, the return of Agatha’s inappropriately short skirts.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned, she felt Agatha smile against her neck where she had been kissing, waiting to strike before biting. “No hickies, Wanda asked me about the last one.”</p><p>“What’d you tell her?” Agatha taunted, hands palming Rio’s breasts.</p><p>“Curling iron.” She huffed, rolling her hips faster.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “And she believed that?” Moving her mouth down over Rio’s collarbone, down her sternum.</p><p>“Not a fucking chance.” Rio’s giggle quickly dissolved into breathy sounds when she felt Agatha’s mouth lavishing her tits. “Fuck, baby-”</p><p>She pulled back and looked down at Rio, her eyes were flooded with lust, but also something else. Something sweeter. She was suddenly shy, unsure.</p><p>“Can I go down on you?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes nearly popped out of her head. “You think I’m going to say no?!”</p><p>“Well what if I suck at it?” Agatha looked so concerned.</p><p>“Not that I’ve ever done it, but I think the whole point is to suck.” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Smartass.” Agatha grumbled and made a move for the button of her jeans.</p><p>This was finally it, she wouldn’t die a virgin, she’d have sex with her fucking goddess of a girlfriend. Her girlfriend who loved her, who she loved so much in return.</p><p>The couple seconds of anticipation as Agatha worked at the zipper were the best of her young life, nothing could ruin it.</p><p>“Cariño, ¡ya estoy en casa!” Her mom’s voice bellowed through the house as she heard the front door close and keys hit the coffee table.</p><p>Okay, that fucking ruined it.</p><p>They both froze, looking at one another in horror.</p><p>“I thought you said she was at work!” Agatha whisper-yelled, getting up and searching for her top.</p><p>“She was supposed to be!” Rio shouted back in a hushed tone, securing her jeans closed again. Fuck, they were so close, Rio had been so close. Her own mom; cock-blocking her.</p><p>“Here!” Agatha threw Rio’s chopped-up Bikini Kill t-shirt at her while she pulled on that stupid fucking polo.</p><p>“I got off early!” Her mom’s voice was getting closer.</p><p>Yeah and Rio hadn’t gotten off at all, god damnit.</p><p>She scrambled, fixing her clothes and hair, trying to make it look like she hadn’t been seconds away from letting Agatha steal her virtue.</p><p>“Do you think I have time to make a run for it?” Agatha was pulling on her shoes, looking like a teenage boy who’d just been caught with the town preacher’s daughter.</p><p>“She’s not going to bust in here with a shotgun! Just act fucking normal!”</p><p>Her mom emerged through the once closed door, still in her scrubs, hair tied up. Her eyes first landed on her daughter before gliding over to the stranger standing right next to Rio. Her face scrunched, waiting for an explanation.</p><p>“Mom, this is Agatha. We-” She couldn’t say the truth, so she lied right to her mother’s face. “Go to school together.”</p><p>Her mom looked between the two before smiling.</p><p>“Hi, Miss Vidal.” Agatha gave an awkward wave, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Okay, so she wasn’t acting normal, great.</p><p>“Oh nonsense, call me Victoria, Miss Vidal makes me sound a hundred.” She immediately threw her arms around Agatha. “It’s so nice to meet one of Rio’s friends, she never has friends.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“I have friends!” Rio defended.</p><p>“You have that one creepy ginger who barely comes around anymore.” Victoria joked. She ended the hug, but kept her hands resting on Agatha’s shoulders. “Ella es muy bonita.” She told Rio.</p><p>“¡Mamá!” Rio scolded, dropping her now bright red face into her hands.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“¿Tú hablas español?” Victoria asked, surprised.</p><p>“Um, solo un poco.” Agatha proudly replied.</p><p>Rio didn’t expect her mother and girlfriend interacting to make her feel so mushy, but the hugging and spanish was not helping.</p><p>“So you’re pretty and speak spanish?” Victoria let go of Agatha, turning to her daughter. “¿Por qué no estás saliendo con ella?”</p><p>“Mamá, Agatha is straight.” Another lie. “And she understands what you’re saying.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“Are you the Harkness’ daughter?” Her mom asked, clearly unbothered.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said, looking slightly ashamed.</p><p>“Your mother is a real piece of work.”</p><p>God, Rio wanted to crawl into a hole and die of embarrassment.</p><p>“You say you want to meet my friends and then you insult their family.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t seem offended. “No, it’s alright, your mom’s right.”</p><p>“Are you staying for dinner?”</p><p>“Uh, no, I don’t think-” Her girlfriend began.</p><p>But Rio knew her mom. “Absolutely not, you’re staying. Do you like pork?”</p><p>Agatha was clearly thrown off. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“Perfect, I’m making pasteles, give me an hour.” Victoria announced, leaving the room, presumably for the kitchen.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio breathed out. “She’s a lot.”</p><p>Agatha was smiling. “I like her. She’s cool.”</p><p>“No, she’s not.”</p><p>“She is, maybe cooler than you.”</p><p>Rio pushed her tongue against her cheek, suppressing a grin. “You wound me, my love.”</p><p>“You’ll live.”</p><p>And an hour later, Rio sat at the kitchen table with her mom and her girlfriend, who weirdly got along. Her mom was so much warmer than her, she just had a way with people. Victoria was generous, charming, funny. There was no one that she couldn’t make like her.</p><p>“Princeton?” Victoria praised after asking Agatha where she was going next year. “Your parents must be so proud!”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Agatha politely agreed. “But it’s nowhere near as impressive as Rio going to NYU, she’s really talented.”</p><p>Rio wanted to giggle and blush, twirl a lock of hair around her finger.</p><p>“Oh, I know. When she was five, I gave her a disposable camera to keep her distracted and after an hour she asked me to ‘fix’ it so she could take more photos.”</p><p>No, not baby stories. “Mom-”</p><p>But Agatha was entertained. “Hush.” She pointed at Rio and kept her head towards Victoria. “Go on.”</p><p>“So I bought her another, then another, and so on.” She chuckled. “I tried to revert her back to coloring books, but they were old news by then. Even though most of the photos she took were just of her stuffed animals or her own face.”</p><p>“Please tell me you have these photos!” Agatha shouted.</p><p>And of course she did, little Rio in a plastic princess crown, blinding herself with the flash. She sprawled them out on the table and Agatha held them like they were gold.</p><p>“I knew it was special from then on, I’m so proud of her.” Victoria said.</p><p>Rio wonders if her mom would still be proud now, twenty years later. Sitting in a classroom at seven in the morning, having just been crushed by that very pretty Harkness girl for a second time the day before.</p><p>She rested her elbows on the desk and stared at the plant Agatha had brought her. Definitely some sort of Monstera, definitely a few hundred dollars. She thought about letting it die as an act of revenge, but she couldn’t punish the poor innocent plant for the sins of her sociopathic ex.</p><p>She mulled over the list of students in her black and white photography class, looking for which one could be Agatha’s kid. She wanted to remain impartial, she didn’t ask Lilia the kid’s name or any other identifying information. Rio didn’t even know the kid was a boy until Agatha said her ‘son’s education’ last night. But no, curiosity got the best of her, her finger trailing down the list of names.</p><p>Huh, no student with the last name Bohner, which phenomenal fucking call on Agatha’s part, but also no Harkness.</p><p>Maybe he dropped the class?</p><p>There was only one period where black and white photography ran, and it was only taught by Rio. So maybe he changed his mind, or maybe Agatha forced him to withdraw.</p><p>At least it makes things easier, not having to spend five days a week with a walking, talking reminder of Rio’s resentment towards her ex.</p><p>Plus, if the kid had any of Ralph’s genetics, he’d probably be an obnoxious jock just looking to get an easy A on his report card before fucking off to an ivy where he’d be a frat president.</p><p>An hour later, the bell rang, and a bunch of teenagers flooded into Rio’s classroom. Rio was never particularly fond of teens, not even when she was one.</p><p>Also, she felt like an imposter, someone playing pretend teacher. She fucking hated authority her whole life and now she was in an authoritative role? Her eighteen year old self would judge her so hard right now.</p><p>She stood at the front of the classroom until everyone was seated, waiting to speak. She could do this, she just had to make it through today… and then all the other days until the end of the year. Stupid fucking bills.</p><p>Rio plastered on the fakest fucking smile of her life and projected her voice as if she had some semblance of how to do any of this teaching bullshit.</p><p>“Happy first day of school guys. I’m Miss Vidal and I’ll be your black and white photography teacher for the year.” She sounded perky, she never sounded fucking perky.</p><p>“RAW, NEXT QUESTION.” A student shouted from the back of the room. He had on one of those nauseating ‘Supreme’ shirts and looked so cocky, snickering after screaming it.</p><p>Fucking teenagers.</p><p>She did not have the patience for this today, or any day, really.</p><p>Rio dropped her smile and made her way to his desk. “What’s your name?”</p><p>The boy didn’t answer, just shrugged. Smug fucking prick.</p><p>Rio whipped her head over to where she remembers seeing a familiar face, Billy. He was sitting next to another boy with shaggy brown hair.</p><p>“Billy, what’s his name?” Rio’s voice was no longer perky.</p><p>“Um, Trent.” He piped up.</p><p>Rio scoffed, of course it was Trent.</p><p>She turned to the asshole, staring him down.</p><p>“Trent, did you think that was funny?”</p><p>He smirked. “Yeah, a lil.”</p><p>Okay, Rio was never meant to work with children. She was not tolerant enough for this shit. She placed her hands on his desk, getting down to eye level, her voice steady.</p><p>“Listen, you little prick,” His eyes went wide. “I suggest you drop this class, because I will flunk you…like, miserably. And then whatever sad little community college you’re applying to will laugh at the fact that you couldn’t even pass a fucking art class.”</p><p>“You can’t talk to me like that.” He insisted.</p><p>“Like what?” Rio feigned innocence. “Did anybody hear anything?” She asked the class.</p><p>All the students just shook their heads, agreeing they heard nothing. Good, at least she didn’t have to deal with any narcs.</p><p>“Why don’t you head down to the office, Trent, meet with your counselor about changing your schedule?” She phrased it as a question but it was an order.</p><p>He quickly got up and scurried out of the room. Rio made her way back up to the front. Well, she lasted one minute into the school year before letting the happy teacher facade fucking shatter.</p><p>“As I was saying, this course will focus specifically on film photography. You’ll learn how to use a film camera, develop your film, and proper shooting technique.” She spoke in her natural voice, leveling with these miscreants.</p><p>The rest of the class was mostly just handing out the syllabus, talking about assignments, going through the classwork. She handed out a study guide to the parts of a film camera for the kids to look at and get tested on before they got their cameras.</p><p>Billy whispered to the boy next to him. “We have to pass a quiz to get our cameras?”</p><p>“You gotta respect your equipment, dude.” The boy next to him whispered back. “You can study on mine after school.”</p><p>The bell rang and all the hooligans filed out, Rio sat down at her desk, letting out a sigh of relief before her freshman art class started after the passing period. Then Billy and the other boy approached her.</p><p>“Hey, Miss Vidal, I’m really looking forward to this class.” Billy excitedly told her.</p><p>Jesus christ, Wanda raised a suck-up.</p><p>“That’s great, Billy.” She deadpanned.</p><p>“Uh,” The other boy started. “I was wondering if I could bring in my own camera for the year?”</p><p>“You have your own?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I shoot on 400, will that work for the course? Or are we using 200?”</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>“How long have you been shooting?”</p><p>“Couple of years, but honestly, I’m just excited to use a real darkroom. My mom tried to convert our basement into one, but it’s not the same.” He smiled.</p><p>Rio smiled too, happy to have one student who didn’t have their head up their ass. “Valiant effort on your mom’s part, but yeah 400 works.”</p><p>He nodded. “Cool.” Him and Billy started turning to leave.</p><p>Wait, was her new favorite student’s name?</p><p>“Hey, kid.” Rio called after him.</p><p>“Yeah?” He swung around.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>“Nicholas, but everyone just calls me Nicky.”</p><p>“Bring in some of your work next time, Nicky.”</p><p>This kid fucking lit up. “Really?”</p><p>“Yeah, gotta make sure you’re not shit.” She sarcastically replied.</p><p>Billy chimed in. “You really can’t cuss.”</p><p>Suck-up.</p><p>“Billy, I swear to god, I will fuck your mom.” She wouldn’t, but the joke was right there.</p><p>His overlined eyes widened and his jaw dropped, Nicky snorted in a way that was eerily familiar.</p><p>“You can’t  just threaten to fuck peoples moms!” He whined.</p><p>Rio smoothed her face into a very serious expression. “Billy, language!”</p>

<p>When it first happened about halfway through September, Rio didn’t think anything of it. It was a new school year, kids can struggle to make friends, god knows she fucking did at their age. So if they wanted to hang out in her classroom during their free period or lunch, who was she to stop them?</p><p>Until it kept fucking happening.</p><p>Every day like clockwork, lunch started, Billy and Nicky were at her door. It wasn’t just them though, a couple of kids from each of her classes started showing up, all together there were probably seven or eight kids in her space, during her one fucking break in the day.</p><p>It was the last week in September when she finally snapped.</p><p>“Why are you always here?!” She exclaimed as she saw Billy and Nicky walk in.</p><p>“I wanna develop this roll.” Nicky proudly held up a film canister.</p><p>“I just go where he goes.” Billy shrugged.</p><p>“No, I don’t mean this specific time, I mean all the time. I see you guys when I teach first period, then fifth period because that’s yalls free period, and now lunch. Is nothing sacred?”</p><p>Nicky was already headed for the darkroom, Billy stayed there smiling like an idiot. “But it’s so cool to have an openly queer teacher.”</p><p>And Rio just wanted to be left alone and enjoy her god forsaken lunch, but since she couldn’t, she had to entertain herself.</p><p>“What makes you think I’m gay?” She asked, her face dead serious.</p><p>He suddenly looked unsure. “You said you’d fuck my mom on the first day of school.”</p><p>“Still could, so?”</p><p>“You played Doechii in the darkroom yesterday!”</p><p>“Yeah, under the one condition that you’d never mention it.”</p><p>She was fairly certain the administration would frown upon such explicit music rotting the minds of Westview’s best and brightest.</p><p>“Your spotify history is all lesbians! Chappell, Renee, Arlo Parks!” He defended.</p><p>Rio often played music during work time, her laptop screen displayed on the projector.</p><p>“Plenty of straight women love Good Luck, Babe.” God, this kid was too easy to fuck with.</p><p>“You dress like a lesbian!”</p><p>“I dress like an art teacher.” Rio shot back, pulling on the collar of her oversized button up.</p><p>His eyes were wide, manic almost. “Same thing! You only ever wear docs,”</p><p>“They’re versatile.”</p><p>“And you have short nails,”</p><p>“Easier to load film.”</p><p>“And you grip your iced coffee like your hand is a claw!”</p><p>“Don’t judge my dexterity.” She tried sounding earnest and she can’t believe this kid bought it.</p><p>He took a minute to think. “You have a gay face.” Like it was obvious.</p><p>“Jesus, I heard that enough in high school.”</p><p>He jumped and pointed. “Ha! You are gay!”</p><p>“Your investment in this is concerning.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“Miss Vidal? Could you come here for a sec?” Nicky shouted from the darkroom.</p><p>Rio grumbled, but she got up from her desk.</p><p>Over the past month, she’d taken a liking to Nicky. He weirdly reminded her of herself when she was his age, minus the unbridled rage. The very next day after Rio had asked him to bring in some of his work, the kid slapped a leather bound portfolio on her desk at eight in the morning.</p><p>Between the type of camera he had, and the custom fucking formatting of his portfolio, Rio knew one thing; his parents were fucking rich. Not comfortable or well-off, no, rich.</p><p>Maybe it was her trauma talking, but Rio hated rich people. Still, she gave Nicky a chance, she was an educator or some shit now after all. And she had to admit, the kid was good.</p><p>He still had a lot to learn, but for being self taught, Nicky was talented in an almost annoying way. He had the eye, the ambition, the fucking optimism.</p><p>“What?” Rio said as she reached Nicky in the darkroom.</p><p>“I fucked it.” Nicky held up his photograph that was, in fact, fucked.</p><p>She chuckled.</p><p>“What’d I do? The bath was right, the roll wasn’t prematurely exposed…”</p><p>“Gimme your camera.” She held out her hand and he swiftly gave it over. “Is this what you had your settings at when you took the photo?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Okay well, your exposure is way too high for the lighting.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Rio fiddled more with the camera, “You might’ve been better off using 800.” She turned it around when she saw it. In the corner of the camera, engraved clear as fucking day, ‘N.S.’.</p><p>Cruel coincidence on the world’s part.</p><p>“Damnit.” Nicky muttered, scrunching up the photo and tossing it in the garbage in frustration.</p><p>“Hey, man, it’s not that serious.” She awkwardly comforted.</p><p>“I keep fucking up this one print.”</p><p>Rio smiled, she couldn’t count how many meltdowns she had in this darkroom. Over a print or a girl.</p><p>“Kid, that’s all this is,” She held up his camera. “Fucking up until something sticks.”</p><p>He huffed out a laugh. “That’s awful.”</p><p>“Yeah, and you choose to do it.” Rio raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Then he just stared at her, like he was trying to place her.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face. “What?”</p><p>Nicky seemingly snapped back to reality. “Sorry, sometimes you just look so familiar.”</p><p>“Well you don’t.” She deadpanned and handed the camera back, her phone in her back pocket started buzzing. “Just take a break, you’re not getting any further when you’re already discouraged.”</p><p>Rio left the darkroom, answering her phone and sitting back down at her desk. Billy was still there, messing with his phone.</p><p>“You’re a bad friend.” Wanda greeted through the phone.</p><p>“Wanda,” Billy perked up hearing Rio, and she couldn’t not take the opportunity. “Babe, what’s up?” The twink in front of her widened his eyes.</p><p>“My birthday was yesterday and I heard nothing from you.” Her tone was joking.</p><p>“I’m sorry, happy birthday.” Rio acquiesced.</p><p>“Well, I suppose you can make it up to me…” Oh whatever she was about to tell her was not going to be good. “By coming out to my birthday girl's night.”</p><p>“Yeah, no fucking way.”</p><p>“You owe me!”</p><p>“Wands, as much as I’d love to spend a night with you.” She knew Billy would crawl at that. “I’m not that much of a masochist.”</p><p>“Fuck you, you’re coming.” Wanda pressed. “I haven’t seen you since the reunion and it’s my birthday.”</p><p>“Who do the girls entail?”</p><p>“Alice and Jen, obviously.” Do not say it, do not say who Rio knew she was going to say. “And Agatha.”</p><p>There it was.</p><p>“So the three bitches who I hate most?”</p><p>Wanda giggled. “Alice said you and her were cool, by extension so are you and Jen. And I figured after you slogged Ralph, you and Agatha had worked out your shit.”</p><p>Oh, this ginger had no clue how their shit was very much not worked out.</p><p>“Wanda…”</p><p>“Please?” Rio could hear her pout through the phone. “For the birthday girl? I’m thirty-nine, that’s so old!”</p><p>“Bitch, we’re the same age. That’s not old.”</p><p>“So, you’re coming?”</p><p>“Never said that.”</p><p>“So Friday?”</p><p>“Uggggghh, fine.” She grumbled.</p><p>“Perfect, I’ll text you.” And just like that, Wanda was gone, call over.</p><p>Rio flung her phone on her desk.</p><p>“Are you actually fucking my mom?” Billy squeaked, face twisted in worry.</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>The next few days passed, pretty uneventfully. But Rio was vibrating with nerves at the thought of seeing Agatha again. It was inevitable, of course, but she had convinced herself she could avoid it forever.</p><p>So, Friday came, and Rio was finishing up grading at her desk after school. Some of these kids were fucking inept, or lazy, or both, probably just lazy. Nicky was hanging out, arranging and rearranging his portfolio while sitting on his desk. Not at, on.</p><p>“Okay, kid. It’s almost five, I unfortunately have places to be so I gotta kick you out.” Rio stuffed the work into her desk drawer, she wasn’t looking at that shit again until Monday.</p><p>He solemnly looked up. “Ten more minutes?”</p><p>Rio stood, collecting her bag and walking over. “Nicky, you could do that at home.”</p><p>“I don’t wanna go home.” He quietly said.</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“It’s Friday.”</p><p>“Astute observation.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“On Friday’s I have to go to my dad’s.”</p><p>“Your parents are divorced?” No wonder he’s artsy and angsty..</p><p>“Yeah, thank god.”</p><p>“Yikes.” She hissed.</p><p>“I remember, when they first got divorced, I was eleven. It was my first weekend at his shitty apartment, and I had this stuffed rabbit that I was probably too old for; Señor Scratchy.” He gave a bitter smile.</p><p>“Señor?”</p><p>“I called him mister scratchy, but my mom speaks a little spanish and was trying to teach me, and I don’t know, Señor stuck.” Nicky said. “But I was at his place and by the end of the weekend, I lost the rabbit. And my dad…he didn’t even look for it. Just pawned me off on my mom.”</p><p>“Did you ever find Señor Scratchy?” She didn't realize she was actually invested until she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. “Nope. But my mom chewed him out, like, everyday for a year about it.”</p><p>“So, I take it we don’t like your dad?”</p><p>“He’s…” Nicky trailed off. “Kind of a dick.”</p><p>She laughed. “I’ve heard that about dads, never had one myself, but I can imagine.”</p><p>“Anyways, once I go home, I have to pack an overnight bag. And he’ll ask me about school once before we fall into an unbearable silence for the rest of the weekend.”</p><p>“You can’t just stay with your mom?”</p><p>“Nope, he’ll make it a thing with the custody agreement. He doesn’t even want to spend time with me, just wants to punish my mom.”</p><p>Fuck, that’s depressing.</p><p>“Okay, c’mon, let’s go.” Rio waved him off the desk. He slipped the prints into his backpack and started walking. She placed her hand on his back as they walked out. Was it weird to touch him? Dammit, she hadn’t even thought about it before she did it. “On the bright side, you’re an adult in like two years and then you can tell your dad to go fuck himself!” She mock comforted.</p><p>For the first time all day, Nicky cracked a real smile. “Your words are truly inspirational. You’ve definitely found your calling as a teacher.” He quipped as they walked down the hall together.</p><p>Once she got home, Rio showered and got ready. Wanda had texted her the bar and the time, so now she had to figure out what to wear. What does one wear to birthday drinks with high school enemies and her evil fucking ex? Something slutty?</p><p>Definitely something slutty.</p><p>She dug around in her closet until she found a slinky black dress that had gotten thorough use in New York. Lovingly deemed her ‘fuck me’ dress. She pulled on some matching heels and took a deep breath.</p><p>It’d be fine. Everything would be fine. Worst comes to worst, she gets blackout drunk and spends her weekend immobile.</p><p>Rio arrived at the bar, and, huh-</p><p>A gay bar.</p><p>Smack dab in the midpoint between Eastview and Westview.</p><p>Through the crowd, she found Wanda at a high-top table with Alice and Jen, sans Agatha. Good, enough time to down a few in preparation.</p><p>“Happy not your birthday!” Rio said as she approached, hugging Wanda.</p><p>“Thank you!” She smiled and pulled back.</p><p>“Why a gay bar?” She shouted over the music.</p><p>“Why the hell not?” Jen chimed in.</p><p>Rio looked at a cheery Jen and her wife. Alice didn’t meet Rio’s eyes, her gaze darting around.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>“Hey, why does my son think we're having an extramarital affair?” Wanda asked.</p><p>So in addition to being a suck-up, Billy was also a narc.</p><p>She shrugged. “No clue.”</p><p>“Well whatever you’re doing, Billy loves you. He gushes about your class every day.”</p><p>Rio was going to respond when she felt the air shift, something darker in the atmosphere. She whipped her head around, and yup, she knew it.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>She was wearing this silk halter top thing and the jeans- no. Nope. Rio was not going to drool over her. Not anymore. Fuck her. In the figurative sense, not literal.</p><p>“I’m gonna get a drink.” She hastily excused herself in the opposite direction of where Agatha was walking.</p><p>She sidled up to the bar, grabbing the attention of the bartender. “Tequila.”</p><p>The bartender just looked at her. “Tequila…?”</p><p>“Just fucking tequila.” She ground out.</p><p>“Good to know you haven’t changed.” A raspy voice next to her said.</p><p>Rio looked, and smiled in recognition.</p><p>“Nat, what the hell are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio knew Natasha from New York, even in that big of a city, the lesbian social circles were microscopic. They had been friends with benefits for years off and on because they liked each other, just not enough to actually date.</p><p>“Bachelorette party.” She nodded her head over to a group of drunk women. “Straight women love drag queens, you?”</p><p>She knocked back the shot and grimaced. “Friend’s birthday.” She pointed over to Wanda and the others.</p><p>Natasha looked and grinned. “Hot. Please tell me the redhead is single.”</p><p>“Straight and married.”</p><p>“The rest?”</p><p>“Married, married, and my ex.” Rio said, pointing to each woman as she spoke.</p><p>“The one from high school?” Nat lights up.</p><p>So Rio had told her years ago, they were friends, and she didn’t think she’d ever see Agatha again.</p><p>“That’s the one.” Rio shot another small glass of tequila.</p><p>“I sense some resentment.” Nat jokes.</p><p>She scoffed. “You could say that.”</p><p>Natasha glances back at the table. “She’s staring at you.”</p><p>“Let her.”</p><p>“Or, you could make her jealous…” Nat snaked her hand against the small of Rio’s back.</p><p>Was it mature? No. Healthy? Absolutely not. She should seek therapy. But it would hurt Agatha. And she really, really wanted to make Agatha suffer. Plus, Nat was offering.</p><p>“Fuck it.” She whispered and leaned in, catching Natasha’s lips. Good enough, not Agatha level good, but good.</p><p>She felt hands, not the ones she wanted, pull her closer by the waist and Rio slung her arms over the other women’s shoulders. The kiss deepened, and it tasted off, artificial, everything about this was wrong.</p><p>Rio heard wolf whistles from her table, presumably from everyone but Agatha.</p><p>“She moves fast.” Wanda almost sounded impressed.</p><p>She pulled back from the kiss. “She still looking?”</p><p>Natasha chuckled and snuck a look. “She looks like she’s trying to hex me.”</p><p>Smiling, Rio made forced googly eyes and leaned in to whisper in Nat’s ear. Hoping it gave off the impression that Rio was two seconds away from jumping her bones on the floor of this bar. “Great.”</p>

<p>In another life, Agatha would storm across the bar.</p><p>In another life, she’d brutally murder the hot blonde woman sticking her tongue down the love of her life’s throat.</p><p>In another life, she’d drag Rio away to some dark corner, bend her over in that offensively short dress, and fuck her until she cried or collapsed.</p><p>But she didn’t live that life, so sitting at this table and seething was the best she could do. Jaw clenched, knee bouncing, little vein in her forehead popping.</p><p>“Go Rio!” Jen hollered, sipping her drink and laughing with Wanda as they gawked.</p><p>Then Rio leaned in and whispered something in the other woman’s ear and Agatha lurched forward, like she was actually going to do something about it. But Alice stopped her, placing a hand on her knee and asking under her breath. “You okay?”</p><p>Not by a long shot.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“Agatha,” She could hear the pity in Alice’s voice.</p><p>Wanda whipped around from where she was watching what looked like the beginning of an amaetur lesbian porno, “Speaking of, is Nicky as obsessed with Rio as Billy is?” She asked.</p><p>Of course he was. Everyday since the first day of school, all she heard about from her son was his affinity for Miss Vidal. What he learned that day, who she threatened, how cool she was. She smiled and nodded, listening as Nicky spoke about her ex as though she was the fucking messiah.</p><p>And she had to give it to Rio, their relationship hadn’t interfered with Nicky’s education. In fact, it seemed like she elevated it. He looked so happy talking about school, about photography, about Miss fucking Vidal.</p><p>Did Rio go out of her way for Nicky because he was Agatha’s son? Or in spite of? She did know Nicky was hers, right? Like, it’s pretty obvious?...Right?</p><p>Secretly, it brought her a small sense of comfort to know Nicky and Rio clicked.</p><p>Agatha politely smiled. “She’s all he talks about.”</p><p>“Since when did kids start liking their teachers?” Jen questioned.</p><p>“I don’t know, their generation is weird. They’re so…” Wanda was looking for the right word.</p><p>“Pretentious?” Alice finished.</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “Yes! I love him, but Billy is so angsty, if this was ten years ago, the kid would have a Tumblr.”</p><p>“Need I remind you of how you were in high school?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It’s different…I had a MySpace.” Wanda joked.</p><p>Rio finally came back to the table, drink in hand, and thankfully, alone. “What about MySpace?”</p><p>“Fuck MySpace, who’s the girl?” Wanda goaded.</p><p>“Uh, Nat.” Rio smirked and avoided eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>Agatha could kill Nat, maybe not with brute force because the woman looked a little jacked, but she could find an effective method.</p><p>“Praytell, why are you not over there? Looked like you were trying to mount her.” Jen screamed over the obnoxiously loud music.</p><p>Poison, that’d be effective. Or stabbing, like a billion times.</p><p>“It’s Wanda’s fake birthday. I’m not bailing after half an hour.” Rio’s lips were still swollen from kissing.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “How altruistic of you.”</p><p>Those brown eyes finally met hers and it hurt. Nothing but rage.</p><p>“Who knows, though, maybe I’ll meet back up with her at the end of the night. God knows it’s been ages since I’ve had a good lay.” Rio said to the table, but Agatha knew it was aimed at her.</p><p>Okay that’s it.</p><p>“Alice and I are going to smoke.” Agatha harshly announced, grabbing the woman next to her and exiting.</p><p>“Agatha!” Alice shouted as they made their way to the alley next to the bar.</p><p>“Can you fucking believe her?!” Agatha yelled once they were alone.</p><p>Alice sighed. “Yeah, actually, I can.”</p><p>“What? Alice, you’re my friend and the only person who knows about this. You’re supposed to be on my side.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Well, you’ve made it clear you don’t want to commit or come out. What’d you think was going to happen? She’d wait around forever?”</p><p>She knew Rio wouldn’t just pine for Agatha for the rest of her days, but god dammit, she didn’t need to be reminded of it.</p><p>“It’s not about what I want Alice!”</p><p>“It is! If you wanted Rio, you’d be with her!”</p><p>Her head was going to explode, or implode, either one sounded like a dream right now.</p><p>“It’s not that simple.”</p><p>“Then simplify it. Explain it to me. Not in your non-explanatory Agatha way, like in a real way.” Alice softened.</p><p>Fine, Alice wanted the sob story, she’d give her the damn sob story.</p><p>“I can’t want her. I can’t have her. I can’t come out. My mother, she…” She’d never said everything aloud, it was harder than she expected. “In high school, my mother found out, I don’t wanna get into how, but she did. She confronted me and told me if I didn’t end it, she’d make things harder for Rio and her family. Threatened them.”</p><p>Alice was looking at her with so much sympathy, it made Agatha nauseous.</p><p>“So, I ended it. Part of the deal was staying closeted. And I did, I married Ralph and shut off that part of myself.” She inhaled a shaky breath. “And it worked for twenty years, but then she came back, and I don’t know, I just- I couldn’t keep things shut. My mother visited me earlier this month and–” She looked down at her hands. “It’s not about what I want.”</p><p>“You’re protecting her.” Alice murmured.</p><p>“My mother can still do a lot of damage, Al.” Agatha slumped against the cold brick wall.</p><p>“Why do you let her believe those things about you?”</p><p>She shook her head, looking up. “Because the truth is too awful.”</p><p>“Just tell her, she’d understand.” Alice comforted.</p><p>“The whole point of being extorted is that you can’t talk about it, especially not to the person whose life is being used as leverage.” Her lip trembled. “Because of me, Rio’s life was almost ruined, it still could be!”</p><p>Alice hummed. “Okay one, it wasn’t because of you. It was because of your villainous hag of a mother. And two, I’m not going to pretend to know everything about your relationship with her. But from what it sounds like, you really love her, so I’m assuming she really loves you too. So food for thought, maybe losing you already ruined Rio’s life. Maybe the other stuff wouldn’t have been so scary if she’d had you by her side.”</p><p>“Nobody's life is ruined because they didn’t end up with their high school sweetheart.” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Yours was.”</p><p>And as much as it pained her to admit it, Alice was right. Not that Agatha’s life was completely devoid of anything good. She loved Nicky, more than anything on the fucking planet, she wouldn’t change anything if it meant getting her son out of it again. But she spent so many sleepless nights wishing she’d had him with Rio. She loved her friends, they supported her for decades. But every time she saw one of them Wanda, Alice, Jen, she’d think of Rio, however briefly. Agatha didn’t necessarily have a bad life, but it was ruined, if only by the absence of one person.</p><p>“We should head back, don’t want Jen or Wanda walking in on our heart to heart.” Agatha bitterly joked.</p><p>“You gonna be okay?”</p><p>“As long as that bimbo keeps her hands to herself.” Agatha said and started walking.</p><p>“Don’t say that, it’s demeaning to women.” Alice scolded, following after.</p><p>“By all means, lock me up for being a bad feminist.”  She rolled her eyes and entered the bar, looking over to the table.</p><p>Jen, Wanda, and Rio were cackling and drinking. Bimbo-free.</p><p>“Ahh Agatha, Alice, perfect timing!” Wanda greeted, slightly tipsy.</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked as she took her seat again.</p><p>“Craziest place you‘ve done it, go.” Wanda prompted.</p><p>“Wands, what the fuck?” Alice’s eyebrow furrowed.</p><p>The redhead giggled. “We were talking about Rio almost fucking that girl on the bar floor,” Agatha ground her teeth. “And we got on the topic of the wildest places we’ve done it.”</p><p>“We own a house with a bed, why would we fuck elsewhere?” Alice asked.</p><p>“You fucked in the bathroom at my wedding.” Wanda deadpanned.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Yeah, and at mine.”</p><p>“Our own too!” Jen smiled, sloshing around her drink.</p><p>Wanda looked over. “Rio?”</p><p>“Uh,” Rio ran her tongue over her cheek and thought. “Lecture hall, maybe?”</p><p>“Lecture hall?” Wanda prodded.</p><p>“Had a thing with a professor my junior year.” She explained.</p><p>So, Nat whatever-her-last-name-is and a random NYU professor, Agatha’s hit list was really filling up quickly.</p><p>“Vis and I conceived the twins in the campus library our last month of college.”</p><p>“Gross.” Rio gagged.</p><p>And then the table looked at Agatha.</p><p>Nope, not happening. She’d have to be burned at the motherfucking stake to admit that the craziest place was with Rio, senior year.</p><p>“I plead the fifth.” Agatha said, grabbing Alice’s drink right out of her hand and gulping it.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” Rio mockingly pouted. “You and Ralph never got a little wild?”</p><p>This petty fucking bitch, Agatha was so stupidly in love with her.</p><p>“I think he was too busy getting wild with his secretary.” Agatha said, knocking back the rest of the booze.</p><p>Not that Agatha actually cared about his infidelity. She wasn’t surprised, she almost never put out for Ralph after she had Nicky, not even on his birthday, no matter how much he begged. It made sense his eye wandered, and at least it kept him out of the house more.</p><p>“I think they're called executive assistants now, secretary is a bit…” Alice piped.</p><p>“Demeaning?” She finished, shooting daggers at her friend.</p><p>“Nevermind.” Alice conceded.</p><p>“I’m going to the bathroom.” She mumbled, the table had gone dead quiet, presumably because they thought Agatha was upset about Ralph. Who would be upset about that stupid fucking man?</p><p>The bathroom was empty, which had to be rare for a gay bar. She placed her hands on the sink, dropped her head, and closed her eyes. She just needed a minute before getting through the rest of this night. A minute to push everything down again. A minute before facing her ex.</p><p>The door opened and shut, she felt a body stand next to her.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio spoke.</p><p>Sweet motherfucking christ.</p><p>“What.” She said but didn’t lift her head.</p><p>“I’m sorry for…that.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her through the mirror in front of the sink. “For what you said, or for trying to inhale the dye-job at the bar?”</p><p>And she fucking smirked. “You sound jealous.”</p><p>Agatha turned, facing Rio. “You don’t sound surprised.”</p><p>“No, I am. Especially since there’s no reason to be upset over someone else getting what you supposedly never had. ‘Cause you’re straight, right?”</p><p>“The fucking games you play-”</p><p>“That I play? You climbed into my house and propositioned me. You pursued me. You crushed me.” Rio was almost shouting, thank god for the loud music.</p><p>She couldn’t take this anymore.</p><p>“Fine! Fine! Go fuck whoever you want, go fuck half the town. It’s none of my business anyways.”</p><p>“Jesus christ, Agatha, I wanna fuck you!” Rio threw her hands up in frustration. “But you’re too emotionally stunted to do anything beyond that!”</p><p>Between her and Alice, yes, Agatha got the fucking message. She’s a mess.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “You wanna fuck me?”</p><p>“My god, your hubris…”</p><p>Deflection. Rio was backtracking.</p><p>“Just tell me something.” Agatha’s hands were still on the sink, she leaned in, her lips brushing Rio’s ear. “Did you think about me when you were kissing her?”</p><p>It had the intended effect.</p><p>Rio pupils blew wide, the rage from earlier dissipating into something else. “Unfortunately.”</p><p>“Did you think about my hands when hers were on you?” She pushed, moving her hands to Rio’s waist.</p><p>Rio audibly swallowed. “Yes.”</p><p>“Did you wear this for me?” Agatha asked but she already knew the answer. She slid her hands down, playing with the hem of Rio’s dress that came down to her mid thigh.</p><p>She heard Rio’s breath hitch. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Did you. Wear it. For me?” She repeated.</p><p>“Yes.” It came out as a whisper.</p><p>Her gaze locked with Rio’s for the second time, and now, all she saw was lust. “I like it, makes me want to bend you over this sink, remind you who you belong to.” Agatha’s voice was like gravel.</p><p>Because Rio would always belong to her, no matter how long it’s been. She was Agatha’s and Agatha was hers. She’d never be anyone else’s, she never was anyone else’s, she was and always would be Rio’s.</p><p>And Rio stared, face slightly flushed, weighing her options. She seemed to settle on an answer before backing away from Agatha and heading towards the door. She couldn’t blame Rio, she’d hurt her and sex wouldn’t fix that.</p><p>Agatha didn’t watch her leave, just turned back towards the sink. God damnit, she really was a fucking mess, she just propositioned Rio again-</p><p>She heard the soft click of a lock rather than the swing of an open door.</p><p>Whipping around, she saw Rio stride back over, felt hands tangle in her hair and pull.</p><p>“You piss me off.” Rio mumbled before pouncing.</p><p>Agatha moaned as her mouth met Rio’s, she’d never get enough of this woman, never get sick of this. She faltered for a moment before taking over, slipping her tongue against Rio’s, hoping it’d erase any traces of the hot blonde that might’ve lingered.</p><p>Without breaking the kiss, she grabbed Rio and turned them, effectively swapping their positions so that Rio was in front of the sink, her back to the mirror.</p><p>She let her hands drift under Rio’s dress, trailing up her hips. Agatha pulled back at the absence of fabric.</p><p>“Are you not wearing underwear?” She rasped.</p><p>Rio was panting through her answer. “It’s a fuck me dress, why would I wear underwear?”</p><p>She grinned and used her grip to turn Rio around, her back now pressed against Agatha. She pushed Rio’s hair to one side of her neck, “Slut.” And saw through the mirror how Rio’s eyes lidded at that, heard the breathy noise Rio made in response.</p><p>After their last time, Agatha suspected as much, but it's always so satisfying to be right. She kissed down Rio’s neck, dragging her teeth along the unmarred skin. She couldn’t leave any marks, not without someone back at the table noticing, but god was it tempting.</p><p>“Bend over a little for me, baby.” She husked against Rio’s throat.</p><p>Miraculously, Rio didn’t fight, just complied. Planting one hand on each side of the sink and arching her back, causing her dress to ride up so that her ass was barely covered.</p><p>Agatha left one hand on Rio’s hip and brought the other between her thighs, running a pair of fingers through her wet cunt. She smiled against Rio’s neck at the feeling, she moved to her ear and whispered.</p><p>“This all for me?” Still just letting her fingers tease.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut. “Mmh.” She affirmed.</p><p>That wouldn’t do, she wanted to watch Rio struggle.</p><p>Agatha stopped teasing and used her hand to give a quick smack to Rio’s ass. “Eyes open, love.”</p><p>Her ex moaned and opened her eyes, locking her gaze with Agatha’s.</p><p>She let her hand go back to teasing, “You sure none of this is for Nat?” And yeah, it was petty and possessive and all the other things, but she wanted to hear Rio say it.</p><p>Her knuckles were white against the porcelain of the sink. “All for you.” She whined. “Baby, please, it’s only you.”</p><p>Normally, Agatha might’ve tortured Rio longer, but time is of the essence here.</p><p>“So why’d you kiss her?” She asked as she sunk her digits into Rio, pumping.</p><p>“Ahh-f, fuck-” Rio moaned. “To make you, god-” Agatha pulled Rio’s hip back further, making her take Agatha’s fingers deeper.</p><p>“Use your words.” She scolded, not easing her pace.</p><p>“Make you jealous.” Rio whimpered out, her eyes getting heavy.</p><p>And though Agatha currently had her bent over, fucking her, she still wanted her ex to admit it. “Who do you belong to?” She asked, thrusting faster, just to make it harder for Rio.</p><p>The other woman buckled onto her elbows, moaning and throwing her head back. God, she couldn’t be more perfect. Agatha’s free hand left her hip and snaked into the hair at the base of Rio’s skull, pulling.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were still open, if only by a faction. Her mouth was open, trying to breathe, her walls pulsing around the pair of digits.</p><p>“You, mi amor,” She let out a hiss when Agatha gave a sharp tug on her hair. “I belong to you!“</p><p>Maybe Rio was right, maybe Agatha’s hubris was an issue, because she felt liking a fucking god after hearing that. The admission yes, but more so the pet name. Rio had said it the last time too. Proof that Rio didn’t completely hate her, that she never had in the past twenty years.</p><p>“Please, Agatha.” Rio asked for permission, her voice raw.</p><p>She’d been more than willing to please, and eventually someone else in this bar would try to enter this bathroom. “Go ahead, baby.” Agatha smiled and kissed down Rio’s back, wherever skin was exposed.</p><p>One of her elbows left the sink, hand disappearing underneath her dress, finger pressing down on her own clit. And Rio broke, maybe more accurately shattered.</p><p>She let out something akin to a scream.</p><p>The music wasn’t that fucking loud. Agatha reached around and clapped her hand over Rio’s mouth as she felt the vice grip around her fingers still buried in Rio’s cunt.</p><p>A muffled “Fuck!” left Rio’s mouth as her legs shook from her orgasm.</p><p>Agatha waited until the aftershocks subsided before letting go of her face, tucking any stray hairs behind Rio’s ears.</p><p>She felt Rio start to stand, signaling for Agatha to pull out. Which she did, even if she wished she didn’t have to. She wanted to take Rio home, make her breakfast in the morning, wake up to her in a raggedy oversized t-shirt and a bare face.</p><p>When she turned around, Agatha spoke first. “Rio…”</p><p>‘Come home with me.’<br/>
‘I’m sorry, please forgive me.’<br/>
‘I love you.’</p><p>Really, fucking pick one, any of them worked, just say it.</p><p>And there was a knock on the door. “Hey guys? You’ve been gone a minute and Wanda got worried.” Alice shouted from the other side of the door. “So I very bravely volunteered to check on yall.” Oh, she definitely knew what they had just done.</p><p>Rio’s eyes briefly flicked to the door before landing back on Agatha’s, and there was the rage again.</p><p>Fuck, the whiplash between Rio one minute ago and Rio now could’ve snapped her damn neck.</p><p>“Rio,” She said again.</p><p>“Guys!” Alice pressed.</p><p>“Don’t. Just don’t fucking start, Agatha.” Rio quietly reprimanded, fixing her dress and walking towards the door.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen.</p><p>Rio automatically assumed Agatha was asking her not to tell anyone.</p><p>She assumed Agatha would hide her before ever thinking Agatha would commit to her.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Fair though, unfortunately.

</p><p>Alice knocked again, before Rio pried the door open.</p><p>“Stop being annoying!” Rio deadpanned as she passed by Alice.</p><p>Agatha quickly washed her hands and met Alice in the hallway.</p><p>“Dude…” Alice started, but Agatha didn’t want to hear it.</p><p>“I know, I know.”</p><p>“You can’t keep this up.”</p><p>“I said, I know, Al.” And stormed off back to the table where Rio was already shooting more tequila. Wanda and Jen were officially drunk, so at least they were oblivious.</p><p>“Okay, Rio said you guys are good now.” Wanda kind of slurred. “So, Agatha, what’s the craziest place?”</p><p>They were still on this?</p><p>She let out an exasperated breath as she sat back down.</p><p>She looked at Rio, who refused to look up from her now empty shot glass.</p><p>“I don’t know…” Agatha trailed. “A club bathroom?”</p>

<p>After the longest hour and a half of her life, the gang finally called it a night. Well not so much called it, more like Wanda got blackout drunk.</p><p>Agatha hoisted one arm around to support Wanda to the car, while Alice essentially herded her drunk wife and an even drunker Rio a couple steps behind. Jen and Rio had their arms interlocked and they were giggling as though they still didn't actively hate each other.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll take my lovely wife,” Alice grumbled. “And the not birthday girl, you got Rio?”</p><p>They were both the default designated driver since Alice only had half a drink before Agatha swiped it and chugged the other half. She felt too guilty to drink afterwards, her stomach too knotted to take anything more than the club soda she nursed after the bathroom.</p><p>Alice unlocked her car and Agatha opened the back seat for Wanda. “You sure that’s the best idea?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Alice gave a pointed look to her wife and Rio, who were essentially just tripping over one another and laughing. “She's gonna need help getting into her house and into bed. Usually that’s a wife's responsibility but since she has no wife, you’re up, champ!”</p><p>“Wait, wait, wait-” Wanda slurred. “I live closer to Aggie, and Rio-” She hiccupped. “Rio lives on the same street as you two.” Wanda pointed to Alice and her stumbling wife. “So why don’t I just go with Aggie?”</p><p>Alice gave a gentle nudge for Wanda to climb into the car. “Shushhh, you’re drunk.”</p><p>“Al….” Agatha spoke.</p><p>Alice gritted her teeth and raised her eyebrows. “Work. Out. Your. Shit. I’ve had heartburn since the reunion! My blood pressure has skyrocketed!”</p><p>“Okay!” She relented and pulled out her keys, looking over to Jen and her ex. “Rio, c’mon, you’re with me.”</p><p>Rio looked over and dramatically widened her eyes. “No, don’t let her take me!” She started in what sounded like an exaggerated transatlantic accent. “She’ll be the death of me, I know it!” Agatha brought her arm around Rio’s waist to help her walk towards the car. “Someone call the constable! This will not stand!”</p><p>Jen cackled at her antics as Alice guided her to the passenger seat of their car. Wanda, however, was already passed out in the backseat.</p><p>Fucking lightweight.</p><p>Good god, Rio was a relatively small woman, but drunk Rio was dragging her weight and could barely take a step in her fucking heels. After about two minutes of Rio swearing she’s good, Agatha gave up.</p><p>“Okay, hold out your arms.” She pocketed her keys so her hands would be free.</p><p>“Why?” Rio blinked, clearly unimpressed.</p><p>“Because I’m only parked a hundred feet away from Alice, yet this is taking forever.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but threw up her arms.</p><p>She swiftly picked up Rio and headed for the car.</p><p>Rio let out a girly yelp. “What the fuck? How-” She started asking, in her drunken state, it was probably more impressive than it actually was.</p><p>“Pilates.” Agatha said as they finally reached the fucking car. She unlocked and opened the passenger side door for Rio, who begrudgingly got in.</p><p>“Ugh, you’re one of those rich pricks that has an iPad as your dashboard?” Rio pouted, face scrunching as she hit different buttons on the screen.</p><p>“It’s not a Tesla, so no.”</p><p>“Still a rich prick.” Rio mumbled.</p><p>Fair.</p><p>“Please, just don’t vomit in my car.” Agatha pleaded, turning out of the parking lot and getting on the highway.</p><p>“I won’t. My mom would roll over in her grave if she knew I’d wasted perfectly good tequila.”</p><p>“Ri, she was a nurse for like thirty years, she’d probably rather you waste the booze than get your stomach pumped.”</p><p>“Don’t talk about her like you knew her.” Rio spat, some words running together. “Some of us actually liked our mothers because they weren’t psychotic lizard people masquerading as humans with empathy and shit!”</p><p>And she knew that Rio meant it to be serious, she really did, but the lizard people got her. “I wouldn’t put it past Evanora.” She snorted.</p><p>Rio gingerly rolled her head back and forth against the headrest. “How is the old bat? Alive, right?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>She tutted. “That’s too bad.”</p><p>“I am sorry, you know, about Victoria’s passing. I-”</p><p>“Please don’t invoke my dead mothers name when I’m drunk and pissed at you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to fight.</p><p>“Okay.” She said and placed her left elbow against the window and leaned her head against her hand as she drove, right hand on the wheel.</p><p>Then Rio let out a little huff of air, not quite a scoff, but not a laugh.</p><p>Agatha looked over momentarily. “What?”</p><p>“You used to do the same thing when you drove in high school.” Rio quietly spoke, head looking at the road rather than Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha looked back at the road, straight on. “Guess some things never change.”</p><p>The car ride was silent after that, Agatha wanted to say more, but didn’t know how much would stick with Rio’s brain saturated in liquor. So, she drove and didn’t look over, didn't want to do another thing to upset her.</p><p>When Agatha pulled up to Rio’s house, she finally checked on her, and-</p><p>Passed out cold, slumped in the passenger seat, necked craned back.</p><p>She shut off the car and gently shook her arm. “Rio, hey,” and nothing. So, she jostled her arm a little more. “We’re home.”</p><p>Okay saying that felt like a cruel joke on herself. They weren’t a ‘we’ and they sure as hell weren’t home, just a home, Rio and Victoria’s.</p><p>Because Agatha and Rio didn’t have a home together, never did.</p><p>“Mmmmmhhh.” Rio whined and shifted, refusing to open her eyes.</p><p>She exhaled a frustrated breath and climbed out of the car before opening the passenger side door, unbuckling Rio, and once again hoisting her up and carrying her. Her ex’s arms instinctively wrapped around her and she heard a chuckle as she reached the front door.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god,” Agatha realized and started setting Rio down. “You were faking so I’d carry you again?”</p><p>“My feet hurt and I like the princess treatment, sue me.” She smiled, like the goofy lopsided one from way back when. “Also I was asleep until you rudely woke me up.”</p><p>“Was I supposed to leave you sleeping in my car all night?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “That car is nicer than my last apartment.” She fumbled with her keys for a long while, occasionally dropping them. “C’mon guys, be cool.” She scolded the inanimate metal objects hanging from a carabiner.</p><p>Agatha snatched them after the third time they clattered to the cement. “Here, let me help.”</p><p>“Right cause you’re so helpful.” It was sarcastic and obviously passive-aggressive.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just jiggled the lock until the door gave way, ushering Rio in and shutting the door behind them.</p><p>“I think that’s the first time I’ve ever seen you come in using the door.”</p><p>“First time for everything.”</p><p>Rio started undoing the straps of her heels while still standing, ultimately losing balance and tipping.</p><p>Agatha quickly caught her, righting her again. “Okay, let’s get you to bed.” Moving through the small home towards Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>“Stop trying to fuck me all the time.” Rio whined as she flopped onto the mattress once inside the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and knelt to start freeing Rio from her heels. “Wasn’t a come on.”</p><p>“You came on what?” Rio smirked.</p><p>She placed the first heel on the floor and moved to the second. “Ha. Ha.” She deadpanned, undoing the ankle strap and gently tugging to get off the shoe before placing it next to the first one.</p><p>“Where are your jammies?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“My jammies? Fuck, you really are a mom.” She groaned.</p><p>So her vocabulary was a little skewed, fucking crucify her.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were glassy and half-lidded, but she still managed to roll them. “Dresser, bottom drawer.”</p><p>She walked over the dresser, picking up a sweater and pants. She turned them around to show to Rio for approval.</p><p>“I want a tank top” She sounded like a whiny kid. “And boxers.”</p><p>“Of course, I should’ve just intrinsically known that.” Agatha mumbled, locating the correct pieces and handing them to Rio.</p><p>She looked down at the pjs then back at Agatha. “You gonna watch?”</p><p>Oh, fuck, that’s right.</p><p>“Sorry, I’ll grab some water and aspirin.”</p><p>Agatha closed the door as she left, entering the kitchen and grabbing a glass. When she opened the fridge for the water filter, it was bare. Did the woman never eat? Even back in high school Rio didn’t cook, but still, other than half a carton of eggs and some expired oatmilk– nothing.</p><p>Okay, either Rio was negligent and lazy about grocery shopping, which is definitely plausible. Or, she wasn’t buying food because too much of her paycheck was going towards bills.</p><p>Could Agatha feasibly buy this house without Rio knowing? No. She also knew Rio would never knowingly accept financial help, especially if it was Harkness money.  But she fucking yearned for it in that moment, just solve all of Rio’s problems for her, make her life easier.</p><p>Instead, Agatha made a mental note to stock the fridge later, maybe before Rio got up tomorrow morning. She filled the glass, found the aspirin and knocked on the bedroom door.</p><p>“Come in.” Rio said, slightly annoyed.</p><p>When she did walk in, her mouth went dry. For such an inconspicuous reason too. Rio was dressed in the clothes; a tank top and boxers. Hair tied up. And for some reason, it made her more attractive than the dress did. Okay equally as attractive.</p><p>“Um, here.” Agatha offered the glass and the aspirin, watching as Rio downed both.  “I’m gonna go, since you’re all set.”</p><p>She turned to leave, and of course Rio could never just leave well enough alone.</p><p>“Did you genuinely miss me?”</p><p>Well she suddenly just sounded a lot more lucid..</p><p>Still maybe a little tipsy, hence why she was bold enough to ask the question. But sober enough that she’d remember this conversation.</p><p>Agatha turned to look at her, they were on opposite sides of the room.</p><p>How to go about this? Lie. There was always lying. But after tonight, she didn’t have it in her to keep pushing, lying, withholding. So-</p><p>“Desperately.” It was almost a whisper.</p><p>“Why’d you leave me?” Rio softly asked, holding eye contact.</p><p>And she didn’t know if Rio meant in high school or after the reunion, but either way-</p><p>“I was scared.” Wasn’t a lie, maybe an omission. But she was scared then, she is now, just not of what Rio thought.</p><p>“Did you ever love me?” And now her eyes were glassy for a different reason.</p><p>She swore she felt her heart snap in two at being asked that, because in her almost four decades on this planet, Agatha is certain she’s only ever loved Rio.</p><p>Fuck, they were doing this now as Rio is half-drunk at midnight, standing in her god forsaken jammies.</p><p>“So much it hurt.” Agatha admits, her own eyes clouding.</p><p>Rio pushed her tongue against her cheek, like she always did when she was thinking, considering.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>Agatha felt a tear run down her cheek, but she didn’t attempt to wipe it away or hide it.</p><p>“Still hurts.”</p><p>Rio just nodded, not upset, not happy, just acknowledging the information.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio croaked. “Hurts me too.”</p><p>Maybe Agatha should’ve let it be at that point, left well enough alone.</p><p>But no, she had to push, plead her case, make her ex understand.</p><p>“Rio, I’ve loved you for twenty-one years.”</p><p>And she just stared, her own tears spilling over as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“You think you’d be better at it by now.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t defend herself, Rio was right. She should be better by now, take accountability, wiggle out from underneath her mother’s thumb. She was an adult and still lived like she did back in high school, ashamed and so fucking scared.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha softly agreed. “I want to be.”</p><p>They stood there, neither of them speaking, no more to say. Rio couldn’t know that Agatha was telling the truth, and Agatha couldn’t prove that she was. If there was any trust left between them, then maybe she stood a chance in hell, but she was pretty positive she’d burned everything down beyond recognition.</p><p>“I’m gonna, uh” Rio cleared her throat when her voice started to break. “I’m gonna go to sleep.” She pointed to the bed behind her.</p><p>Agatha got the message loud and clear; ‘I don’t trust you.’</p><p>“Yeah, um, goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>She reached for the doorknob on her way out, praying to make it back to her car before the dam burst, not wanting to bawl in her ex-girlfriend's childhood home.</p><p>“Can you stay?” It came out so quiet, had Agatha not been listening for more, she might’ve missed it entirely.</p><p>She looked at Rio, now tucked under the various quilts and throw blankets that adorned her bed.</p><p>“Sure, I can sleep on the couch.” She offered.</p><p>“It’s older than we are, just-” Rio folded over a corner of the blanket, inviting. “Not like we haven’t shared a bed before.”</p><p>Again-</p><p>She got the message loud and clear; ‘I want to trust you.’</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It’s more than she was expecting.</p><p>So she closed the door, and approached the bed, shucking off her boots.</p><p>“You can grab something to sleep in.”</p><p>Normally she would’ve refused, but sleeping in a halter top and waking up to angry red lines on her neck was not enticing knowing the lines didn’t come from Rio.</p><p>She went back to the dresser, pulled out sweatpants and that battered NYU hoodie that she’d seen Rio in at the supermarket a couple of months ago, and quickly changed. Why changing felt more intimate than sex or being outright naked in that moment, Agatha chose not to analyze.</p><p>Rio turned off the lamp, the only source of light in the room.</p><p>She slipped under the covers, and she wasn’t expecting any physical contact, but when she turned on her side away from Rio, she felt an arm sling itself over her waist.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio spoke, but just barely.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Can you promise you’ll be here in the morning?”</p><p>Rio was asking her not to run again. She wouldn’t, she’d dig her heels in and take fucking root if it meant Rio even looking in her general direction.</p><p>“Promise.” Agatha affirmed and gently ran her thumb soothingly against Rio’s arm.</p><p>“‘Night, Agatha.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p>

<p>“That’s four titles in four years, the people love me.” Agatha bragged, crown atop her head. She was in a silky white gown, purple and green flowers embroidered on the bodice, soaking in her last coronation of high school.</p><p>Rio sat next to her under the bleachers in her thrifted green slip dress that came down to her ankles. Even outside the school, she still heard the chorus of ‘Hey There Delilah’ blasting from the auditorium.</p><p>Senior Ball, late March 2005.</p><p>She hadn’t attended a single dance in her high school career, but Agatha had asked her. Genuinely asked, with like a cardstock poster and a bouquet of azaleas. Of course she did it in Rio’s bedroom, which was a little less grand of a gesture, but it made Rio swoon all the same.</p><p>“The people fear and wanna fuck you.” Rio corrected.</p><p>She adjusted her crown, “Doesn’t matter, the powers all the same.”</p><p>“Oh? And what’s your first official act as dictator?”</p><p>“Need I remind you, I was democratically elected. I am nothing but a humble servant.” Agatha grinned and her eyes twinkled with chaos. “That being said, I think my first official act will be making out with my hot as hell first lady.” She bunched up the skirt of her dress to easily straddle Rio.</p><p>“Wait, now you’re president?” Rio gripped Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer.</p><p>“Queen, president, dictator, supreme leader, I’m flexible.”</p><p>And Rio smiled up at this woman, so completely confident and utterly ridiculous. “Power looks good on you.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Honey, everything looks good on me.” And lurched forward in Rio’s lap, connecting their lips.</p><p>They’d been in this position a million times, but Rio melted all the same despite that. Her hands dropped to Agatha’s thighs out of muscle memory and kissed back. Agatha’s hands carded through her hair, deepening the kiss, adding tongue. She moaned in response and moved her palms beneath her girlfriend’s dress, mouth watering at the soft skin. Agatha was always so fucking soft, it made her feel feral.</p><p>Agatha dropped her mouth to Rio’s neck, leaving searing-hot kisses in her wake. “I uh, I wanna tell people.” Agatha breathed against her throat.</p><p>And Rio’s eyes were closed, barely listening. “Huh?” She mumbled through Agatha’s teeth scraping against her skin.</p><p>“About us, I wanna tell people.” She said and continued her mouth.</p><p>Oh, that’s nice.</p><p>God she wished Agatha was vampire in this moment because then the blood loss might add to the sucking, and-</p><p>Hold the fuck on.</p><p>Rio pulled back. “What?!”</p><p>Agatha’s lips were puffy, her eyes dilated, seemingly confused as to why Rio’s neck was not in her mouth anymore. “What?”</p><p>“You’re gonna come out?!” Rio practically screeched.</p><p>“...Yeah?” She nonchalantly replied.</p><p>“What- wha-” Rio felt like she was having a stroke. “But your mother-”</p><p>“I wanna tell my friends after graduation and my mother once I’m at Princeton. Like, the day after she drops me off, I call and tell her I’m one of those queers she ‘prays’ for.”</p><p>“Your mothers religious?”</p><p>“Not even a little, but she loves Laura Bush.”</p><p>Rio giggled. It’s not immediate, there’s still two months of school left, but it was progress. “You really want to?”</p><p>“I love you. I’m sick of hiding you when there’s nothing to be ashamed of.” Agatha explained so plainly, so fucking earnestly.</p><p>“I love you, so so much.” And Rio grabbed the back of Agatha’s head and yanked her into another kiss. It was passionate, desperate, like she’d parish without her.</p><p>Rio’s not sure how long they sat there, making out and pawing at each other before Agatha detached herself. She pulled the crown off her head and placed it on Rio’s. “Hold this for me.” And before Rio could question why the accessory was now on her, Agatha got up and dropped to her knees.</p><p>God this woman, is eighteen too soon to consider marriage? Yeah, no…yeah, too soon.</p><p>“Here?” Rio asked through heavy breaths.</p><p>“Why not? It’s our spot. It’s poetic.” She slid Rio’s dress up to pool it around her waist.</p><p>Was being eaten out under the bleachers poetic? No probably not, but damn did Agatha make it sound good.</p><p>And for her first time, it was good. Agatha was eager and patient and treated Rio like she was made of glass. Just complete and utter devotion. Rio remembers the grass stains left on Agatha’s pristine white dress, how they raced back to Rio’s and spent the next forty-eight hours in bed together thanks to the fact that Victoria was pulling doubles all weekend.</p><p>She remembers keeping the crown, she remembers the broken promises, she remembers ‘Hey There Delilah’ and it haunting her anytime it played in public. Which for the record, it did…a lot.</p><p>Rio woke up, and maybe she was going crazy but she swore she heard that same stupid fucking song softly playing in her house.  Was probably the tequila, or maybe it was Agatha. She’d been drunk, but not too drunk not to remember the whole night.</p><p>In excruciating fucking detail, no less.</p><p>God, it had been tequila, tequila, Natasha. Tequila, Agatha. Tequila, tequila.</p><p>And Agatha had driven her home and helped her, and gave her water and aspirin, and-</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>‘Did you genuinely miss me?’<br/>
‘Desperately.’</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>‘I was scared.’<br/>
‘So much it hurt.’<br/>
‘Still hurts.’</p><p>Her throbbing head pounded in equal time with her heart as she replayed the cherry on top of last night.</p><p>‘Rio, I’ve loved you for twenty-one years.’</p><p>She sure had a fucked up way of showing it, but still, Rio wanted to believe the best. She always wanted to believe the best with Agatha, even to her own detriment. So she let her stay, maybe not her smartest move, but the woman had some other-worldly witchy fucking claim on her where she acted fucking stupid. Which reminds Rio, who looks over at the other side of the bed-</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Even to her own fucking detriment.</p><p>Rio tried not to be angry, Agatha ran, that’s what she does. Can’t get mad, it’s just the way she was. The sun rises and sets, a river ebbs and flows, Agatha Harkness promises and runs. It’s just the way of the world. Not her fault Rio chose to believe otherwise.</p><p>She was content to roll back over and sleep the rest of the day, when she heard a clanging sound from somewhere in the house.</p><p>Rio bolted upright, oh way too fast, the room spun a little. But she fought her way out of the tangled mess of sheets and slowly crept towards the door, listening.</p><p>Okay, she wasn't crazy, The Plain White T’s were definitely coming from the kitchen. She briefly looked over to her bookcase near the door, Agatha’s crown still sat on the top shelf, a thick layer of dust coating it.</p><p>Rio cracked the door open quietly, and the sound became clearer, as did the smell. Cinnamon and vanilla, and maybe bacon. Her stomach growled at the sudden prospect of food and without realizing, her legs carried her down the hallway and to the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha was in the kitchen, still in Rio’s hoodie and sweatpants, hair unruly and wild from sleep. Her phone sat on the counter, playing music. Her back was turned as she pushed something around in a pan on the stove, mug in hand. The sun from the windows shone through, covering the room in a soft light. Agatha looked content, almost like she herself lived here. Like it was her kitchen, and cooking in it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio wasn’t surprised two minutes ago when Agatha supposedly bailed again, but this? Domestic Saturday morning in pjs with a home cooked breakfast? She was fucking flabbergasted.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio cautiously asked, she didn’t know if she was dealing with a body snatchers situation.</p><p>The phone shuffled to another song as Agatha whipped her head around. “Morning.” Her voice still a little sleepy. Why was that fucking endearing?</p><p>“What the fuck is this?”</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows. “French toast?”</p><p>“I don’t have the stuff to make that.” Her mind felt heavy, she couldn’t process the scene in her kitchen right now.</p><p>“Yeah, I know, I put in a delivery order and the groceries came like half an hour ago.” She said and turned back to the pan.</p><p>Rio looked at the coffee maker, still on and brewing. Rio ran out of coffee days ago.</p><p>“How much did you buy?”</p><p>Agatha waved her mug around noncommittally, spatula ready in her other hand. “Just the essentials.”</p><p>She knew that tone of voice, it was her ‘I know something you don’t know’ voice. Rio walked over to the fridge and cracked it open before hastily closing it again.</p><p>Motherfucker stocked the whole fridge, at least a week or two worth of groceries.</p><p>“I can buy my own food, Agatha.” She just had to wait six days from now for her next paycheck.</p><p>“Yes, I know, but seeing as your negligence would lead to my own starvation this morning…” She plated the food. “I took it upon myself to do it.”</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>Then her ex pulled a pan out of the oven. “Turkey bacon?”</p><p>“I- I,” Who the fuck was this in her home and where did the woman from last night who railed her in the bathroom of a bar go? “I guess.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha said and began adding the bacon to their plates.</p><p>Rio just shook her head at the display before her, moving past Agatha to the coffee maker, placing her hand on the small of Agatha’s back as she maneuvered around.</p><p>She grabbed a mug, poured the coffee, took a sip, and sweet jesus, Agatha got the expensive stuff. The really good kind that Rio never shelled out for.</p><p>Agatha went into the fridge, plucked out the brand new oatmilk, and handed it to Rio without a word.</p><p>Okay, what fucking game was this? Where did this housewife who knew how Rio took her coffee appear from? Thin air?</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio cautiously spoke, adding it to her coffee.</p><p>She hummed in acknowledgement and took their plates over to the kitchen table, leaving Rio confused in the corner with her mug.</p><p>“You coming?” Agatha asked as she pulled off a small piece of bacon and popped it in her mouth.</p><p>Rio walked over and sat down at the table, placed her cup next to the plate of food, and stared down at it. “Is it poisoned?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Don’t know, better eat it and find out.”</p><p>She dug her fork into the bread, and fuck it was good. Definitely brioche, fluffy, and yes, that was cinnamon. She groaned and went in for another bite.</p><p>“Good? Not poisonous?” Agatha teased, eating her own.</p><p>“Jurys still out.” Rio replied through a full mouth.</p><p>“How long has it been since you cooked something in this kitchen? I had to find a match to light the stove, and Victoria’s pans were dusty.”</p><p>Something about Agatha using her mom’s name so casually irked her. “You care about my mom’s pans? You didn’t even go to her funeral.”</p><p>Victoria’s funeral was meant to be small, but almost everyone from the hospital had shown up, offering their condolences. Lilia had made a brief appearance, but she didn’t really get to talk to her, too busy listening to her mom’s former co-workers stories. But no Agatha.</p><p>Agatha looked taken aback. “I sent flowers. I figured you were already hurting and I didn’t want to add to it.”</p><p>Flowers? Rio didn’t get anything addressed from Agatha, all of them were addressed from someone, well except one over-the-top bouquet that was-</p><p>“Were yours the azaleas?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Those are not appropriate funeral flowers, do you know what they mean?”</p><p>“I sent those because you and Victoria used to grow them, out back, behind the garage.”</p><p>Gardening was her mom’s favorite pastime when she wasn’t working, naturally she roped Rio into it too. They hand huge planter boxes throughout the backyard, once flourishing. When her mom got sick, she couldn’t keep up with them anymore, by the time Rio arrived from New York, the garden was withered, a husk of its former self. Kind of like her mom. Azaleas were Victoria’s favorite, Rio’s too.</p><p>“What’s happening here, Agatha?”</p><p>“Breakfast.”</p><p>Rio huffed. “No, I mean,” She waved a hand between the two of them. “Here.”</p><p>“You wanted me to stay.” She softly supplied.</p><p>“And you wanted to stay?” Rio asked, incredulous.</p><p>“I meant what I said last night.”</p><p>“That doesn’t just magically fix things.”</p><p>“I just-” She paused. “I want to do better.”</p><p>“So, what , you’re going to come out? Stop hiding me?”</p><p>“I want to.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Well, are you going to?”</p><p>“I figured I’d start with Jen and Wanda. Alice already knows, she saw us through your window the night of the reunion.”</p><p>That explains why Alice couldn’t look her in the eye last night.</p><p>“Saw us? How much of us?”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw. “Enough to know.”</p><p>“Alice saw my tits?” Rio dropped her head into her hands.</p><p>She snorted and reached over to place a hand on Rio’s wrist. “At least they’re great tits.”</p><p>Rio dropped her hands and scowled. “So, you’re telling your friends.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, smiling.</p><p>“I’ve heard that one before.” Rio said under her breath.</p><p>“Look, I know I’ve said things before, but it’s different this time. My son and mother might be a different story, especially with the whole…teacher thing. But I’m serious, Rio.”</p><p>It’s different this time.</p><p>Isn’t that what shitty partners always say to worm their way back in?</p><p>“Prove it.”</p><p>“You want me to call Wanda and Jen right now? I will.” Agatha picked up her phone.</p><p>Rio stopped her. “No, I mean prove that you’re serious. If you want this then I need to see actual evidence.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>She shrugged. “That’s up to you to figure out, I’m done meeting you where you’re at, it’s your turn to meet me.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha agreed, though she didn’t look confident about it. “Okay, so I need to prove it to you.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Woo you?”</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>“I can do that.”</p><p>Rio took a sip of her infuriatingly delicious coffee. “But don’t just throw money around, I don’t want empty gestures.”</p><p>“I made breakfast.” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“You don’t get a gold star for bare minimum girlfriend duties.”</p><p>She smiled, or more accurately beamed. “I’m your girlfriend?”</p><p>Absolutely not, Rio was not giving in that quick.</p><p>“Jurys still out on that too.”</p><p>“Fair enough.”</p><p>They ate the rest of their meal in relatively comfortable silence, little talks every now and then. When they finished, Agatha offered to clean up while Rio took a shower. When she emerged from the bathroom , the kitchen was spotless and devoid of her not ex but not current girlfriend. She opened her bedroom door and Agatha was finishing getting dressed, the same clothes from the night before, sliding on her boots.</p><p>“I’m not running.” Agatha quickly explained.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Didn’t think you were.”</p><p>“But I have been thinking about it, and,” She deeply exhaled. “I don’t think we should have sex.”</p><p>She stood there, hair still dripping, towel wrapped around her. “Wasn’t exactly planning on it right now…”</p><p>“No, I mean like, for a while. You said it last night at the bar. I proposition you, we fuck, and then I bolt. I don’t want you to think that’s all I want from you.”</p><p>“No sex?”</p><p>“We keep it PG-13, high school rules.”</p><p>“We fucked in high school.”</p><p>“Okay, junior high rules, nothing below the belt. Then when you feel like I’ve proved it, you can proposition me or not. It’s up to you.” Agatha explained, sounding honest.</p><p>“You’re not gonna try anything?”</p><p>Yeah fucking right.</p><p>“Nope, nothing at all.”</p><p>“So if I just,” Rio opened her towel and watched as Agatha’s eyes bugged to the size of fucking saucers. “Nothing?”</p><p>She looked to be in pain at not reaching out and touching, but she didn’t move.</p><p>“Nothing.” Agatha squeaked.</p><p>Rio smirked and closed her towel. “Okay, Agatha.” She was going to torture this woman and it was going to be be fucking spectacular.</p><p>“I’m going to uh,” She obviously was trying to get her brain to switch gears after being flashed. “Go home, shower, change, all that. But, um, can I call you?”</p><p>Rio waved her head like she was considering. “I’ll allow it.” Reaching her arm out for Agatha’s phone, which the other woman readily produced. She tapped the screen with her number and handed it back.</p><p>“Okay so,” Agatha pocketed her phone. “Bye.” She started walking past Rio, when she was caught by her arm.</p><p>“Te veo.” Rio hummed, giving her a miniscule kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Agatha halted, looking surprised.</p><p>She smiled. “Now get the fuck out of here.” And smacked Agatha’s ass, causing the other woman to jolt forward and start walking again.</p><p>“I said nothing below the belt!” Agatha exclaimed down the hall.</p><p>“You don’t know what I was doing in junior high!” Rio shouted back from the bedroom.</p><p>When she heard the front door close, she looked back over to the crown on her bookcase. She picked it up and wiped off the dust before placing it safely back on its shelf.</p><p>It’s different this time, right?</p>

<p>Monday morning, Rio walked into her classroom a few minutes before the bell. Since Saturday her and Agatha had exchanged a few texts but nothing major. Rio might’ve purposefully waited several hours in between said texts, but who’s to say? She wanted to make Agatha work for it, grovel, pine, yearn, and her not-girlfriend had agreed.</p><p>All of her students shuffled in, Billy and Nicky joined at the hip like always.</p><p>“Morning, Miss V.” Billy greeted on the way to his desk.</p><p>Gross, Miss V made her sound like a dominatrix, she didn’t need to hear it out of her student’s mouth.</p><p>“Never call me that again, Billy.” She greeted. “Nicky.” She smiled and he smiled back. “Hey, how’d the weekend go?”</p><p>“Oh, so good, I was fed freezer burnt pizza rolls and listened to my dad rant about how his mistress finally left him.” He deadpanned.</p><p>“That is so rough, dude. That’s fucking grim.”</p><p>“I tried the 800 though, hopefully it’ll come out this time.”</p><p>“I’ll help you develop it today.” Rio offered, watching his eyes perk up a bit.</p><p>“Thanks.” And made his way to sit next to Billy.</p><p>The bell rang and Rio closed the door. “Alright guys,” She spoke loud enough for the entire room to hear. “It’s officially October, so after a month of learning the technicals, I am finally letting you loose in the darkroom.”</p><p>A series of cheers came from the class. Billy raised his hand. “Why’d Nicky get to use it all month?”</p><p>“Because he knows his shit.” She pointed. “Which brings me to my next point; darkroom safety. Do not sniff the chemicals, don’t touch the chemicals with your bare hands, and I cannot believe I have to say this seeing as I’ve been told most of you have common sense- do not drink the fucking chemicals. You hurt yourself and I will not show you sympathy. I will laugh at you. Manically. Now-”</p><p>There was a knock at her door, through the little rectangular window she could see it was some random delivery man.</p><p>She crossed the room and opened the door, revealing a bouquet in his hands. She looked down at it before looking at the man.</p><p>“Rio Vidal?” He asked, clipboard in hand.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>He shoved the flowers towards her.</p><p>Azaleas.</p><p>She took them, face scrunched. “Who are they from?”</p><p>“Lady, I don't know, I just spent fifteen minutes convincing the secretary in the office downstairs that I’m not a shooter.” He shrugged and walked off.</p><p>She turned around, facing her class again. Upon revealing the flowers, a chorus of “Ooooohhhh”s and whistles rang out.</p><p>“Calm down, virgins.” She found the card buried in the glass vase, and she already suspected, but now it was confirmed.</p><p>‘And yes, I know what they mean.’<br/>
-A</p><p>Scribbled on the card in Agatha’s trademark loopy chicken scratch.</p><p>Against her better judgement, she smiled.</p><p>“Miss Vidal has a girlfriend!” Billy accused.</p><p>“Who’s the girl?” Another student shouted.</p><p>“Is it Billy’s mom?” Nicky snorted.</p><p>“Dude!” Billy screeched.</p><p>She placed the vase on her desk, next to the monstera, pocketed the note, and turned back to the teens. “Okay all of you shut up and be free.” She waved them off and the mob moved towards the darkroom.</p><p>Billy hung back, because of course he did. “Seriously, who is it?”</p><p>“You don’t know her, she goes to a different school.” Rio joked.</p><p>He spun around, racing out the classroom door and disappeared.</p><p>“Did I finally break him?” She asked Nicky.</p><p>“No way, he’ll die on this hill.” He said, standing and surveying the flowers. “Azaleas?”</p><p>“Yeah, how’d you know?” Not that she knew many men, or boys for that matter, but she assumed most didn’t know the types of flowers beyond roses.</p><p>“They’re my mom’s favorite, I usually get them for her on mother’s day or her birthday. Says they bring her happy memories.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Billy appeared yet again, dragging Lilia with him.</p><p>“Billy, I have a class, what is so urgent?” She scolded as she crossed the threshold.</p><p>He didn’t say anything, just pointed to the bouquet on the desk.</p><p>And Lilia actually fucking gasped. “I thought you two ended it? She sent you flowers? Look at these, they must’ve cost a fortune! Oh, Rio, go to her!”</p><p>“Lilia.” Rio widened her eyes. “We’ll discuss it later.” She was not updating Lilia about the very graphic and gory details of the weekend in front of minors. She had some morals.</p><p>“Who is it? Do you know her? You so know her, don’t you?” Billy rapidly fired.</p><p>Lilia looked at him, then Rio. “I need an update, you owe me a wine night.” She said and left, closing the door yet again.</p><p>“Mrs.Calderu, c’mon!” He shouted after her.</p><p>“Get your ass in the darkroom, Billy.” Rio scolded.</p><p>He pouted but huffed off.</p><p>“If I help you develop that print during fifth period, will you help me wrangle these dummies in the darkroom?”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Like a TA?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Sure, and don’t be afraid to use physical violence. I obviously can’t, I don’t think the administration would like that, but you can!”</p><p>“Say no more.” He gave a fake salute and followed after Billy.</p><p>She hoped giving Nicky a bigger sense of purpose in class helped to distract him from his homelife. When he was at his dad’s place, he felt invisible. But when he was here with Rio, he could feel important, heard, valued.</p><p>Or something like that, it’s not like Rio was invested in this student. No, that’d be crazy, she didn’t even like this job.</p><p>When fifth period rolled around, Nicky popped in and Rio led him into the darkroom. She assisted as they developed the photo together before dunking it in the bath. The moment of truth came and-</p><p>“It fucking worked!” Nicky almost screamed, holding the photo between the wooden tongs. Crystal clear, perfectly in-focus, expertly developed photo. He hung it on the clothesline and jumped up and down in excitement.</p><p>Rio laughed as he lost his mind. “Fucking nerd.”</p><p>He beamed as he yanked Rio into a hug. “Thank you so much, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Damnit, the kid was happy because of her help. Is this why teachers do this shit for well over forty hours a week and make next to nothing? The little moments? She stiffened at the hug before giving him a quick squeeze back.</p><p>“It was all you, Nicky.” Rio said and pulled away.</p><p>“No, seriously, thank you. It's nice to have somebody who gets it.” His brown eyes filled with so much emotion, it made her feel something tight in her chest which she did not want to address.</p><p>“Anytime.”</p><p>Okay, maybe this job was fine. Just fine. Not good, definitely not rewarding. It was fine.</p><p>When lunch came, she debated on calling Agatha, knowing she was probably crawling up the wall waiting to hear about the flowers, but Rio waited. Delayed gratification never hurt anyone.</p><p>So far the wooing consisted of Agatha refusing to initiate sex, and flowers. Both well-intentioned but sure as hell not enough.</p><p>When 5pm came, Rio packed up for the day. She debated bringing the flowers home, but sounded like too much work. They could live on her desk for the next week, maybe make Rio smile when she was dealing with idiotic teenagers all day.</p><p>She got home, flung herself on the couch and pulled out her phone, clicking Agatha’s contact and calling. She picked up after two rings.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha said through the phone.</p><p>“I got your flowers.”</p><p>“I should hope so, they were marked as delivered.”</p><p>“My whole class went apeshit, started razzing me.”</p><p>“I tried to be inconspicuous, I only signed my initial.”</p><p>Why anyone in her class would know or care who Agatha was, Rio didn’t know. “I’ll give you a singular brownie point for the flowers, but I said no throwing money around.”</p><p>“No, you said don’t ‘just’ throw money around. ‘Just’ implies addition, meaning I can throw a little money around.”</p><p>“You’re really putting that ivy league degree to good use, huh?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “So how was your day?”</p><p>“You really wanna know?”</p><p>“I’m dying to hear how you sculpted the minds of tomorrow.”</p><p>She smiled. “Well, a kid in my freshman art class glued his hands together because his friend dared him.”</p><p>“Well fuck, society is shot to hell then.”</p><p>“You don’t even know, for every one kid I like, there’s another ten eating paste.”</p><p>“Teenagers are eating paste?”</p><p>“No, thank god, just vaping.”</p><p>She swore she could hear Agatha’s grin through the line. “Oh, please, we were so much worse.”</p><p>“I owe Sharon an apology.”</p><p>“Who’s Sharon?” Agatha genuinely questioned.</p><p>“Mrs. Davis… The principal…?”</p><p>Silence from the other end.</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Mrs. Hart.”</p><p>“Oh, Mrs. Hart!”</p><p>“Okay, you were worse than me.”</p><p>“I should offer to reimburse her for the therapy that I definitely caused her to need.”</p><p>Rio laughed and kept talking, they both did, seemingly all night. She hadn’t noticed the sun set, or the fact she was still in her work clothes, lanyard and all. They talked as Agatha made dinner, talked as Rio got ready for bed, talked as they both swore they had to sleep.</p><p>Same thing happened Tuesday too. Rio got home after work, called Agatha and discussed basically nothing all fucking night. Stupid shit, really.</p><p>“Would you still want me if I was a worm?” Rio asked in earnest as she made instant ramen that night, despite the fresh groceries sitting in her fridge.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha breathed. “What the fuck?”</p><p>“One of my students said it today.” She defended.</p><p>“Do I know the worm is you?”</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting follow-up questions.” Rio replied sardonically.</p><p>“I need context!”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio thought for a second. “Yes, you know I’m the worm.”</p><p>“Can you still talk?”</p><p>“No, Agatha, I’m a fucking worm.”</p><p>“How long is the lifespan of a worm?”</p><p>“Hell if I know. Are you saying you wouldn’t love me if I was a worm?!”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I’d love you if you were a speck of dust. Does that satisfy you?” She said, as if not knowing the weight of her admission.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, trying to push away the stupid warm fuzzies flowing through her veins. “God, how has no one clocked you yet, the closet is glass.”</p><p>After work on Wednesday, Rio did the same thing. Flopped onto the couch and called Agatha, but no answer. Huh. Okay. Ouch.</p><p>No, it’s not like they had discussed this, whatever this ‘calling each other at night and talking about their day's’ thing is. Plus, they weren’t together, not actually, so Agatha had done nothing wrong. Logically, Rio knew all of this, but she still found herself disappointed.</p><p>She groaned as she resolved to get up, have a beer, and grade shit all night. God, she needed to get back to her hobbies, like very badly. As she started sitting up, her phone buzzed, displaying Agatha’s name.</p><p>On instinct she went to answer right away, but her thumb hovered over the accept button. Again, delayed gratification. She waited until the second to last ring before answering.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio greeted.</p><p>“Fuck you, I saw you stare at the screen before picking up.” Agatha taunted.</p><p>Rio whipped around her surroundings, no sign of the other woman. “Okay…I feel as though I should let you know, stalking does not woo me.”</p><p>“Garage, my love.” Agatha instructed before the line went dead.</p><p>Confused, Rio crossed the living room, which had an open floor plan connecting it to the kitchen, and reached the side door in the kitchen that led outside. There stood Agatha in a simple sweater tucked into jeans, leaning against the door frame of the garage’s side door. And yes, she definitely had a clear view of where Rio was just sitting in the living room.</p><p>“You’re insane.” Rio said in lieu of an actual greeting.</p><p>“No, I’m whipped.” She corrected, “Which is sad since I just spent all my time and effort on this date.” And pouted.</p><p>“You could’ve just asked, you didn’t have to go all ‘Fatal Attraction’ on me.”</p><p>“Something tells me you would’ve left me waiting for an answer, so instead, I broke in.”</p><p>“There are laws saying I could shoot you right now.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and raised her hands in surrender. “Please don’t shoot, I’ll do anything.” She spoke in a faux-sexy breathy voice. Fuck, Rio actually kind of liked it.</p><p>“Fine.” Rio gave in. “But I’m changing first.”</p><p>Not looking back, she walked back into the house and ripped off one of the many band tees she frequently wore to teach. The jeans could stay on, she couldn’t look like she was putting in too much effort. She grabbed a deeply cut black camisole and pulled it on, undoing the clip that she had holding her hair up. She looked in the mirror before leaving, and-</p><p>She could be meaner.</p><p>She reached behind her back, unclipped her bra and pulled it out from underneath the top. Now her tits were only being very precariously covered by the lace of her top.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She met Agatha back at the garage doorway, noticing how her eyes not so subtly dipped to Rio’s chest before snapping back up to her face.</p><p>“Comfortable?” Agatha asked, brows raised.</p><p>“Yup.” Rio smirked.</p><p>Agatha waved her hand, indicating Rio to walk into the garage.</p><p>When she did so, she was met with candles scattered throughout her studio. Well, former studio, she hadn’t done much creatively since she’d moved back. The old fairy lights that no longer worked had been replaced with several new strings of lights. There was a box of pizza on the old coffee table, a six pack of beers next to it. Rio looked up.</p><p>“Those faded years ago.” Rio muttered, referring to the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. They looked like the ones from high school except they actually glowed.</p><p>“I got new ones.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“Your idea of a date is a definite fire hazard and pizza in my garage?”</p><p>“And beer, and one of those psychopath movies you like.”</p><p>“And you felt good about this?”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “You said I couldn’t throw money around, and what other plans did you have tonight?”</p><p>Damn her.</p><p>“I was planning on calling and talking to you.” She mumbled.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Don’t push it.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“You have to admit, this gesture isn’t empty.”</p><p>And no, it wasn’t empty, it was sweet. Agatha had hung new lights, peeled down and then stuck on new stars. She lit a concerning amount of candles, brought pizza and beer, and was about to endure a film she’d hate, all after presumably working a full day and parenting her kid. And all for Rio.</p><p>“What movie?” Rio skeptically asked.</p><p>“You think I’m stupid?” Agatha smiled and picked up a DVD case and held it up.</p><p>Of course it was Saw.</p><p>Rio had subjected Agatha to many a horror flick during their first go around, so it was telling that she had chosen that particular movie.</p><p>“Fine. One gold star.” She spoke and tried to fight the smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“I also have ‘Misery’ because I know you love Kathy Bates.”</p><p>Of course she had a backup.</p><p>The sense of deja vu that crept over Rio as they watched Saw was gnawing at her. They ate their food, drank their beers, and were almost but not quite cuddled up and touching on the same couch as when they first watched this together.</p><p>Then, as if on cue-</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha whipped her head away from the screen, head hovering oh so close to the crook of Rio's neck, but not landing.</p><p>“You’ve seen it before, baby.”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean I wanna see it again!”</p><p>“You literally planned this.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I should’ve gone with one of my numerous other ideas.” Agatha turned her head ever so slightly and cracked one eye open, looking at the screen.</p><p>“Do tell, what were these other ideas?” Rio turns her body to face Agatha, her date doing the same.</p><p>“Well, there’s an axe-throwing bar in Eastview I considered because of your affinity for sharp things and throwing the aforementioned sharp things.”</p><p>“Ugh, booze and blades, that’s so chaotic and hot.” Rio genuinely praised.</p><p>“I also thought once it got colder we could go ice skating at Rockefeller Center or the smaller rink we have in the town square.” Agatha kept going. “And I know it sounds cliche, but Westview has a great Christmas market. They also have a cute little farmer’s market in the spring so we could always get the stuff to rehab the garden…”</p><p>Rio momentarily tuned out because; what in the everliving fuck was going on? Agatha was sitting across from Rio throwing out date ideas that couldn’t happen until months in the future. Meaning, Agatha saw herself sticking around for literal months. Months that she intended on spending wooing Rio.</p><p>“And if you ever let me spend any money on you, I thought we could scope out a few galleries in New York this summer because N-”</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s face and kissed her, the movie forgotten. Unlike every other time they kissed, Agatha didn’t push, didn’t control, didn’t try to get the upper hand. She just let Rio kiss her.</p><p>Which was a beautiful thing because Rio had every intention on not giving this woman a fucking break. Rio bit down on her ex’s bottom lip, causing Agatha to open her mouth and let out a moan, using the perfect opportunity to slip her tongue against Agatha’s. She kissed Agatha like she was hungry, like if she stopped, she might show just how much everything happening here tonight was affecting her. Like she’d babble all the sappy thoughts running through her head.</p><p>She pulled away to push Agatha onto her back and straddle her, an inverse of what they had done for most of their relationship. Usually Rio was the one on her back breathless and writhing for the next move, but Agatha seemed hellbent on keeping her word. She was participating, but only passively, she followed Rio’s lead.</p><p>“Where’d this come from?” Agatha asked, hair splayed against the throw pillow, chest rise and falling, eyes almost completely black.</p><p>It came from Agatha putting in effort. From her multiple date ideas. From her assuming she’d be with Rio even months from now. From her trying and only slightly failing at making this god awful garage as special as it used to be. From her watching Saw again for Rio. From her breaking into her home like a stalker because she knew Rio well enough to know that she’d never get a straight answer about a date. From her worrying about the garden. It came from Rio starting to believe this time was really different.</p><p>But instead of giving any of that away too soon, she settled on the easiest option.</p><p>Delayed gratification.</p><p>“Figured I’d give you that gold star now.” Rio teased against the shell of Agatha’s ear, and felt a slight shiver from the women beneath her.</p><p>“What happened to the rules?” Agatha nearly whispered, her hands grabbing at Rio’s ass.</p><p>She let out an evil chuckle, grabbing the hands off her body and pinning them above Agatha’s head.</p><p>“They’re still in play.” And dipped her head to graze her teeth over that one spot underneath Agatha’s ear that always drove her insane. She arched her back and moaned again at Rio kissing and sucking down her neck.</p><p>“No hickies.” She graveled out between breaths. “Really don’t wanna explain that to my sixteen year-old.”</p><p>Rio smiled against her throat. “Where does your son think you are tonight?”</p><p>“On a date.” Agatha easily replied, definitely a little distracted seeing as she was staring right down Rio’s top.</p><p>Rio sat up and let go of Agatha’s wrists. “Are you supposed to tell your kid that kind of stuff?”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “It’s not like he’s angling for Ralph and I to get back together.”</p><p>“Okay well, I think we should call it for the night. I suddenly feel very awkward being on top of you after discussing your kid and ex-husband.” Rio slid off Agatha and watched the other woman sit up, hair mussed.</p><p>“Hey,” She softly prompted, hand brushing the hair out of Rio’s face. “What just happened?”</p><p>What happened was Rio got that jealous pit in her stomach about Agatha and Ralph. Their kid together. Which wasn’t fair to a kid she had never met, wasn’t fair to Agatha since she’d already divorced the man.</p><p>“I hate that you chose him…back then.” Rio said, not looking at Agatha.</p><p>“I do too.”</p><p>“So why did you?”</p><p>“He was the safe option. He’s what my mother wanted and I…” Agatha sniffled. “Do you remember when you called me a coward the day we broke up?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“You were right. I was. I should’ve fought harder for you.” She finished, her hand gently scratching at the root. “I am so sorry, Rio. If I could do it all differently, I would.”</p><p>She sounded sorry. All of her actions pointed to a feeling of guilt and remorse. And Rio really, really wanted to believe her.</p><p>“I have parent-teacher conferences on Friday night, but I’m free Saturday.” Rio finally looked at Agatha, leaving her to fill in the blank.</p><p>She smiled despite the watery eyes, she understood. “Rio, will you go out on a date with me this Saturday?”</p><p>Rio smiled too. “I don’t know.” Delay that gratification. “Something better might come along.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a simple kiss. “Please, my love?”</p><p>God damnit.</p><p>She situated herself back on Agatha’s lap. “I think it’s going to take some convincing.”</p><p>Agatha cautiously rested her hands on Rio’s waist, obviously ready for them to be smacked away. They weren’t, she’d allow them to stay. “However can I do that?” Agatha feigned innocence and asked, looking up.</p><p>Fuck, Rio really like Agatha looking up at her and waiting for directions. “I need to top you more often.”</p><p>That is, whenever Rio deemed Agatha worthy, which she still was not.</p><p>“Is it truely topping if I’m letting you? Kind of like arm-wrestling with your opponent’s hands tied up.”</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>“I can tie up your hands, baby.”</p>

<p>“Nicky, I’m leaving!” Agatha called up the stairs on Thursday night.</p><p>She heard her son crack open his bedroom door, letting out more of the music he was blasting. “Have fun at book club!”</p><p>Okay, so no hug or actual goodbye, fucking teenagers.</p><p>She felt bad for being so absent this week, both physically and mentally. Monday and Tuesday night she was glued to her phone, last night she was at Rio’s, and now book club. Or what they called book club, they really just sat around, drank, and bitched.</p><p>Not that Nicky said anything to her. When she had said she had a date, he just smiled and nodded, which Agatha did not know how to take. Was he actually happy for her? Just being nice because he knows his mom is lonely? That’s fucking bleak. He didn’t ask questions on who her date was, thank god, she was not ready to tell him she was trying to bone his favorite teacher. Or that said teacher is a woman.</p><p>And Rio was most definitely his favorite, especially after this week. She helped him develop some print because of 800 whatever, Agatha got the jist; he was getting attached. Great on one hand, but on the other, if Agatha fucked up again, Nicky could be the one who suffers. Not that Rio would punish him, Agatha knew she’d never stoop that low, but whatever bond they had would become strained.</p><p>Between Nicky and her mother, Agatha had a lot riding on this.</p><p>When she arrived at Wanda’s, she immediately poured herself a glass of wine, something to drown the stress in.</p><p>Wanda was rambling about the incompetency of Tommy’s track coach while Jen and Alice listened. Usually Alice didn’t come to book club, but Agatha had asked her to be there tonight…for support.</p><p>“He’s gonna bench my kid? He’s the fastest one on the team!” Wanda finished from her spot next to Agatha on the couch.</p><p>“Wanda, honey, stop exclaiming with your hands. Your couch is white and the wine you’re holding is red.” Agatha gently told.</p><p>“It’s eggshell.” Wanda grumbled, sipping her glass.</p><p>“Okay, well now that kids have been covered, please, let’s talk about something else.” Jen piped up from the armchair across from Wanda and Agatha.</p><p>Alice topped herself off, sitting on the floor next to the coffee table despite there being numerous other pieces of furniture where she could sit. “Yeah, anyone have any other news to share?” She asked, eyeing Agatha.</p><p>Wow. Subtle.</p><p>Fine, time to bite the bullet.</p><p>“I went on a date last night.” Agatha said, looking at her glass.</p><p>Wanda was on her in a flash. “WHAT!? You haven’t dated since the divorce! Who is it? Is this mystery man why you wouldn’t let me set you up with my brother?”</p><p>“No, it’s because I’m not dating Pietro, the kid had headgear.”</p><p>“And now his teeth are perfectly straight!”</p><p>Jen leaned forward. “Don’t deflect! Who’s the guy?”</p><p>She briefly locked eyes with Alice, who was trying to give her the courage to keep going telepathically. Why the fuck was she so nervous? It’s not like they’d have an adverse reaction. It was just weird admitting it out loud, the only person she’d ever said this to was Rio, and it was in the darkroom twenty years ago before distracting her with shoving her tongue down Rio’s throat. Otherwise, she’d always been confronted about it, like it wasn’t hers to actually tell.</p><p>Agatha took a breath, still looking at her wine. “Um, well…” She looked at Jen and Wanda, sitting on the edge of their seats, quite literally. “It was a woman.”</p><p>And the deafening silence after her admission was just perfect, really, inspired a lot of confidence.</p><p>After a beat, Jen rose from her chair and squealed, smiling like she’d just won the lottery. “Finally! I’ve dreamed of days like these! One of us, one of us, one of us!” She pointed to the redhead next to Agatha. “You’re outnumbered! 75% of this group now eats p-”</p><p>Alice grabbed her wife’s hand. “Babe, Agatha just came out, maybe give it a minute before bringing up pussy.” She yanked Jen back down onto her chair.</p><p>Wanda had been silently staring at Agatha with big eyes and scrunched brows through Jen’s display. “I didn’t know women were an option! I would’ve set you up with Monica from work.”</p><p>“Is that cause other than me and Alice, she’s the only queer woman you know?” Jen chided.</p><p>“No!” Wanda looked like a kid who just got her knuckles slapped with a ruler. “...yes.”</p><p>“I need details, when did this happen? When did you know? Who’s the girl? How far have you gotten?” Jen continued. “Do you need tips, because Agatha, I genuinely think you’ll enjoy sex with women way more than whatever Ralph was doing.”</p><p>She didn’t even know the half of it.</p><p>“It’s Rio.” Agatha quietly answered.</p><p>Again, another beat of fucking silence. The bitches.</p><p>“WHAT?” Wanda and Jen screamed in unison.</p><p>Agatha looked at Alice, pleading for a buffer.</p><p>“How about we all stop yelling?” Alice scolded.</p><p>“You hated Rio, always have, always did.” Jen ignored her wife.</p><p>Wanda was now uncomfortably close to Agatha’s personal space. “Since when?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to crawl into a hole and die at this point, she felt naked, vulnerable. “2005.”</p><p>She braced herself for more screams, which came, all overlapping with one another, none of them intelligible.</p><p>Agatha looked at the empty wine bottle on the coffee table, then down at her own almost empty glass.</p><p>She needed alcohol. More alcohol. As much as she could find, preferably.</p><p>Wanda and Jen were still screaming questions as Agatha got up and leisurely made her way to the kitchen where Wanda stored more wine.</p><p>“You can’t drop that bomb and walk away!” Wanda yelled, getting up and following.</p><p>“Get your sapphic ass back here, Harkness!” Jen strutted into the kitchen, with Alice not far behind.</p><p>Agatha damn chugged another glass as her friends interrogated her. “Ugh, it’s so cheap.” she recoiled. “You have to get better booze, Wands.”</p><p>“I’ll buy fancy wine when you tell me what the hell is going on.” Wanda retorted.</p><p>She stared at her friends, all huddled around the kitchen island, impatiently waiting for the lore.</p><p>“Okay, okay.” Agatha set down her glass and braced her hands against the counter. “To answer your question, Jen, I’ve known since senior year of high school, when Rio and I started dating.” She gave Jen a pointed look. “We hung out under the bleachers everyday during fourth period, we called it our spot. And I don’t know, something about talking to her felt…different. We kissed, and I freaked out. She said she didn’t wanna date a straight girl and I knew I wasn’t. So, I broke up with Ralph and we were together in secret all of senior year, basically.” Three sets of eyes were boring into her soul, but she continued. “And it was good. Like, it was what I knew I should’ve felt with guys.” She awkwardly cleared her throat. “I loved her. I still do.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you say something to us?” Jen softly questioned.</p><p>“Yeah, and why did it end?” Wanda gently added.</p><p>The answer to both their questions was the same; her mother.</p><p>“That’s a really long story.” Agatha solemnly stated.</p><p>“Why are you being so chill about all of this?” Jen looked at her wife with a raised brow. “You haven’t freaked out once.”</p><p>“Uhhh,” Alice nervously scratched the back of her head and avoided eye contact.</p><p>“Alice saw us. Not back then, after the reunion…in a compromised position.”</p><p>“You saw them fucking and didn’t tell me straight away?” Jen yelped.</p><p>“You had sex after the reunion?” Wanda asked at the same time.</p><p>“In my defense, I've been going through a roll of antacids, like, daily.” Alice shouted, throwing up her hands in surrender.</p><p>Agatha poured another glass. “I’m really going to need you all to shut the fuck up.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask anything!” Alice pouted.</p><p>“We’ve been…I don’t know what we are, but ever since the reunion.”</p><p>“You guys fucked in the bathroom at the bar, didn’t you? I knew you were gone for too long.” Jen accused.</p><p>Wanda cocked her head. “On my birthday?!”</p><p>“It was your fake birthday.” Agatha shrugged.</p><p>Jen stopped eye-murdering her wife for long enough to look at Agatha. “If you knew in high school, why the hell did you marry Ralph and say nothing about this for two decades?”</p><p>She let out a puff of air.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you this once, and literally only once, and then none of you so much as breathe a word of it again, got it?” Agatha bit out.</p><p>All three women bobbed their heads in agreement.</p><p>“We’d been together a while, the school year was almost over, and I was going to come out to you guys. I knew my mother would be worse, so I was going to wait until I got to college...”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to unearth that life-shattering memory, one she worked so hard to compartmentalize every single fucking day.</p><p>It was April, 2005, she was at her desk, dragging her feet through her homework. Senior slump was very much a real condition, one she wasn’t allowed to have, but still. She had seen Rio that afternoon, briefly, before her girlfriend had to run off to yearbook. Apparently all the nerds were losing their minds as everything went to press, Rio included.</p><p>Had Agatha known that afternoon would be their last moment together, their last kiss, she would’ve held Rio so much tighter, kissed her longer, defied science and frozen time to live in that moment forever. She would’ve clung to her and never let go.</p><p>But she didn’t know, so she sat in her room, doing fucking calculus at almost eight o’clock at night.</p><p>She heard her door open, and she stiffened, her mother never knocked, never gave her a warning or a heads up.</p><p>She braced herself as she heard footsteps approaching before her mother slammed something down over her textbook. The first thing Agatha noticed were the rings on her mother’s hands. Fuck she knew what that meant, the bitch always wore more rings when she pre-meditated her punishments.</p><p>Agatha’s heart raced as her mother’s hand gingerly slipped away, out of her line of sight and the paper she had slapped down came into view.</p><p>Rio. Happy and smiling, not a care in the world as she looked up at Agatha behind the camera. There was something written on the back, but Agatha wasn’t going to flip it over and find out right now. Her stomach dropped and her throat closed, her eyes glazed over with tears. She didn’t dare look up at her mother.</p><p>“Did you know I’m on the board of Westview Presbyterian hospital?” Evanora said, calm and poised.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer, but it seemed the question was rhetorical.</p><p>“I know most of the staff and faculty. I was there today when I ran into a nurse. Cheery, enthusiastic, personable. We started talking and she asked how nice it was that our girls were friends.”</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>Her mother kept going, looming over her daughter’s frozen body. “You can imagine my surprise since I know Jen and Alice’s mothers. But this woman’s name was Victoria, daughter named Rio.”</p><p>She hated the way Rio’s name sounded in her mother’s mouth.</p><p>“I thought I had noticed you acting differently lately. Disappearing more, mouthing off, head seemingly in the clouds.”</p><p>Happy. Agatha was happy and that’s what was strange.</p><p>“So I took it upon myself to see what this Victoria woman was speaking about. You left this in your backpack.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even realize Rio had developed it, let alone slipped into her bag. She never cleaned the thing out, just shoved months worth of papers in and hoped for the best.</p><p>“End it.” Evanora ordered.</p><p>Her knee-jerk reaction was to comply, obey out of self-preservation.</p><p>But as she thought about it, Agatha realized she was an adult, a legal one anyways. She’d be moved out of this house in four months, living her own life, a life she wanted with Rio. And if there was ever a time to stand up to her mother, a reason for fighting back, it would be now, it would be for Rio.</p><p>“No.” Agatha said, still looking down at the photo.</p><p>What would her mother do? Disown her? Kick her out? That would be a mercy at this point, she’d be free.</p><p>“No?” Her mother confirmed.</p><p>Agatha finally looked up. “No. I love her.”</p><p>The sound of palm hitting skin rang out in the otherwise silent room. And though she had seen it coming, the slap still startled her. She brought her hand up to cradle the side of her face that now felt hot. The tears already pooling in her eyes before were now doubling down, ten-fold.</p><p>“I was afraid you’d be stubborn.” Evanora said, not acknowledging the outburst. “So I did some research. Victoria Vidal, 39. Moved to the states from Puerto Rico in ‘85. Went to nursing school at night while raising her daughter, no father on the birth certificate. She’s been working at Westview Presbyterian ever since graduating. Owns that decrepit bungalow on the edge of town with a criminally high mortgage rate. Must be why she’s always working and can’t seem to keep her daughter in line.”</p><p>Oh, she had severely underestimated her mother.</p><p>“Being on the board means I have a lot of pull, Agatha, enough to get someone fired should I choose.”</p><p>“Mother, please-” Agatha spoke out of turn and her mother’s hand swiftly made contact again. She tasted metal on her tongue this time, blood.</p><p>“She could find work elsewhere. Not at a hospital, of course. I’d let the ones in the surrounding area know how she stole drugs, or abused patients, or gave sexual favors for preferential treatment. But she could waitress or strip, I’m sure.”</p><p>The threat was not lost on Agatha, but her mother really insisted on hammering it home.</p><p>“As for your friend,” Oh, that’s what she was going to call Rio? “I saw on your computer your interest in the distance between Princeton and NYU.”</p><p>She was going for Rio’s ticket out of here, what she had worked so hard for, what she’d been destined to do.</p><p>“I happen to know the dean of admissions at that school, old friend. I’m sure I could call in a favor and have her acceptance rescinded.” She crouched down to Agatha’s eye level. “Unless you choose a wiser course of action.”</p><p>Agatha tears were dripping down her face, a face that felt sore, she felt where the metal left an impact on her cheekbone.</p><p>“You have no idea how hard I have worked for you to have this life, Agatha. The sacrifices. I have built a company and a family, of which I expect perfection. You had one job and you failed to do it.”</p><p>It didn’t matter if Agatha became the fucking chemical engineer to cure cancer, she’d still fail in her mother’s eyes. She’d still glower at her with contempt.</p><p>“Why do you hate me?” Agatha’s voice quivered.</p><p>“You were born evil, I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body.” Evanora reasoned like it was as clear as the sky on a summer's day.</p><p>“Please, I can be good.” She choked out through tears, through the cut in her lip that was tricking blood into her mouth.</p><p>“No you cannot.” Her mother stood straight again, lording over Agatha. “End it. Crawl back to that nice boy Ralph and pray he takes pity on you. If you ever bring her up again, I will make sure to take care of it.”</p><p>Evanora started walking towards the door, before turning around momentarily. “So, are we clear, Agatha?”</p><p>Beaten into submission, Agatha obeyed. “Yes, mother.”</p><p>With that, Evanora left, the door softly clicking shut in her wake.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think about that day often, tried not to. She had the bullet points of the conversation and that's all she cared to remember. Not the body wracking sobs, the way she missed the following three days of school because of the bruising under her eye and the scabbing on her lip.</p><p>No, she didn’t care to remember any of it.</p><p>She finished the story and looked up at Wanda, Jen, and Alice across from the kitchen island. All of them froze with this look of horror.</p><p>Wanda, the sap, pulled her into a hug, soothingly stroking her back.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Agatha. I’m so, so sorry…” Wanda softly spoke, trying to comfort.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t crying so she didn’t know why Wanda was acting like she was, but she sunk into the embrace nonetheless.</p><p>Jen started manically jogging from spot to spot in the house. “Where are my keys?! I’m driving to New York and strangling her myself!”</p><p>Alice stopped her. “Okay, I love the energy. But you would not survive prison, no matter how much ‘Orange Is The New Black’ we’ve watched…”</p><p>“Then I’ll burn the body! No body, no crime!” Jen whined.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and untangled herself from Wanda, who almost refused to let go.</p><p>“Does Rio know?” Wanda asked, and that got Jen to halt, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“No, and she can’t. Same threats still apply, she’ll burn Rio’s life down.”</p><p>“Okay, we need to regroup.” Jen spoke and started pacing.</p><p>“Regroup?” Alice echoed.</p><p>“Evanora is blackmailing Agatha, right? So, we just need to dig up something on her and she’ll fuck off.” Jen hastily explained.</p><p>Wanda raised her eyebrows. “We all know she’s done some shady shit.”</p><p>“Yes, but my mother never leaves a paper trail, she’s not dumb.”</p><p>“Well, your mother is closing in on seventy.” Alice reasoned. “Maybe back then she was good at keeping shit behind closed doors, but in her old age? You’re telling me the old broad hasn’t gotten a little sloppy?”</p><p>Jen nodded. “Yes! She’s fucking ancient, she’s bound to have messed up somewhere! There’s been so many generations of iPhones since she was in her prime, we just need to find the paper, or more likely, electronic trail. How many folks over sixty-five do you know who actually clear out their email?”</p><p>These stupid, stupid women were trying to help Agatha. Didn’t even think twice, just started plotting. “You guys really don’t have to do this.”</p><p>“Shut up, we're scheming.” Wanda scolded and poured herself and Agatha another glass.</p><p>“Does anyone know a PI or a hacker?” Jen was still pacing back and forth in Wanda’s kitchen.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, let me just call my guy.” Agatha sarcastically replied.</p><p>“Really?” Jen stopped pacing.</p><p>“No. I’m rich, I’m not Batman.”</p><p>“Not helpful, Agatha!” Wanda reprimanded.</p><p>“Why don’t we ask Vision?” Alice questioned. “He works in IT, right?”</p><p>“Something like that, honestly, I zone out when he talks about his job.” Wanda spoke through her wine glass.</p><p>“Does he know enough to hack somebody?”</p><p>The redhead shrugged. “Probably, what else do they teach computer nerds in college?”</p><p>Jen beamed. “Okay, so Vision hacks your cunt of a mother, you profess your undying love for Rio, and have a summer wedding where I’m your maid of honor. Done, we solved it!”</p><p>They did not solve it, Agatha was pretty sure none of them knew what hacking entailed, Agatha sure as hell didn’t. But it was more of a plan than she had come up with, and it was sweet of them to try.</p><p>She bristled at the touchy-feely emotion she was experiencing right now. “Fine. We’ll do it.”</p><p>Then Wanda gasped out of the blue, as if receiving a message from god. “You and Rio had sex under those bleachers, didn’t you? Rio told me she lost her virginity under those bleachers.” Green eyes glitched back and forth in realization. “I feel like I’m putting so many things together right now.”</p><p>Finally, something happy to think about.</p><p>With a shit-eating grin, Agatha responded. “Good times.”</p>

<p>A pair of pale hands adorning black chipped nail polish and several rings slammed onto her desk and into her line of view at 8AM on Friday morning. Rio didn’t look up from the tests she was grading, she knows Billy needs no prompting to start yapping.</p><p>He’s panting like he sprinted up the two flights of stairs it takes to get from the ground level to the art wing. “I-I” He deeply inhales oxygen. “I know who you’re dating.”</p><p>Does the kid have asthma? How is his twin getting scouted by colleges for being the fastest teen in New Jersey, and yet Billy cannot handle a brisk jog?</p><p>“Your mom finally told you?” Rio said and moved on to the next paper in the stack.</p><p>“My mom, my-” He finally stood straight and puffed out his chest to allow more air flow.  “Jesus christ, I need to start working out with my dad and Tommy.”</p><p>“Did she finally wake up next to him in the middle of the night, with her head in her hands, realizing she’s nothing more than his wife? And when she thinks about me all of those years ago-” Rio taunted, halfway through grading the current test in her grasp.</p><p>Billy cut her off. “It’s my aunt Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s red sharpie stopped mid-correction as she lifted her head from her work. She looked at the boy, trying to keep her expression neutral. Maybe whatever proof he had could be explained away, because how the fuck did he figure it out? It’s been less than a week.</p><p>She stood and looked past a smug Billy to the rest of the class. “Listen up, gremlins! I’m giving you a free period to work on whatever assignments you may have fallen behind on, doesn’t matter if it’s for this class or another. Also, parent-teacher conferences tonight, so none of you better rat me out, I swear to god. Got it?”</p><p>The class all nodded and mumbled in agreement, Rio hastily shuffled her spotify and zeroed her attention back on Billy. “Hallway. Now.”</p><p>Suddenly, Billy looked a lot less smug.</p><p>After she’d closed the classroom door and walked down the hall a little ways so none of her class would hear, she turned to the boy who just stared. “Well?”</p><p>That seemed to get him started. “Oh! So, every week my mom has her friends over for book club, except it’s not really a book club. And they think that we don’t know, but it’s pretty obvious considering I never see any of them with books-”</p><p>Yes, Rio was already familiar with this information.</p><p>“Billy! The point?”</p><p>“Okay, so I was in my room upstairs because my dad and Tommy were at the batting cages and as we’ve established just now, I’m not all that athletic. At first I couldn’t hear anything beyond some idle chatter every now and then, but then I heard my aunt Jen yell something about ‘One of us, one of us’ so I snuck downstairs and eavesdropped on the staircase.”</p><p>“Dude, not cool.” Rio crossed her arms, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>“I know, but in my defense, they were like legit screaming. Like, I probably could’ve heard most of the conversation from my room.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek and waited.</p><p>“Oh, anyways they asked Agatha who she was dating and she said a woman, and then there was more screams and then she said it was you, more screams, you get the pattern, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, got it. What else?” Should she feel guilty about plying a minor for information? Maybe. Did she? Not even a little.</p><p>“They just screamed some more and drank more wine. I also heard things that I definitely shouldn’t have. Things involving a reunion and a bathroom.” Billy awkwardly averted his gaze.</p><p>Rio’s face scrunched. “You weren’t supposed to hear any of it, you little punk.”</p><p>“Who calls people punks anymore?”</p><p>“Okay, so was that it?”</p><p>“Basically, other than the whole therapy session. I have to give you two props, though,  your love story is very Romeo and Juliet-coded.”</p><p>Her and Agatha’s story was many things, but other than being horny teens, it was nothing like Shakespeare. “What the fuck are you on about, kid?”</p><p>“You know, the self-sacrifice? One family threatening to take down the other? Montagues and Capulets, two star-crossed lovers? Doomed but bound to one another?” He supplied like Rio was dumb.</p><p>“Yes, I’ve read Romeo and Juliet before, I passed ninth grade English. I mean, how does any of that relate to me and Agatha?”</p><p>He didn’t seem to realize the amount of information he truly had. “Because Agatha’s mom made all those threats all those years ago, and she sacrificed her happiness for yours. But now you two are in love again!”</p><p>She tilted her head at him, trying, for the love of god, to understand what he was talking about. “Billy, from the beginning, I need to know everything you heard, as you heard it. Can you do that?”</p><p>Ten excruciating minutes later, the boy finished recounting the entire night. “But I swear that’s all I know! I dipped once aunt Jen started looking for her keys to go kill Agatha’s mom.”</p><p>“Good woman, that Jen.” She responded, but it felt vacant. “Just, don’t say any of this to anyone else, okay?”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Rio sent Billy back to class, but she stayed in the hallway. She needed a minute to process everything just relayed to her from a fucking teenager rather than her kind of-almost-maybe girlfriend.</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall, trying to catch her breath, which had seemingly abandoned her.</p><p>Twenty fucking years had gone by and Agatha never thought to tell her? Tell her about the threats? Or about the abuse? Honestly, Rio didn’t know what she was more enraged about, the lies or  Evanora still having a pulse while Victoria didn’t.</p><p>No, what enraged her most? The lost time. The time spent apart because Agtha sacrificed herself willingly for Rio. The time spent where Rio hated her because she was kept in the dark. The time spent with Evanora controlling Rio’s life from afar.</p><p>Then a horrifying thought crossed her mind, was Evanora still controlling everything? Why else would Agatha not give a single fuck about coming out to her friends, but hesitate with her mother? She had to still be in control. Why else would Agatha keep this from her? Agatha didn’t feel shame about her sexuality, she felt shame about her family, her mother.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t lying when she said she was scared, but not scared for herself; scared for Rio.</p><p>Too many emotions flooded her at once.</p><p>Heartbreak, sorrow, grief.</p><p>She fumbled finding her phone and called Agatha, maybe Billy heard wrong. Maybe her and her mom weren’t used as collateral. Maybe, Agatha broke up with Rio all those years ago because she just felt like it. Maybe Rio wasn’t blind to the abuse Agatha was suffering at the hands of her mother. Maybe none of what Billy said actually happened.</p><p>Because if it did, that means Agatha had just spent twenty years protecting her, all the while Rio thought she was the villian.</p><p>The line trilled, but no answer. She settled for a voicemail.</p><p>“Hey, baby,” Rio’s voice trembled from anxiety. “Can you call me back as soon as you get this? Okay, um-”</p><p>‘I just need to see you.’<br/>
‘I love you.’<br/>
‘I’m sorry.’</p><p>Any of them worked, really, just pick one.</p><p>The door to her classroom opened and a student’s head popped out. “Miss Vidal? I need your help, I knocked over the bath in the darkroom.”</p><p>She wanted Agatha to physically be here, now, to explain. Rio needed to yell at her, and shake her, and fucking hold her.</p><p>“Te veo.” Rio ended the call and made her way back to class.</p><p>The rest of the day passed Rio by with no response from Agatha. Normally, she’d be leaving school at this point in the night, but instead, she plastered on a smile and listened as parents inflated their kids' egos. Some parents came in with their kids, others were alone. Rio preferred when the kids were there because at least she knew someone in the fucking meeting. She felt like she was putting on a show, she didn’t cuss at or ridicule anyone and it felt unnatural.</p><p>Hours had passed, the sun was gone and she was cheking her phone every five fucking minutes for a call or text from Agatha.</p><p>She looked at the kids sitting across from her, really looked at them. They were so young, and small. At sixteen Rio thought she knew everything, at eighteen she knew that she knew everything. And yet, she didn’t have a fucking clue. Not a fucking shred of an idea of what Agatha went home to every night, why she snuck out so often; Rio’s house was safe. She was just a kid, putting on a front so nobody, not even her own girlfriend, knew her mother was hitting her behind closed doors. Rio tried to focus, she really did, but as another parent and their kid got up to leave, she couldn’t recall a single thing they had just talked about.</p><p>She looked at her phone again, and nothing, no messages, not a voicemail, zilch. Agatha never went this long without getting back to her. She was debating calling again, thumb hovering over the contact-</p><p>“Boo.”</p><p>Rio jumped, not having been paying attention. “Jesus fuck-” When she looked up, there stood the woman she’d been trying to reach all day. Makes sense, she was probably here for her son’s parent-teacher conferences.</p><p>“Between you and me, is there anything I could do for some extra credit, Miss Vidal?” Agatha purred, obviously joking and failing to read Rio’s face.</p><p>She sprang up from her chair and nearly tackled Agatha with how quickly she rounded the desk and hugged her. Well, maybe not hugged, so much as compressed with as much force as she could.</p><p>“You never called me back.” Rio mumbled into Agatha’s neck, which she was currently trying to bury herself in.</p><p>Though clearly thrown off, Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio. “I’m sorry, I forgot my phone at home today, only had my work cell. I didn’t know you called.”</p><p>“You’re so fucking stupid.” She said it softly, like she didn’t actually mean it. She did, just not about Agatha forgetting her phone.</p><p>“What’s up? You seem off.” Agatha asked, voice strained with concern.</p><p>Rio pulled back fractionally and noticed a few sideways glances from passing parents and kids in the hallway. Right, they were in school.</p><p>“Come with me.” Rio dragged Agatha along with her into the darkroom.</p><p>“Rio, what’s wrong?”</p><p>She closed the door behind them and faced Agatha. “Were you ever going to tell me?”</p><p>Agatha stared, confused. “Tell you..?”</p><p>“That your mother was blackmailing you! That she probably still is! That she’s using me as leverage! That she used my mom as leverage! That, I don’t know, the past twenty years of my life were not at all what I thought they were.” She whisper-shouted, the darkroom was further from the hall, but it wasn’t soundproof.</p><p>“How’d-”</p><p>“Next time you have book club, make sure the kids are out of the house.”</p><p>Agatha worked her jaw for a moment. “I wanted to tell you, I was going to-”</p><p>“When? After we’d slept together again? After another year of dating? When were you planning on telling me, Agatha?” Rio’s voice was laced with frustration.</p><p>“After I fixed it!” She snapped. “It’s my mother, it’s my cross to bear. I wanted to protect you. I just wanted to handle it so that way you wouldn’t worry.”</p><p>“I’m a grown woman! I don’t need you to protect me, I need you to tell me the truth.”</p><p>And Agatha looked tired, defeated almost. Like holding onto everything from the past made her bones heavy. Her posture deflated.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re right. I’m sorry, Rio. I thought I could solve it on my own.” Agatha breathed out, exasperated.</p><p>Rio took a couple steps forward so she was almost flush against the other woman. “You’re not on your own.”</p><p>“I should’ve told you. I should’ve told you then. I should’ve tried to tell you everyday, and I’m so fucking sorry.” Her voice shook with remorse.</p><p>“No, you were trying to keep me safe,” Rio brought her hands up to hold Agatha’s face. “Mi amor, you’ve carried so much for so long. You have people around you who can help. You have your son, and your friends.” She brushed her thumb over the highpoint of Agatha’s cheekbone, idly wondering if that’s where her mother had hit her that night. “You have me.”</p><p>Even with only the soft red glow of the overhead lights, Rio could see the weight of her words as they registered with Agatha.</p><p>“I do?” Agatha sounded so small.</p><p>“I understand why you did what you did all those years ago. I understand why you didn’t say anything back then, but now?” Rio kept eye contact, seeing the shame well in her love’s eyes. “I’m not mad, baby, I just need you to tell me these things, okay? That’s what a relationship is.”</p><p>She hoped it would soothe Agatha, the last thing she wanted was to send her into fight or flight mode. She was hurt, sure, but she also knew Agatha was hurting worse. And she was mad, just not with Agatha.</p><p>Rio continued. “So, whatever happens next, we figure it out together. Can you promise me that?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands clasped over her wrists, holding. “I promise.”</p><p>They weren’t done talking about this, but it wasn’t exactly something they could hash out completely right now. And honestly, Rio didn’t want to. She had spent the day in with her stomach in knots waiting to see Agatha, and now that she had the woman in her hands, she didn't want to let go.</p><p>“You told your friends about me.” Rio grinned.</p><p>Agatha huffed out a tired chuckle. “I think they’re our friends now, Jen’s already planning our wedding.”</p><p>“What season?”</p><p>“Summer.”</p><p>She smiled. “Too hot.”</p><p>“That’s what I was thinking too.” Agatha quipped. “I really am sorry for not saying anything.”</p><p>“We’ll sort it all out later.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped down Rio’s body. “Why are you dressed like a Mormon missionary?”</p><p>And Rio laughed, for the first time all day, something brought her enough joy and comfort to find something funny. “Had to impress the parents. Looked up outfits on something called teachertok? Apparently those women have something against pants.” She said in reference to the dress and chunky cardigan she was currently wearing.</p><p>“Well I am most certainly impressed.” Agatha smirked, sliding her hands to rest of Rio’s waist.</p><p>“Why are you dressed like Bette Porter?” She asked, looking at Agatha’s navy pantsuit and heels.</p><p>“Came straight from work.”</p><p>God, did she envy the people who worked in Agatha’s office for being graced with sight of her in a button up and slacks every day.</p><p>“You should wear your work clothes more often.”</p><p>“I should?” She asked incredulously.</p><p>Rio fisted her fingers into the lapels of the suit jacket. “I love a woman in a suit.” She mumbled and kissed Agatha slowly, gently, as if to ring out all the stress from the day.</p><p>It was soft, and reassuring, and a small comfort she could offer them both. Until she felt the hands on her waist dig in ever so slightly, as if restraining themselves. Taking the cue, Rio sped her movements, kissing Agatha deeper, hungrier, until they were both frenzied.</p><p>She didn’t break the kiss as she pushed Agatha against a workbench, which student it belonged to, Rio couldn’t really find herself to care at the moment. She brought her hands to Agatha’s hair as the other woman’s lower back collided with the edge of the table, jostling whatever equipment was laying on top. Rio dug her fingers in at the root, angling her head and adding tongue, a soft groan emitted into the room as a result. Forgetting where they were, Rio slid her thigh between Agatha’s and pressed, causing the other woman to shudder and pull Rio closer.</p><p>She felt the roll of Agatha’s hips and her nails bite into Rio’s sides, kissing her like she might disappear if they broke apart even for a moment. Rio’s lungs started to protest at the lack of oxygen between the women, but Rio would sooner rather die than pull away from her.</p><p>Agatha ground down on Rio’s thigh, moaning at the friction. She needed to hear that again, Rio needed it like she needed food and water; she needed Agatha. She tensed her thigh, giving Agatha more, she’d give this woman fucking everything. Everything Rio had, everything she was, she’d happily hand over to Agatha. Finally breaking apart, Rio lazily kissed down a neck she’d thought about for twenty years, letting her tongue run over the hammering pulse point.</p><p>“Rio-” Agatha moaned at the feeling of teeth against her throat. “Baby, the rules.” She softly admonished.</p><p>Rio pulled away, trying to catch her breath. “Agatha,” She huffed. “I don’t fucking care.” And released her grip on the untamed locks atop her girlfriend’s head to find purchase at the button of her slacks. She deftly undid the button before pulling on the zipper of what she was sure were very expensive designer slacks that fit Agatha in a way that should be studied.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha whimpered, jutting her hips forward to help.</p><p>Rio connected their lips once again, trying to swallow Agatha whole, trying to-</p><p>“Mom?” A voice from Rio’s classroom called out.</p><p>They both froze, staring at one another.</p><p>Right, they were at fucking school.</p><p>She knew that voice, she heard it five days a week.</p><p>“Mom?” Nicky’s voice repeated, a little louder this time.</p><p>“Shit.” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio detached herself, albeit begrudgingly, from Agatha. “I got it.” She reassured, pressing a quick peck to her lips, and started walking towards the door.</p><p>When Rio reemerged from front the darkroom, eyes readjusting to the light, she saw Nicky by her desk.</p><p>“Hey, kid, what’s up?” She smiled, trying to cover for the fact that she was a minute away from fucking her girlfriend in a tax-payer funded darkroom.</p><p>Nicky smiled back. “Hey, Miss Vidal, sorry I didn’t realize you were in here. Have you seen my mom?”</p><p>How the fuck was Rio supposed to know if she had seen his mom?</p><p>“No, I don’t think s-.” She spoke and of course that was the moment Agatha exited the dark room, pants buttoned, hair maybe only a little fucked up.</p><p>“Hey honey, sorry, Miss Vidal was just showing me some of your work.” Agatha beamed, but her voice not fully normal sounding yet, still a little breathy.</p><p>Honey?</p><p>Nicky looked between the two of them. “What’d you think?” He asked, eagerly awaiting an answer.</p><p>“Next Ansel Adams, for sure.” Agatha proudly responded before winking.</p><p>Sorry, what the fuck was going on?</p><p>Rio, oblivious, “What?”</p><p>Nicky chuckled. “I don’t think my mom knows that many photographers because she’s definitely used that line before.”</p><p>Mom?</p><p>Agatha grinned. “It’s him and Annie Leibovitz, after that I’m out.”</p><p>No, because Rio must be having a tiny stroke right now.</p><p>She looked at Agatha, then Nicky. Then Agatha, then Nicky. Back and forth over and over again in quick succession.</p><p>Her brain was working to catch up. “You two know each other?” She squeaked, eyes wide.</p><p>Nicky furrowed his brows. “Miss Vidal,” he pointed at Agatha. “That’s my mom.”</p><p>Rio felt like she was buffering.</p><p>She’d been making the ‘I’ll fuck your mom’ jokes to the wrong kid this whole time.</p>

<p>“Right.” Rio faltered. She briefly looked over to Agatha who was seemingly enjoying watching her struggle. Sadist. “Sorry, I don’t know where my head is at today. Low blood sugar.”</p><p>Nicky kept staring in confusion when, thank whatever cruel god, Billy and Wanda bound in. Billy’s smile immediately dropped as he looked at Rio, then looked between Rio and Agatha, then at Nicky. Wanda, however, lit up when she saw Rio and Agatha standing next to one another.</p><p>The ginger in question smirked. “We’re here for parent-teacher conferences.” And Billy looked like he wanted to find a rock to bash his head in with.</p><p>Rio shared that sentiment. “He’s passing and talks too much. End of conference.” She deadpanned.</p><p>“Wow, Nicky and Billy really paint an accurate picture of you as an educator.” Agatha muttered under her breath.</p><p>“Okay, well you were our last stop,” Wanda began. “Agatha, we were wondering if you and Nicky wanted to grab dinner with us. Vis and Tommy still have some more meetings.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio and Nicky before turning her attention to Wanda. “Oh you were?”</p><p>At least it took the heat off of them because Nicky turned around. “I’m so in.”</p><p>Wanda, the evil bitch, opened her mouth again. “Miss Vidal, would you like to join us?”</p><p>No, she would like to have ten more minutes with Agatha in the darkroom. Okay, thirty. Fine, an hour. No, like three hours. Honestly, she needed a bed for what she wanted to do to her right now.</p><p>“I’m good.” Rio said.</p><p>“You sure?” Agatha asked, she looked genuine.</p><p>“Please Miss Vidal?” Nicky damn near begged. “I can pick your brain!”</p><p>He did not want to see the thoughts in her brain right now lest he be psychologically scarred for life and give Freud a run for his money.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “I’m not really hungry.”</p><p>“You just said your blood sugar was low.” Nicky furrowed those fucking eyebrows again.</p><p>“She did, did she?” Wanda questioned.</p><p>“She did.” Agatha confirmed.</p><p>These fucking people.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll go.” She scoffed.</p><p>“Great!” Wanda preened. “Boys, how ‘bout you go grab your stuff from your lockers and meet us out front?”</p><p>Billy and Nicky agreed and left, Wanda waited until they were down the hall to strike.</p><p>“Sooooo,” She sing-songed. “What have you guys been up to?”</p><p>Agatha flipped her hair over her shoulder. “Nothing.”</p><p>Wanda nodded insincerely and approached Agatha. In one fell swoop, Wanda reached down and zipped up the zipper on Agatha’s pants that she had obviously forgotten to do back up before leaving the darkroom. “You should be a little more covert when doing nothing.” She pulled back and winked.</p><p>Okay, she was officially at her breaking point. “Your son, the emo one, he listened in on your coven’s conversation last night and told me everything. Feel free to ground him.”</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. “Coven?”</p><p>Wanda just gave a mom look. “Understood, he’ll be dealt with.”</p><p>“Was the zipper obvious?” Agatha looked down at her pants.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No, mi amor.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “The fabric covered anything, I think you’d have to assume you two were fucking to even notice.”</p><p>Her girlfriend-</p><p>Was she Rio’s girlfriend?</p><p>Her girlfriend let out a breath of relief.</p><p>“But you two are good?” Wanda asked, referring to the many revelations last night caused.</p><p>“Never better. That is until Nicky almost caught us.” Agatha started. “Did you really not know he’s my son?”</p><p>Looking back, there were clues-</p><p>Nicky’s eerily similar snort-laugh.</p><p>The engraving on the camera.</p><p>The shitty dad stories.</p><p>Señor Scratchy.</p><p>The obvious wealth.</p><p>The makeshift basement darkroom.</p><p>The azaleas.</p><p>-Oh, she she was a fucking dumbass.</p><p>But actually no because-</p><p>“His last name is Scratch!” Rio defended.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “It’s Ralph’s mother’s maiden name, I wasn’t going to curse my kid with the last name Bohner and Ralph refused to let it be Harkness despite the fact I grew and carried the damn child for nine months.”</p><p>Rio brought her finger to the bridge of her nose in frustration. “God, he’s such a fucking tool.”</p><p>“And that’s why my boys have my last name.” Wanda clapped her hands together. “So, food?”</p><p>And that is how Rio found herself at Westview’s best (and only) steakhouse with her student, her high school bestfriend and also mother to said student, her favorite student, and her favorite student’s mom who’d she very much like to fuck. She bagged a MILF and none of these people would leave her alone with Agatha long enough for her to enjoy it.</p><p>Agatha was at the head of the table with Rio and Nicky on either side of her. Billy was next to Nicky, and Wanda was next to Rio.</p><p>The fact that they all went to high school together came out relatively early in the meal as Wanda kept using her first name and asking her about the house and Victoria. The boys weren’t stupid, they knew Wanda and Agatha went to high school together, so logically they made the connection.</p><p>“What was high school like in 2005?” Billy asked over his plate of pasta.</p><p>“Nothing crazy.” Agatha chirped.</p><p>“Oh we were so boring.” Wanda dismissed.</p><p>These lying fucking liars. Their kids had no clue who they were way back when.</p><p>“What were you like in high school, Miss Vidal?” Nicky asked in between bites of his burger.</p><p>Oh, how she was going to run with this. “Ever seen Mean Girls, Nicky?”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Ah fuck.”</p><p>“Billy dragged me to the musical reboot last year.”</p><p>“I don’t care what critics say- masterpiece!” Billy cut in.</p><p>Rio grinned. “I was the lesbian played by Lizzy Caplan.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed her food and spoke. “Janis wasn’t a lesbian, it’s explicitly stated at the end of the movie.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “There’s subtext there.”</p><p>Nicky chuckled. “So who was my mom?”</p><p>She turned her head to look at Agatha who was staring daggers at her.</p><p>Rio set down her fork. “She, my dear young impressionable child, was Regina George.”</p><p>Billy choked on his sprite, obviously he knew of the subtext.</p><p>“Really?” Nicky looked at Agatha.</p><p>“Yes! She was a fucking cheerleader.” Rio reasoned.</p><p>He looked back at Rio. “I know, she still has the uniform in her closet-”</p><p>Agatha still owned that? Interesting. Very fucking interesting.</p><p>“But she was in national honor society and graduated valedictorian, I just assumed she was kind of a geek.”</p><p>Rio set her elbows on the edge of the table. “Kid, the stories I could tell you…”</p><p>“No! No stories needed.” Agatha quickly scolded.</p><p>“Really, we just sat around and gossiped.” Wanda tried to save face.</p><p>No fucking way was Rio not taking this opportunity.</p><p>“One time, during sophomore year, Agatha bullied our principal so bad that Mrs. Davis clutched her chest in panic and screamed ‘My heart! My heart!’ before fainting.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened before whipping his neck to look at his mom. “You gave Mrs. Davis a heart attack?!”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw in frustration. “No. It was an angina flare up. She was fine.”</p><p>Rio giggled. “Yeah a flare up caused by anxiety from you. Agatha called her Mrs. Hart from then on and it just stuck.”</p><p>“So were you guys friends?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha. “I don’t know, Agatha, were we friends?” She taunted.</p><p>She was now squirming in her seat as she answered Rio. “I’d say we were friendly.”</p><p>And now Billy just choked on air, coughing and hacking. “I’m fine.” He wheezed. “Totally fine.”</p><p>Wanda leaned over to her son. “William Maximoff, get it together.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Nicky, please keep in mind-</p><p>And suddenly the kid’s eyes doubled in size, gasping like a freight train just hit him.</p><p>“-It was a different time.” She finished.</p><p>Nicky sat up straighter. “Please keep me in mind!”</p><p>Jesus, those words were like a trigger and Rio was a sleeper agent. She hadn’t remembered those words strung together in that order in decades.</p><p>“What?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Please keep me in mind! I knew I recognized you! Last year I was going through my mom’s jewelry box looking for her weed stash-”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and looked at her son, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>He corrected. “I mean stash of, uh, something, definitely not drugs. When I found an old photo of a girl. It was in black and white and on the back it said ‘Please keep me in mind’ with a heart, but the name was smudged. I didn't realize it was you because of the eyeliner and the blonde chunks in your hair and the nose piercing, and well, you were young. I- I mean, younger!”</p><p>Agatha kept that photo all those years? She still had it? Even after it had caused her all that pain? She kept that little part of Rio with her throughout college, and motherhood, and an awful marriage? Something to bring her happy memories; like the azaleas.</p><p>And now that Rio thought about it, Nicky’s camera being engraved in the same way as hers was also a way Agatha carried Rio with her. And the spanish she tried to teach Nicky with Señory Scratchy. The way she supported Nicky’s interest in photography. She had infiltrated every aspect of Agatha’s life without ever even knowing.</p><p>Twenty years of love.</p><p>Twenty years of longing.</p><p>And she hadn’t ever even considered reaching out to Rio in New York out of her own selflessness.</p><p>Rio swallowed the emotion. “Those were era appropriate highlights.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over to her son. “Nicholas Victor Scratch, so help me god, we will be talking about this when we get home-”</p><p>Victor-</p><p>Like Victoria.</p><p>“Victor?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>Agatha looked over at her like a deer in headlights.</p><p>“Yeah, mom got the name from a nurse working in the maternity unit when I was born.” Nicky took a bite of his burger, blind to the origin of the name, the weight of it.</p><p>Agatha looked embarrassed. “I was hopped up on drugs, she was there all forty-two hours. Ralph and my mother were MIA, she stayed past her shift with me so I wouldn’t be alone. I didn’t even realize I’d done it until we sent off the birth certificate.” She quietly explained, making sure nobody else at the table could hear.</p><p>So she was too out of it for his middle name, but not his last? Rio doubted that.</p><p>She wanted to cry. She wanted to sob.</p><p>Twenty years of love.</p><p>Love Rio never felt, but that didn’t make it any less tangible.</p><p>Any less real.</p><p>She looked at Agatha, willing her eyes to stay dry. “Consider me woo’d.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, the real one that reached her eyes like it did all those years ago. Suddenly they were eighteen and no time had been lost, no threats had been made, no dreams had been crushed, it was just them.</p><p>“So you guys did know each other because why else would you have the picture?” Nicky scrunched his face.</p><p>Rio liked this kid, she really did, felt a certain type of kinship with him, but damnit, what a massive cockblock.</p><p>Rio looked at Nicky. “Yeah. Um, yeah. We were friends.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to have some social awareness because she quickly distracted the kids from the fact that Rio and Agatha were all but eye-fucking each other. “Should we look at a dessert menu?”</p><p>An hour later, the group left the restaurant with the rest of the meal going relatively smoothly. Which thank fuck for that because Rio didn’t think she could handle anymore revelations today.</p><p>Outside, Rio found herself messing with Nicky while Wanda and Agatha said their goodbyes, doing that thing moms do where they say bye and then one of them brings up something new and they talk for another five minutes before repeating the process over.</p><p>Her hands held out as Nicky tried to smack them before she pulled away at the last second, causing him to miss them all together.</p><p>They’d been at it for however long Agatha and Wanda had been talking, not that Rio was waiting around for something. Not for a hint that they’d see each other tonight, or when Nicky was going to Ralph’s, or when the house would be empty. No, she was just spending quality time with her favorite student.</p><p>She held out her hands again, Nicky missed again. “Damn you, Miss Vidal.” He playfully cursed.</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you, be fucking faster, dude.” She impassively replied.</p><p>“Okay, you try then.” He held out his hands steady.</p><p>Rio smirked. “You think your mom and aunt are okay over there?”</p><p>Nicky glanced over to them as Rio shot her hands down, smacking his in victory.</p><p>“You cheated!” His voice cracked slightly.</p><p>“All I’m hearing is that I won.” She shrugged.</p><p>He placed his hands out again. “Best two out of three.”</p><p>“Care to put some money down on that?” She chuckled, setting up to smack his hands again.</p><p>“Please don’t give my child a gambling addiction.” Agatha quipped as she approached them.</p><p>Wanda and Billy waved goodbye as they headed to their car, Rio and Nicky waved back before returning to their game.</p><p>“One sec mom, Miss Vidal has a lot riding on this.” Nicky said, hands out and ready to yank them back.</p><p>“Maybe when we’re outside of school, you just call me Rio.”</p><p>With the information that Nicky was Agatha’s son, she thought first names might be a good first step.</p><p>Nicky shot his eyebrows up in surprise. “Really?” And Rio smacked his hands again. “Stop distracting me!”</p><p>Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Stop making it so easy!” She motioned for his hands again, and he placed them out.</p><p>“Do I wanna know why this is what you guys chose to entertain yourselves with?” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“It’s fun.” Nicky shrugged, hands rigid and ready to fly back at any moment.</p><p>“Yeah, fun and violent.” Rio smiled, hands above Nicky’s.</p><p>“What more could you ask for?” He said, eyeing Rio’s hands, waiting.</p><p>“Oh god, and now there’s two of you.” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“It’s not like you have somewhere to be, I’m sure the kid would rather prolong going to Ralph’s.” Rio spoke and whipped her hands down, narrowly missing Nicky’s.</p><p>“Ha! You missed! Gotta make this next one, Rio.” He elongated her name, dragging out the ‘O’ sound.</p><p>“Stick 'em out then, Victor.” Rio taunted, elongating his middle name by rolling her R’s. Her cheeks were starting to hurt from all this damn smiling.</p><p>He did so and waited, when her girlfriend piped up almost apologetically. “Ralph’s at a work conference in Philly, Nicky’s home this weekend.”</p><p>Maybe it was her own petulance at not getting laid, maybe it was the denial of getting to pounce on Agatha back in the darkroom, but a sudden burst of annoyance flowed through her as she brought her hands down.</p><p>“Fuck.” Nicky laughed as his hands were successfully hit again.</p><p>“I win.” Rio said, but it didn’t fucking feel like it. “I take cash or venmo.”</p><p>With the utmost respect to Nicky-</p><p>Cock. Motherfucking. Block.</p><p>“Okay, enough violence for one night.” Agatha declared and fished out her keys. “Nicky, can you go start the car?”</p><p>He took the keys. “Can I drive home?”</p><p>She looked at her son and gave a gentle nod.</p><p>“Hell yeah,” He took off towards the car across the parking lot. “See you Monday, Rio!” He shouted as an afterthought.</p><p>“The one time I count on a man for something!” Rio looked at Agatha.</p><p>“Why’d you think he wasn’t at the school?”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “‘Cause he’s a shit parent!”</p><p>“Would it make you feel better to know that Nicky’s sleeping over at Wanda’s tomorrow?” Agatha said, briefly checking to make sure Nicky was in the car and unable to see them before wrapping her hands around Rio’s waist.</p><p>Praise be, there was a higher power out there.</p><p>“Maybe.” Rio slung her arms around Agatha’s neck, playing with the ends of her hair. “You know what would really make me feel better, though?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>She leaned in to whisper in Agatha’s ear. “Bending you over in that cheer uniform and fucking you with my strap until you can’t walk the next day.”</p><p>Rio often had that fantasy, the uniform may have been a new addition, but ever since the night of the reunion-</p><p>‘Did you think about me while you fucked him? Did you think about my cock inside you instead of his?’</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>“Would that make you feel better, baby?” She innocently asked and felt fingers bunching into the fabric of her dress.</p><p>The other woman let out a wanton huff of air and gave the same response she did when she was riding Rio’s fingers almost two months ago. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio pulled away from Agatha, and gave her a sweet kiss before stepping back all together. “Then I’ll see you tomorrow night, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha groaned as Rio kept slowly walking to where she had parked.</p><p>“You’re cruel!” She shouted.</p><p>Rio turned and kept moving, flashing her teeth. “Yup and now I’m gonna go home and masturbate to what I would’ve done in that darkroom.”</p><p>Luckily, she was parked on the opposite side of the lot, no chance of scarring her student with that admission.</p><p>“You’re sick in the head!”</p><p>“Goodnight.” Rio chuckled as she reached her car.</p><p>Agatha finally started moving from where she was standing. “Good night, my love.”</p>

<p>Rio spent Saturday with her hand in a permanent claw around her phone, waiting for the sacred ‘all clear’ text. But that text, much like Rio, wouldn’t come for many, many hours.</p><p>Desperate to find ways to kill time, she started the project she should’ve finished two months ago. Dealing with a half-packed up house. She hadn’t moved a thing, just maneuvered around boxes whenever need be. She wasn’t really living in the place, so much as sleeping and eating in it, surviving.</p><p>The question wiggled its way into her head as she started looking around; was she packing or unpacking?</p><p>When she had first moved back, she was determined to keep this place as her mom left it, but now it felt like one giant shrine to Victoria’s death. She started putting things away to try and help her daughter after she died, and what was her daughter doing? Treading water? Rio could restore the place back to its former glory. Almost all of her past memories in this house were rosy and had a vibrant orange hue laid over them. Planting azaleas in the backyard, pasteles with her mom and Agatha, the nights spent with her girlfriend tangled up in her arms. Those memories brought comfort, warmth.</p><p>The recent ones? Her mom barely being able to move from the kitchen to the living room without having to catch her breath, the dilapidated garden, coming home after the funeral, drinking herself into a stupor with cheap tequila the day before she first ran into Agatha again. Those memories were all gray, lifeless.</p><p>She could just leave the house like this, barely maintained and almost ready for a surprise eviction. She wasn’t letting go of Agatha, not again, not a chance in hell. Evanora would have to snipe Rio to get her to disappear from her daughter’s life. Not that she wouldn’t put it past the harpy. But Rio also had to be realistic, Evanora had the means and motive to take this house away whenever she damn well felt like it. Rio had made some progress, but she was a public school teacher, the bills and the debt were still crushing her.</p><p>Rio knew she’d survive without this house, but it didn’t make it hurt any less. Her growth markers were still etched on the archway in the kitchen. Her mom’s bedroom was still preserved as it was from when she was alive, untouched, like Rio was still waiting for her to come back. Like she wasn’t really gone.</p><p>Victoria had killed herself getting the down payment for this place, and continued to kill herself to keep up with the mortgage, how she pulled it off, Rio would never know. What she did know was that if her mom were here right now and knew everything that Rio did; the threats, the blackmail, the seemingly undying love Agatha held for two decades. She’d probably look her daughter in the eye and say something like-</p><p>‘And what are you going to do about it, mija?’</p><p>Rio’s first instinct was the same as Jen’s-</p><p>Find Evanora and make her die a slow, painful death.</p><p>But her mom’s voice in her head made her stop.</p><p>Stupid fucking motherly guilt apparently transcended mortal planes of existence.</p><p>She thought about Agatha. About how she never really let go of Rio. How their love was passed on through hidden gestures, little momentos, and through Nicky. Rio may not have contributed any genetic material to that kid, but hell, it could’ve fooled her. He had her mother’s name, her artistic ability, and his eyes lit up the same ways hers did. Okay maybe that’s just because their eyes are both brown, but Rio could dream.</p><p>Dream of that domestic little life she’d thought she’d never have with Agatha. But instead of nameless faceless kids running around, it’d be Nicky. Her and Agatha and Nicky having dinner at the end of the night, her and Nicky annoying the shit out of Agatha because it’s just too easy, her and Nicky playing video games together while Agatha scolds them for said game being too violent. It didn’t hurt to dream.</p><p>Nicholas Victor Scratch was a good name, all things considered.</p><p>Nicholas Victor Vidal-Harkness was better though.</p><p>No, too soon.</p><p>It’s been a week. Or two months if she started counting from the reunion. Or twenty-one fucking years if she’s really getting technical.</p><p>Rio looked at the box at her feet labeled ‘books’ and then at the bookshelf that sat against the living room wall.</p><p>She could leave them there, compressed in cardboard, give up and accept that even though she’d keep Agatha, she’d lose everything else.</p><p>Or-</p><p>Unpack them, unpack everything and fight. Fight for her house, fight for her mom’s memory, fight for Agatha.</p><p>‘And what are you going to do about it, mija?’<br/>
</p><p> Rio forcefully ripped the packing tape off the box and began shoving books back onto the shelf. She’d make the place alive again.</p><p>Out of death-</p><p>Life.</p><p>After the first box, it was like Rio was possessed. She gutted whichever box she could find in her sight and meticulously returned each knick or object back to its rightful place. And god, Rio really loved her mom, but some of this shit was not as tacky as she remembered. How did her mom, lover of all things pink and hyper feminine, give birth to and raise a lesbian who decorated every one of her former apartments with blacks and greens? Then again, how did a treacherous bitch like Evanora give birth to and raise an empathetic smartass like Agatha?</p><p>She was though most of the house when her phone buzzed, she looked down and-</p><p>A text should not bring as much joy as this one did, the beautiful, glorious text letting Rio know that the house was, in fact, all clear.</p><p>Shit, she didn’t realize she’d spent the whole day unpacking, she was still in her sweatpants and hoodie. She texted back, letting Agatha know she’d be there in an hour and bolted down the hall to shower. She’d been so distracted by her own emotions, she almost fucking forgot that she had her hot, hopefully cheer-clad girlfriend waiting on her.</p><p>When she got there, her jaw fucking dropped at the sight of the home. Rio double checked the address Agatha had sent and, yup, she was at the right place.</p><p>It was a Cape Cod style house, well Rio didn’t know if she could call what was essentially a micro mansion a ‘house’. As if Rio wasn’t already aware of the Harkness’ vast wealth, this was just a great reminder. She stood on the porch steps, neck craned upwards, mouth agape. Why the fuck did they need all this space? It was just Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>“You know you’ve already kept me waiting.” Agatha’s voice broke whatever poor person spell Rio was under. The front door was open and there she stood, and goddamnit, no uniform. Just a green and purple robe with her hair pulled back.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Do you even pay property taxes on this thing? What does the insurance cost?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Why do you sound like someone's dad assessing the property value of my home?”</p><p>“When the revolution starts, I’m eating you first.”</p><p>She grinned. “Promise?”</p><p>Rio met Agatha in the doorway. “Do I wanna know what‘s under that robe?”</p><p>“Do I wanna know what’s in that bag?” Agatha parroted and pointed to the bag Rio had slung over her shoulder.</p><p>Bag, not backpack, she wasn’t a twenty-two year old fuckboy. She had a respectable tote bag concealing her strap…like an adult.</p><p>“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.” Rio husked.</p><p>“Sure you’re going to be able to handle the rest of the house, or are you going to ask me how much my mortgage is?”</p><p>Rio yanked Agatha in by the firmly tied piece of silk around her waist. And leaned in. “That depends…did you get a good rate?” And crashed her lips against Agatha’s, pulling her into a bruising kiss before shuffling them past the doorway and into the house. Rio kicked the door closed behind them, intending to drag Agatha to wherever her bedroom was in this godforsaken manor, but she felt Agtha push her backwards against the front door.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue felt like it was staking claim in her mouth, trying to overpower her. And no, not again, this was not how she was going to let things go tonight. Agatha’s hands were pinning her hips against the door as Rio fisted her hands in Agatha’s hair giving a firm tug so her head snapped back.</p><p>The ponytail Agatha’s hair was currently in was going to come in very handy, Rio realized. She licked the skin from the hollow of Agatha’s throat to her ear before whispering. “Bedroom.”</p><p>Agatha nodded as much as she could with the hold Rio had on her hair, blue eyes clouded with lust. She let her hold go as Agatha grabbed her hand and led her upstairs.</p><p>Suddenly she wasn’t paying attention to the opulence of the house anymore, just Agatha in that damn robe which Rio was going to burn if she didn’t take off soon.</p><p>After the longest hallway of her life, Agatha opened the door at the end, revealing her room. Rio had never seen Agatha’s room, not even in high school, but it was undoubtedly her. Dark wood toned furniture, creams and lilacs sprawled throughout, and most importantly a bed with a king sized mattress.</p><p>She slung her bag somewhere, she’d find it later, and pushed Agatha against the first wall she could find. She fumbled with the tie on Agatha’s robe, carelessly pulling on the material to get to what was underneath. Whether it was the uniform, lingerie, or just Agatha completely naked, Rio needed to see.</p><p>“Aren’t we eager?” Agatha mused, slightly breathless.</p><p>Rio ignored that comment and finally undid the knot on the fabric, releasing the tension and revealing what lay beneath.</p><p>Big bold WHS letters stared at her, embroidered across the front of the cheer top. The matching red, white, and black pleated skirt barely skimmed Agatha’s mid thigh. Rio’s mouth ran dry at the sight. The last time Rio had seen her in this was probably one of the numerous times in the backseat of a car, and her eighteen year old self definitely did not have the sexual experience to appreciate it like her adult self was about to.</p><p>And even though Rio had hinted at it, she didn’t know if Agatha would really do it. “You wore this for me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “What can I say? I like the bad boys.”<br/>
</p><p> Fine, she’d indulge the roleplay. “But baby, what about your big, dumb jock boyfriend?” She feigned confusion and slid her hand under the skirt as Agatha slipped off the rest of the robe.</p><p>“I don’t let him go all the way.” Her breath hitched as Rio’s hand reached the apex of her thighs.</p><p>Agatha had forgone underwear under the uniform, making it easy for Rio to tease her fingers through the already wet and soft skin of her girlfriend’s pussy.</p><p>“Does he get you this wet?” Rio asked, but she already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha’s hands flew to Rio’s hair. “No.”</p><p>She immediately removed the hands in her hair and pinned them to the wall. “No touching.”</p><p>Agatha cruelly chuckled. “Or what?”</p><p>“You wanna find out?” Rio squeezed the wrists in her grasp as she asked, and suddenly Agatha’s grin disappeared. “Or are you going to be good?”</p><p>The blue was barely showing in the other woman's eyes as she nodded, pupils blown wide. “I can be good.”</p><p>“We’ll see.” Rio taunted and dropped to her knees, rucking up the very little fabric that was currently an obstacle. “Hold this for me.” She commanded.</p><p>Agatha complied, keeping the fabric bunched as Rio slung a leg over her shoulder and dove her face against her cunt. She pressed her tongue flat against Agatha’s clit and licked, causing her to let out a gasp and arch her back. Rio brought her hands to Agatha’s hips to keep her steady, making sure her nails bit into the flesh.</p><p>God, she had missed the way Agatha tasted, it was like finally downing water after wandering the desert for twenty years. She felt ravenous, messily dipping her tongue into Agatha’s entrance to get more. She wasn’t trying to be precise, she wasn’t trying to get Agatha off right now, this was for Rio’s own enjoyment.</p><p>Agatha’s hips tried to roll forward, demanding more, but Rio just pinned her hips back.</p><p>She heard a whiney, “Baby-” above her, but paid it no mind, running her tongue through Agatha before sucking lightly on her clit. She repeated the process over and over again, never staying in one spot long enough to satisfy. She looked up at Agatha whose head was thrown back and knuckles were white as they clutched the fabric of the skirt.</p><p>Rio heard the soft moans and heavy breaths come from her girlfriend, who was trying so hard to behave. But Rio wanted to see her break her rule. She grazed her teeth ever so slightly against Agatha’s clit, causing the other woman to loudly moan and grab at Rio’s hair, trying to pull her closer.</p><p>She pulled away and looked at Agatha.</p><p>“No-” Agatha whimpered. “Love, please, I forgot.”</p><p>Rio smiled, face shiny, and grabbed the silk tie from Agatha’s robe off the floor before standing. “If you can't keep your hands to yourself, I’ll have to do it for you.”</p><p>She placed Agatha’s wrists together in front of her, feeling no resistance as she methodically bound them together. She finished the knot and looked at Agatha. “How’s that feel?”</p><p>And Agatha, panting and slumped against the wall in her old cheer uniform, now bound, looked back at Rio. “Good.” She whispered, eyes trained and waiting for Rio’s next move.</p><p>“Get on the bed for me, baby.” Rio ordered, watching as Agatha sat on the edge. She found her bag, retrieved her strap and harness and threw it next to Agatha on the bed. Keeping eye contact, Rio stripped off her shirt and jeans, then her bra and underwear until she was completely naked.</p><p>Agatha stared, eyes tracking every movement as Rio pulled on the harness and threaded through the dark green strap-on, making sure it’d grind down against her own clit just right when she was inside Agatha.</p><p>“You want it?” Rio taunted.</p><p>She looked desperate, hands twitching against the silk like she wanted to reach out and touch. “So bad.”</p><p>Rio flashed an evil smile. “Show me how bad, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha flickered her eyes to the appendage between Rio’s legs and nodded in understanding, scooting as close to the edge of the bed as possible, hands tied and resting in her lap. She opened her mouth and looked up.</p><p>“Good girl.” She praised and wrapped Agatha’s ponytail around her hand and closed it in her first, watching as the tip disappeared between perfect full lips. Watching as Agatha moved back before taking more of the length. Rio didn’t push, just held and let Agatha bob her head slowly at first.</p><p>But if there was one thing Agatha Harkness was; it’s determined. Apparently wanting to give a show, Agatha looked up innocently and batted her eyelashes before taking Rio’s cock deeper until her nose was almost flesh with Rio’s abs. And she couldn’t help herself, as Agatha pulled back, Rio finally used the leverage on her hair to yank her forward again. She moaned around the strap as Rio pushed her hip forward, sending vibrations through the silicone.</p><p>She really needed to remember to make a ‘head’ cheerleader joke to Agatha tomorrow.</p><p>“You look so pretty sucking my cock.” Rio praised, snapping her hips forward, fucking Agatha’s throat. “Do you like when I use your mouth?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were glassy as she moaned again in agreement, tears welling on a particularly powerful thrust. When she gagged, Rio loosened her grip on her hair, fearing she might’ve gone too hard. But even without pressure on the back of her head, Agatha kept going, silently letting Rio know she was fine.</p><p>Everytime Agatha took her deeper, Rio felt it against her clit, causing a delicious friction. She knew she could come from this if she kept going, and she told herself she’d wait until she was fucking Agatha, but as the tip of the strap hit Agatha’s soft palette, she lost it. She thrust faster, Agatha’s gagging was something out of Rio’s wet dreams. She didn’t want it to end and Agatha was looking up at her so obediently, with so much affection. Without meaning to, Rio’s hand in Agatha’s hair squeezed, restricting the other woman’s movements as something inside her snapped. Her cock was still halfway down Agatha’s throat as she came, her eyes slamming shut and feeling her orgasm pull her under in waves.</p><p>Through the haze, Rio pulled out of Agatha’s mouth completely so that her girlfriend wouldn’t choke. She quickly brought her hands to cradle Agatha’s face. “I’m so sorry baby, are you okay?” Apologizing for not pulling out sooner.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice was scratchy and strained. “Please fuck me.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “So you’re okay?”</p><p>She gave a gentle nod, eyes pleading. “I need you inside me, please.” It came out as a whimper.</p><p>Fuck, it was not too soon, Rio needed to marry this woman.</p><p>“Turn around and get on your knees.” She ordered and watched Agatha situate herself in Rio’s chosen position. She climbed on the bed behind Agatha, placing her hand on her back and encouraging her to bend over. The skirt rode up, barely covering Agatha’s ass. She flipped it up and took in the sight.</p><p>Aagtha’s head on the mattress, ass in the air, back arched, hands tied, and cunt dripping. Rio could see the stickiness shine down Agatha’s toned thighs. Eighteen year old Rio would die, thirty-eight year old Rio planned to fuck her into the bed.</p><p>She brought the tip to run through Agatha’s pussy, hearing a breathy whine in return. “You ready, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just moved her hips back until she sunk onto the strap, moaning. Rio grabbed her hips and pulled farther back, watching as the shaft was swallowed.</p><p>“Fuuuck-” Agatha husked. “So-” she gasped as Rio bottomed out. “So big.”</p><p>Rio chucked, slowly thrusting. “Bigger than him?”</p><p>The fact that man ever saw or had any part of Agatha enraged her.</p><p>The woman below her mewled before she responded. “So much bigger.”</p><p>Moving her hips a little faster but still gently, Rio rewound her hand into the ponytail. “Good girl, taking me so well.”</p><p>“I’m not going to break, Rio. Fuck me.” She said and moved her hips against Rio harder.</p><p>Music to her fucking ears.</p><p>Rio pulled out almost completely, before snapping her hips forward at the same time she pulled Agatha’s hair towards her.</p><p>“GOD.” Agatha screamed, neck pulled taut by Rio’s grip.</p><p>She didn’t stop. She wasn’t gentle as she began a punishing pace, slamming into Agatha and making sure she was taking it to the hilt on each thrust.</p><p>“That’s it, baby, take it all.” Rio cooed. “Let me use you. Take all of me.”</p><p>She couldn’t see Agatha’s face, but from the sobs escaping her lips, she could imagine it was blissed-out. She couldn’t literally feel the inside of Agatha, but she felt how tight she was, how her pussy was clenching around Rio’s cock.</p><p>“Baby,” She breathed out in between Rio’s thrusts. “I-I’m close, I’m…” Her elbows, which she was using to hold herself up, buckled, head hitting the mattress.</p><p>“Not yet, not until I say.”</p><p>“Please, my love.” She begged. “Please, please let me come for you.”</p><p>The headboard was repeatedly hitting the wall, the bed frame sounded like it was about to break, Rio’s breath was getting thinner and she felt sweat starting to bead in her hairline.</p><p>“Let go, my love.”</p><p>Agatha screamed as her body stiffened, her back bowed and her thighs trembled as Rio felt her cunt pulse around the length buried inside of her. Rio peppered light kisses down her back as she came, her orgasm leaving her body almost convulsing on the bed.</p><p>Her body went limp and Rio slowly pulled out, a whine leaving her throat at the loss. Rio gently helped her roll over and started undoing the silk tie, freeing her wrists. The cheer uniform was completely disheveled, the skirt essentially useless.<br/>
She helped Agatha strip out of the uniform and lay back against the pillows. The uniform was hot, but Agatha completely bare was by far her favorite way to have her.</p><p>“Can you handle another?” Rio asked as she climbed between plush, creamy thighs.</p><p>“You thought we were done?” Agatha croaked, her voice was shot.</p><p>Rio smiled, kissing down Agatha’s collarbones and sternum before bringing her head up to give her girlfriend a slow, filthy kiss. This time she didn’t consume or rush, she just enjoyed the feeling of her lips against Agatha’s, a feeling she’d never tire of, a feeling she craved for twenty years and would for the rest of her life.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand wrap around the strap and guide her forward. Sinking into Agatha again, she rolled her hips. This time, she was methodical, making her thrusts deep and slow. Agatha’s arms slung around her neck, hooking a leg around Rio’s back and pressing, encouraging.</p><p>“Fuck, I love you.” Agatha whispered, eyes closed.</p><p>Her rhythm stuttered but didn’t stop. They hadn’t said that yet, not this time around, not as adults. Rio wasn’t even sure she meant it, maybe it was just the heat of the moment. But then those cloudy blue eyes looked into hers.</p><p>“I love you, Rio.”</p><p>Okay, that time it felt targeted.</p><p>She knew she loved Agatha, she never stopped, but she wasn’t planning on saying it while seven inches deep.</p><p>But she wouldn’t be Agatha if she didn’t still find a way to fluster Rio while literally getting fucked. Rio huffed out a tired laugh, still pumping.</p><p>“I love you, baby.” The breath from her admission fanned out in the fractional space between their faces. “So much.”</p><p>She felt herself on the edge, she reached between them and brought two fingers to Agatha’s clit, massaging.</p><p>Rio moaned and fought against her own orgasm, trying to make Agatha fall first.</p><p>Hands tangled themselves in her hair and fisted as Agatha threw her head back, coming and snapping her back nearly in half. Rio finally let go at the sight, dropping her head in the crook of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>They stayed enmeshed like that for a while, Rio still inside of Agatha as she soothingly ran her hands through her hair. Waiting for their breathing to even out again, their bodies to calm down.</p><p>She finally pulled out, the strap sticky and shiny. Rio made quick work of taking off the harness, throwing it into the en suite bathroom and returning to the bed.</p><p>“Where are your jammies?” Rio quipped.</p><p>Agatha laid nearly catatonic on the plush duvet, pointing to the huge oak dresser against the wall.</p><p>Rio pulled out two pairs of pants and a shirt for Agatha before recognizing a piece of clothing. She pulled out her chopped up Bikini Kill shirt that she thought she’d lost in the move from Westview to New York.</p><p>“Thief!” Rio accused, holding up the shirt.</p><p>Agatha lazily raised herself, resting on her elbows. “I just blew you. Call it even.”</p><p>She smiled and pulled on the shirt. “Fair enough.” And put on a pair of Agatha’s linen sleep pants. She walked back over to Agatha on the bed.</p><p>“How about I go get us some water while you get dressed?”</p><p>Agatha noded. “Thank you, baby.”</p><p>She kissed her forehead and bound downstairs, and damn, now she could take in the opulence. She walked into a kitchen that resembled something on HGTV and opened the smart fridge. Grabbing two bottles of water before rummaging through the walk-in pantry and scurrying back upstairs.</p><p>Agatha was dressed in a Fleetwood Mac t-shirt and linen pants that matched Rio’s, exiting the bathroom now without makeup and her hair down.<br/>
</p><p> Rio thought she looked better than she did when she was wearing the cheer uniform. Not that she’d forget about that uniform though, she’d frame that fucking thing.</p><p>She held up her loot. “You really are rich, you buy name brand.” Referring to the box of Cheez-its tucked under her arm.</p><p>Agatha snorted and got into bed.</p><p>Rio followed suit, climbing in next to her and handing her a water. Agatha pulled her in closer so that she was tucked against her side. Rio set her water on the nightstand before opening the box of crackers.</p><p>“You’re eating my son’s snacks.” Agatha spoke.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I also ate his mom. He’ll live.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up the next morning with her head buried in Rio’s neck, feeling the steady breathing of her-</p><p>Girlfriend?</p><p>Girlfriend, right?</p><p>They wouldn’t have done what they did last night, ‘I love you’ and all if they weren’t together…right? Because if they weren’t, then what were they? What was Rio trying to get out of this? And if that were the case-</p><p>“It’s too early for your brain to be thinking that much.” Rio grumbled, eyes closed.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “It’s-” She peeked at the clock on her nightstand. “Nine AM. Plenty of people think before nine in the morning.” Her voice was hoarse from the night before, raw.</p><p>“Not on a Sundaaay…” Rio whined, wriggling further into the bed.</p><p>She smiled and burrowed deeper against Rio’s throat, gently pressing her nose against the soft skin, inhaling the scent that was so uniquely Rio. Like bergamot and something else, she wanted to fucking snort it.</p><p>“Are you sniffing me?” She asked.</p><p>Agatha peered up. “You can’t prove anything.”</p><p>Two pools of amber finally came into focus and looked down. “Creepy fuck.”</p><p>She didn’t respond to that, just started kissing down Rio’s neck, lazy open-mouthed kisses. She snaked one hand under Rio’s shirt, finding her left breast and palming it.</p><p>Agatha kissed up the column of her throat before nibbling on her earlobe, rolling Rio’s nipple between her index and middle finger. Rio arched into the touch, exhaling a shaky breath.</p><p>“Agatha,”</p><p>“Hmm?” She responded, swinging her leg over Rio’s hips so she was straddling her, bringing her other hand to push up the shirt. She didn’t remove it, just bunched it up over her collarbones.</p><p>“Did I not fuck you well enough last night?”</p><p>She did, and that was the issue. Agatha had spent the past two decades with an almost non-existent sex life. There were the handful of women during college, and most unfortunately Ralph, but nobody else. And those experiences weren’t fulfilling, just hollow. The women in her late teens and early twenties were placeholders for what she really wanted, who she really wanted. She didn’t even let them return the favor, she’d just bolt after getting them off. And Ralph-</p><p>Jesus christ, fucking Ralph. He never did grow out of the whole ‘finishing in like thirty seconds and sucking at making out’ thing. The silver lining was, at least anytime they did have sex, it was over quickly. And those occasions were few and far between, but when it did happen, Agatha treated it like a shame-ridden mormon would. Lights off, clothes on, and immediately drowning herself in a scalding hot shower afterwards. Whenever he asked about it, Agatha always claimed she ‘just wasn’t a sexual person’ and of course the dumbass bought it.</p><p>She’d spent the years getting off using her own hand or one of her numerous vibrators whenever she needed it. Because the truth was; Agatha was a very sexual person when she was with who she wanted. So last night, when Rio treated her the way she did, said the things she said-</p><p>‘That’s it, baby, take it all. Let me use you. Take all of me.’</p><p>Rio had opened Pandora’s box of twenty years of sexual repression, and now she’d face the consequences.</p><p>Agatha sucked a mark to the pulse point of Rio’s neck. “I want more.” Now grabbing both Rio’s tits, lightly pinching her nipples, causing them to pebble.</p><p>She let out a soft moan. “More?”</p><p>Agatha nodded before bringing her mouth to Rio’s chest, kissing, biting, licking, hearing her soft breaths become sharp. She wrapped her lips around one of the hardened nubs, sucking and swirling her tongue. She wasn’t lying in Rio’s kitchen a week ago, they were great tits. Probably the best she’d ever seen in her life, and now she could show them the appreciation they deserved.</p><p>She released it with a wet pop and slithered her hand under the waistband of Rio’s pants, well, actually they were her pants but either way they were an obstacle in the current moment. She ran her fingers over the short patch over hair before dipping ever so slightly and grazing Rio’s clit.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and threw her head back, hands flying to Agatha’s hair, nails pressing against her scalp.</p><p>“More.” Agatha hummed and ran her digits through Rio’s cunt, already slick. “Is this from last night or right now?”</p><p>“Both.” She shuddered.</p><p>Her other hand was still playing with Rio’s breast as she spoke. “I wanna wear it next time.”</p><p>The woman beneath her nodded. “Yeah.”</p><p>She slowly sunk two fingers in as she continued. “I wanna make you ride me.” She started pumping, Rio’s hip rolling in tandem.</p><p>“Yes.” She husked.</p><p>She curled her fingers on the next thrust, and Rio hands clamped down in her hair.</p><p>“I wanna make you beg for it, I wanna see your face as you sink down on my cock.”</p><p>Rio’s chest was heaving, face flushed.</p><p>“I wanna see your eyes roll back in your in head as I press my hand against your throat, wanna feel you dripping because you can’t get enough .”</p><p>Her fingers sped up, hitting Rio’s g-spot over and over.</p><p>“Baby-”</p><p>“I wanna make you work for it. I wanna make you struggle, make you prove that you want it.”</p><p>Rio whimpered as Agatha added another finger. She could feel the other woman stretch to accommodate her.</p><p>“Do you want that, love? Want me to fuck you like that?”</p><p>“Fuck-” Rio hissed, fluttering around Agatha’s hand.</p><p>She stopped her hand. “Answer me.”</p><p>Rio let out a sound that almost sounded like a growl. “Yes, yes I want it!”</p><p>Agatha started pumping again, letting her palm grind against Rio’s pulsing clit. “Say it.”</p><p>Her love arched her back, body taut with tension. “I want you to fuck me like that-” Rio rasped, hips bucking against the friction. “I want- I-” She stumbled as she clenched around Agatha’s lithe fingers. “Fuck!”</p><p>Another minute or two passed, and the tension broke, Rio’s back snapping off the bed, hands pulling Agatha’s hair, legs trying to slam shut as she came. Her body shuddered as she let out a whiny, pitiful noise, riding out her orgasm as Agatha stared in awe.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful.” She whispered before her brain could catch the words.</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened, hazy with bliss. “Te quiero.”</p><p>And Agatha finally, finally kissed her. They both needed to brush their teeth, that much was apparent, but she couldn’t bring herself to give a single fuck as she smiled against those lips. “I love you too.”</p><p>So they were girlfriends, RIGHT?<br/>
</p><p>“See what happens when you let a woman think?” She quipped, hand leaving Rio’s pants.</p><p>“You’re so smart, baby.” Rio chuckled.</p><p>Agatha intended on spending the day shackled to this bed with Rio, only abandoning the little sanctuary when absolutely necessary, but like everything in life-</p><p>It had to end.</p><p>The front door downstairs opened briefly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, “Shit. Is that Nicky?” Before pulling her shirt back down.</p><p>And shut with a loud thud.</p><p>Agatha already knew who had the audacity to traipse into her home on a whim, who was more than comfortable intruding, who all had spare goddamn keys.</p><p>“I fucking wish.” Agatha grumbled and flopped onto her back next to Rio.</p><p>Three sets of footsteps could be heard shuffling around downstairs before a single set could be heard climbing the stairs. The doorknob turned and a voice screamed-</p><p>“Oh, lovebirds!” Wanda flung the door open, immediately walking in like it was her own bedroom.</p><p>“We’re right here.” Agatha deadpanned, rubbing her ear for effect.</p><p>“What the hell, Wands??” Rio sunk into the bed.</p><p>Agatha sat up. “What if we were naked?”</p><p>She shrugged. “You’ve both changed in front of me, nothing I haven’t seen.” Green eyes fell to the floor before bugging. “IS THAT YOUR FUCKING CHEER UNIFORM?!”</p><p>If she thought coming out was bad, this was worse, this was coming out on fucking PCP.</p><p>Jen then emerged from the hall. “Why are you scream-” And stopped at what Wanda was pointing to, still crumpled on the floor.<br/>
</p><p> Jen had a shit-eating grin on her face. “Did Agatha finally make ‘head’ cheerleader?”</p><p>Rio bolted up. “I was gonna make that joke!”</p><p>The fuck? She whipped her head to glare at Rio.</p><p>“I mean, you kind of have to.” Jen laughed.</p><p>“WHY ARE YOU HERE?” She yelled at her friends, she was two seconds away from pulling a triple homicide.</p><p>“Coven meeting.” Jen said, as though it was obvious.</p><p>“Coven?” Agatha echoed in confusion.</p><p>“I heard Wanda say it and I liked it.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “I made that joke too!”</p><p>“Where’s my child?” Agatha looked at the redhead.</p><p>“At my house, playing video games with Billy and Tommy. C’mon, we brought coffee and pastries since we figured you’d be too…invested in one another to make breakfast.”</p><p>“Whatever gets you out of my bedroom.” Agatha replied, standing.</p><p>And oh-</p><p>Oh standing should not take this much effort, her legs felt flimsy and there was a slight soreness at the apex of her thighs. She took a few steps towards the door, knowing it was not her normal gate, the walk felt unnatural.</p><p>Rio laughed. “Sweetheart…ya okay?”</p><p>“Fuck off.” She grumbled out the door, hearing little snickers behind her.</p><p>“We need to work on your stamina!” Rio called as she got out of the bed.</p><p>“I would threaten to strangle you, but we both know you’d like that too much, my love.” Agatha retorted.</p><p>Once in the living room, she was greeted with Alice laying out several iced coffees and pastries across her coffee table.</p><p>“You’re the only sane one, and I love you for it.” Agatha spoke, picking up a coffee.</p><p>Alice twisted her face in confusion. “Why does your voice sound like a chainsmokers?”</p><p>Why did she keep any of them around?</p><p>“Okay, I take it back. No love.”</p><p>Rio, Wanda and Jen walked in and situated themselves. She threw her legs over Rio’s lap as she leaned against the back of the couch, sipping her coffee and watching as Rio did the same.</p><p>“They fucked in our old cheer uniform.” Jen told her wife.</p><p>Alice closed her eyes and smiled. “Ah, the uniform.”</p><p>That was too many details about her friend’s sex lives.</p><p>“I only wear it for her on her birthday or anniversaries, though.” Jen added.</p><p>Rio was looking up. “Vaulted ceilings.” She commented, almost to herself.</p><p>She knew how Rio always wanted a house with vaulted ceilings, and if that part of Agatha’s home was purposeful, that was nobody’s business but her own.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Does this gathering have a point?”</p><p>Wanda picked at her croissant and sat on the other side of Rio. “You sound like a throat cancer survivor with the voice box thingy that they put in their necks.”</p><p>“It’s so fun that all your friends are so open and casual with their boundaries.” Rio looked like she wanted to set herself ablaze.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head, faking a smile. “Isn’t it?”</p><p>Jen clapped her hands. “Okay. We have an update on the plan. It’s not looking good.”</p><p>She chuckled. “I could’ve told you that.”</p><p>Rio looked at Jen and the rest of them. “Sorry, what fucking plan?”</p><p>Alice was sitting on the floor, picking apart a muffin. “We were gonna have Vision hack Evanora for dirt.”</p><p>Wanda huffed. “But apparently, that’s” She raised her hands to do air quotes. “‘Not how it works’, according to my husband.”</p><p>Rio scrunched her eyebrows. “Yeah, obviously. Isn’t Vision in like data analytics or something?”</p><p>“Who knows?” Wanda said and bit down on her pastry.</p><p>“He’s your hus-” Rio began and immediately gave up. “Nevermind.”</p><p>Jen clapped her hands again. “Focus up! We need to figure out something else, so I ask again, anyone got a PI or hacker in their contacts?”</p><p>“I do.” Rio chirped.</p><p>Agatha looked at her disbelievingly. “You do?”</p><p>“Yeah, my friend Nat from New York. She’s a PI and her sister does tech stuff, they run their own business.”</p><p>“Nat from the bar, Nat?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” She easily confirmed, leaning over to survey her breakfast options.</p><p>“So Nat just looks like that and runs her own business and is super fucking cool?” Agatha spoke, trying and miserably failing to not sound jealous.</p><p>“Baby…” Rio started before Jen cut in.</p><p>“We can all see the hickey on her neck, Agatha. She’s yours, damn.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t care, she didn’t like it.</p><p>Then the ginger piped up. “So Rio can just call Nat, she’ll do her thing, and then you’ll have the leverage you need.”</p><p>“Now wait a minute-” Agatha said.</p><p>Alice, through a mouth full of food said. “Why don’t y’all just-” And the rest was gibberish.</p><p>“Was that supposed to be intelligible?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Sorry.” Alice swallowed. “Why don’t y'all just get married?”</p><p>She felt like Alice had just dumped a bucket of ice water on her, Rio going rigid beside her.</p><p>“What?” Rio responded.</p><p>The woman sitting on the floor did not seem to realize the weight of her question, because she kept going. “It’d fix all your problems! Agatha’s loaded, she just buys your house and there goes the eviction threat, and if Evanora goes for your job then you have Mrs. Moneybags over here to fall back on.”</p><p>Jen lit up. “Oh, please do that! It’d be the greatest ‘fuck you’ of all time to Evanora. Maybe she’d stroke out at the news and die.”</p><p>Suddenly Nat didn’t sound so bad.</p><p>“I don’t want Agatha’s money, and I’m not being her housewife.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Don’t sell yourself short, baby. You’d be my trophy wife.”</p><p>Rio glared at her.</p><p>“Agatha always said she’d never get remarried.” Wanda so helpfully added.</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened. “You said that?”</p><p>That was when she thought she’d never see Rio again, post-divorce, Agatha was comfortable to grow old alone. Now though-</p><p>“We haven’t even had the ‘what are we’ talk yet, and you're worried about what I said four years ago after I got out of a loveless marriage to a man?” She then motioned to the room, making her point to the other four women. “ And Nicky doesn’t even know yet! He doesn’t know his mom’s a lesbian dating his teacher, and I’m not coming home one day out of the blue with his new step-mom on my arm.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“So fucking tell him?” Jen crossed her arms.</p><p>“Have you ever come out to your own child, Jen? No? Then keep quiet.”</p><p>The room fell into silence.</p><p>It’s not that Agatha didn’t want to marry Rio, she did. She wanted to come home and cook dinner for her wife and son. Wanted to say ‘my wife and I’ in casual conversation, wanted to build overly-complicated furniture and insist her wife is reading the directions incorrectly.</p><p>She wanted to find the biggest, gaudiest, tackiest boulder of a rock and see it on Rio’s ring finger. She wanted to get rid of Harkness, it was tainted.</p><p>Agatha Vidal may as well have been a fucking 17th century sonnet to her at this point.</p><p>And she had seen her with Nicky, they were like two sides of the same sarcastic, smartass, coin. Rio would make an amazing mom, she had no doubt about it. Nicky was already a result of the love Agatha carried for Rio all these years, she had poured all of it into him.</p><p>But even for lesbians, eight days felt like pushing it for a spur of the moment marriage.</p><p>“Girlfriend.” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “What?”</p><p>“You’re my fucking girlfriend.”</p><p>“I am?” She grinned, her heart swelling.</p><p>Brown eyes dramatically rolled. “Fucking obviously.”</p><p>“You never said!”</p><p>“I didn’t think I had to!” Rio threw her hands up. “Especially not after last night! Or the night before!”</p><p>Well she thought as much, but the ice she was on with Rio felt pretty damn thin up until two days ago.</p><p>“I’m your girlfriend.” She teased.</p><p>“Yes, yes, glad you figured out the painfully obvious. The plan?” Jen brought them back to reality.</p><p>“I’ll call Nat on Monday,” Rio spoke. “But she’s pretty expensive, sooooo…” Her eyes fell to Agatha.</p><p>She scoffed. “Oh now you wanna be my trophy wife? Just take my black card out of my wallet.”</p><p>“Black card? Okay, Scrooge McDuck.” Alice muttered.</p><p>“Well, if that’s all…” Agatha prompted and looked at her friends, none of whom had anything to add. “Great.”</p><p>If she thought too long about how little of a plan they really had, Agatha was going to spiral. She pushed herself off the couch and walked towards the hall.</p><p>“I’m going to go shower,” She turned back to look at Rio, still on the couch. “Care to join me, my girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio climbed over the back of the sofa and sprinted across the massive living room. “If you ever hear me say no to that, put a gun to my head and pull the trigger, baby.”</p><p>Agatha snorted as she felt Rio’s hands on her hips, pushing her forwards.</p><p>“Okay, so we’ll just fuck off then, I guess!” Jen shouted after them.</p><p>Alice stood up. “Let them have their honeymoon phase.” Then grinned. “You know, we could always go home and you could put on that uniform…”</p><p>Jen quirked her eyebrow. “Is it your birthday?”</p><p>Alice dropped her head in defeat.</p><p>Jen smiled. “Didn’t think so.”</p><p>Her wife groaned. “You know that when you’re withholding it only makes it hotter.”</p>

<p>Three days.</p><p>Rio hadn’t seen Agatha in or outside of school in three days. She just vanished like a ghost, no explanation, just - gone.</p><p>She wasn’t answering Rio’s calls or texts, hell, Rio even tried AOL instant messenger and nothing.</p><p>“How’s the witchcraft going, Buffy?” Jen said, snapping Rio out of her reverie. She and Alice stopped at her locker, waiting for a retort.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I don’t know, Jen, how’s the bulimia going?” She shut her locker and finally looked at them. “And Willow’s the lesbian, not Buffy. At least be accurate when you’re being a bitch.”</p><p>Jen scoffed in annoyance and made a move to continue walking, but wait, she could actually be useful right now.</p><p>“Where’s the third member of Destiny’s Child?” Rio feigned disinterest.</p><p>“She has the flu.” Alice spoke.</p><p>Rio had seen her three days ago under the bleachers, perfectly healthy. She most certainly did not have the flu, but she was able to talk to Jen and Alice, so at least Rio knew she wasn’t dead.</p><p>“Don’t tell her that, she’ll make an Agatha voodoo doll or hex her or some shit.” Then Jen smirked. “Why do you care? Got a crush?”</p><p>No, she didn’t have a crush.</p><p>She was madly in love.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t want them to know until graduation next month, so Rio bit her tongue.</p><p>“Always a pleasure, Jen, but I gotta run. Children to sacrifice, curses to inflict, brooms to ride and so little time in the day.” Rio turned on her heel and flipped them off as she walked down the hall.</p><p>Okay, so Agatha wasn’t sick but wouldn’t tell her friends the truth. She had contact with the outside world, but was choosing to ignore Rio. Did Rio do something to upset her? She wracked her brain, but came up empty. They were happy, or at least Rio thought they were happy. Now she was wondering if she missed something, if she was so in love with Agatha that she was oblivious to her girlfriends misery. Did Rio make Agatha miserable?</p><p>And that’s when she had a really dumb idea, one that wormed its way into her brain and she immediately acted on. She went to all of Agatha’s classes, picked up any assignments and left straight for Agatha’s house as soon as the last bell of the day rang.</p><p>Rio had never been to Agatha’s house, but everyone knew which one it was because it sat on top of this large hill, all the rich people lived in the same neighborhood in Westview. And of course the Harkness’ lived in the most lavish house at the highest point of the hill, literally looking down on everyone else.</p><p>When she got there, she couldn’t believe that this is where Agatha called home. It was this sterile-looking white mansion that oozed an air of wealth and superiority. She knew Agatha was affluent but she’d never felt so ashamed of her tiny little house on the edge of town.</p><p>Taking a breath she rang the doorbell and waited, shaky hands held the folder of classwork that Rio herself would never understand. She just wanted to know Agatha was okay, that they were okay, to just see her fucking girlfriend. Then she’d leave and no one would be the wiser.</p><p>The front door swung open and a woman who looked like Agatha stood in front of her. Except this woman’s hair wasn’t wild, it was tamed and half clipped up, she wore a plain black, knee-length dress and heels, and was dripping in silver jewelry. The woman’s face was angular like Agatha’s but it was sunken in, it was harsh, like maybe at some point this woman had felt joy, but after years of scowling her face just froze like that. Her eyes were blue, but not Agatha blue, they were dead and unnerving like a snakes. Agatha’s were blue like the ocean during a storm, deep and warm. The blue she saw now reminded her of somebody's lips when dying of hypothermia, frigid. The woman, almost certainly her girlfriend’s mother, raised a singular eyebrow as she looked Rio up and down. Like she was analyzing Rio, judging and unsatisfied with whatever conclusion she had come to. Suddenly she understood why Agatha never wanted to be home.</p><p>“Yes?” Evanora calmly spoke.</p><p>Fuck, she hadn’t rehearsed anything and Agatha’s mom’s gaze on her at this current moment made the tiny hairs on her neck stand. “Hi, Mrs. Harkness. I’m a friend of Agatha’s, I brought over some of the assignments she’s missed.”</p><p>She held out the folder and Evanora took it. “Thank you.” And began closing the door.</p><p>Rio placed a hand out to stop the door from closing. “Sorry, is Agatha here? I need her approval on her coronation photos from senior ball. I’m in yearbook.”</p><p>God damn, that was a miraculous lie she just pulled out of thin air.</p><p>Evanora’s face pulled into a tight, cold smile. “My daughter is resting right now. I’m sure whichever photos you run will be sufficient.”</p><p>Fucking hell, this woman was offputting. “Yeah, I heard she’s sick.”</p><p>“Something must be going around,” Evanora said, her snake eyes boring into Rio’s soul. “Like a plague.”</p><p>She wanted to barrel past this woman and find her love, but her mom raised her better than that and it’d only blow back on Agatha in the long run, so-</p><p>“Guess I’ll see her at school then.” Rio said with a polite smile.</p><p>“Guess you will.” And the door closed the rest of the way, shutting unceremoniously in her face.</p><p>Rio didn’t know why that felt threatening, but she left anyway. As she did so, she looked back at the house one more time. All she saw was a curtain in a bedroom upstairs falling shut, like someone had been watching from the window. Probably just wishful thinking, probably her own imagination.</p><p>She would, in fact, see Agatha at school the next day. The day she fucking ripped her heart out underneath the bleachers.</p><p>Now she knows Evanora’s ‘guess you will’ was a taunt, a threat, and that Agatha was essentially being held captive. She should’ve fucking known, should’ve done something, but she was a stupid kid. If only she could turn back time, if she could go back to that day and save her, if fucking only-</p><p>Snapping back to the present, Rio tugged on the tight collar of her turtleneck, typing away on her laptop and waiting for Nat to call her back. It was lunch, and as usual, acne ridden miscreants overtook her classroom.</p><p>She tugged again, trying to ignore the restrictive fabric, but her frustration only grew. Frustration over the turtleneck, over Evanora, over the marriage proposal from somebody other than Agatha, over her girlfriend vowing never to remarry. Rio didn’t have any plans to propose, but knowing that she might not even be given the option hurt her in a foreign way. It was one thing to not want something, it was another to be told she couldn’t have it. She wanted to show Agatha a good relationship, a good marriage, a good life.</p><p>Yesterday, Rio woke up so sure of what she was doing, what they were doing. But then Agatha was shocked to hear that she was her girlfriend, and then Rio became less sure. She’d left around the early afternoon, after Wanda couldn’t give any more excuses as to why Nicky shouldn’t go home. And Rio knew she had to leave, but waking up with Agatha, talking with their friends, the sex, the showering together, the domesticity of it all. She wouldn’t have minded to end the day with seeing Nicky and falling asleep in bed with Agatha again.</p><p>Rio didn’t notice she was rereading the same sentence across her screen and gnawing on her lip until a body approached her desk. Nicky patiently waited for her attention and smiled when she looked up.</p><p>Another thing adding to the mess in her brain-</p><p>Being around her girlfriend’s kid all day without him knowing he was her girlfriend’s kid. She didn’t know how to act, before she didn’t think twice about talking to him. But now she was afraid to make the wrong move, say the wrong thing.</p><p>“What’s up, Nicky?”</p><p>He shrugged. “I know you went to NYU, and I was just wondering if you liked it.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, I did. Is there a reason you’re asking?” She already knew the fucking reason.</p><p>“I don’t know, just curious. My counselor said I should start considering my options for college since I’m a junior, and I figure it has to be an alright place if you went there.” He was definitely trying to downplay his interest.</p><p>“‘Cause I'm the arbiter on what makes a good school?” She huffed out a chuckle. “I liked it, it was expensive but that won’t be a problem for you.”</p><p>“I mean, you’re cool and super smart, so can’t be that bad of an option, right?”</p><p>Fuck, she almost felt guilty for eating his goddamn Cheez-its after eating his mom.</p><p>“You’ve been spending too much time with Billy, you’re starting to sound like a bigger suck-up than him.”</p><p>“Okay, sorry,” He cleared his throat. “Eat shit and die, Miss Vidal. Is that better?” Nicky grinned.</p><p>“You’re gonna fucking thrive in New York, kid.”</p><p>“Eh, we’ll see, my Nana wants me to go to Princeton. Family tradition.”</p><p>Her skin seethed at that, at Evanora trying to keep the generational trauma cycle going. “And what does your mom want?”</p><p>“Oh, she doesn’t care as long as I’m happy. I’m pretty sure she hated Princeton.”</p><p>Yeah, of course she fucking did.</p><p>“Well if you ever want the authentic tour experience from an alum, let me know. I can always text your mom and set up a trip to the campus.” Rio offered, and genuinely, she wanted to do it. She liked the idea of sharing that with Nicky.</p><p>He cocked his head. “You have my mom’s number?”</p><p>See? Wrong fucking thing to say.</p><p>She willed herself to think of something on the fly, something that wouldn’t draw suspicion.</p><p>“I have all the parent’s numbers from the school directory.”</p><p>Nicky looked like he was going to keep questioning her, when Rio’s phone lit up with Nat’s caller ID. He looked down at the screen and smirked.</p><p>Saved by the bell.</p><p>“That your girlfriend?”</p><p>No, and if his mom knew he made that assumption, Agatha would probably run Nat down with her seventy-five thousand dollar luxury car.</p><p>Rio forced out a laugh as she picked up her phone off the desk. “‘C’mon, I’d never two-time Billy’s mom like that.”</p><p>Billy looked up from his desk that he was doodling at and glared. “Yeah, MY mom.” He said under his breath.</p><p>“How’s being grounded treating you, Billy?” She said menacingly as she left the classroom and answered her phone in the hall.</p><p>“Rio.” Natasha spoke. “Business or pleasure?”</p><p>“Business.” Rio hurried out.</p><p>“What have you gotten yourself into?” Nat’s voice teased.</p><p>“A twenty year long situationship.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll bite, what’s up?”</p><p>“Do you know of Evanora Harkness?”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s famously a very conservative multi-millionaire. Can’t buy or rent anywhere across the east coast without a 50% chance it’s a Harkness property. She’s a fucking vampire.”</p><p>Rio nodded like Nat could see her.</p><p>“How much would it be for you to take her down?”</p><p>“Wha-” Nat stumbled. “Rio.”</p><p>“Yes?” She drawled.</p><p>“You can’t just ‘take down’ a woman like that. I’m good but I’m not god.”</p><p>“Nat, I cannot stress this enough, money is no object.”</p><p>“Last time I checked, you’re chronically poor.” Okay ouch, but accurate. “And other than a Stark, this is the white fucking whale of targets.”</p><p>“Got a sugar mommy now, her mother is a famously conservative vampire.”</p><p>“Shit.” Nat cackled over the line. “So the jealousy worked?”</p><p>“Like a charm.”</p><p>She filled Nat in on the details, the trauma, the lore, the threats, and the blackmail. Lunch was almost over by the time she covered every heinous act Evanora committed.</p><p>“There’s no way she’s clean, right? There has to be some skeletons in that closet.” Rio finished.</p><p>“In my experience, no one gets and stays that rich without some sort of shady activity. Gimme a week or two and I’ll poke around.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “And by ‘poke around’ you mean…?”</p><p>“I’ll follow her, Yelena will hack her.”</p><p>“You can just do that?”</p><p>“No, of course not, that’d be wrong.” Nat quipped.</p><p>“Keep me posted.”</p><p>“Hey, is that ginger friend of yours still….”</p><p>“Straight and married? Yes, let it go.”</p><p>A loud sigh came from Nat. “Send me Agatha’s credit card info.” She spoke, and ended the call.</p><p>Rio opened the text chain that Wanda had so lovingly added her onto, one that contained the entire coven. Letting them know Nat had accepted the case, naturally, her phone quickly devolved into a vibrating brick at the responses.</p><p>When Rio got home after work, she was gifted with the sight of her girlfriend waiting on the porch. Obviously distracted by typing away on her phone, Rio approached.</p><p>“You look like a lululesbian.” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha looked up from her phone. “What’s that?” And looked at her attire; sneakers, leggings, a sports bra, and a cropped hoodie.</p><p>“I have so much to teach you. I’m saying you look like the femme version of a fitness lesbian.”</p><p>“Oh, I was just at Pilates.” She turned and entered the house. “You should really lock your front door. Never know what creepy fucks are lurking out there.”</p><p>Rio followed and shut the door, throwing her things aside and grabbing Agatha’s waist. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”</p><p>And it was a pleasure, past seeing Agatha flushed and kind of sweaty in tight fitting clothes, Rio was always ecstatic to not have to wait until the weekend to see her girlfriend.</p><p>“I was wondering if you wanted to come over for dinner on Thursday.” She rested her hands on Rio’s forearms.</p><p>“Is Nicky gone that night for something?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She knitted her eyebrows together. “So then…?” She processed what that meant and her jaw dropped. “Are you telling him?”</p><p>“Not exactly. I thought it might be good for you two to spend more time together outside of school, that way when I do tell him, it’s easier for him to swallow.”</p><p>“When you tell him? Not if?” Stupid fucking warm and fuzzies spread through Rio’s body.</p><p>“Yes, my love, when I tell him.” She repeated. “It’s just that Nicky and I have been on our own for a long time, just us two. Even when Ralph was in the picture, he was never really around. I just want to be smart about this-”</p><p>And Rio understood, she really did. Bringing another person into a kid’s life is delicate and if Rio or Nicky got too attached too quick and then Evanora did something to keep them apart? She didn’t know if she’d ever recover from that.</p><p>“I know what Wanda said yesterday, but Rio…” She waited for a beat. “I’m in this for the long haul.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Longer than twenty years?”</p><p>“For as long as you’ll put up with my shit.”</p><p>“I’ve made it this far, haven’t I?”</p><p>Agatha smiled that heart-melting fucking smile and leaned into kiss her, like it was sealing her promise. Like she had promised when they were younger, to always keep Rio in mind. They stood at the front door like that for a minute or two, kissing and living in that promise until Agatha pulled back.</p><p>“Okay, now I gotta go, Nicky’s going to be wondering where I am.”</p><p>Rio whined. “He’s turning seventeen soon, he’ll survive without you for an hour.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “We both know if I stay here, what we do will take longer than an hour.” She detangled herself from Rio’s hold. “The place looks great by the way, Victoria would like it.” She pointed to the space, box-free, that looked like a person actually lived here now.</p><p>“I think she’d like that you’re here to see it.” Rio quietly added.</p><p>“Please, I’m sure she hated me after everything in high school. I was surprised she stayed when I was in labor.”</p><p>She shook her head. “No, she always had a feeling about you. I thought she was crazy, turns out, she knew her shit.”</p><p>Agatha solemnly smiled. “So, I’ll see you Thursday?”</p><p>She hated that she’d have to wait that long to see her again, but-</p><p>“Just text me a time and I’ll be there.”</p><p>Agatha gave her one last kiss. “I love you. Call me.”</p><p>Rio watched as she left. “I love you too, you creepy fuck.”</p><p>She was pulling the door shut as she responded. “Lock your fucking door!”</p><p>“But then I’d be protected from hot MILFs in yoga pants!”</p>

<p>Two months ago, in the nurse's office, Rio had said-</p><p>‘I remember the day you broke things off. Down to every fucking word. I could tell you what you were wearing, the season, the month, hell, the day.’</p><p>Yeah, and so could Agatha.</p><p>A Burberry plaid skirt with a white cashmere sweater,</p><p>Spring,</p><p>April,</p><p>Friday the 22nd.</p><p>It was her first day back at school after her mother confronted her. Her lip was mostly healed and the bruise on her upper cheek had turned a sickly yellow color that she hid under concealer.</p><p>It was one day after Rio had come to her house under the guise of dropping off homework. Agatha had listened, out of sight, from the top of the staircase and bolted to her bedroom window to watch her almost ex-girlfriend leave. Evanora silently dropped off the folder to her room and left. She didn’t need to say anything, Agatha already knew. Her mother had taken her phone after she had told Jen and Alice she was sick, and isolated her alone in her room for three fucking days.</p><p>She had managed to avoid Rio all day, purposefully taking different routes to class so they wouldn’t run into each other in the hall, and spent her free period catching up on her missed assignments. But she couldn’t ignore Rio forever, ignore the twisty feeling in her stomach, ignore what felt like a rock lodged in her throat.</p><p>Agatha knew she couldn’t tell the truth, so she had to do what she did best-</p><p>Be the fucking villain.</p><p>Be the mean girl.</p><p>Be what everyone already thought she was-</p><p>Evil.</p><p>If she told her the truth, Agatha knew Rio would be dumb enough to try to fight. Try to save her, because of course she would. Agatha had to pulverize her, leave her heart unrecognizable; leave it black and unfeeling.</p><p>Unfeeling and unbeating for Agatha.</p><p>Rio would be okay, that’s what Agatha told herself as she walked across the field to the bleachers.</p><p>Rio would move to New York and meet so many women. Probably ones that she could actually have, that weren’t broken, that didn’t have a cinderblock of baggage weighing them down.</p><p>Rio would forget about Westview, forget about Agatha. She’d thrive and get everything she wanted in life, become a successful photographer, change the world with her work.</p><p>Rio would be fine.</p><p>And however Agatha felt was secondary, she was bound here. Bound to her family, to this town, to Ralph, to the fucking expectations her mother placed on her.</p><p>“You’re fucking alive.” Rio said as she flung herself at Agatha underneath the bleachers. The embrace was warm; it was safe. And just for a moment, Agatha let herself close her eyes, searing the sensation into her bones so she could feel it forever.</p><p>“Yeah.” Was all Agatha spoke.</p><p>Rio pulled away, smiling, looking at her. “What’s going on here?” She raised her hand and gently ran her thumb along the highpoint of Agatha's cheekbone where the bruise was, where she thought she had covered it well enough.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut at the gentle contact, knowing it was probably the last time someone was going to handle her with any care for the foreseeable future. Knowing that a few minutes from now, Rio would hate her, and Agatha would pretend to hate her too.</p><p>“Uh, I fell.” She lied.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “On your face? Mi amor…”</p><p>‘My love.’</p><p>Agatha would miss that.</p><p>“Cheer accident.” She grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled it away from her face, setting it back down by Rio’s side.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Rio’s voice strained out, noticing how distant Agatha was acting.</p><p>Agatha took a breath. “We need to talk.”</p><p>Two gigantic amber eyes flickered with too many emotions at once.</p><p>Confusion, recognition, understanding, and finally-</p><p>Sorrow.</p><p>She cocked her head. “You’re not serious…”</p><p>No, she wasn’t, but her mother was.</p><p>“I think we need to stop.”</p><p>Not break up, or end things. Stop.</p><p>“Stop what?” Rio asked, but from her tone, Agatha knew she was aware of what was happening.</p><p>She motioned between the two of them. “Us… This.”</p><p>Rio looked at her with so much concern, so much love, trying to read her. “Did your mom find out?”</p><p>And Agatha wanted to scream, she wanted to yell. She wanted to sob and embed herself in the safety of Rio’s arms forever and hide from the inevitable.</p><p>“No.” Her voice remained, steady, almost stoic. “I just think that…” She steeled her jaw. “This has run its course. It was fun, but we’re about to graduate, I need to be realistic.”</p><p>“Fun?” Rio choked out.</p><p>She shrugged. “Yeah, fun. A phase. An experiment.”</p><p>God, she had just verbally stabbed Rio right in the chest, she felt her insides turning. She felt the very fabric of who she was straining against it, felt her bones aching to halt what she was doing.</p><p>Tears were welling in Rio’s eyes. “Bullshit.”</p><p>“Rio, c’mon, we always knew how this was going to end.”</p><p>“Did we? Or are you just fucking scared?” She spit out.</p><p>Good. Anger was good. Agatha knew how to take anger.</p><p>“Scared?” She questioned.</p><p>“Yeah, scared. Scared of what people would say, scared of losing your reputation, scared of your mother!” She yelled at Agatha.</p><p>“Not all of us can skate by on mediocrity alone.” Agatha sniped. “Some of us have goals, aspirations, things we’re meant to achieve. You could fuck off to New York tomorrow penniless and uneducated and nobody would notice, Rio! Nobody would care! I don’t have that luxury!”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted in pain, tears now falling freely. “You said you loved me.”</p><p>Agatha’s body begged for her to break down, but her brain won out, pushing forward. “I say a lot of things.”</p><p>“Why don’t you want me?” She spoke it so softly, if Agatha’s heart wasn’t already in pieces, it would’ve completely shattered what was left.</p><p>Time to twist that knife.</p><p>“I’m getting back together with Ralph.”</p><p>That caused a watery, cruel laugh to leave her love’s throat. “Yeah and I killed Lady Di. Are we both saying stupid shit?”</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. I can’t-” She looked down and corrected. “I don’t- I don't want to be like you.”</p><p>“Like me?”</p><p>“I don’t want to live a lesser life. I was fine before you.”</p><p>Rio looked like she wanted to rip out her own hair. “You were not fine! Staying in Westview and pushing out two and a half babies for a man is not fine!”</p><p>Agatha took the dagger out, and plunged it right back in.</p><p>“It’s better than being a dyke.” Agatha could taste bile in the back of her throat as she said it, like her body was trying to reject the word.</p><p>The full lips she once clung to trembled. The brows she had mapped out down to every microscopic hair furrowed. The eyes that she’d happily drown in flooded.</p><p>“Fuck you! You’re a coward!” Rio screamed through her sobs. “You’re going to be miserable here, Agatha. You’re going to wake up every day hating your life and yourself, and honestly, you fucking deserve it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t doubt that. She knew Rio was right. Right about all of it.</p><p>“Don’t make this harder than it has to be.” Her words came out like venom, but internally it was a plea-</p><p>‘Don’t make this harder than it already is’</p><p>Rio scoffed, enraged. “You know I could just tell everyone, right? Tell everyone what we did, who you are.”</p><p>An empty threat, she knew. But she was playing a part here, acting, giving a show, so she responded in character.</p><p>She plastered on a cold, unnerving, heinous grin. “And who would believe you? I’d just tell everyone you were obsessed with me. That you harassed me. People already think so little of you, is that how you want to be remembered?”</p><p>“You do this and I will hate you…forever.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha counted on it.</p><p>“I’ll live.” She dismissed.</p><p>And Rio-</p><p>She finally broke, her posture deflated, as if accepting reality. “Please, Agatha. Please don’t do this.”</p><p>Agatha stood and watched her beg, watched her cry, watched the love of her life sob over the pain she was inflicting. She wanted to hold her, kiss her, tell her everything was going to be okay.</p><p>“Plea- please don’t-” Rio’s voice wobbled. “Please, my love. Please-”</p><p>She’ll be fine.<br/>
She’ll be fine.<br/>
She’ll be fine.</p><p>Agatha repeated it in her head like a mantra.</p><p>“I don’t want to see you. I want you to stop pursuing me, I want you to stop making my life hell.”</p><p>“We go to the same school, Agatha. We live in the same fucking town.”</p><p>“I don’t care.” She scolded. “I don’t want to see your face.”</p><p>And maybe it was everything she had said, maybe it was the fact that Rio had become accustomed to feeling lesser than, maybe it was because she really did now hate Agatha, maybe she flipped that switch inside herself.</p><p>But Rio’s face, covered in ruined mascara and running eyeliner, went numb. Like she turned off her emotions, like she accepted it.</p><p>Agatha’s blade finally unsheathed itself from Rio, leaving her gutted. And she knew, knew of the blood on her hands, of the future she had stolen. The future of her and Rio, happy. A future of one hour and nine minutes apart.</p><p>Rio’s blank face gave a small, almost imperceptible nod before she turned and slowly walked away.</p><p>She tried not to overthink how Rio didn’t fight more, didn’t fight for her, for them. But that wasn’t fair, she couldn’t expect Rio to fight for something that was seemingly already gone. Fight for something that had died four days ago in Agatha’s bedroom.</p><p>Only once Rio was out of her sight did Agatha’s knees finally cave, hitting the grass, creating tiny divots in the earth. Only then did her body keel over itself, her back hunching, her face heating. Only then did her whole being shake as she wept, as she dug the heels of her palms into her eyes to stuff the emotion back down. Only then did her weight seemingly buckle in on itself, the very core of who she was, of who she loved, was buried and never to be seen again after today.</p><p>What Agatha doesn’t remember, is how long she stayed under those bleachers that day, crying until her throat was raw, until her eyes couldn’t produce any more tears, until her body ceased it’s purge of what she was sure was the only true love she’d ever felt in her eighteen years of life. No, she didn’t remember how long she stayed there, just knew that she’d met up with Rio when it was sunny, and didn’t leave until the moon was towering over her in the night sky.</p><p>Her mother stopped her when she got home, pouncing on her as soon as she entered the foyer.</p><p>“Is it done?” Her mother asked, hands crossed expectantly.</p><p>And if Agatha’s puffy face and cried-off makeup wasn’t enough indication-</p><p>“Yes.” She croaked.</p><p>Evanora nodded in contentment, then raised a brow. “You missed dinner.”</p><p>Now devoid of anything to live for, Agatha ignored the comment and climbed the stairs to her bedroom, curling herself in the covers of her bed and praying to experience the phantom warmth of Rio holding her. Hoped that her heart would heal with time.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure if her heart ever really did heal. The pain got easier as the years went by, but there was never a day where Rio didn’t come to mind. Some days it was something small, like a song they once listened to together coming on the radio. She always meant to shut off ‘Hey There Delilah’ whenever it played, but she could never bring herself to turn the dial. Other days tore her apart, like the day Nicky decided he wanted to pick up photography and Agatha spent the entire weekend making the basement into a darkroom for him. Her eyes misted over as she hung the blackout curtains and installed the red lights.</p><p>Her heart beat, but never quite the same after that day, April 22nd, 2005.</p><p>There was a certain rhythm it had whenever she was around Rio, one like wild horses, like this bounding feeling of euphoria.</p><p>The rhythm she had for Nicky was softer, calmer, no less filled with love, but more like the steady flow of a river stream, complete peace and fulfillment.</p><p>“Mom?”</p><p>Her heart never healed, but it was on the mend.</p><p>“Hey…mom?”</p><p>She felt that rhythm again twenty years later.</p><p>“Ma.”</p><p>Her heart beat and all it could do was chant what it had missed-</p><p>‘Rio, rio, rio, rio, rio, ri-’</p><p>“MOM!”</p><p>Agatha looked at her son from across the kitchen island, her body stilled in front of the stove, not even aware she had spaced out for so long.</p><p>She blinked. “Don’t raise your voice at me.”</p><p>He threw his hand up. “You weren’t answering! You were just standing in front of that pot with a spatula in your hand like a 50’s housewife zonked out on Quaaludes.”</p><p>Damn this kid of hers was clever.</p><p>“You speak to me like that again and I’m chucking your Switch into the Westview riverbank.” She half-joked, pointing the wooden spatula at him and waving it around as she spoke.</p><p>“You make that threat every time, and we both know it's hollow.” He grinned.</p><p>“Keep testing me and you’ll find out just how hollow it is.” She grumbled.</p><p>“Anything I can help with?” He said picking at the ingredients sprawled across the counter.</p><p>Agatha took a step back from the steaming pot in front of her face and set down the spatula. “No, they’re already done. Just letting them sit.”</p><p>“What are these again, tamales, right?”</p><p>“Close.” She sighed. “Pasteles.”</p><p>“And you made these because…?”</p><p>“I know Rio likes them, her mom made them for me once and they were fucking delicious. I doubt I did them justice but…”</p><p>“So you guys were, like, close friends? Because the only friend’s mom I ever had make me food is aunt Wanda.”</p><p>Well, fuck, the clever little shit is still on this.</p><p>She shrugged. “We hung out every now and again. It’ll be good to catch up with her tonight.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m excited.” He agreed. “Did I tell you she said she’d give me a tour of the NYU campus?”</p><p>She chuckled. “Yes, dear son of mine, several times.”</p><p>“We could set up a date to go. Make a whole day out of it! Take the train, tour a few galleries nearby, maybe visit the Met!”</p><p>God, that stupid steady river started pumping in her chest.</p><p>“I think that’d be great, hon.”</p><p>“Are you seeing that guy again?” He nonchalantly asked.</p><p>“You really need to work on your segues.” She picked up the glass of wine she had sitting on the counter. “And what guy?”</p><p>“The dude you went on a date with last week, you never said anything afterwards.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip. “Didn’t think you’d be interested.”</p><p>“Well normally, ew, no I wouldn’t.” He smiled. “But you seem, I don’t know. Glowier…happier. So I figure, I need to see what this guy’s intentions are, ya know, the man thing where I threaten to kill him if he hurts you.”</p><p>She almost spat out her wine from cackling. “Honey, I love you. And that’s very sweet of you, but bring that macho man shit into my house again, and the Switch will go for an eternal swim.”</p><p>“Don’t, I can’t lose my Stardew Valley save file. Spent too much time trying to court Haley for it not to pay off.”</p><p>“I don’t know who or what that is.”</p><p>“But the guy? When do I get to meet him?”</p><p>“Why do you wanna meet this person?”</p><p>She was very intentional with the word ‘person’.</p><p>“Because I met dad’s mistress and all things considered she was cool.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “How is she after dumping his ass?”</p><p>“Better off.” He deadpanned.</p><p>“Listen, I promise you’ll meet-” She cleared her throat and mumbled the pronoun. “-em. Just chill, okay?”</p><p>“Is he-”</p><p>The doorbell rang, Agatha looked at the clock on the smart fridge, and she had to give it to her, Rio was punctual. Six PM on the dot.</p><p>Nicky beamed and raced out of the kitchen towards the front door.</p><p>Agatha stayed in the kitchen, busying herself with cleaning up the mess from making dinner and grabbing plates.</p><p>She overheard their conversation as they made their way back towards Agatha.</p><p>“-And then I was thinking we could hit the Met.” He finished, walking alongside Rio back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Oceans 8 style, I like it.” And even though Agatha hadn’t looked up yet, she could hear the smile on her girlfriend’s face.</p><p>“I’m not familiar.” Nicky quipped.</p><p>“Agatha, your son hasn’t seen Ocean's 8? Fuck’s sake, what are you even teaching the boy?”</p><p>She looked up from setting the table and there Rio was, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, hair down and a little wavy.</p><p>“Not sure it’s really his speed.”</p><p>“He got something against hot women?”</p><p>Nicky chimed in. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Okay, well I know what we’re doing next time.” Rio said with no room for argument.</p><p>That’s when she noticed one of Rio’s arms was hidden behind her back.</p><p>“What do you got there?” Agatha pointed.</p><p>Rio smiled and walked to the table where Agatha was standing and flourished out her hand, clutching a bouquet of azaleas. “M’lady.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and took the flowers. “How chivalrous.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, my mother raised me right.”</p><p>Her heart started up again.</p><p>Stupid fucking wild horses.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to pull all your student’s moms?” Nicky mischievously asked as Agatha found a vase for the flowers.</p><p>Oh, if only he knew.</p><p>Rio lips pursed before responding. “Why, you think I got a shot?”</p><p>Of course Rio was going to torture her with this, tiptoeing around the truth so that Nicky wouldn’t know, but enough to ensure Agatha would squirm.</p><p>Her son laughed. “Don’t you have a girlfriend?”</p><p>That perked her ears up as she filled the vase with water. “You do?” She asked like she was unaware, they were supposed to be ‘catching up’ after all.</p><p>Before Rio could explain, Nicky opened his mouth. “Yeah, Miss Vid-” He caught himself. “Rio has this mysterious girlfriend. Sent her flowers last week and on Monday I saw her get a call from someone named Nat. She acted totally shady about it. Billy has his conspiracies, I’m sure.”</p><p>So her son assumed the woman Rio had probably slept with before, the one Rio had used to make her jealous- was her girlfriend’s girlfriend. Cool. Agatha felt great about that and not at all violent.</p><p>“Good for you.” Agatha said in her fakest tone, the one she used when having to converse with the PTA mom’s, like a politician voice</p><p>The way Rio looked at her made it clear she was internally reveling at Agatha’s struggle. “Thanks.”</p><p>Agatha put the flowers on the counter and started bringing over the food, Rio and Nicky swooping in to help. Her girlfriend literally taking the Le Creuset dutch oven out of her hands wordlessly and setting it on the table.</p><p>“Me and the boy got this.” She stated, bobbing her head towards the table for Agatha to take a seat. She watched as her son and girlfriend brought over the rest of the cookware.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, Agatha at the head of the table with Rio and Nicky on either side of her, she lifted the lid off the pot.</p><p>Rio quizzically gazed over the edge of the pot. “Pasteles?”</p><p>“Yeah, mom spent forever cooking and swearing.” He said.</p><p>God, her son was so not helping her look cool right now.</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes too high.” Agatha warned. “We’ll see how edible they actually are.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes looked at her, filled with affection. “I’m sure they’re delicious, mi am-”</p><p>Agatha gave her a gentle but swift kick under the table, reminding Rio of her son’s presence.</p><p>“Oh my god,” She acted apologetic. “I am so sorry, Rio. Didn’t realize your leg was there.”</p><p>She winced and side-eyed Agatha. “No worries.”</p><p>“Okay.” She clapped her hands together. “Dig in.”</p><p>The moment of truth came as everyone plated their food and began eating. Nicky would eat just about anything, the kid was basically a human garbage disposal so Agatha had no worries about him liking the meal, instead her eyes stayed on Rio as she took her first bite. Saying a silent prayer she wasn’t about to desecrate Victoria’s memory with her shitty cooking.</p><p>“Mmmh.” Rio groaned.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she didn’t know she had been holding.</p><p>“Fuck, this is good.” Nicky added.</p><p>She finally picked up her own fork. “Thank god.”</p><p>Rio was going back for another bite. “That’s understating it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I’m glad you like it, but you don’t need to overcompensate.”</p><p>She swallowed. “I’m not. Mis cumplidos a la chef.”</p><p>Nicky looked up from his plate. “My compliments to the chef?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Your mom taught you well.”</p><p>“Eh, a little. She still has a meltdown from time to time when trying to help me with my spanish homework.”</p><p>“I was never good at conjugations!” Agatha defended herself.</p><p>Her son laughed. “You have snapped more than one pencil trying to figure out the tense of a word. One time you said you were going to hunt down and cuss out my teacher.”</p><p>She heard Rio snickering next to her.</p><p>“Felt like she had a vendetta against me.” She grumbled.</p><p>“I can help you whenever,” Rio offered. “Probably less bloodshed that way.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I can speak it and understand it, it’s just writing it out that’s bullshit!”</p><p>“Right.” Nicky nodded. “So just, like, the literacy aspect.” He deadpanned.</p><p>Her girlfriend outwardly cackled. “Agatha Harkness finally humbled, and by her own child nonetheless, ugh it really warms the heart.”</p><p>“Fuck off.” Agatha retorted.</p><p>“No, no, no.” Rio chided like a disappointed teacher. “En español-” She prompted.</p><p>“Vete a la mierda.” She replied with a sickly sweet smile on her face.</p><p>“Muy bien.” Nicky smugly added.</p><p>And she pretended to be annoyed, but Agatha couldn’t think of a time in recent memory where she had felt so content. Content to have dinner with her son and girlfriend, to have the two people she loved most gang up on her. It didn’t feel malicious, it felt like what she had always longed for.</p><p>She wondered what it looked like from the outside looking in. Did it look like a mom and her son having dinner with an old friend, or did they look like a family? Two parents eating with their kid at their kitchen table. Agatha never considered herself the overly-domestic type, but if this was what it was like, she understood the appeal.</p><p>The meal continued, most consisting of Rio and Nicky talking about something and then giving Agatha shit for not knowing what exactly they were on about. It was infuriating, being teased so mercilessly in her own home. It was exasperating, maddening, and she-</p><p>Had never been happier.</p><p>“Okay, but you have to understand, this was twenty years ago,” Rio was telling her story near the end of dinner. “The darkroom didn’t have a lock on it back then, so people could just come and go as they pleased. And my god, poor Lilia-”</p><p>Nicky’s face fell. “She caught people in the darkroom?!”</p><p>Rio nodded through her giggles. “On more than one occasion. That darkroom has seen shit. Hell, one time, I caught your aunt Wanda and Vision-”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha interjected.</p><p>“...Doing absolutely nothing.” She tried to choke back her laughter.</p><p>Nicky’s face was scrunched. “Yall were feral back in the olden days.”</p><p>“If only you knew...” Rio smirked.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>“You never told me about that.” Agatha said in reference to the Wanda/Vision incident.</p><p>“If you asked for a list of everyone who hooked up in that darkroom, we’d be here all night.” Her girlfriend’s eyes gave her a pointed look, as if to remind her that they too, would be on that list.</p><p>That they almost made that list again last week.</p><p>Agatha pushed that very tempting, very dangerous memory out of her mind  as she looked at the now dirtied dishes. “I should bring these over to the sink.” And started getting up.</p><p>Rio placed a gentle hand to her forearm. “No, you cooked. Nicky and I got it. Right, kid?”</p><p>Nicky agreed, getting up and collecting the plates while Rio grabbed the cookware. And Agatha felt…strange?</p><p>Her and Nicky usually cleaned up together, and back when Ralph was around he just fucked off to another part of the house after dinner, avoiding having to actually help. She had always done everything alone, the child-rearing, the chores, the cooking, making the appointments. She paid attention to Nicky’s needs, she organized his schedule, she encouraged his interests. She was so used to handling everything by herself, she didn’t realize what it was like to have a partner around to recognize her work and then offer to help.</p><p>“Why are you loading the dishwasher like that? Who raised you?” Rio sarcastically scolded Nicky.</p><p>Agatha got up from the table. “It’s the most efficient method!”</p><p>“Nothing’s gonna get clean with the plates so close together like that!” Rio shot back. “And sit your ass back down.”</p><p>She complied, hiding the smile currently pulling at her lips.</p><p>“So…how am I doing this?” Nicky cluelessly looked between his mom and teacher, plate in hand.</p><p>“Gimme it.” Rio shooed him from the open appliance. “You’re shafted to tupperware duty.”</p><p>Nicky huffed out a breath and started putting away leftovers.</p><p>A few minutes later, the dishwasher was running and the food was put away. Nicky was leaning against the counter, typing on his phone before he spoke. “Can I go to Billy and Tommy’s?”</p><p>Rio was back at the table with Agatha, pouring herself a glass of wine as, quote- a ‘treat’ for her labor. She picked up her glass and responded before Agatha could.</p><p>“Isn’t Billy grounded?”</p><p>“Yeah, but Tommy isn’t.” He hopefully replied.</p><p>Agatha conceded. “As long as Wanda’s okay with it…”</p><p>“Thanks, mom.” He smiled. “Can I have the car keys?”</p><p>Rio looked at her. “He doesn’t have his own car?”</p><p>“What does he need with a car?”</p><p>“Freedom, convenience, independence…?” Nicky mumbled under his breath, but loud enough for his mom to hear.</p><p>Agatha looked at her son. “Keys are in my purse. Back by curfew or Haley sleeps with the fishes.”</p><p>“Not my almost-wife!” He fake panicked and started leaving the kitchen. “Love you, mom. See you tomorrow, Rio.”</p><p>“Love you, hon.”</p><p>“See ya, kid.”</p><p>She heard her son rustle through her purse before starting to leave.</p><p>“You had a car in high school.” Rio accused.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. “Yeah and I know what we did in it, I don’t need to be a grandmother at forty. Thank god you couldn’t get me pregnant.” She said in a hushed tone, knowing Nicky was not all the way out of the house yet.</p><p>Rio shrugged and grinned ear to ear. “You want me to try?”</p><p>Her brain short-circuited for longer than she’d like to admit. “I-”</p><p>The front door opened and Nicky’s footsteps departed, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Rio craned her neck to look down the hall, making sure it was child-free. Satisfied with the absence, she leaned over a kissed Agatha.</p><p>“Fuck, it was hard not touching you all night.” She mumbled against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha smiled and pulled back fractionally. “You almost blew our cover,” She emphasized her next words. “Mi amor.”</p><p>“It slipped out! It’s like muscle memory now, I didn’t even realize.” Rio kissed her again. “And you kicked me.”</p><p>“And I’d do it again.”</p><p>“Do you think it went well?”</p><p>“Baby, I think it went fucking amazing.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Her girlfriend beamed.</p><p>“Like gangbusters.”</p><p>“So…When are you going to tell him?”</p><p>Agatha got up and took her glass to the sink. “Maybe once the dark cloud named Evanora is no longer of concern.”</p><p>Rio got up and followed. “Makes sense.”</p><p>Agatha rinsed her glass. “Any news from your girlfriend?”</p><p>“Nat hasn’t found anything yet,” Rio started, coming up behind Agatha and setting her hands on Agatha’s hips. “And she’s not my girlfriend.”</p><p>She felt Rio sweep her hair to one side, lips pressing against the exposed side of her neck.</p><p>“My girlfriend is a frustrating,” Rio lowly spoke and placed a feather-light kiss to her skin. “Irritating,” Another kiss. “Stubborn,” Again, another kiss. “Whitty,” Another. “Sexy,” Another. “Lunatic who’s incredibly hot when she’s jealous.” She finished.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were clutching onto the edge of the sink, head lolling back. “You’re playing a dangerous game here, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Fingers gripped a little tighter on her hips. “You know I’ve given it some thought, and I have a few ideas on how you can earn that extra credit.”</p><p>She turned her body around, now facing Rio, and batted her eyelashes. “And, praytell, what’s that?”</p><p>Rio’s hands never left her. “I don’t know if you're up for it, might be a little time consuming.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>She hoisted Agatha onto the kitchen island. “And tiring.”</p><p>“Hmmm.” She threw her arms over Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>“Could leave you a bit sore.” And dragged Agatha closer to the edge, encouraging her to wrap her legs around her waist, which she happily did.</p><p>“You think awfully high of yourself.”</p><p>“Do I not have a reason to? Tell me baby, how’d Pilates feel the day after?”</p><p>Hurt like a bitch, her legs screamed at her throughout the entire class.</p><p>Instead of giving Rio the satisfaction, Agatha shrugged. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Guess I’ll have to rectify that.”</p><p>Her hands splayed against her thighs and dug in as she closed the gap between her and Agatha. She kissed her like she was starved, like she hadn’t seen her three days ago, like they hadn’t woken up together four days ago, like they had fucked five days ago. She kissed Agatha like it really was hard to not touch her all night.</p><p>“I missed you.” Rio breathed out in between kisses.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped, she’d never tire of hearing that.</p><p>“I love you.” She ground out, hands tangling in Rio’s hair.</p><p>Should they be doing this in Agatha’s kitchen right now? No, there were windows everywhere, anybody could look in. Additionally, they had no clue how long Nicky would be gone for, his curfew wasn’t for another two hours, but that didn’t mean he’d be gone that long. But Rio’s tongue was in her mouth, and her son was gone and safe at a friend's house. And maybe, after decades of responsibility, of denying herself this, she convinced herself that she deserves to be a little reckless, a little selfish.</p><p>“What times he gotta be back?” Rio asked and dropped her mouth back down to Agatha’s neck, now lavishing the other side.</p><p>“Not till ten.” She said before releasing a breathy moan at teeth softly indenting her skin.</p><p>“I can work with that.” And pulled Agatha impossibly closer by the belt she was wearing. “You leave this on for me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded at the insinuation, really she just hadn’t changed her clothes after work, figuring that the button up and trousers she always wore to the office would suffice for what was supposed to be an innocent dinner.</p><p>However, if Rio wanted to use her belt for something else, say to restrict Agatha’s movements, who was she to deny her?</p><p>She let out a soft moan at Agatha’s confirmation before kissing her again and fumbling with the belt’s buckle.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whimpered, canting her hips ever so slightly to assist her girlfriend in her goal.</p><p>Her stomach dropped at the thought of what was to come, at the feeling of nothing but Rio overtaking her senses, at the perfect way this night had gone. She was so preoccupied with kissing and having Rio in her grasp she almost missed the noise behind her.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She broke away as her brain registered the sound of small metal objects hitting the floor with a soft clink. Rio looked at her, confused and breathless before her eyes widened at something behind Agatha, something she couldn’t see.</p><p>Now, her stomach really dropped.</p><p>And she knew, she fucking knew, but she had to make sure. She turned her body to follow Rio’s eyeline-</p><p>So much for being smart about this.</p><p>Her son, her poor, sweet, innocent son, stood in the kitchen. The keys were resting on the hardwood floor, his palm still open from when he had dropped them. His mouth agape and his eyes frozen with-</p><p>Well, Agatha didn’t know with what.</p><p>Horror?</p><p>Disgust?</p><p>Shock?</p><p>Anger?</p><p>Disappointment?</p><p>“Forgot my phone.” Nicky quietly spoke, pointing to the counter to Agatha’s left, where his phone did in fact lay.</p><p>Agatha lightly pushed against Rio so she could hop off the kitchen island. “Nicky-”</p><p>“Nope.” He said. “Nope, I’m good.” He collected his phone at breakneck speed and exited the room.</p><p>Keys still on the floor, at least he couldn’t go far.</p><p>She momentarily turned to Rio, “Give me a minute.” And followed after her son up the stairs.</p><p>“Nicky, can we talk about this?” She called after him as he made his way to his bedroom.</p><p>He opened the door and went in, but didn’t close it. “I said I’m good, mom.”</p><p>Agatha entered and shut the door behind her. “You are not good, you got outta there faster than fucking FloJo.”</p><p>Nicky sat on his bed. “Who’s that?”</p><p>“An Olympic runner.”</p><p>“Never heard of him.”</p><p>“Her.” She corrected.</p><p>“Fucking hell, I should really stop assuming, huh?” He retorted, and Agatha knew he wasn’t just referring to the random athlete.</p><p>“You look like you saw a ghost.” She tried to soothe.</p><p>“I saw my mom getting her face eaten off by my teacher! What else was I supposed to look like?”</p><p>That’s actually pretty fair.</p><p>“That isn’t how I wanted you to find out.” Agatha sat down next to him.</p><p>“Just weird is all.” He muttered.</p><p>Okay, time to ask what she was fearing would crush her heart, break her soul, destroy her spirit-</p><p>“Is it ‘cause it was a woman?”</p><p>And Nicky whipped his head in horror, looking at his mom like she just grew an extra head. “What? No, I-” He tripped over the words. “I don’t care if you’re a lesbian, mom. I’m surrounded by gay people all day.  Billy, aunt Jen and aunt Alice, I’m gen Z, like 90% of my friends are some flavor of gay, I’m the anomaly.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, tucking her legs underneath herself and crossing them.</p><p>“I’m not homophobic, mom. I just don’t think I've ever seen you kiss someone, let alone like… that. You and dad never touched and I wasn’t expecting to see that.” He twitched his body like a shiver ran through it.</p><p>Her body finally relaxed, her jaw unclenching.</p><p>“So, you’re not upset?”</p><p>“Honestly, I kind of already had a feeling. You two are not subtle.”</p><p>“Yeah, we get that a lot.”</p><p>“And, she obviously makes you happy, and I like her, so…” He trailed off.</p><p>“So…?” Agatha prompted.</p><p>“I’m good!” He repeated with finality.</p><p>“Just like that?”</p><p>“Yeah, just like that.”</p><p>She looked at him, trying to see if he was hiding his true feelings about the matter, lying to spare her feelings. But as she looked into his stupidly big brown eyes, she saw nothing but the truth.</p><p>“Thanks, hon.” She placed her hand on the back of his head, ruffling his hair.</p><p>“How long have you two been, uh… doing all of… that?”</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>“It always is with lesbians.” He firmly stated.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head.</p><p>“Aunt Jen may have rubbed off on me a little too much.” He explained.</p><p>She chuckled. “Listen, I’m relieved you’re okay with this, but could you maybe not tell anyone? I’m not ashamed or anything like that, there’s just a lot of stuff in play right now, and the quieter this stays, the better.”</p><p>This fucking kid of hers knew her too well. “Is it ‘cause Nana’s a bigot?”</p><p>“How’d-”</p><p>“She made certain comments when you told her I was gonna be the ring bearer for Jen and Alice’s wedding.”</p><p>“You were four.” Damn, kids notice more about their surroundings than Agatha thought.</p><p>“Yeah, and I was the best ring bearer the state of New Jersey has ever seen.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you turned out so great, how’d that happen?” Her eyes were a little teary.</p><p>“Was raised by a really cool lesbian.” He sarcastically replied.</p><p>She chuckled and pulled him into a hug. “C’mere.”</p><p>“Mom! Don’t make this a thing.” He wiggled in her embrace, but she knew he was strong enough to break free if he really wanted to, the kid had at least four inches on her.</p><p>“I will make it a thing, because I love you and because I’m banging your teacher and I feel a little guilty about that.” She teased.</p><p>“Okay,” He broke away. “Good talk.”</p><p>But being the mom she was, Agatha made sure one more time.</p><p>“So we’re okay? You’re okay with Rio?”</p><p>He rolled his eyes, a habit he’d almost certainly picked up from her. “You have my blessing. She’s better than dad.”</p><p>“That’s not saying much.” She quipped.</p><p>“I’ll still kill her if she hurts you.”</p><p>“What’d I say about the macho man shit?”</p><p>“Don’t you dare touch a hair on my wife’s head.” He pointed his finger at her, defending his pixelated villager girlfriend.</p><p>“I will spare her this time.” She finally got up from the bed. “Is school going to be awkward for you tomorrow?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t be as long as I don’t almost catch you two in the darkroom again.” He taunted.</p><p>Motherfucker had already put the pieces together.</p><p>She picked up a pillow off the bed and flung it at him.</p><p>“Okay, now I’m going for your PS5.”</p><p>He deflected the attack. “Don’t joke about that!”</p><p>Agatha gave him a quick kiss on the top of his head before leaving and going back downstairs where she discovered Rio pacing back and forth in her cavernous kitchen.</p><p>“Jesus, took you long enough. Was he mad? Did he take it badly? Does he hate me for mounting his mom in his kitchen where his fucking Cheez-its are?” Rio rambled as soon as she saw Agatha.</p><p>She gripped Rio’s face and gave her a soft kiss. “He’s fine.”</p><p>Her girlfriend’s face scrunched. “Fine?”</p><p>“He had more of an issue with the mounting aspect than the girl-on-girl aspect.”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>“That’s what I thought too.”</p><p>Rio looked down. “I’m just gonna-” And redid the buckle of Agatha’s belt.</p><p>“Again?!” She exclaimed. First it was the zipper, now it was the belt.</p><p>“My fault for always trying to get in your pants.” Rio winked.</p><p>“Well, on that note…”</p><p>“Yeah, I should probably head out.”</p><p>“Can I see you tomorrow night after Ralph picks up Nicky?”</p><p>Rio smiled and nodded. “Looking forward to it, I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>She kissed her once more and walked Rio to the door, saying their goodbyes. Once Rio was gone, Agatha moved back to the kitchen. She downed the rest of the glass of wine her girlfriend hadn’t finished and walked it over to the sink. The little alarm on the dishwasher went off and she opened it, putting away the dishes from dinner and-</p><p>Son of a bitch, her dishes had never looked cleaner.</p>

<p>Rio would like to say that she left Agatha under those bleachers because she had some self-respect, because she knew her worth. Because she deserved better than some apathetic, bitchy, cheerleading closet case. Because she saw the writing on the wall and had enough of a backbone to know when to walk away…</p><p>Rio would like to say that, the unfortunate reality was that she could feel her stomach churning and didn’t need the added embarrassment of vomiting as her ex verbally annihilated her.</p><p>She crossed the field and immediately hunched over, throwing up and tasting the tears slipping down her face. She didn’t want to know how pathetic she looked in this moment compared to Agatha, who was the perfect picture of composure.</p><p>When she got home, her mom called her from the kitchen, but she couldn’t be upright anymore. She booked it to her bedroom and buried herself in the pillows, a fresh wave of tears burning themselves across her skin, her chest shaking to get breaths in through the sobs.</p><p>She heard her mom open her door and move to sit on the bed next to her.</p><p>“Cariño?” Victoria spoke, placing a soothing hand on her daughter’s head, gently carding her hand through Rio’s hair.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t respond, her heart hurt. It felt like it was struggling to keep beating, it felt withered.</p><p>“Rio,” Her mom tried again, obviously concerned. “What happened?”</p><p>“Agatha-” Her voice wobbled, lips trembling. “Ag-” She couldn’t get enough air to explain, her body wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>Her mom’s face relaxed from worry to understanding, she shifted on the bed so she could hold Rio, her arms engulfing her daughter. “She wasn’t your friend, was she?” She asked, but Rio knew by her tone, it was more of a statement.</p><p>Rio shook her head and let out a wail, her voice was useless at this point anyways.</p><p>“She- she said she loved me.” She hiccupped out before her throat closed again, thick with snot.</p><p>“I’m sure she did, mija. I’m sure she still does.”</p><p>“No, she never loved me.” Rio said that much with conviction.</p><p>Because nobody treats a person they love the way Agatha just did, nobody cuts and runs like that when they really care, nobody creates that big of a scar out of fucking love.</p><p>“I saw the way she looked at you, eyes can’t lie like that.” Victoria stated, like it was simple.</p><p>“If she loved me, she wouldn’t have gotten back together with her beard. If she loved me, she would tell me, show me, come out for me. If she loved me, why did she just break my heart?”</p><p>Her mom tutted. “It’s not always that easy.”</p><p>Rio pulled away and sat up. “Bullshit. If she wanted to, she would.”</p><p>Victoria brushed the hair out of Rio’s face and tried to wipe some of the ruined eye makeup off her cheeks. “Do you remember what I said when you came out to me?”</p><p>“Yeah, you said that it didn’t change anything and that you loved me.”</p><p>Rio had come out at fourteen on a random day with zero pomp or circumstance, just said it to her mom while they were gardening and that was that. She never worried that her mom wouldn’t accept her, Victoria’s love felt unconditional because, well, it was.</p><p>“Right and that’s true. But that doesn’t mean that’s how it’ll be for everyone.”</p><p>“Yes, mamá, I know homophobia exists. But Agatha said she would tell people, she said she wanted to be with me. And now she’s choosing some idiot jock because she doesn’t want to ‘live a lesser life’.”</p><p>“Honestly, I feel sorry for her.”</p><p>“You feel sorry for her?!” Rio gawked.</p><p>Victoria shrugged. “She has to live everyday knowing it’s a lie, and that isn’t living, it’s surviving, it’s getting through the day. She won’t be happy.”</p><p>“Good.” She bitterly acknowledged. “I hope she fucking suffers.”</p><p>“Something tells me she already is, mi vida.” Her mom took a breath. “I know you can’t understand this now, but people like Agatha- The ones bound by great expectations? They’re the most insecure people you will ever come across.”</p><p>“Why are you showing her more sympathy than your own daughter?” Rio bit out.</p><p>“Querida, she is awful for hurting you. But you also have to remind yourself of where she comes from, that her house is not a happy one.”</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Because she spent the past several months sneaking in and out of my home at all hours of the day.” She said with one eyebrow raised. “And I know her mother, that woman is el diabla.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. “You knew?”</p><p>“I know everything.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you say anything? Your teenage daughter was sneaking her girlfriend in and letting her stay the night.”</p><p>“What, like I was scared you were gonna get pregnant?” Victoria chuckled. “And if she was coming here so often, it’s only because she didn’t want to be there. I can only imagine what she was running away from.”</p><p>“I never thought about it like that.”</p><p>“Just give it time, the pain is temporary.”</p><p>“Mamá, it doesn’t feel temporary.” Her lip quivered and her eyes pooled. “I don’t think this will ever go away.”</p><p>“So you drown it in comfort food and a few bad decisions, then you feel it a little less, then less, and then a day comes where you barely feel it at all.” Her mom kissed her forehead. “I can run out and buy some junk and we can curl up on the couch and wallow while we stuff our faces”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Victoria smiled and stood. “Maybe I’ll take you to get your bellybutton pierced like you’ve been begging me for.”</p><p>Rio sniffled. “Promise?”</p><p>“Yeah, like I said; food and a bad decision.” She quipped.</p><p>“The piercing is cute!”</p><p>“No, mija, it’s definitely not. But you’re going through your first heartbreak, so I’ll allow it.”</p><p>Her mom, as it turns out twenty years later, was right. She was right about Agatha, about Evanora, and most importantly; the piercing. It stopped being cute after it got infected in the dorm showers her freshman year of college, but she was colossally wrong about one thing-</p><p>The pain.</p><p>It wasn’t temporary and it did not go away. It quieted, but there wasn’t a day that went by in the past two decades when she didn’t feel it.</p><p>Except for the last thirteen days.</p><p>The pain subsided, her heart bloomed again, gaining its color back, its beat. And it was all because of Agatha.</p><p>Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>Last night, mounting incident aside, had been what she always wondered about. She let herself pretend that she had helped her beautiful wife clean up dinner after showing their son how to properly load the damn dishwasher. And something in her heart clicked, thawed, relaxed.</p><p>Obviously Agatha wasn’t her wife and Nicky was not her son, but last night, it felt like they could be, like it was a feasible option, like maybe that future they had imagined when they were young was coming to fruition.</p><p>Nicky knew and was okay with it, not that it surprised Rio, he was a great kid and that was all because of Agatha. But it was still comforting to know that they didn’t have another hoop to jump through, another hurdle standing in their way, another-</p><p>“Why does it look like that?” Billy almost shouted, looking at his filmstrip in his hand.</p><p>First period, and the class and Rio were in the darkroom, developing their rolls from the latest assignment. She had basically drafted Nicky into helping her every period now, being her teaching assistant.</p><p>Technically unpaid labor, but there were twenty-two of these idiots and one of her, she needed backup and Nicky was the only student who possessed more than a single brain cell it seemed.</p><p>Okay, and maybe she’s biased, fucking sue her.</p><p>Nicky walked over to Billy and grabbed the filmstrip.</p><p>“You prematurely exposed it, dumbass.” He laughed at Billy.</p><p>“Miss Vidal! Nicky just called me a dumbass!” Billy squeaked.</p><p>Rio turned around from where she was helping another student.</p><p>“Well, were you a dumbass?” She diplomatically asked.</p><p>Nicky was nodding and giggling as Billy just stood there in shame.</p><p>“Little bit.” He conceded.</p><p>Rio clapped her hands together to get the room's full attention. “Okay, seeing as all of you gravely misunderstood the assignment.” She pointedly looked at Wanda’s spawn. “I’ll let you guys take the weekend before you have to turn it in. Remember, I said candid portraits, half of you definitely posed the subjects and the other half are still struggling to develop a photo correctly. Or in one very special case, struggling to properly load a roll of film.”</p><p>The bell rang, signifying the end of the period.</p><p>“Have a good weekend, and if you disappoint me again, I’m coming to your homes and I’m hiding in your walls. I have access to all of your addresses.” She deadpanned, watching her students funnel out. “And don’t tell Mrs. Davis I said that!”</p><p>“Hey Ri-” Nicky walked up and corrected himself. “Miss Vidal, god that’s going to be a bitch to get used to.” He said, referring to switching back and forth between Rio’s first and last name in between school and home.</p><p>She was pouring out the bath of developer chemicals. “What’s up, kid?”</p><p>They hadn’t really spoken all period, not on purpose, but Rio didn’t mind the buffer of students between her and the kid she traumatized last night.</p><p>“I actually did the assignment, so can I just develop it and turn it in during fifth period?”</p><p>“Sure, do you want me to help?”</p><p>He slung his camera over his neck, getting ready to leave. “No, I got it. See you in a few.”</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>He never turned Rio’s help down before. And he left kind of abruptly. Was he actually okay with her dating his mom? Fuck, did he feel uncomfortable around Rio now?</p><p>She pondered that lovely little anxiety producing thought for the next several class periods until fifth period arrived. She sat up a little straighter at her desk as Nicky and Billy entered, her girlfriend’s son heading straight for the darkroom.</p><p>Billy stayed in the classroom, trying to get her attention.</p><p>“How are things with you and my aunt going?” He asked, and he looked too fucking smug for Rio’s liking.</p><p>“I don’t know, how are things with the assignment going?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to prematurely expose it!” He slouched, then leaned over conspiratorially. “When are you going to tell Nicky?”</p><p>“He already knows.” She shrugged.</p><p>“WHAT?” He yelled.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this day!” Billy sprinted into the darkroom and called after Nicky. “I have so many ‘Miss Vidal is fucking YOUR mom’ jokes to catch up on!”</p><p>She heard Nicky groan. “Billy, I swear to god, I hear one from you and I’m strangling you with your own camera strap.”</p><p>Good god, he really was Agatha’s son.</p><p>Near the end of the period, after Billy had in fact made the joke and was subsequently punched in the shoulder by Nicky, a photo was slid onto her desk. It was a candid portrait, one of Agatha in her living room. Nicky must’ve taken it when she wasn’t paying attention because she was on the couch reading a book. She had either just started reading or was just finishing because Rio saw a little folded corner she used as a bookmark. She was in leggings and a sweater, hair tousled and glasses sitting on the tip of her nose. And she had this dopey smile on her face, Rio saw it even though the photo was taken from her side profile. The lighting was low, and the setting felt cozy, intimate even. A frozen moment in time where Agatha was just being.</p><p>“I took this on Tuesday night, I didn’t realize it at the time, but she had just gotten off the phone with you.” Nicky quietly explained. “She basically looks like that anytime she talks to you or is around you.”</p><p>Rio looked up. “Is this when you give me the ‘don’t hurt my mom’ speech?”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “No, mom said I’m not allowed.”</p><p>“Hmmm.”</p><p>“But I also don’t think it's necessary.” And he said it casually, but Rio picked up on the deeper meaning.</p><p>Stupid fucking thawed out, not-black heart.</p><p>She blinked back the wetness trying to escape her eyes. “Thanks, Nicky.”</p><p>“Yeah.” He started turning to head out. “Just maybe keep things PG in common spaces? Eating my cereal at the kitchen island this morning was kinda disturbing.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Heard.”</p><p>“Also, I expect noise canceling headphones as compensation at some point.”</p><p>“Fair.” She agreed as he made his way to the door. “Wait, Nicky-”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“So does she only wear these glasses when she reads, or how can I get her to wear them around me?” She pointed at the print still in her hand.</p><p>Tender moment aside, she needed to see Agatha in those fucking glasses again, like in a biblical sense.</p><p>“Ughh,” He faked a gag. “C’mon man…” He shamed as he finally left.</p><p>The rest of the day was decidedly worse, dumb kids, freak accidents, a metric fuckton of assignments to grade. She just wanted to lay down and not have anyone bug her for a minute, the only thing getting her through the day was knowing she’d see Agatha at the end of it.</p><p>Around five PM, she called it a day, collecting her things and her girlfriend’s kid who had been hanging out in her classroom since the last bell of the day.</p><p>“You want a ride home?” Rio asked as she closed and locked her door.</p><p>“Why cause you’re heading there anyways?”</p><p>She threw up her arms. “You want the ride or not?”</p><p>“Better than walking.” He grinned.</p><p>After many, many jokes from Nicky about how old her car was, they arrived at the Harkness compound and went in. What Rio was not expecting was for Ralph to already be there, she couldn’t see him, but she could hear him and Agatha fighting in the kitchen as she and Nicky entered the foyer.</p><p>“You always fucking do this, you never support me in anything!” Ralph shouted.</p><p>“You’re taking a job in a different state without considering your own son, forgive me if I’m not supporting your absentee parenting!” Agatha screamed.</p><p>So they definitely did not hear her and Nicky walk in, and they couldn’t see her and the boy because they were around the corner.</p><p>“I’m not absent!”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “What’s your son’s middle name? When’s his birthday? What’s his favorite color or his favorite class? Where does he wanna go to college?”</p><p>Victor, June second, blue, black and white photography and NYU. But that’s all surface level bullshit, so Rio wasn’t going to give herself too much credit. Any parent would know those basic things about their own child.</p><p>“God you just always have to make me feel small, don’t you? You fucking thrive on it!”</p><p>“You can’t answer those fucking questions because you never think to ask him about himself or remember anything about him!”</p><p>She looked at Nicky who refused to make eye contact, like he was embarrassed, like it was his fault his dad was negligent.</p><p>“Why don’t you go upstairs and pack?” Rio placed a hand on his arm, trying to comfort him without further embarrassment.</p><p>He nodded and started up the stairs to his room.</p><p>“I can see him on holidays and breaks from school, it’s not like he’ll miss me!” Ralph deflected.</p><p>“ARE YOU EVEN GOING TO MISS HIM?” Agatha practically fucking roared.</p><p>Please god, may Rio never be on the receiving end of a scream like that.</p><p>And apparently, this was how the two of them were, because he didn’t even take a beat before matching her volume.</p><p>“I WON’T MISS HAVING TO DEAL WITH YOUR BULLSHIT EVERY WEEK, AGATHA.”</p><p>“God, you are such a fucking prick!”</p><p>“You’re such a fucking bitch!”</p><p>Okay, time for Rio to intervene.</p><p>She threw her bag and jacket on the coat hook by the front door and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>“Hey guys, Nicky is upstairs, so maybe we stop the screaming. Especially Ralph, because if I hear you call her that again, I’m going to have to punch you and we all know how that ended last time.”</p><p>Both Agatha and Ralph whipped their necks over to look at Rio.</p><p>Ralph was in a wrinkled suit, Agatha was in a pantsuit that Rio would appreciate much more thoroughly at a later moment in time.</p><p>“What the hell is she doing here?” Ralph glared, his eyes enraged.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but Rio cut her off.</p><p>“Gave Nicky a ride home.”</p><p>“Why is she around my kid?” He pushed.</p><p>“Cause she’s his fucking teacher, you moron! His favorite one if you ever fucking listened to him!” Agatha shouted in hushed tones, obviously trying to make an effort with the knowledge that her son was home.</p><p>“Who let her around children?!” He yelled, obviously not trying to make an effort with the knowledge that his son was home.</p><p>“Keep your voice down!” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“That’s it, I’m fucking done. I’m taking my son, he’ll see you Sunday.” Ralph stomped out of the kitchen and into the foyer. “Nicky!” He called upstairs.</p><p>Agatha and Rio followed him into the foyer, watching as Nicky slumped down the stairs like it was a funeral procession with his duffel bag in hand, his backpack slung over his shoulder, and his camera around his neck.</p><p>Ralph took Nicky’s duffel and opened the front door. “I’ll be waiting in the car.” He hissed and stormed off.</p><p>Nicky looked at his mom and Rio. “He’s gonna be fun this weekend.” He deadpanned.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Let me know if we need to jailbreak you, I don’t care if he pulls the custody agreement card again, I’ll bribe a judge.”</p><p>Her son gave a tired laugh. “Thanks, mom.”</p><p>“I love you.” She pulled him into a hug.</p><p>He hugged her back, kind of like he didn’t want to let go. “Love you too.”</p><p>They stayed like that before Agatha finally pulled away. “Okay, go, go. Before he starts honking.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “He does that?”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “More than once.”</p><p>“Fuck.” She muttered under her breath.</p><p>“Thanks for the ride, Rio.” He smiled, but it wasn’t genuine, he looked too sad.</p><p>“Anytime.” She smiled back.</p><p>”Okay, well-” Nicky started before there was an obnoxious honk from outside. “Jesus fucking christ!” He opened the front door. “Bye guys.” He waved and disappeared out the door.</p><p>They stood there for a minute in silence before Agatha turned to Rio.</p><p>“Wanna get high?”</p><p>Rio let out an exasperated chuckle. “Fuck yes.”</p>

<p>“Motherfucking, cocksucking-”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio tried to soothe.</p><p>“Moronic fucking imbecile of a waste of fucking life,” Her hands worked faster.</p><p>“Hmmm.”</p><p>“Small-dicked fucking deadbeat!” Agatha was still gripping the grinder, seemingly trying to take out her frustration on her ex-husband via the small metal compact.</p><p>“I think it's ground.” Rio stated.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands, realizing that she may have overdone it.</p><p>They were in Agatha’s home office, the only room in the house that Nicky would never think to look for her stash. Honestly, she was a little offended to hear him assume she’d keep it somewhere as obvious and juvenile as her jewelry box.</p><p>But Agatha’s rage could power a small city right now.</p><p>“I’d say I can’t believe him, but I very much fucking can.” She bitterly told her girlfriend.</p><p>Rio was sitting next to her on the couch that was against the wall opposite the lit fireplace. “What happened?”</p><p>“He came to pick up Nicky early, I said he wasn’t home yet, so he said that we should talk before our son hears my, quote, ‘hysterics’.” Agatha huffed and watched Rio’s jaw clench. “Then he told me that while he was in Philly at that work conference, he was offered a promotion. God knows why, the man has the IQ of wet cardboard.”</p><p>“Well, Philly’s only like an hour and a half away,” Rio tried to comfort.</p><p>“Oh no, no, no. See that’s what I thought. That’s not what pissed me off. What pissed me off was him telling me that the job was in fucking Texas and that he already accepted it!”</p><p>“Gross, Texas.” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha sighed and leaned over to the coffee table where her rolling tray was, along with her papers.</p><p>“He didn’t even take into account his own son, because why would he? I basically raise Nicky alone already, always have, so why can’t he just fuck off to Texas?”</p><p>“Mi amor-”</p><p>“I just saw red, I couldn’t help it.” Agatha exclaimed, gesturing wildly. “He’s never there for Nicky, never has been. Wasn’t there when he was born, wasn’t there for a single elementary school recital or choir concert, wasn’t there last year when Nicky made honor roll and got a special fucking award. And I have always made an effort for him to be involved in his son’s life, despite the fact that he’s essentially nothing more than a sperm donor at this point!”</p><p>Agatha had told Ralph dates and times before and after they were divorced, and Nicky always brushed off his dad’s absence but she knew it had to hurt. Her son had tried, tried for so many years to make himself smaller, brush off his own wants and needs all for Ralph to not feel like the shitty parent that he absolutely was. And it killed her, it killed her that she couldn’t fix it for Nicky, that she couldn’t give him a better dad, one who saw and appreciated how fucking cool he was. How smart and witty and talented he was, Agatha didn’t regret having her son, but she fucking despised that she had him with Ralph. Even lesbianism aside, Agatha could’ve found a man with a brain and some empathy, but no, Evanora wanted her to marry Ralph, so she did.</p><p>Hell, her mother was more maternal to her ex-husband than she ever was to Agatha. Always praising him for doing the bare minimum like ‘babysitting’ Nicky while Agatha ran errands. Ralph changed a diaper and you’d think he discovered life on another planet by the way Evanora reacted. He could never do any wrong in her eyes, probably because he was a man, and rich, and not her own daughter. When she found out that he’d had an affair all she did was shrug and tell Agatha that she must not be doing enough to keep him satisfied at home, which was technically true, but it wasn’t any less revolting to hear.</p><p>Rio nodded. “I agree but you have to stop throwing your hands around, you’ll get weed everywhere.”</p><p>She looked at her and chuckled. “Sorry, this is not romantic.”</p><p>“On the contrary, misandry is very romantic in my opinion.” Her girlfriend smirked.</p><p>Agatha smiled, finally feeling like she could breathe for the first time all day. “Thank you for giving Nicky a ride home.”</p><p>“Well, it wasn’t completely selfless of me, I expect payment in drugs and sex.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over and kissed her. “Gimme a minute to roll this, and both of those things can be arranged.” She spoke against Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Good, I hear you rich types never pay your debts.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and popped the lid of the grinder.</p><p>“You are one classy broad.” Rio said, examining Agatha’s set up.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Your tray looks like its made of crystal, you have lavender rolling papers, you even have matching fucking filters! I’m surprised something isn’t monogrammed.”</p><p>Agatha wordlessly handed her the lid of the matching lilac grinder, snickering as she started rolling up the sleeves of her button up.</p><p>Rio looked at the engraved initials, ‘A.H.’, on the top of the lid and chuckled. “You have quite the affinity for putting people’s initials on things.”</p><p>“What can I say? I’ve been told I’m a classy broad.” She pulled out a paper and started working.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha said without even looking up.</p><p>“How’d this,” She motioned to Agatha and held up the lid of the grinder for reference. “Come about? You never struck me as the burnout type.”</p><p>She let out a bitter laugh. “It’s um, kind of a long story.”</p><p>Rio just looked at her, eyebrows shot up as if she was expecting her to keep going.</p><p>“It was prescribed to me by my therapist.” She spoke, not looking up from her task.</p><p>“You’re in therapy?” Rio sounded absolutely gobsmacked at the revelation.</p><p>“I was.” And Agatha left it there, but her girlfriend knew her too well.</p><p>“Your mother find out?”</p><p>“Bullseye.”</p><p>“Why’d you start?”</p><p>And even though they were together, and Rio was as committed to Agatha as she could possibly be, catching her up on the last twenty years still gave her pause, made her hesitate. Not because she thought Rio would be scared off, but because Agatha hated thinking about it.</p><p>She blew out a breath and bit the bullet. “After I had Nicky, I started getting these really bad panic attacks. I was overwhelmed and I wasn’t taking care of myself.”</p><p>Rio nodded, genuinely listening.</p><p>“One day Ralph and I were fighting, screaming at each other, and I snapped and threw a plate at his head. I missed, but Nicky saw it… and he was so young and he looked so afraid, and I guess I just…” She trailed off.</p><p>“You what?” Rio softly asked.</p><p>“I started thinking; what if I snapped at him next time? Like what if something like that was just inside me by default because of my mother? He was so vulnerable and he relied on me for his safety, his protection from everything bad in the world.” She kept rolling, not looking at Rio, only at what she was doing with her hands. “I think I was five the first time I remember my mother backhanding me, and Nicky couldn't have been much older at the time. The panic attacks got worse and I didn’t have anyone to talk to about them. I was convinced it was just destined that I’d become my mother.”</p><p>Rio placed a reassuring hand on Agatha’s thigh. “You could never be her. You’d never hurt Nicky.”</p><p>“Well fuck, you could’ve saved me a lot of money in shrink bills.” Agatha quips, finally looking at Rio, brown eyes flooded with love, with understanding. “When Nicky was six, I finally started going. The therapist tried prescribing Valium, but I hated how it made me feel. I wasn’t panicking anymore but I was also just kind of numb? Then it was Prozac, then Xanax, then another and another. Finally, my doctor recommended weed, and voilá, here we are.”</p><p>Agatha held up her work, perfectly rolled.</p><p>“Prettiest joint I’ve ever seen.” Rio praised.</p><p>“Excuse me, it’s a blunt, be accurate when giving me validation.”</p><p>She grinned. “You know you’re a great mom, right?”</p><p>“You’ve seen me and him together all of like three times.” Agatha tried to brush it off.</p><p>“I didn’t need to see you guys together at all. Even before I knew Nicky was yours, I knew he had a loving and supportive mom. The way he talks about you? Agatha, that kid knows you’d sell your soul for him.”</p><p>And she would, she’d sell her soul, bury her own heart, give piece after piece of herself if it meant her son was okay.</p><p>“You raised a straight white guy who was born into generational wealth, who isn’t an entitled douchebag. Do you know how hard that is? Nicky is empathetic and kind and well-liked at school. He went out of his way today to make me feel better.”</p><p>“Sounds like him.” Agatha chuckled, placing the blunt between her lips and lighting it.</p><p>“Sounds like you.” She corrected and plucked the blunt from Agatha’s lips and perched it between her own, inhaling.</p><p>“I did all that work, and I don’t even get the first hit?”</p><p>Rio exhaled the smoke. “Lo siento, mi amor.”</p><p>She repositioned herself in Agatha’s lap, one leg bent on either side of her hips, straddling her. Rio looked down at her as she took another hit, her free hand dropped to Agatha’s face. Her love placed her thumb on her chin, lightly pulling down. Agatha’s mouth instinctively parted, waiting.</p><p>Rio bent down and gently blew the smoke that had just been in her lungs into Agatha’s mouth. She didn’t think, just inhaled, Rio’s lips ghosting over hers. She felt the burn of the smoke hit her and thought it must’ve been as close to heaven as she’ll ever get. This, right now, with Rio, this would be Agatha’s heaven. If she could just have this, Rio and Nicky, Agatha would happily retire to the afterlife, she’d give up her mortal body and ties if it just meant getting to have them.</p><p>She didn’t pull away after she ran out of smoke to give. “Better?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized her eyes had closed, she fluttered them open and looked up. Rio was smiling down at her, hair curtaining her face. She hadn’t realized her hands had made their way to Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Do that again.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head. “We’ve barely smoked this,” She held up the blunt that sat between her index and middle finger. “But maybe later if you’re good.” She smirked and slid off Agatha’s lap.</p><p>Agatha took it from Rio and inhaled a deep hit in response. Trying to flood her emotions in smoke, Rio calling her good did something to her, something she did not wish to analyze too closely.</p><p>As the time passed, and the blunt nearly burned down to the filter, her and Rio kept talking, mostly about the time in between. The twenty years that had passed them by.</p><p>Eyes red, and hair wild, Agatha cackled. “She fucking knew?”</p><p>Rio’s legs were slung over her lap, back resting against the arm of the couch, staring at Agatha with her undivided attention.</p><p>She was laughing uncontrollably. “Of course she fucking knew, she said she heard you sneaking in and out all the time.”</p><p>“Why didn’t she call us on it?”</p><p>“Said she figured it was better than staying at your house. Called Evanora the devil.”</p><p>Agatha wiped her eyes, tears forming out of the laughter. “Victoria Vidal, the woman you are.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Well, was.”</p><p>Fuck, only Agatha would get high enough to pour salt in her girlfriend’s ‘dead mom’ wound.</p><p>“Shit, baby, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio started playing with the ends of her hair. “Don’t be, honestly it’s kind of nice not to have her pointing in my face bragging that she told me so.”</p><p>“You think she’d do that?”</p><p>And that made her giggle, almost manically so. “If she were here right now, she’d say something like ‘See, mija? Eyes don’t lie.’”</p><p>“Your Victoria impression is uncanny.”</p><p>“Then she’d hug you and thank god that she finally had a grandkid to spoil, probably insist that Nicky call her abuelita before asking when the wedding was.”</p><p>Grandkid. Like Nicky was Rio’s.</p><p>“Do you ever think about what would’ve happened if we had stayed together?”</p><p>“Through college?” Rio asked.</p><p>“An hour and nine minutes.” Agatha affirmed.</p><p>And Rio looked at her like she was watching every single ‘what if’ she’d ever imagined play in her head. Like she’d thought of a million different outcomes and was trying to find her favorite.</p><p>“I think we’d be married.” Rio softly spoke.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Have a few kids.”</p><p>And even in her current state, which was very fucking high, Agatha could see the the life Rio had conjured.</p><p>“One of them would be Nicky, obviously. “ Rio continued. “But I always thought we’d have a girl.”</p><p>Agatha could see Rio with a little girl. Could see her braiding her hair, and taking her to the park, soothing her tears after she skinned her knee. And Agatha could see herself right there too. Holding the hair tie, yelling at Rio for pushing the swing too hard, bandaging her knee.</p><p>“I don’t think Nicky would be the same Nicky.” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“Hey, it’s my fantasy. So if I want Nicky there, then he’s there, you don't dictate my alternate reality.”</p><p>“Where would we live?”</p><p>“Nice house, quiet street, garden in the back-”</p><p>“Vaulted ceilings.” Agatha supplied.</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes glassy, but not from the weed or the smoke.</p><p>She gazed at Rio as she spoke. “We’d have to live close enough to Victoria that she could watch the kids.”</p><p>“We’d never see them again, mamá would kidnap ‘em, we’d have a hostage situation on our hands.”</p><p>“I’d comply with her demands.” Agatha smiled. “We need our date nights and I’m not leaving them with my mother.”</p><p>“Oh, Evanora’s dead in this world.” Rio quipped.</p><p>She gasped. “How’d she go?”</p><p>“Didn’t you hear? Mugging gone wrong, yeah tragic, and they never caught the guy.”</p><p>“So she just abandoned me with her millions of dollars?” Agatha pouted. “How will we cope?”</p><p>“You take over her company and run it, well, ethically.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’d teach.”</p><p>She furrowed her brows. “But you always wanted to change the world.”</p><p>“Still could, maybe I teach the next person to change the world. Maybe it’s Nicky.”</p><p>“And that’d make you happy? Staying in Westview? Living and teaching in suburbia?”</p><p>Agatha had crushed Rio all those years ago so she could have her dream, get out of their tiny little town and do amazing things.</p><p>“I’d be happy as long as I’m with you.” Rio said without hesitation. “Doesn’t matter where, as long as I have you and Nicky.”</p><p>She felt a single tear roll down her cheek, she didn’t even realize her eyes had started welling.</p><p>“Can’t forget our unnamed daughter.” She said, trying to keep her tone light, this was all just hypothetical anyways.</p><p>“Victoria.”</p><p>“What about her?”</p><p>“No, I’m saying, if I ever had a daughter, I’d name her Victoria.” Rio explained.</p><p>“So our son and daughter would share a name?”</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “Are we talking about the fantasy or reality?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t caught Rio’s switch in tenses, she was talking about a real daughter, not an imagined one. And yet, Agatha hadn’t even thought about the difference, just assumed.</p><p>“Whichever you want.”</p><p>“What I want…” Rio raised the basically-gone blunt to her lips. “Is for you to open your mouth for me.“ And inhaled before flicking the leftover filter into the crystal ashtray on the coffee table and leaning in even closer.</p><p>Like a knee-jerk reaction, Agatha complied, lips parting, taking whatever Rio would give her. She’d take anything from this woman, whether it be something as fleeting as smoke, or as solid and tangible as the love Rio bestowed.</p><p>She inhaled, feeling her lungs contract and expand before lurching forward and pressing her lips to Rio’s. It was sweet, but no less passionate than any of their other kisses. Neither of them battled for control, just lost themselves in one another. She felt the way Rio’s breath picked up, hitching. She felt Rio’s hands tangle in her hair, felt her pull her closer, felt the moan Rio released vibrate against her lips. All Agatha could do was feel, feel her heart race and swell, feel the softness of Rio’s skin as her hands slipped under her shirt, feel the love that she had kept sheltered but not unnurtured for two decades.</p><p>She leaned in further and further until Rio slumped down, laying flat against the couch, pulling Agatha on top of her, refusing to let go. Hands flew to her button up, yanking it open without care, buttons flying to the floor before the garment itself joined. Agatha did the same, pulling at Rio’s shirt before flinging it into some dark corner of the room.</p><p>She paused, gazing down at this woman, a woman she’d worship, devout her life to, pray to, she’d sell all her earthly possessions and kneel at the altar of Rio.</p><p>Or maybe she was just high.</p><p>Her movements to get Rio’s pants off were rushed and messy, she needed to be close to her, needed to show her the love she couldn’t begin to verbalize. Rio raised her hips to aid in Agatha’s goal, without thought or hesitation, kicking the rest of the offending denim to the floor.</p><p>This was taking too long, Agatha pushed Rio’s bra up far enough and dropped her mouth to her tits. Kissing before taking a nipple into her mouth and gently sucking.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio whined, hands on the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>She didn't respond, bringing a hand to cup Rio through the soaked green lace panties, groaning.</p><p>Rio moaned. “Don’t tease.”</p><p>And who was she to deny her?</p><p>She moved her head to the neglected nipple and slipped her hand beneath the waistband, she’d rip them off later, right now she just needed to feel her. She ran her digits through the wetness dripping onto her hand before running methodical circles over Rio’s clit.</p><p>The love of her life arched her back, nails digging into the exposed skin of Agatha’s back and letting out a breathy whine. Agatha wished she was recording this, listen to that sound over and over until it was burned into her brain.</p><p>“Inside, please, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her way up over Rio’s collarbones, up to her neck, burying herself in the crook. She complied, sinking two fingers and feeling the way Rio shuddered in response, clinging to Agatha as though her life depended on it.</p><p>As she thrust, all she could get out was what she was thinking, what she knew was etched into her bones, what she carried and hadn’t dared to set down for twenty years.</p><p>“I love you.”  Agatha whispered against Rio’s throat. “I love you, love you-”</p><p>Rio let out something akin to a growl, nails biting into once unblemished skin of Agatha’s shoulder blades.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, broken and clenching around her fingers.</p><p>Her fingers kept moving, trying to get deeper, trying and desperately wanting to communicate the devotion she couldn’t quite ever seem to shake.</p><p>Legs wrapped around her waist, pulling her ever closer.</p><p>The only noise in the room was the crackling of the fire and the heavy breathing escaping Rio’s lungs.</p><p>“More.” Rio whined.</p><p>Anything, anything for her.</p><p>Agatha added a third finger, redoubling her efforts as Rio’s walls stretched around her, swallowing her.</p><p>She lifted her head up and made eye contact, brown eyes lidded and lost in lust but fighting to stay open.</p><p>“Reality.” Rio moaned out. “I want it to be reality.”</p><p>Oh, she was not just high. Agatha craved that reality more than she craved another day on this planet.</p><p>Her hand didn’t stop.</p><p>“It will be.” Pressing her palm to Rio’s clit, giving her something to grind against.</p><p>Rio’s back bowed, her head snapped back, and her mouth let out a scream from the back of her throat. Her whole body rippled with pleasure as her hips bucked. Agatha’s eyes were trained on her face until she felt something wet, too wet, pooling in her palm. The front of her pants had residual cum currently drying. She looked down before smirking.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>Her eyes hadn’t opened. “Shut up.”</p><p>Agatha felt like a fucking god in this moment. “Does that always happen when you’re high?”</p><p>Rio finally looked up. “No,” She deadpanned. “I do not always squirt when I’m high, Agatha.”</p><p>She pulled her hand out, gawking down at the evidence of Rio’s orgasm.</p><p>Agatha looked back at her girlfriend who was disheveled and breathless, and all she wanted to do was make it happen again, over and over until Rio couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“Bedroom. Now.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As Rio sat on a white folding chair on the football field on the first Friday in June of 2005, she made a pointed effort not to look for Agatha. Should be easy enough, everyone was lost in a sea of polyester scarlet graduation gowns, matching caps obscuring faces. The fucking tassel was pissing Rio off, squirming in her seat and batting at it like a cat bats at a string.</p><p>No, she had avoided Agatha for the last month in the halls, only catching glimpses of her and Ralph and the rest of her cronies. If Agatha didn’t want to her see face, then fine, she’d bide her time until she left for New York in August and never set a foot in Westview fucking New Jersey ever again.</p><p>“-And now, a few words from our valedictorian,” Mrs. Davis’ squeaky voice rang out through the speakers from the large stage on the field. “Even though I don’t understand why we couldn’t have the salutatorian speak this year….” She grumbled under her breath. “Agatha Harkness!” And flourished out her hand as the parents in the stands and the students on the field all started clapping.</p><p>All except for Rio.</p><p>Agatha stood from her spot on the field, basically fucking strutting onto the stage. Shoulders back, head held high, smile practiced, hair flowing. She looked like she was treating this as though it was Miss America, and what was even more annoying? Rio knew she’d probably fucking win.</p><p>She approached the podium that Mrs. Davis had vacated and spoke into the microphone. “Thank you, Mrs. Hart.”</p><p>The class let out a collective wave of chuckles and laughs at the inside joke.</p><p>Agatha looked relaxed, as if speaking in front of basically the whole town was nothing more than a minor inconvenience. She gingerly held her note cards, but barely looked down at them.</p><p>“I’d like to start by thanking the faculty, the teachers and administration who supported and taught us over the last four years. Who molded us into who we are today, who guided us into the next phase of our lives. Thank you, what we take from this institution will be invaluable.”</p><p>Bullshit. Agatha loathed the faculty and tortured the principal, Rio can’t think of a single time where Agatha had ever mentioned even having a favorite teacher.</p><p>“To our parents, who nurtured us, inspired us, and influenced us. Our success here today is a reflection of your efforts and hard work and we are forever grateful to you.” Agatha’s voice wavered, not enough for anyone else to notice, but Rio knew what it sounded like. She paused for a mili-second, almost like she knew how ridiculous the speech sounded. “You’ve held our hands through heartbreak, wiped our tears during finals, and supported our academic and extracurricular pursuits. Whatever we move onto next will no doubt be your accomplishment as much as it is ours.”</p><p>Yeah, Rio doubted Evanora actually did any of that. Not that it mattered anymore, whatever mommy issues Agatha struggled with was no longer any of Rio’s concern.</p><p>“And finally, to my fellow students- I have enjoyed the time we spent together.”</p><p>Lying fucking liar.</p><p>“I have enjoyed the community we’ve built and the memories we’ve made, the games, the rallies, the dances, the practices. I’ve enjoyed the friendships I’ve forged, old and new. I will take them with me into the next chapter, and I hope you will too. Whether it be higher education, the workforce, or the military, I encourage you all to carry those connections with you. I encourage you to nourish those friendships, those relationships, even if they’re worlds apart after today. Whether the distance be the other side of the country or only an hour and nine minutes,”</p><p>Rio’s heart strained.</p><p>Stormy blue eyes briefly flickered over to Rio, “I hope we see each other again.” And were gone just as soon as they had landed.</p><p>She felt crazy, unsure of what just happened, if that even did happen. No, she had to be insane, it had to be a coincidence, Agatha had made it very clear where they stood with one another and seeing eachother again was not part of the agreement.</p><p>“I know we have all prayed for this day, army-crawled to the light at the end of the tunnel, dreamt of nothing but moving our tassels to the other side of our caps. But as I stand before you today, I am sorry it’s here. I will miss the conversations we had in hushed tones during class, I will miss the school spirit radiating throughout the halls after the football team won another game, but most of all; I will miss seeing your faces everyday.”</p><p>Sure as hell won’t miss Agatha’s gorgeous, fucking ethereal face.</p><p>“I am honored to be your valedictorian, and I am honored to be a part of Westview High’s 2005 graduating class. Thank you.”</p><p>Clapping and cheering erupted as Agatha took her leave, walking back to her seat, practiced smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes unfaltering.</p><p>After they moved their tassels and threw their caps, Rio collected her diploma and tried to haul ass out of there. She stopped after the ceremony, eyes scanning the crowd in the bleachers for her mom, and no luck. She’d have to stand here and wait until Victoria found her. She looked around at the other students, all huddled off in groups talking and laughing on the field.</p><p>Wanda came bounding up to her, throwing her arms around Rio before she could register her presence.</p><p>“Can you believe we’re done?” Wanda said, her accent was almost gone.</p><p>Rio hugged her back, Wanda was possibly the only person she’d miss after today. “Thank fucking god.”</p><p>Wanda giggled and pulled away. “A few of us are grabbing a bite and then there’s a party at Ralph’s later tonight, you wanna come?”</p><p>“Hard pass.”</p><p>“C’mon! It’ll be fun and we never see each other anymore!”</p><p>“Yeah, cause you hang out with three most evil people to ever grace the east coast.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“They’re not that bad, just a little…” She was trying to find a word that was accurate but not mean. “Abrasive.”</p><p>Oh, the irony.</p><p>That’s what Agatha had called Rio their first day under the bleachers together nine months ago.</p><p>“I’ve had enough abrasion for one lifetime, but thanks for the offer, Wands.” Rio said.</p><p>Wanda nodded in understanding. “Okay, well, we’ll have to get together this summer.”</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>Not because Wanda had done anything wrong, but because Rio planned on spending the summer self-isolating until her dorm room at NYU was available.</p><p>“Definitely.” Rio smiled.</p><p>“Keep in touch?” Wanda warmly smiled back.</p><p>“Promise.” She lied.</p><p>She didn’t want ties to anyone here, she wanted a fresh start.</p><p>Wanda gave her arm one last squeeze before scampering off and joining another group of students. Rio’s gaze followed the redhead, seeing the group she joined.</p><p>Vision, Jen, Alice, Ralph, and Agatha.</p><p>He had his arm slung around Agatha’s waist as she spoke with Alice, throwing her head back and laughing at something that was just said.</p><p>She stared for a moment longer, on the outside looking in, a preview as to what the rest of Agatha’s life would look like. That perfectly performed heteronormative life, the one Rio couldn’t give her.</p><p>Maybe in another lifetime.</p><p>“You ready to get out of here?” Her mom came up beside her.</p><p>Rio ripped her gaze from the Norman Rockwell painting in the making, and nodded. “Good fucking riddance.”</p><p>Rio didn’t see Wanda that summer, instead putting her energy into packing and barricading herself in her studio. When her move-in date rolled around, she threw the last of her things into her mom’s car.</p><p>“Got everything?” Victoria asked, walking by with her keys dangling off her fingers and reaching for the driver’s side door.</p><p>“Almost. Have you seen my Bikini Kill shirt? I rifled through my dresser and my closet like ten times looking for it.” She closed the trunk.</p><p>“It’s not in the laundry, but if I find it, I’ll mail or drop it off.”</p><p>“Mamá, do not come to campus.”</p><p>Her mom gasped like she was hurt. “You don’t want everyone to see your mom dropping off your favorite t-shirt? That wouldn’t help your mysterious artsy façade?”</p><p>“I was already a loser in high school, I don’t need a repeat at NYU.” She adjusted her camera strap hanging around her neck.</p><p>“Yeah, because losers have loving moms who’d drive almost two hours away to make sure they have what they need.” Victoria raised a judgmental eyebrow and got in the car.</p><p>Rio climbed in the passenger’s seat. “Well now I feel like a dick.”</p><p>Victoria shrugged and started the car. “Then don’t be a dick.”</p><p>She chuckled and watched out her window as her mom drove through town to get onto the highway.</p><p>Then Rio looked down at her camera, thumb grazing over the carved initials in the bottom corner. She could put distance between herself and the darkroom, the bleachers, and Agatha. But there’d be no distance far enough between Rio and the memories she had or the love she still felt. All she could do is hope that, with time, those memories and that feeling faded, that they dulled. That her secret fling with Westview’s girl-next-door was just a footnote in a much more interesting life than anyone she went to high school with could dream of.</p><p>When she looked out her window again, she was met with a road sign stating the obvious. One shaped like the state of New Jersey with a little star over the town-</p><p>‘You’re Now Leaving Westview, Come Back Soon!’</p><p>She would not.</p><p>She would not come back at all.</p><p>Not for Thanksgiving, not for Christmas, not to do her laundry on the weekends. Didn’t matter that Agatha was moving away for college too, the whole town was tainted. A blackhole right over Westview existed in Rio’s mind, and she would sooner rather die than get sucked back in.</p><p>But that’s not how life works, so-</p><p>Twenty years later, almost to the day, Rio came back, not of her own choosing, but for her mom. She remembers passing another road sign as she drove back, a rectangular one that probably hadn’t been updated since the seventies-</p><p>‘Welcome To Westview<br/>
Home: It’s Where You Make It!’</p><p>And to make matters worse, she was sucked right back in.</p><p>Back to Westview, back to high school, back to her girl-next-door.</p><p>And this time, it really was different.</p><p>Because this time, Rio could give Agatha the life she deserved, the one she now knew Agatha really wanted.</p><p>Because this time, the threats weren’t as scary.</p><p>Because this time, they had each other through it all.</p><p>Because this time, there was no doubt in Rio’s mind that she’d cross centuries and alternate realities, timelines and physical planes of existence if it meant getting to love Agatha.</p><p>Maybe they didn’t need a different lifetime, because they had this one.</p><p>She woke up naked in Agatha’s bed Saturday morning, drowning in her girlfriends hair. As she pushed it out of her face, the soft, warm, exposed body of her love roused, face still planted against Rio’s sternum.</p><p>They had spent the rest of last night fucking with intermittent breaks in between for water or the bathroom, or for Agatha to make boxed mac n’ cheese when Rio complained that she’d starve if she wasn’t fed expeditiously.</p><p>Last night didn’t feel like Rio was spending the night at her girlfriend’s place, it felt like they were just a couple spending the night together in their home, enjoying the domesticity.</p><p>“What time is it?” Agatha’s voice asked, laden with sleep.</p><p>Rio grumbled and looked over. “Just before ten.”</p><p>She shot up. “I haven’t slept this late since before Nicky.”</p><p>“So enjoy it.” Rio pulled her back down, sinking further into the very expensive mattress Agatha had. “Always sleep so well here.”</p><p>“Mhh.” Agatha mumbled, laying back down on Rio’s chest. “It’s tempurpedic.”</p><p>“It’s not the bed, baby.” She lazily smiled.</p><p>“Is it all the orgasms?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“It’s the pressure on my chest, missed it.” She softly admitted, not fully awake yet.</p><p>Agatha nuzzled in more. “I missed being the source.”</p><p>The simple intimacy of spending the morning cuddled up in the safety of their bed-</p><p>Agatha’s bed.</p><p>Sent Rio’s mind to last night, not the sex, but the promises, the declarations, the fantasies.</p><p>“Did you mean it?” She peeked her eyes open.</p><p>Agatha’s head didn’t move off her chest, she just looked up. And Rio didn’t need to elaborate, Agatha just knew. “Every word.”</p><p>“I don’t think I know a hitman.” She said in reference to Evanora’s demise in their fantasy.</p><p>“And much to my own chagrin, I don’t know a necromancer.” Her girlfriend responded, referring to Rio’s mom.</p><p>“But everything else?”</p><p>The house, the kids, marriage.</p><p>“I don’t see a reason why not.”</p><p>There was a reason, a problem that took form in the shape of a sixty-seven year old, gray-haired, shriveled up harpy. But Rio would rather not think about that right now, so she didn’t bring it up.</p><p>After not enough time in Rio’s opinion, Agatha got up, pulling Rio into the shower with her.</p><p>“Can I wash your hair?” Rio asked, voice reverberating in the massive walk-in shower.</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face, hot water steadily dripping off the slope of her nose. “Why?”</p><p>“Cause I want to, don’t make it weird.”</p><p>“Creepy fuck.” Agatha muttered but relented.</p><p>And even though she’d never admit it, Rio could tell Agatha enjoyed it. The scalp massage, the intimacy, the feeling of being cared for. After they got out and wrapped themselves in towels, Agatha opened her medicine cabinet and silently handed Rio a brand new toothbrush before picking up her own. She didn’t think twice, just stood next to Agatha in front of the sink and brushed her teeth, placing her toothbrush next to Agatha’s in the holder on the counter. One purple toothbrush and one green, like two people lived in this space, like a real couple. They exchanged soft kisses and sweet nothings before parting ways.</p><p>She left the other woman in the bathroom to do her very meticulous skincare routine that Rio absolutely gave her shit for, and dug through Agatha’s closet. Her jeans and shirt were still in the office, her bra was MIA, and her panties were useless because someone got too eager and ripped them clean off of Rio’s body last night.</p><p>They both got dressed, Agatha cooked breakfast, Rio did the dishes.</p><p>They checked-in on Nicky, making sure he was fairing well at Ralph’s.</p><p>They talked about stupid, meaningless things over coffee, like how Jen and Alice are redoing their kitchen. How the sconce in the hallway upstairs keeps flickering and Agatha needs to call a guy, how Rio could probably fix it and how they didn’t need to call a guy.</p><p>And it dawned on her-</p><p>A routine.</p><p>They had a morning routine.</p><p>Small in the grand scheme of things, but it wasn’t minimal to Rio.</p><p>Around noon, she proposed a plan for the day.</p><p>“How would you feel about doing a little shopping?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed. “Shopping?”</p><p>“Shopping.” She smirked.</p><p>Her girlfriend agreed, even though Rio refused to tell her where they were going, just handed Rio the keys to her car and let her drive.</p><p>And fuck, the thing handled like a dream, now she understood why rich people buy nice things. The house, the car, the shower, the bed, everything was so fucking nice and Rio didn’t find herself minding all the perks that came along with being in proximity to wealth.</p><p>When they arrived at the location in Eastview, Agatha sunk in her seat and covered her face in shame.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Yes, my love?” She killed the engine.</p><p>“This is a sex shop.”</p><p>“Nothing gets past you.”</p><p>“Why are we at a sex shop?”</p><p>“Shopping.” She shot up her eyebrows and grinned manically.</p><p>“I’m good.”</p><p>“You said you wanted to strap me.”</p><p>And for the love of everything holy, Rio had not stopped thinking about it since last week when Agatha said it.</p><p>“I’ll order one off Amazon, then!”</p><p>“I’m not letting a billionaire profit off my orgasm.”</p><p>“But these folks can?” Agatha pointed out the window at the shop.</p><p>“You really need to support your local sex shop, Agatha. Brick and mortar storefronts are dying.”</p><p>Her girlfriend started banging her skull against the headrest of the seat. “This isn’t my local sex shop, we’re in the next town over.”</p><p>Rio feigned starting the car again. “Did you want to go to the only one in Westview?”</p><p>She smacked Rio’s hand away from the ignition. “Can’t I just wear yours?”</p><p>“Baby, it’s like a lesbian rite of passage to pick out your first strap.”</p><p>“It’s a fake dick.” She deadpanned.</p><p>“No, it’s your fake dick.” Rio smiled. “And if you ever want to fuck me like that, you’re going in and picking out your own.”</p><p>“Why are we doing this today?” Agatha whined.</p><p>And maybe it was cruel to tease, but Rio just wanted Agatha out of the damn car. She leaned over the console and brushed her lips against the shell of her girlfriend's ear. “Gotta practice if you ever wanna get me pregnant.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, a blush settled over her face. “You’d want to carry?”</p><p>“That’s what you took from what I just said?!”</p><p>“I’m sorry! It just caught me off guard.”</p><p>“Wait, you’d wanna be pregnant again?”</p><p>“I mean, it was seventeen years ago, but I don’t remember it being that bad.”</p><p>“I just figured, after everything you told me last night, carrying another kid would be hard on you.”</p><p>Blue eyes softened. “Baby, it wasn’t because of the physical aspect, it was because of everything else. This time, I’d have you.”</p><p>Okay, well this had sidetracked her sexy plan. Now she wanted to get down on one knee in the parking lot of a sex shop and start their life together as soon as possible.</p><p>“If you want to go through another forty-two hour labor, I won’t stand in your way.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “As long as you’re there.”</p><p>As if she could keep Rio away.</p><p>“God, you’re going to break my fucking hand from gripping it in the delivery room, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I didn’t break Victoria’s hand.” Agatha supplied. “I did, however, make the other nurse cry.”</p><p>“Atta girl.”</p><p>“I want purple.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Agatha motioned towards the shop. “I want purple.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yes, my love.”</p>

<p>She wasn’t a stalker.</p><p>No, because stalkers were usually creepy, perverted men pursuing women that would never be interested in them.</p><p>So Agatha attending an NYU student showcase in New York in the summer of 2008 was not stalker behavior.</p><p>It was a public event after all, who knows who would even be there.</p><p>Agatha definitely didn’t.</p><p>She just came to appreciate art. She loved art, and missed art, and just wanted to know art was doing okay.</p><p>It had been three years since she had seen art.</p><p>She wouldn’t say or do anything, just keep her head down and find Rio-</p><p>Find the art and leave.</p><p>She’d see her-</p><p>It, see the fucking art, and go home.</p><p>She walked into the sprawling warehouse gallery in Brooklyn, picking up a program and winding her way through the sea of people scattered around. Crowds were good, it meant she could hide behind other people, it lowered the chances of being spotted.</p><p>God, she sounded like a fucking stalker, didn’t she?</p><p>Agatha turned a corner and was met with Rio’s exhibition.</p><p>She was still shooting on film because Agatha recognized the texture of the grain that comes from the development process.</p><p>She made herself as small as possible, crossing her arms and standing perfectly still, roaming her eyes over the wall adorning Rio’s work.</p><p>Black and white prints of veterans. Some in uniform, some with medals, some in civilian clothes. Agatha felt their pain in the photos, their sorrow, their melancholy. She looked at the little plaque stuck to the wall next to the instillation-</p><p>‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’<br/>
‘By: Rio Vidal’</p><p>Her fingers lightly brushed over the engraved name, when a voice came from behind her.</p><p>“Moving, isn’t it?” The accented voice spoke.</p><p>She startled, whipping around to see the voice’s owner.</p><p>A woman she’d never seen before, late-thirties, long black hair, charming smile, arctic blue eyes, stared at Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha softly agreed.</p><p>“Professor Hela Odinsdottir.” The woman introduced herself, reaching a hand out to shake Agatha’s. “Rio’s my student, as is everyone else in the showcase.”</p><p>She gave a polite smile and shook Hela’s hand.</p><p>Hela dropped her hand and continued, now looking at Rio’s work. “I thought it was too ambitious for an undergrad, but she did it all herself.”</p><p>Agatha looked back at the photographs.</p><p>“Rio found all the veterans, coordinated shooting with them, and worked tirelessly night after night. I was a bit scared for her sanity.” Hela chuckled.</p><p>“It paid off.” She said.</p><p>“It’s supposed to bring awareness to the government’s stance on openly queer people serving in the military, especially with this upcoming election.”</p><p>So Rio was doing those amazing things.</p><p>Everything that happened under those bleachers, the pain, the sacrifice, the bloodshed-</p><p>Seemed worth it.</p><p>Rio took the opportunity and was trying to make real change in the world, that’s more than Agatha could say.</p><p>“When’s the big day?” Hela smiled.</p><p>“Mmh?”</p><p>She pointed to the engagement ring that sat on her left ring finger. “It’s quite the rock.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the ring. Felt more like a noose slowly choking her bit by bit, like death by a thousand cuts.</p><p>She never would’ve picked it for herself, probably because her mother chose it and told Ralph when to propose.</p><p>She graduated from Princeton a year early, hoping to have a year of freedom in between graduation and settling down.</p><p>Then Ralph proposed at her mother’s annual Christmas party in front of everyone, and she got the message-</p><p>Agatha didn’t get freedom.</p><p>She looked back up. “Thanks.”</p><p>“So…?” Hela prompted. “When’s the day?”</p><p>She blinked back the tears threatening to spill and put on her perfectly practiced smile. “Uh, tomorrow.”</p><p>The professor’s face contorted into shock. “And you’re spending your last night of singledom here?”</p><p>“Guess I’m just a big patron of the arts.”</p><p>“I can grab the artist, if you want. The university is always looking for donations from,” Hela looked back down at the massive diamond on Agatha’s finger. “Well-endowed patrons. Maybe you two could talk and you could see why funding is so vital for these students.”</p><p>She bought the damn camera the photos were taken on, she was aware of the vitality of money when it came to art.</p><p>“Sounds great.” Agatha lied through her teeth.</p><p>“Give me a moment.” Hela said, walking away to find Rio.</p><p>Agatha could not be here when they returned, but her body didn’t want to move, didn’t want to put the distance between her and Rio again.</p><p>She tracked Hela as she made her way through the crowd, a few people shuffled and Agatha was able to catch a glimpse-</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Her first love.</p><p>Her only love.</p><p>Her hair was different, no more blonde highlights, it was its natural color.</p><p>Her makeup was lighter, devoid of a smoked out lash line.</p><p>And no nose piercing.</p><p>She looked grown up, standing in a simple green dress.</p><p>And she looked happy, laughing with a group of other students, glass of champagne in hand.</p><p>Agatha saw Hela approach and place her hand on the small of Rio’s back, smirking and whispering something in Rio’s ear.</p><p>Her ex blushed for a moment and looked at the professor like she hung the moon and the stars-</p><p>Like…</p><p>Like she was in love.</p><p>Fuck, the tears were coming back with a vengeance, burning her eyes as they clawed their way out.</p><p>More bodies shuffled, and the glimpse was gone.</p><p>Agatha took it as her chance to escape, ducking out and speed walking to the exit. She didn’t stop until she was out, down a few blocks, and away from her ex and her ex’s girlfriend slash professor.</p><p>A sob was trying to fight its way out of her throat but she wouldn’t let it. She didn’t get to break down over this. It was her fault they were even in this mess in the first place. Because Agatha was always too fucking greedy, too fucking selfish, too fucking broken. So, no, she didn’t get to wallow and feel bad for herself.</p><p>Rio got everything Agatha had ever wanted for her-</p><p>The fulfilling college experience.</p><p>The opportunity to show the world her talent.</p><p>A seemingly available woman.</p><p>Agatha just wanted to know Rio was happy.</p><p>And she was. She was beyond happy, she was thriving.</p><p>So why the fuck did Agatha feel so fucking empty right now? So fucking numb? It didn’t matter in the long run. It didn’t matter that her heart was ripped out of her own chest in a gallery in Brooklyn, it didn’t matter that Agatha was trapped in Westview for the rest of her life, none of it mattered, tomorrow she’d be some man’s wife.</p><p>The next morning, she sat in a makeup chair as a woman her mother hired painted her face.</p><p>“You look puffy.” Her mother stated, hovering over her daughter in the bridal suite.</p><p>Yeah, it’s ‘cause she cried herself to sleep the night prior, but she couldn’t say that. Not with her bridesmaids; Alice, Jen, and Wanda, in the room.</p><p>“I think she looks beautiful.” Jen replied, side-eyeing Evanora.</p><p>“Thanks, Jen.” Agatha spoke, only half-listening as her friends continued on talking.</p><p>An hour or two later, Agatha stood in front of a full length mirror as Wanda helped to do up the back of her dress. Her ugly, frilly, white, fucking dress that she wanted to light on fucking fire. The longer she was in it, the more nauseous she became, her body rejecting everything happening today.</p><p>“Wanda, please, just close the damn thing.”</p><p>The redhead yanked the fabric together again. “Did you alter this again? It was perfect at your last fitting.”</p><p>“My mother took in another quarter of an inch.” Not that she had checked that with Agatha, just did it and told her afterwards. A silent demand for her to be smaller and smaller, just wither away.</p><p>Wanda grunted and jostled Agatha’s body again, cinching her with satin of the bodice.</p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha choked out.</p><p>Her body caved ever so slightly, like the constricting fabric around her torso, mixed with the regret pooling in her stomach finally converged.</p><p>“Wanda, I can’t- I-”</p><p>She pulled away, dress half done, and sprinted for the bathroom off of the bridal suite. She pushed open the door and-</p><p>Jen, on the sink, legs wrapped around Alice who was standing in front of her. Oh god, Jen’s head was thrown back in pleasure and Agatha could not see Alice’s other hand. Probably covered by the chiffon skirt of their lilac bridesmaid dresses.</p><p>That was a new development.</p><p>But she couldn’t say anything, not with the bile making its appearance in the back of her throat, she ran past them and fell to her knees in front of the toilet, keeling over.</p><p>“Oh my god!” Jen yelled, climbing off the sink and rushing to hold Agatha’s hair back.</p><p>She heard Wanda run in after her.</p><p>“Agatha?” Alice tried to comfort.</p><p>Her body wretched out the scarce contents of her stomach before it slumped.</p><p>“What happened?” Wanda shouted.</p><p>She lifted her head and groaned at their worrying, she felt Jen combing her hair back in an attempt to soothe her.</p><p>“Bitch, are you pregnant?!” Jen gasped.</p><p>Agatha turned her gaze to look at her. “Bitch, are you gay?!” She sniped.</p><p>“What?” Wanda scrunched her face.</p><p>She pointed to Jen and Alice. “These two-” And then made a scissoring motion with her hands.</p><p>Wanda and Agatha just stared at the pair for explanation.</p><p>“Fine, yes! We started seeing each other this summer!” Alice huffed.</p><p>“Babe!” Jen scolded.</p><p>“That’s great.” Wanda smiled. “You know, Vis and I have talked about not getting married until everyone can.”</p><p>“I checked with all the gay people, Wanda.” Agatha deadpanned. “They said they don’t care.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes and started helping her up off the floor. “Answer my question, are you pregnant?”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Alice whispered. “We drank so much vodka at your bachelorette last weekend.”</p><p>Agatha righted herself. “No, I’m not pregnant.”</p><p>“It’s okay if you are, it’d explain why you’re marrying that jackass at twenty-one.” Jen muttered.</p><p>She threw her arms up. ”I can’t be pregnant, Ralph and I haven't even fucked!”</p><p>And Agatha would avoid doing so until the last possible second.</p><p>“You and Ralph have been together off and on for four years and you’ve never had sex?” Wanda questioned.</p><p>“You’re a virgin?” Alice asked, eyebrows shot up.</p><p>No, not by a long shot.</p><p>“Can someone please just help me with my dress so I can get this day over with?!” She snapped.</p><p>All three of them looked at her with wide eyes. As if they all understood that Agatha didn’t just heave her guts up for no reason, as if they could sense her reluctance to walk down that aisle.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this if you don't want to, Agatha.” Wanda softly murmured.</p><p>“We can leave right now.” Jen started. “Disappear and never look back.”</p><p>“I hear Fiji is nice this time of year.” Alice smirked.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “My mother would kill me, and everyone is waiting. This circus cost a small fortune, and the whole town would hear about it.”</p><p>Plus who knows if Evanora could magically get Rio expelled, she sure as hell could still get Victoria fired.</p><p>“I didn’t hear you say you love him.” Wanda quietly observed.</p><p>The concern from her friends was sweet, it really was, but it wouldn’t change her circumstance.</p><p>“Dress. Now.” Agatha motioned to the back of the garment and waited. ”Alice, wash your hands first.”</p><p>They all grumbled but worked together to squeeze Agatha in, doing the last of the buttons. Everyone funneled out of the bathroom afterwards, leaving her alone. She looked at herself in the mirror, internally scolding herself. She has one job, and she wasn’t doing it right.</p><p>Just walk down the damn aisle, and smile. Smile and nod, and pretend like a lobotomy doesn’t sound like a dream in comparison to this day.</p><p>Agatha looked at herself one last time in the mirror.</p><p>She didn’t look like her.</p><p>She looked like who mother wanted her to be.</p><p>She looked like a shell of her former self.</p><p>Her happy self.</p><p>Agatha saw that same image in the mirror everyday of her life for another seventeen years after her wedding. Sometimes she’d catch a peek of that eighteen year old girl she once knew so well, but it was few and far between.</p><p>As she looked at herself now in the present day, she recognized the reflection. Like the color had come back in her face, like smile lines had actually started forming again, like she was her old self. The one that was blind to her mother’s cruelty, and hopelessly and desperately in love.</p><p>“Mi amor!” Rio shouted from the other side of the bathroom door. “If you keep me waiting, I’m going to start without you!”</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>After shopping, they swung by Rio’s house so she could pick up a few things, throwing an overnight bag into the backseat. When they got back, they spent the afternoon doing nothing. Rio had her laptop and graded assignments with her legs resting over Agatha’s lap. She opened her book from where she had left off, grumbling and reaching for her glasses. She had made it through half a chapter before she felt Rio shift next to her, saying something about the glasses and closing her laptop and pulling Agatha upstairs.</p><p>After the first round, which Rio made Agatha keep the glasses on for, her girlfriend suggested they break out their newest purchase. And Agatha did not need any convincing past that, but it made her feel a little ridiculous. It was a silicone appendage literally strapped to her body, so she slipped into the bathroom to put it on. It was easy enough to figure out.</p><p>She glanced over her body in the mirror, trying not to cackle at the purple cock that was now jutting out between her legs.</p><p>“Don’t laugh.” Agatha shouted back and creaked open the door.</p><p>Rio was reclined on the bed, naked and flushed from Agatha eating her out like her pussy was her last meal.</p><p>Dark eyes flashed even darker as they took in Agatha’s appearance.</p><p>“Who’s laughing?” Rio husked, sitting up and reaching out.</p><p>And suddenly, she felt a lot more confident, a lot more desired. Rio’s eyes were hungry, as if Agatha was her salvation.</p><p>She walked forward into Rio’s grip, letting herself be pulled on top of the other woman. Matching Rio’s fervor, kissing her like it was as natural as breathing, because to Agatha, it was.</p><p>She felt Rio writhe beneath her, trying to create some friction with the strap. Agatha pulled away with a low chuckle.</p><p>“Gotta,” She mumbled between Rio assaulting her lips, “Grab the lube.”</p><p>“Don’t need it.” Rio immediately replied.</p><p>“I don’t wanna hurt you.”</p><p>She grabbed Agatha’s hand and placed it over her sex, still dripping with her arousal and Agatha’s spit. “You won’t.” She messily kissed her again. “But you can hurt me a little.”</p><p>And something in Agatha’s brain broke, a switch flipped, the soft and mushy clouds parted. Whatever it was-</p><p>All she knew now, is that she had to ruin this woman.</p><p>“You’re going to regret saying that.” Agatha growled, lining the tip of the cock with Rio’s entrance.</p><p>“Promise?” She smirked.</p><p>She needed to fuck that smug look off her face.</p><p>She pushed her hips forward slowly, hers wasn’t as big as Rio’s, but it wasn’t fucking small. Honestly, she had tried to pick a bigger one while they were at the shop, but her girlfriend scolded her. Stating that she wasn’t going to let Agatha ‘impale’ her, to which Agatha grinned and rolled her eyes.</p><p>She sank in apprehensively, flickering her gaze between Rio’s face, analyzing it for hints of discomfort. And the apex of Rio’s thighs, watching in awe as the purple of the shaft slowly disappeared.</p><p>“Fuck-” Rio choked.</p><p>She furrowed her brows in worry. “Do I need to pull out?” And started moving her hips further away.</p><p>Rio’s hand flew to her hip, gripping and freezing her movement. “Don’t, don’t,” She breathed. “So deep.”</p><p>Music to her fucking ears.</p><p>Agatha experimentally rolled her hips and Rio’s eye’s screwed shut as she moaned lewdly.</p><p>Oh, this was dangerous, too dangerous.</p><p>Because Agatha needed to hear that again, over and over.</p><p>She pulled back, almost until she was completely out, looking down for a moment to appreciate the shiny wetness now coating the strap, before thrusting back in, ripping out that same fucking moan from the back of Rio’s throat.</p><p>If Agatha’s hubris was bad before, it was multiplying tenfold now. The feeling of Rio tight and clenching around her, the sounds, the power. All of it was too intoxicating.</p><p>She repeated the action, pulling back and snapping forward again, settling into a punishing rhythm. “Look at you, I knew you’d be so pretty like this.”</p><p>Rio’s nails were biting into her back again, the scratches from last night being re-torn. It burned, but in a way that only spurred her on further.</p><p>Agatha slung one of Rio’s legs over her shoulder, needing to get deeper. The new angle resulted in Rio releasing a near pornographic whine. “Fuck!”</p><p>She took it as encouragement, slamming into the other woman faster, harder. One hand on Rio’s tanned thigh, the other groping her breast.</p><p>“Feel good, baby?” Agatha taunted through her strokes.</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>Agatha’s hand left her thigh, and gave a harsh smack to Rio’s ass, palming the hot flesh. “Use your words.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio’s words came out broken. “Feels-”</p><p>Her other hand snaked up Rio’s chest, gripping her throat and cutting off the words Agatha had just demanded.</p><p>Brown eyes opened slightly, grinning wickedly as her hand covered Agatha’s, urging her to clutch tighter, choke her harder.</p><p>She felt the blood working overtime to keep pumping through the veins on her love’s neck, and it was-</p><p>Delicious.</p><p>She was sure if she had anything pressing against her right now, she’d come on the spot. She shouldn’t like this as much as she did, enjoy Rio’s struggle the way she was.</p><p>Any hesitations she had, melted away, now fucking Rio with reckless abandon. The headboard hitting the wall in time with Agatha’s thrusts.</p><p>Pounding with as much force as she could muster, she locked eyes with Rio, making sure she heard every word. “Such a whore.”</p><p>Her back arched. “For you,” Rio rasped through the hold on her airway. “Only you.”</p><p>“All for me.” Agatha echoed, and she was sure the hand still on her back was ripping the skin clean open, but she didn’t care, not as she felt Rio’s cunt flutter around her length.</p><p>She felt something primal in the dark recesses of her mind and all she could do was listen to it as it told her to bury herself inside Rio again and again. Her hips were burning and her chest was heaving but it was a small price to pay for the ecstasy that was washing over her.</p><p>The bedframe groaned at the movements, she’d have to remember to get it reinforced, not that she knew how to do that or who to call but she was pretty sure she’d break this bed trying to break Rio.</p><p>“You going to come for me, love?”</p><p>She nodded and Agatha cruelly chucked, quickly spanking her yet again, making absolutely certain that it would sting.</p><p>“Try again.” She scolded.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was erratic and her tits bounced from Agatha’s efforts.</p><p>“Wanna come for you.” Rio whimpered.</p><p>She looked down at the strap, her girlfriend leaking around it. She didn’t want it to end, she could stay in this moment forever and die with a smile on her face.</p><p>“You can wait.” She grinned, waiting for what she wanted to hear.</p><p>“Please.” Rio moaned. “Please, let me. Please, just wanna-” She sounded brainless, on another planet. “Please, please-”</p><p>Agatha kept pumping through her pleas, maybe only another minute passing by, the tension in Rio’s body was too mesmerizing. She could see the way Rio was fighting against the orgasm, thighs shaking, back arched and taut, mouth slack jawed and gasping for breath.</p><p>“Come on my cock.” She demanded.</p><p>Those same dark eyes rolled back in her skull as her body convulsed, screaming and snapping her neck back and out of Agatha’s grasp. She kept fucking her through it, slowing her pace to help Rio wring out as much pleasure as possible. Placing soft kisses along the column of the throat she had just throttled.</p><p>When Rio came to, she lazily grinned. “I regret nothing.”</p><p>Agatha smiled back and placed a kiss on her swollen lips. “I need to do that again.”</p><p>Suddenly she understood why men couldn’t keep it their pants, if she had a dick, a real one, she’d spend her days buried inside Rio. She’d fuck her until she really was pregnant, until she couldn’t move. Maybe it was for the better, for her sanity and for Rio’s safety.</p><p>Her girlfriend huffed out a laugh and swiftly rolled them over without disconnecting from the strap, grinding her hips down immediately. “Then do it.”</p><p>Agatha sat up, bucking up her hips and reaching around to grab at Rio’s ass, dragging her nails and leaving angry red lines in her wake. She heard the hiss escape through Rio’s teeth.</p><p>“Fuck, I love you.”</p>

<p>They had a problem.</p><p>Well, a problem besides Evanora.</p><p>Including Evanora they actually had three problems.</p><p>Or at least Rio did.</p><p>Number One: Evanora. Nat assured Rio that she was working around the clock to find something, and judging by the statements on Agatha’s credit card, she was going above and beyond. There was nothing either of them could do to speed up the process, but damn if that other shoe wasn’t hanging over Rio’s head with a fucking vengeance just waiting to drop.</p><p>Number Two: Rio had created a monster with Agatha and that strap-on. Sunday had been spent with her girlfriend attached to the apex of her thighs, the woman would not leave Rio alone. Not that she wanted her to, but she might need to take back what she said about Agatha and her stamina. Because as it turns out, she had plenty, maybe too much. Agatha was fucking insatiable with the thing, Rio was truly scared she had unleashed some sort of demonic spirit within her girlfriend.</p><p>Number Three: She had broken her promise to Nicky, well not so much a promise and more of a gentleman’s agreement. Rio had agreed to no…misuse of common areas in the home out of respect for Nicky. Yeah, she folded on that as soon as Agatha suggested that Rio would look good bent over the kitchen island, or the couch, or up against the bookcase in the sunroom that had about a thousand windows. To be fair though, it wasn’t completely her fault. They had to get creative after Agatha had quite literally fucked her into the mattress so hard that one of the bedframe’s support beams snapped and the corner of the headboard indented a tiny crack into the wall. And no, it did not help tamp down Agatha’s ego.</p><p>But Rio could live with two out of three of those problems.</p><p>She left around Sunday afternoon, not wanting to possibly explain to Ralph why she and her car were still there. She decided to leave her overnight bag in Agatha’s closet, easier than hauling the thing back and forth. When her girlfriend had noticed, she suggested Rio just take a drawer of the dresser and make it her own.</p><p>The toothbrush, the strap, the dresser drawer-</p><p>Little reminders of Rio were infiltrating the house, and Agatha was letting her, encouraging her to leave those items there.</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, Rio didn't try to push down the warm and fuzzy feeling coursing through her. She just smiled and agreed, picking a drawer and throwing her clothes in.</p><p>Seventeen days ago, Rio was barely agreeing to let Agatha woo her, and now, she couldn’t imagine going back. Back to a time without her, without Nicky, without the wide-open future they had sprawling before them.</p><p>Monday morning, Rio walked into her classroom with a dopey smile that her students did notice, and did not let her live down. Claiming it was off putting seeing her smile instead of scowl.</p><p>“What could be making Miss Vidal so happy?” Billy sarcastically asked before looking at Nicky sitting next to him. “And ideas?”</p><p>Nicky rolled his eyes. “I’ll punch you again. Hard.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio shouted to the class. “If anyone comments on my facial expressions again, I’ll fail you all. Don’t test me, I have unchecked power and nothing to lose.” She tried to scowl through it, but her face wouldn’t let her, melting back into a smile.</p><p>“Your threats are less scary when you look like that.” Billy said.</p><p>“Everyone turn in your candid portraits for class critique, except Billy, because now I’m failing him.” She deadpanned and watched as the class all shuffled up one by one, handing in their prints.</p><p>The rest of the period was spent going through each photograph, and to her surprise, the results were actually okay. Good, even. She could see her students progress, hear their understanding as they gave feedback on each other's work. Like, she was doing something impactful here, by teaching. She knew that was literally her job, but it was different actually seeing them participate and know what they were talking about. These stupid idiots were improving because of her. She didn’t expect it, but this job and these kids were making her feel something, something like pride.</p><p>When the fuck did that happen?</p><p>As the bell rang, the kids took their leave as Rio sat down at her desk and waited for the passing period to go by before her next class. She was collecting all the prints into a folder when she asked Nicky to stay behind.</p><p>“How was your dad’s?” She asked, not that it concerned Rio. Technically she wasn’t a co-parent, but she still wanted to know he was okay.</p><p>“Exactly how’d you think it was.” He shrugged. “Complained about my mom, about you,” He then grinned. “When were you going to tell me you decked my dad?”</p><p>“I don’t think the boss would’ve appreciated that.” She chuckled, referring to Agatha.</p><p>“Eh, he probably deserved it.”</p><p>“Oh, he definitely deserved it.”</p><p>“I’ll take your word for it.” He adjusted the strap of his backpack. “I gotta go or I’m gonna be late, and the boss really wouldn’t like that.”</p><p>“What are you waiting for then, man? Go! I don’t wanna get yelled at.” She waved him out.</p><p>“Something tells me she’d go easier on you.” He called out as he left.</p><p>And that fucking dopey smile graced her face again, like it belonged there, like it couldn’t fade.</p><p>The rest of the day went by in a blur, everything just felt right. It was the first time in twenty years where it seemed like everything in her life just kind of clicked into place. She was good at her job and was finding herself liking it, her and Agatha were on the same page, Ralph was moving away and therefore couldn’t cause Nicky or Agatha anymore strife.</p><p>She was happy.</p><p>If her mom were here right now, Rio knew she’d be proud of her.</p><p>She was halfway through grading after school when Lilia knocked on the doorframe, getting her attention.</p><p>“I’m bailing.” Lilia said.</p><p>“It’s only four.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, my show is on tonight and I have a bottle of wine chilling at home that’s calling my name.”</p><p>“You need to retire.” Rio quipped.</p><p>“Two more years and I’m free, baby!” She beamed and started leaving. “Also Sharon asked to see you, told me to send you to her office.”</p><p>“‘Bout what?” Rio entered another score into the digital gradebook.</p><p>“Who knows, maybe one of your students ratted you out for that sinful music you blast.” She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“How the fuck do you know that?” Rio gaped.</p><p>“We share a wall…” Lilia started walking down the hall. “And I love Denial Is A River!” Her voice echoed off the walls as her footsteps receded.</p><p>She finished up the grades before walking down to the first floor, through the front office and knocking on Sharon’s door. It was probably something benign, like a student letting it slip about the music or the cussing, nothing that wouldn’t result in a more than a meaningless slap on the wrist. But she was still nervous, despite her anarchist attitude as a teen, Rio had never been called to the principal's office before. She never did anything noteworthy enough to get in trouble, well she never got caught doing anything noteworthy.</p><p>“Come in!” Sharon’s perky voice called through the door.</p><p>God help her.</p><p>“You wanted to see me?” Rio asked as she walked in.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, yes, please take a seat.” She smiled as she sat behind her desk.</p><p>She sat in the chair opposite the desk and waited.</p><p>“How’s it going?” Sharon asked.</p><p>“Fine..?” Because what else was she supposed to say?</p><p>Sharon stiffened in her chair. “I called you in here because I’m afraid we have a problem.”</p><p>Add it to the fucking pile.</p><p>“A problem?” Rio acted dumb. Who fucking snitched on her? She’d interrogate all of them tomorrow.</p><p>“Some concerns have come to my attention, and it's with a heavy heart that I’m going to have to let you go.”</p><p>What. The. Fuck?</p><p>“Let me go?” She lurched forward in her chair out of confusion, and maybe some anger.</p><p>“Your contract will be terminated effective immediately.” Sharon smiled, but it wasn’t real.</p><p>Also who the fuck smiles when they fire someone?</p><p>“Is this about the music? I promise you those kids are already listening to it.”</p><p>“Music?”</p><p>“Is it the swearing? Because I’ve seen what’s written on the stalls in the bathroom, I’m a fucking quaker compared to some of these delinquents!”</p><p>“We don’t look fondly on foul language, but no.”</p><p>Rio just stared.</p><p>Sharon stared back.</p><p>“So why are you fucking firing me?!” She stood.</p><p>“I’m not at liberty to say, but I have the full backing of the administration on this.”</p><p>“You can’t fire me for no reason, I’m pretty sure that’s illegal.” Her voice was getting louder now, but she wasn’t getting a straight answer.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, please…” Sharon grumbled.</p><p>“What about my classes? We’re almost three months into the year, I can’t just abandon them!”</p><p>“We’ll get subs.”</p><p>“They don’t know how film photography works!” She threw her hands up. “And that’s going to cost the school more in the long run.”</p><p>Getting a substitute everyday until June? It made no fiscal sense.</p><p>“We’re cutting black and white photography, your other classes will either be absorbed by Mrs.Calderu or covered by a substitute.”</p><p>“You’re cutting-” She scoffed. “What about my kids? They’re just starting to get the hang of it, they’re getting something out of it- I’m getting something out of it!”</p><p>What about Nicky? He’ll be crushed.</p><p>“That’s none of your concern anymore, Miss Vidal. They’re not your kids.”</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>“Can you just tell me why?” Rio ground out through her teeth, she was seriously fighting the urge to bitch-slap this woman.</p><p>“Above my head.” Sharon spoke.</p><p>“Above your-?” Her eyes widened.</p><p>Her stomach dropped.<br/>
</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>Rio let out a humorless laugh in her realization.</p><p>“What’s she have on you?” She snarked.</p><p>“Sorry?” Sharon feigned ignorance.</p><p>“Spare me the fucking act. Evanora Harkness. What does she have on you?”</p><p>The woman let out a tired sigh. “Mrs. Harkness donates a lot to this school-”</p><p>“SO YOU’RE LETTING HER BRIBE YOU?” Rio screamed, the rage shooting out of her.</p><p>“Miss Vidal!” Sharon scolded. “Keep your voice down.”</p><p>“You’re letting the students suffer all so, what, the football field gets a new scoreboard?!”</p><p>“Excuse me, do you know how little public schools receive in federal and state funding?” Sharon stood now too. “I couldn’t keep half of my teachers employed without her donations! I can’t take away pensions to keep one teacher!”</p><p>“Agatha could match her money easily, you don’t have to bend to Evanora’s every whim.”</p><p>Everyone bent to Evanora, fell at her feet, and Rio would be damned if she was next.</p><p>“I’d rather not rely on Agatha, she’s a bit…difficult.” Sharon said, obviously still holding a grudge.</p><p>“Oh, grow up. It was twenty years ago!”</p><p>“She gave me a heart attack!”</p><p>“It was an angina flare up, you were fine!” Rio defended. “And did you ever stop to think why she was ‘difficult’?”</p><p>“Some people are just born like that.” Sharon brushed off.</p><p>“No, they’re not! Kicked dogs usually bite!”</p><p>“Are you insinuating that I called her a bitch? Because I didn’t, I only thought it.” She hastily explained.</p><p>“It’s because of what was happening at home, and you, a mandated reporter entrusted with protecting these kids, didn’t even fucking notice! And now, you’re taking money from her abuser!”</p><p>Sharon slumped back down into her chair. “There’s no evidence of that, Agatha never said anything, and Evanora is a pillar of this community. I’m sorry Miss Vidal, I really am. I know how much your students loved you, but I have to think about what’s best for everyone.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, the reality washing over her. “Can I at least have tomorrow to say goodbye to my kids?”</p><p>“No, I’ve been told to make sure you leave campus and don’t return.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Said she doesn’t want you around her grandson.” Sharon almost whispered from the guilt.</p><p>God, that felt like a gut-punch.</p><p>Rio quickly nodded, there was no more she could say or do. “I’ll pack up my desk.”</p><p>“Security already did it for you, your stuff is at the front desk.”</p><p>“Wow, this was really premeditated…” She said in shock.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Miss Vidal. I wish you well in your next endeavor.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio deadpanned and flipped her off, storming out of the office and pulling out her phone to call Agatha.</p><p>The phone trilled, but no answer.</p><p>Wrong fucking day to forget her phone at home.</p><p>Fine, Rio would go to Agatha’s and create a game plan there. She could hang out with Nicky until Agatha got home from work, maybe he had the number of her work cell and Rio could fucking warn her.</p><p>She collected the box of her things from the office in shame and started for the front doors.</p><p>Her mind raced as she walked out to her car. Evanora knew, she fucking knew. How did she know? How’d she move so quick? When was she showing up? Would she even look Rio in the eye as she took a wreckingball to her fucking life? What was she going to tell Nicky? How would she explain something like this to a kid? She needed Agatha, she needed to see her and know everything was going to be okay. And what about Rio’s house? Fuck, she couldn’t fucking lose it. Victoria would roll over in her grave-</p><p>Rio was snapped out of her reverie as her phone buzzed. She dropped the box of her shit and contorted her body as fast as possible to answer. When she looked at the caller ID, she groaned. It wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>“Alice?” Rio answered.</p><p>“Rio, you need to come home right now.” Alice said over the line.</p><p>“Let me guess, bright orange eviction notice on the door?” She picked up the box and flung it into the back of her car.</p><p>Alice’s voice was shaking. “Not exactly.” And Rio could hear a siren suddenly blast in the background.</p><p>“Alice, what the fuck is going on?” She climbed in her car and started it, backing up and peeling out of the lot.</p><p>“I called the fire department as soon as I saw flames.” Alice tried to comfort.</p><p>Flames?</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, she hung up and floored it the entire way home. Her normal commute usually took about fifteen minutes, she got home in just under ten.</p><p>The car was barely in park as she got out, mouth wide open in horror. The tears pooling in her eyes reflected the flames burning her childhood home.</p><p>The house her mother had worked for, saved and scraped for-</p><p>Burnt to a motherfucking crisp.</p><p>This wasn’t an eviction, it was a scorched-earth policy, a fucking call card, a threat delivered on.</p><p>She felt someone next to her, presumably Alice, but she couldn’t pull her eyes away to confirm. Her knees buckled as a sob tore out of her throat, she hit the concrete of the sidewalk and hunched, the smoke burning her eyes more than the tears.</p><p>Alice crouched beside, placing an arm around her. “Rio…”</p><p>“Everything-” The tacky floral couches, the god-awful vinyl countertops, the beige carpeting. “It’s gone.” She croaked.</p><p>Her mom’s room wasn’t even cleared out yet, she hadn’t gone through it, she hadn’t been ready to face it all, and now she’d never get the chance.</p><p>The growth markings etched into the kitchen door frame.</p><p>Agatha’s crown from senior ball.</p><p>Her mom’s books and pans and everything fucking else.</p><p>Her whole life was in that house.</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Natasha's voice rang out in her ears.</p><p>She looked over and the woman was crossing the street from where she had parked, manila folder in hand. “Did Evanora do this?” She asked, leaning down.</p><p>“I doubt that it’s traceable, but…” Rio said, fighting to speak rather than wail.</p><p>“Add it to the list of her crimes then.” Nat held up the envelope.</p><p>Rio shot off the ground and grabbed the folder, prying it open. She ran her eyes over the papers, view obstructed by the tears pouring out. Nat may have waited ‘till the eleventh hour, but fuck did she deliver.</p><p>“Are you the homeowner?” A firefighter asked.</p><p>She looked up from the papers. “Y-yeah.”</p><p>“It’s a class B fire.” He explained. “Those start from flammable liquids like gasoline, alcohol, kerosene…” He listed.</p><p>“I get it!” She barked.</p><p>“Right now, that’s all we know, but these types of fires are hard to put out because they can easily reignite.”</p><p>“Do you know what caused it?” Alice asked.</p><p>“There’s no indication anything was wrong with the oven, so our best guess is arson.”</p><p>Rio almost laughed. “Fucking duh.”</p><p>“We’ll have the cops come once we’re sure it’s out.” He said and left.</p><p>“That’s good!” Alice half-heartedly smiled. “You can tell the police everything and they’ll arrest Evanora.”</p><p>Rio looked back down at the folder Nat had handed her. “Are you sure everything in here is real?”</p><p>Nat nodded. “Agatha’s credit card never declined, turns out, people talk when you sweeten the deal.”</p><p>She looked back at Alice. “They’ll never convict a rich white lady who’s a ‘pillar of the community’.”</p><p>The roof of her home caved it in, engulfed by the fire.</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>“I tried calling Agatha, I think she forgot her phone today because I haven’t been able to reach her.” Alice said, trying to distract Rio from her life literally going up in smoke.</p><p>“I-” Rio began but was interrupted by her phone buzzing in her back pocket. She shoved the folder into Nat’s chest, the other woman got the memo and held it.</p><p>And finally, fucking finally, Agatha’s caller ID showed up on her screen.</p><p>“Bitch got the drop on us.” She greeted.</p><p>“Rio…” Not Agatha said.</p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p>“I didn’t- I didn’t know who else to call.” His voice trembled. She never heard it tremble, the boy was almost six feet tall and he sounded like a little kid right now.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” She felt it in her gut that something bad, something even worse was happening.</p><p>“I don’t, I don’t know. My Nana showed up and-” Nicky paused.</p><p>Rio’s whole body tensed.</p><p>“Whatever happened, I’m sure it’s okay.” Her attention focused down to just Nicky in this moment, the roaring fire falling to the background.</p><p>“They went into my mom’s office and I think I heard my mom scream.”</p><p>“What’d she say?”</p><p>He let out a breath. “It wasn’t words.”</p><p>Shit. Agatha was trapped in a room with a very angry and probably violent Evanora.</p><p>“Where are you right now?” Rio softly questioned, she didn’t want him to panic even though she was.</p><p>“I’m sitting on the staircase, I feel like I should go in and help her-”</p><p>“No, Nicky, do not go in there.” She firmly stated. Nicky was almost an adult, but no kid should have to see that. And she knew Agatha wouldn’t want him there. “I’m coming over, I’ll be there in two minutes, just hang on for me, okay?”</p><p>She took the folder from Nat and sprinted to her car, standing and watching her house burn was not going to help anything, especially not Agatha.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Alice called after her.</p><p>She didn’t respond, her body overridden with adrenaline. She didn’t know what the fuck she was walking into, she just knew Agatha and Nicky needed her. That’s all her brain could  compute as she drove through the quiet suburbs of Westview.-</p><p>Agatha and Nicky needed her.</p><p>Agatha and Nicky needed her.</p><p>Agatha and Nicky needed her.</p><p>When she arrived at Agatha’s she saw another luxury car parked in the driveway, presumably Evanora’s. Rio ran as fast as her legs would carry her, storming into the house and seeing Nicky on the staircase, head in his hands, probably scared and wracked with guilt.</p><p>“Hey Nicky,” She softly spoke, placing a hand on his shoulder to prompt him to look up.</p><p>“I should’ve helped her.” He said, looking back at her with too much anguish for how young he was.</p><p>“You did nothing wrong.” Rio affirmed.</p><p>“Do you think she hurt my mom?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to answer when Evanora’s voice boomed through the house.</p><p>“YOU SHOULD FEEL LUCKY I DIDN’T BURN IT DOWN WITH HER INSIDE.”</p><p>He whipped his head at the source of the sound.</p><p>“Hey, hey, Nicky,” She pulled out her keys. “Take my car, go to your aunt Wanda’s, tell her your grandmother is here and that I sent you.”</p><p>“I don’t think I should leave her.”</p><p>“Your mom wouldn’t want you to see this, so I need you to do this for me, okay?”</p><p>He seemed to understand and stood up, taking Rio’s keys. “You’ll make sure she’s okay?”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>Then Nicky hugged her, but not like before, he hugged her like she was a source of comfort for him. And she hugged him back, really hugged him back, hoping to convey that he could trust her, that she could be a source of comfort.</p><p>“Thanks, Rio.”</p><p>“I’ll call you as soon as possible.” She pulled away. “Go.”</p><p>Nicky left, closing the door behind him. Rio looked down at the folder in her shaky hands.</p><p>She would not bend to this woman.</p><p>For her mom.</p><p>For Agatha.</p><p>For herself.</p><p>She raised her head, rolled back her shoulders, steadied her jaw, and took off down the hall.</p><p>The other shoe had fucking dropped.</p>

<p>Who the fuck does she even call about this?</p><p>After Rio had left on Sunday, Agatha was surveying the damage of her very expensive, very brittle Pottery Barn bed frame.</p><p>Real mahogany her ass.</p><p>She had maybe an hour before Ralph dropped off Nicky, and it left her sprinting through the house to cover the evidence of the weekend.</p><p>She stripped her bedsheets, stopping in her office on the way to collect Rio’s shirt and pants that were still crumpled on the floor. Her girlfriend had gone home in one of Agatha’s sweaters and a pair of her jeans, which just meant that even more of Rio’s things were at her house.</p><p>Rio’s things-</p><p>At her house.</p><p>Maybe it could be their house.</p><p>She hid any weed paraphernalia and threw the clothes and sheets into the laundry room, the only thing still missing was Rio’s bra. Where she’d thrown it or at what point she’d taken it off two nights ago, she couldn’t remember. She looked around the office and nothing. Did she still have it on when Agatha dragged her upstairs? She retraced her steps, going upstairs and down the hall. Both locations free of underwear. She scrambled around her bedroom, and how the fuck did a bra just dematerialize?</p><p>“Mom!” She heard her son from downstairs.</p><p>Cool, cool, cool, his teacher’s bra was just flung somewhere around her home. Around his home. No, this is great, really.</p><p>She met him at the front door, relieved to see him back in one emotional piece.</p><p>“How was your dad’s?” She always asked the same question every Sunday.</p><p>Then behind Nicky, Ralph appeared. He never walked him to the door, just dropped him off and bolted.</p><p>“Great.” Ralph replied.</p><p>She sucked air through her gritted teeth. “I asked Nicky.”</p><p>Her son just looked between his parents, probably praying it didn’t end in a screaming match.</p><p>“Yeah, uh, it was great. We had fun.” Nicky agreed, but he was so obviously trying to play peacekeeper.</p><p>Deciding not to make her son suffer any more than he already had, she moved on. “Glad you guys got some time in before the big move.”</p><p>“Nicky, why don’t you head upstairs for a minute?” Ralph told, not asked.</p><p>He looked between his mom and dad again before walking upstairs and closing his bedroom door.</p><p>“What?” Agatha hissed.</p><p>“I thought you might want to know that I leave Friday.” Her ex-husband said.</p><p>“You leave in five days? Does Nicky know?”</p><p>“Didn’t want to add to everything else. Kid has enough going on between a psychopathic teacher and his mental patient of a mom.”</p><p>Oh, how she wishes she had a plate right now, or a shiv.</p><p>“I’m going to let that go, because our son is home, and I’d rather not scar him with the homicide of his father. But you need to tell him and say goodbye.”</p><p>“Your mother agreed that it’d just make things harder on him.”</p><p>“My mother?” She incredulously spoke.</p><p>“Talked to her last week when I got the offer. She was happy for me, like you should be.”</p><p>“Then marry her, you already kiss her ass enough.”</p><p>“You should really clean in here.” He said. Agatha followed his eyeline.</p><p>The bra did not dematerialize, it was strewn behind a standing plant in the corner of the foyer next to the staircase. That’s right, she’d finally ripped it off as she pushed Rio up against the banister on their way to her bedroom. The bra was green so it blended in with the leaves of the plant, Agatha hadn’t even clocked it.</p><p>“If I want to rip my bra off after a long day of work and throw it around in my own home, that is my god-given right as a single woman.” She lied.</p><p>“Don’t make our son see that.”</p><p>She agreed, but she was saving her own skin here.</p><p>“He’s sixteen, I think he knows what a bra looks like.”</p><p>He grumbled, but continued. “I’ll be back for Christmas.”</p><p>“Unless it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, you’re not seeing Nicky.”</p><p>“We’ll see, you know I still get an invite to Evanora’s annual Christmas party every year.”</p><p>“My god, do you ever remove your mouth from her dick or are you just content to spend the rest of your life on your knees for her?”</p><p>He chuckled. “As if you’re any better. We both damn well know that all Evanora has to do is say jump, and you’d ask how high. But, hey, at least I’m aware of it. You pretend to be above it all. You’ve been at her fucking feet for almost forty years, begging her to love you.”</p><p>Fucking hell, that cut deep.</p><p>“Goodbye Ralph, safe travels. I’ll pray for your plane not to go down in an explosive fiery crash and that you don’t suffer a long, painful death.” She smiled sweetly.</p><p>“Always a pleasure, Agatha.” He said and turned to leave.</p><p>She closed the door and turned around to dig Rio’s bra out of the plant, she heard a creek at the top of the staircase and looked up. Nicky was looking down at her over the railing.</p><p>“How long have you been standing there?” She called up.</p><p>“Long enough.” He replied. “That’s the last time I’m seeing him.”</p><p>So he had heard everything, every dig, snipe, every grain of salt poured into her emotional wound. Fuck, she needed to get her shit together.</p><p>“He’ll be back for Christmas,” She soothed. “You can see him then if you want, and there’s always facetime.”</p><p>“No, I’m saying…I don’t want to see him again.”</p><p>“Hon, he’s your father.” Might be a shit one, but she didn’t want him to cut Ralph off just for her.</p><p>“Never acted like one.” He muttered. “And I don't like how he talks to you.”</p><p>“If it’s really your choice, you don’t have to.” Agatha said. She'd never force him to do something he didn’t want to. Appease others at his own sacrifice, not after how she was raised.</p><p>“That’s not yours, is it?” He pointed to the fabric in his mom’s hands.</p><p>“Umm…” Her voice was high-pitched.</p><p>“You guys are sick.” He joked.</p><p>“On a totally unrelated note, I have to swing by a furniture store, wanna come with?”</p><p>“Why do you have to go to a furniture store at three PM on a Sunday?”</p><p>“Stop asking questions you don’t want the answer to.”</p><p>They spent the rest of the day at Williams Sonoma in Eastview looking at bed frames and she pretended not to notice her son’s face when he realized why his mom all of a sudden needed a new one. She paid extra for at home delivery and assembly before picking up take out for her and Nicky.</p><p>They sat at the table eating chinese as two guys disassembled the old frame and put up the new one.</p><p>“You’re all set.” One of the fixer-builder guys said, holding out a clipboard. “I just need a signature.”</p><p>She set down her fork and walked over to sign.</p><p>“What happened to the support beam on your old one?” He genuinely asked. “I’ve never seen it splinter in half like that before.”</p><p>“Fucked too much.” She politely smiled, signing and handing him back the pen. “Have a good night.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah…’night.” He mumbled and grabbed his buddy to leave.</p><p>Monday morning, she decided to work from home. In all honesty, most of her job was just coordinating emails with contractors and signing off on budget reports. Her mother oversaw the actual running of the company, and Agatha knew that if the old bag would just fucking die, she could run things so much better.</p><p>She burrowed in her home office, dawning a white button up and jeans. She would’ve rather worn a comfy shirt, maybe one of Rio’s, but she had the occasional zoom call to answer and knew that if it got back to her mother, she’d show up out of thin air to scold Agatha.</p><p>Around four, Nicky got home, throwing his backpack on the hook next to the door and coming into her office to talk about his day.</p><p>“-Then Billy laughed so hard that the soda shot out his nose and he started running around yelling about how it burns.” Her son laughed, recounting the story of his lunch period.</p><p>“Good to know the behavior of teenage boys hasn’t changed since I went to high school.” She got up and headed to the kitchen, placing her phone down on the island and grabbing a bottle of water.</p><p>Nicky followed, grabbing a snack for the pantry. “And Rio almost made me late for class.”</p><p>“Oh, do tell, should she be in trouble?” She smirked.</p><p>“I was trying to ask why she slogged dad.”</p><p>“And did she tell you?”</p><p>“No, said you wouldn’t like it if she did.” He grinned.</p><p>“Smart woman.”</p><p>“Wish I could’ve been there, did he cry?”</p><p>Agatha almost cackled. “I don’t think I should tell you that…but yeah, like a little bitch.”</p><p>“Nice.”</p><p>“Okay, now that I’ve earned mom of the year, I should finish up my work.” And started back for the office when the doorbell rang.</p><p>“Did you invite Billy or Tommy over?” Agatha asked her son.</p><p>He shook his head, still chewing his crackers.</p><p>Then the bell rang again, followed by a knock.</p><p>No, not a knock, more of a beating, a pounding.</p><p>She set her phone back down, along with the water and started down the hall. She tried to subtly peek out the windows that were stationed on either side of the door, but to no avail.</p><p>Because something in her gut was telling her that nothing good was on the other side of that door.</p><p>Something sinister, like-</p><p>Her mother.</p><p>Agatha had barely opened the door before she strode in, as if it was her house and she had every right to be here.</p><p>“Mother-” She started.</p><p>Evanora shot her a look, one that told her she was fucking furious, if a stare could kill, Agatha’s pretty sure her throat would be slit right now.</p><p>“Office.” Her mother quietly hissed, one hand on her cane and another fisted by her side. Evanora didn’t often need assistance walking, Agatha thinks she secretly just liked to look more intimidating, but she was getting older and her mobility was declining. God, she couldn’t wait for the day where she just stopped moving completely. She looked down, and sure enough, more rings than normal adorned her mother’s hand.</p><p>A fucking calling card.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</p><p>She fucking knew, didn’t she? Who told her? She needed to warn Rio, but her phone was in another room and if she was wrong and ran to call Rio, then she’d make herself look guilty.</p><p>Agatha just simply nodded and followed her mother down the hall, past the kitchen where she saw Nicky’s eyes widen, past the living room and to her office. Her mother held herself with a certain type of quiet intensity, her cane was more of a show of fucking regalia at this point, she walked as though nothing could touch her.</p><p>She needed to calm down, her mother was essentially a bag of bones with skin stretched over and if she tried something, Agatha was younger and stronger, so everything should be fine.</p><p>That’s what she told herself anyway.</p><p>Once they were in the office and Agatha had closed the door, she turned to look at her mother. “Listen whatever you’re angry about, please just remember, my son is home.”</p><p>Evanora smiled that cruel fucking smile, the one devoid of empathy. “And why would I be angry?”</p><p>“I don’t know, you haven’t told me.”</p><p>“Who says I’m angry?”</p><p>What fucking mind game was this.</p><p>“Well it’s not Nicky’s birthday or a holiday, so that leaves you being pissed at me for your visiting.”</p><p>“I just thought you’d like to know about an interesting chat I had with your ex-husband.”</p><p>“Nothing Ralph has to say can be that interesting.” She retorted.</p><p>“We don’t talk nearly as much as I’d like, but it’s nice to have a son-in-law who cares.” Eavnora said, eyes narrowed at her daughter.</p><p>“He’s not your son-in-law anymore.”</p><p>“Yes, and I have you to thank for that, don’t I?”</p><p>“So, you just came here to rehash my divorce?” Oh thank fucking god, they were in the clear.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Agatha.” She huffed. “I spoke on the phone with Ralph last night, wanted to know how you took the news. You always were too hard on that man, no wonder he left you.”</p><p>“I left him.” Agatha corrected. In fact, he had begged her not to leave him.</p><p>“And do you know what he told me?” She continued, ignoring what Agatha had just said.</p><p>“That I’m a mean dragon-lady who bullies him?” She silently hoped that for once in his useless life, he kept his mouth shut.</p><p>“Yes, and,” She took a couple steps closer. “That Nicky received a ride home from his favorite teacher.”</p><p>There it is.</p><p>A chill ran down her spine as her mothers eyes dissected her, reading her and trying to catch her crumble.</p><p>It wouldn’t happen, after high school, Agatha vowed to never let her mother see her cry again. She wouldn’t give her the vulnerability and pain she so obviously craved.</p><p>“And?” Agatha asked, as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>“I can’t ever recall having a teacher that felt comfortable enough to drive me home, or interject in my parent’s marital squabbles…or leave her bra at my home!” Evanora barked, and before Agatha could register the movement, her hand shot out to stop her mother’s mid-slap.</p><p>Agatha looked at the wrist caught in her grasp, mere inches from her own face, looking as stunned as Evanora that she had stopped it.</p><p>In some gross, corny way, she felt brave, brave because she had Rio, had her love.</p><p>Maybe love made her brave.</p><p>God, that sounded really gay.</p><p>“And what are you going to do?” She spoke evenly, finally matching her mother’s intensity. “Get her fired, throw her out of her house?”</p><p>Her mother just blinked, trying to pull her hand back, but her daughter wouldn’t let go.</p><p>She yanked Evanora’s wrist tighter, hearing her mother hiss in discomfort. Agatha was officially pissed.</p><p>She was done bending to her mother.</p><p>For Victoria.</p><p>For Rio.</p><p>For herself.</p><p>“I’ve been so scared of you all these years, and what has it gotten me?” She quietly spoke, her own eyes digging into Evanora’s. “I made myself miserable to appease you, and it didn’t make a fucking difference. I could live a thousand lives under your jurisdiction and each one would be more depressing than the last, and you know what I think?”</p><p>Evanora didn’t say anything, just flitted her wrist around trying and failing to break free.</p><p>“I think you get off on it. I think that you’re a miserable old hag who hasn’t felt an ounce of happiness in eons so you take it out on me. Because you can’t stand the thought of your own daughter living a better life than you. Because you’re too much of a fucking narcassist to have a maternal bone in your body. Because without your money and your status, you’re nothing more than a con-woman who has wasted her life trying to feel important, superior, better than. And the truth is, mother, you could die tomorrow and nobody would care. They’d rejoice in the fucking streets.”</p><p>She dropped her mother’s wrist, more than confident that she’d be able to defend herself against Evanora and her hollow fucking bird bones.</p><p>“So you do whatever you need to do. Get her fired. Evict her.” She spit out, standing taller, almost towering over her mother. “I’m not seventeen, and you’ve lost your edge. I’ll buy the fucking house, I’ll support Rio, I don’t fucking care. I love her and I’m not letting you ruin it again.”</p><p>God, that felt good, like a weight lifted, like she could see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>Her mother cocked her head and smiled, her hand clenching tighter round her cane before she raised up and whipped it back down.</p><p>Agatha faintly heard herself yelp before her vision momentarily went black, losing balance and slumping against the wall. Her ears were ringing, her head was throbbing, the room was spinning.</p><p>She raised her hand to her skull just above her temple and looked down at her hand, dark red covered her fingertips.</p><p>Scratch that, love made her stupid.</p><p>Because two months ago, Agatha would’ve seen that coming.</p><p>Not to keep score, but-</p><p>Bird Bones- 1, Agatha- 0.</p><p>“Remember,” Evanora chided. “My grandson is home.” Parroting Agatha’s earlier words at the scream she’d let out.</p><p>“Whacking me with a cane? Who are you, Al Capone?” She said, but her voice came out so much shakier than she expected.</p><p>Her mother didn’t laugh. Fucking bitch, that was funny.</p><p>“I have been assured by Principal Davis that Miss Vidal will be terminated.” Evanora began. “And yes, I did realize that you could just simply purchase the home for that woman.”</p><p>“So why the fuck are you still talkiiinngg?” Agatha goaded, she felt woozy, she could hear her heartbeat in her ears.</p><p>“But,” Evanora ignored her yet again. “I thought it’d sell so much easier as an empty plot. A fresh start for the new homeowners.”</p><p>“Empty plot?” She scrunched her face, feeling the liquid drip down her jaw and onto the collar of her shirt.</p><p>She liked this button up and now it had blood on it, damnit.</p><p>“A fire is much more inconspicuous than a demolition crew.” Her mother bared her teeth in something akin to a smile.</p><p>“Fire?” She didn’t understand and the head trauma wasn’t helping.</p><p>“You see, it’s not the structure that she cares about, it's what it represents.”</p><p>“You…” She was connecting the dots in her head.</p><p>Evanora raised her eyebrows, her face pinched in some sick victory. “I’m guessing it’s almost broiled down to the studs by now.”</p><p>And the rage she felt coursing through her bloodstream suddenly gave her a second wind. “Evil fucking bitch!” And pushed herself off the wall.</p><p>Balancing was a challenge, but she pushed on.</p><p>As she lunged towards her mother, no actual plan in mind, she registered the cane being handled like a fucking baton, hurtling towards her again. She shot her forearm up, deflecting it.</p><p>A violent wave of pain seared itself across the flesh before seeping into the bone. She was running out of nonvital places for her mother to jab, she could barely stand, and now her arm was fucked.</p><p>Shit, Bird Bones- 2.</p><p>She couldn’t yell for help, she didn’t want Nicky in here. She had spent so much of her childhood being exposed to things that no kid should have to endure. She’d rather die in this room than subject him to that.</p><p>She wanted Rio.</p><p>She’d always want Rio.</p><p>And now she was the cause of her home being destroyed, of Victoria’s memory being tarnished. All because she couldn’t stay away, she couldn’t stop pursuing her, couldn’t just leave her alone. Maybe she really was greedy-</p><p>Selfish.</p><p>Broken.</p><p>Or maybe it was the bloodloss.</p><p>She was on the floor, no idea how she really got there, but presumably the force of the cane ricocheting off her arm sent her tumbling down.</p><p>And just like always, her mother lorded over her.</p><p>And now she really seemed pissed, like Agatha fighting back was annoying rather than threatening.</p><p>“I tried treating you like the adult I thought you were. Trusting you. I showed you mercy time and time again.”</p><p>She chuckled at the absurdity. “Mercy?”</p><p>Evanora crouched down to eye-level of where Agatha was sitting. “Twenty years of mercy!”</p><p>Well, if she was going down, she’d go down swinging. She looked her mother dead in the eye and smiled before pursing her lips and spitting in her face. “Cunt.”</p><p>Evanora recoiled, wiping the spit off her cheek and standing up again.</p><p>Apparently, she had finally pushed her to the edge, because she’d never heard her mother’s voice project so loudly, filled with so much rage. “YOU SHOULD FEEL LUCKY I DIDN’T BURN IT DOWN WITH HER INSIDE.”</p><p>Agatha winced at the volume, the headache pulsing through her skull was on a mission to make it feel like her scalp was being split open.</p><p>“Thanks, mom.” She deadpanned, voice hardly above a whisper. “Wanna braid each other’s hair and drink cosmos? We can be just like the Gilmore Girls!”</p><p>“Of all my missteps in my life, you are by far my biggest regret.”</p><p>“Tell me something I don’t know.” She huffed, eyes slightly drooping.</p><p>“I’ve made accommodations for you and Nicky to stay with me in New York. I’m not leaving you within a fifty mile radius of that girl.” Evanora barked.</p><p>“I would rather die.” She rasped, and fuck, head wounds were no joke.</p><p>“There are fates worse than death, my dear.” Her mother condescended.</p><p>“There is no fate worse than having you as a mother.” Her voice was breaking. And she was really, really trying to hold back her tears, but the pain- both physical and emotional, was getting to be too much.</p><p>“There is.” Evanora assured. “Having you as a daughter.”</p><p>“So fucking melodramatic...” Agatha grumbled, her back melting against the wall, legs sprawled out on the floor, her injured arm slung over her abdomen, and hand clutching her head.</p><p>“I-” Evanora began but stopped at the sound of the turning of the doorknob.</p><p>No, no, no-</p><p>She did not want Nicky seeing her like this, quite literally beaten down and groaning in pain. He’d never look at her the same, she was supposed to protect him, not the other way around.</p><p>The door opened, and Agatha braced herself for the terrified screams of her minor son, but instead-</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Either she was really here, or her head wound was worse than she thought.</p><p>She saw her storm in and immediately lock her gaze on her, flying down to the floor and cradling Agatha’s face. Her hands felt warm, and safe. She smelled bergamot and was instantly soothed, like the scent was cocooning her. Big brown doe eyes looked at her like she was the most precious thing in the world.</p><p>“What happened?!” Rio’s voice sounded far away, muffled by the bloodrush.</p><p>She didn’t feel too hot, and judging by the look of horror on her love’s face, she didn’t look too hot either.</p><p>Agatha tried focusing her eyes as she responded-</p><p>“Cheer accident.”</p>

<p>“Cheer accident.” Agatha spoke.</p><p>Rio knew things were going to be bad, but she didn’t expect to see her girlfriend limp on the floor with blood pouring out of her head. It was oozing down her face, dripping onto her shirt, staining the crisp white fabric a deep crimson.</p><p>And she wanted to cry, scoop Agatha up in her arms and comfort her, tend to what hurt and kiss away the agony. She wanted to whisk her somewhere far away from here, away from her mother, and Ralph, and anyone else who dared to inflict pain onto her.</p><p>But, she couldn’t do that yet.</p><p>Not with the problem still standing a few feet behind them.</p><p>Rio shot up against her own wishes, wanting to stay on the floor consoling Agatha. She dropped the folder in Agatha’s lap and whipped around, charging first and thinking later. She crossed the room where Evanora stood and fisted her hand into whatever designer blouse Agatha’s mother was wearing, and kept fucking charging until Evanora’s back hit the wall, cane clattering to the ground.</p><p>Now Rio didn’t consider herself a violent person, sure she had punched a few people in her life, Ralph included. But overall, she thought physically harming another person was excessive.</p><p>But as Evanora’s eyes widened and the wind was knocked out of her, Rio could only think of the harm she’d love to cause this woman. The bag of dust wiggled in her grasp so Rio brought her forearm up to her throat, pinning her head to the wall and pressing.</p><p>“You burned down my fucking house, got me fired.” Rio growled.</p><p>Eavora tried to speak, but it was useless with Rio’s forearm pressing down on her neck. Her hands flew up to claw at Rio’s arm, trying to be released.</p><p>“You threatened me, my mom.”</p><p>The woman against the wall just stared in terror, and fuck, it might be deranged, but a wave of sick satisfaction washed over her.</p><p>“You beat your own daughter and made the love of my life bleed.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t putting enough weight that Evanora would choke, just enough to hurt.</p><p>“Did you know it only takes 33 pounds of pressure to crush a human’s windpipe?” She asked rhetorically.</p><p>“Rio,” She heard Agatha croak from across the room.</p><p>“And that the average person can force 40 pounds of pressure in just one arm?” She pushed down harder on the hag’s throat, feeling the muscles trying to contract and get air.</p><p>Evanora just let out a strangled breath, hands languidly hitting Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Baby, it’s not worth a murder charge.” Agatha tried to reason.</p><p>But the anger, the fucking rage pouring out of Rio’s body in this moment was too much. She needed an outlet, and the cause of her decades long torment was at her mercy.</p><p>“You stole twenty years of my fucking life.” And smiled when she saw Evanora’s eyes getting heavy. “What if I stole the last twenty of yours?”</p><p>“My love, don’t…” The plea fell so earnestly from her girlfriend’s lips.</p><p>Rio finally lifted her arm away, watching Evanora slump back and gasp for air, hacking and clutching her neck.</p><p>“You should feel lucky your daughter is a better person than me.” She spoke Evanora’s earlier words back to her. “Because if she wasn’t here right now, you wouldn’t be breathing.”</p><p>Rio turned, picking up the cane off the ground and walking over to Agatha. The woman wouldn’t be much of a threat without a weapon and a semi-bruised windpipe. She quickly shrugged off her sweater and bunched it to place against Agatha’s wound, attempting to stop the bleeding.</p><p>“We’ll get you out of here soon, okay?” Rio gently spoke.</p><p>Agatha reached up and took over the task of holding the fabric. “Yeah.” She winced at the pressure.</p><p>Rio picked up the folder and stood in front of Evanora, papers in one hand, cane in the other. “Let’s get to the main event, shall we?”</p><p>“What on earth are you yammering about?” Evanora rasped through the pain that Rio had no doubt inflicted.</p><p>“You’ve been a very busy woman, haven’t you?” She held up the evidence and grinned.</p><p>“I have no clue what you’re referring to.”</p><p>“No?” She opened the folder. “Let’s start with the least incriminating and work our way up.”</p><p>She was being dramatic, but sue her, she’d waited for this moment her whole life.</p><p>“In 2012, Stark Industries finally went public, but your buddy Howard gave you a heads up in advance didn’t he?” Rio held up the paper, showing a piece of email correspondence. “Do you know what insider trading is, Evanora? Apparently, you do, because you’ve done a fuckton of it throughout your career. Up to twenty years in federal prison if convicted.”</p><p>“This is ridiculous, I’m calling the police.” The old bat huffed.</p><p>“Go ahead, we can explain what happened to your daughter’s head.”</p><p>Eavnora swiped the paper from Rio’s hand, ripping it to shreds.</p><p>“Don’t worry, everything in this folder is backed up on a hard drive somewhere in New York, just had a friend go above and beyond to print it all out.” Rio assured.</p><p>In their time as friends with benefits, Rio had heard about the inner workings of Nat’s business. Her and Yelena weren’t dumb, they kept every piece of dirt unless a client told them otherwise.</p><p>“Moving on,” Rio projected, using her teacher's voice and picking up another piece of paper.  “You’re estimated to be worth 700 million dollars…but it’s more than that, isn’t it?”</p><p>Evanora lifted her eyebrows, playing dumb. “Give or take.”</p><p>“It’s give. You have several offshore accounts with more.” She looked down at the paper. “Now, I’m gonna be honest, I have no clue what an offshore account is or what it entails, but I do know that rich people usually have them when they make a profit through illegal means.”</p><p>“Offshore accounts? How tacky.” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>Rio smirked, even with a head wound, Agatha was still making her little comments. Fuck, she loved that woman.</p><p>“None of those can be traced to me.” Evanora stated.</p><p>“They can be, they already were.” She gingerly handed the paper to Evanora, letting her see the evidence for herself. “You’ve been embezzling from Harkness Inc. for years, skimming off the top.”</p><p>“How did you get this?” Agatha’s mother barked.</p><p>“Embezzlement is a felony and six years in prison.” Her girlfriend helpfully supplied.</p><p>“Thank you, baby.” Rio said without looking back, instead gazing down at the accounts of Evanora’s numerous crimes. “Next…” She started, twirling the cane in her hand. “Oh, this one's my personal favorite-”</p><p>“Enough!” Evanora yelled.</p><p>Rio held up the cane. “Raise your voice at me again.” She challenged.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just stood and waited.</p><p>“That’s what I thought.” Rio smiled. “Now, you inherited the company after Agatha’s father died when she was five, right?”</p><p>Agatha never really spoke about her dad, didn’t remember him, only knew what her mother told her.</p><p>The crone rolled her eyes. “Correct.”</p><p>“Incorrect, Agatha did.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha questioned, trying to stand.</p><p>“In his will, he left everything to Agatha, including control of the company when she turned twenty-five.” Rio held up a photocopy of the original will. “So you’re about thirteen years late on handing over the reins.”</p><p>Evanora took the paper and ran her eyes over it. “This was supposed to be destroyed.”</p><p>“The lawyer you had doctor and verify a fake one is retired now, but he was more than happy to hand over the collateral he kept on you…for a price.”</p><p>Agatha slowly walked over, standing next to Rio.</p><p>Rio continued. “So in addition to forging a legal document, you also defrauded the company.”</p><p>“Oh, the shareholders are going to be pissed.” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“Which do you think is worse for the public image, my love?” She asked Agatha. “The conviction for long list of white collar crimes, or a lesbian for a daughter?”</p><p>“Sheesh, it’s hard to say.” Agatha blew out.</p><p>“You would’ve run the company into the ground.” Evanora stated. “I did what was best for everyone involved.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the sweater and bolted forward, slapping her mother. “You did what was best for you.” And her body wavered, as if she had exerted too much energy. Rio caught her, helping to steady her. “I hope you rot in that prison cell they throw you in.”</p><p>Evanora looked at them, steadying her jaw. “What do you want? Money? Control of the company?”</p><p>“I want you to suffer everyday the way I did for thirty-eight years.”</p><p>“I’ll deny everything. Get a good lawyer. The most I do is pay some fines.” Evanora said. “And, as I recall, I don’t sign off on the budgetary reports.” She raised her eyebrow at Agatha.</p><p>“I was your failsafe?” Her girlfriend asked.</p><p>“I’m just an old lady, who knows what you’ve done using my name…”</p><p>“Are you serious? Do you feel no remorse for anything you’ve done?” Rio asked.</p><p>“What have I done?” Evanora started. “The only thing I’ve done is protect this family and company. It does not matter that I cut some corners. That I bought some stock before the FTC could notice. That I faked some expense reports. That I did what my husband was too feeble-minded to do and fixed his will! I ran the damn company and I made it a success!” She narrowed her eyes at Rio. “And I’d burn down your shitty little house again if it ensured my family and business continued to thrive. I’d take your job a thousand times over!”</p><p>All three just stood in uncomfortable silence for a minute.</p><p>Rio smiled. “That was perfect.”</p><p>Agatha knitted her eyebrows together. “Perfect?”</p><p>She hastily raised her phone out of her pocket, showing that it had been recording the entire time. She tapped the red button on the screen, ending the recording. “We’ll have to cut out my almost-murder, but all in all, I’m satisfied. Even got the arson and corruption in there.”</p><p>Evanora’s face fell. “You-”</p><p>“God, I love you.” Agatha lazily spoke.</p><p>“I’d start packing if I were you,” Rio’s eyes boring into Evanora’s. “Where do all disgraced rich people flee to? Italy? I feel like it’s Italy.” She held up her phone. “‘Cause I think the feds are about to be on your ass.”</p><p>“You can’t just-” Evanora said.</p><p>“I can.” She temporarily let go of Agatha and cornered Evanora against the wall again. “And if you ever come back here, if you ever try to hurt my family again, if I so much as hear a whisper from you; I will find you and next time I won’t stop. I will ensure your death is so long, so unending, that you’ll wish I had killed you in this room.”</p><p>And Evanora was standing tall, but Rio could feel her body trembling. “Comprende?”</p><p>Evanora looked at her daughter. “You’re going to let her speak to me this way, treat your own mother like this?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Yeah, I’m actually thoroughly enjoying it.”</p><p>“Your father would be so disappointed in you.” Evanora hissed.</p><p>“Do you have a death wish?” Rio raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Well, there’s the thing mother, you’ve done such a good job, I’m kind of numb to parental disappointment.” Agatha said. “Now get the fuck out of my house.”</p><p>Evanora scoffed, and Rio moved so that she could leave. She motioned for her cane back and Rio just laughed. “I’m not fucking dumb.”</p><p>She kept walking, hobbling slightly, head held high. They heard her footsteps recede until she was out the front door, closing it behind her.</p><p>“Oh, thank god,” Agatha buckled, leaving Rio to catch her, propping her up.</p><p>“C’mon, we need to get you to a hospital. Where are your keys?” Rio started helping her walk out of the office.</p><p>“No, no hospitals. Just call Jen.” Her girlfriend grumbled, leaning against Rio’s body as they moved.</p><p>“Jen? She’s a dermatologist.”</p><p>“She’s a doctor and I hate hospitals. Just help me to the kitchen and she can patch me up there, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Baby, you have a gash in your head. You’re probably not feeling it because of the adrenaline, but it’s going to start hurting.” She gently placed Agatha on a seat at the kitchen table, crouching down to evel-level.</p><p>“It already hurts, and I’m not going to a hospital.”</p><p>“Stubborn woman.” Rio whispered under her breath.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha glared.</p><p>“Maybe the head injury isn’t as bad as I thought.” She replied.</p><p>Then Agatha relaxed in her chair, looking guilty. “I’m so sorry about your house, I should’ve seen that coming-”</p><p>And it broke Rio’s heart to hear that she blamed herself.</p><p>“Mi amor, you have nothing to apologize for, I’m just happy you’re okay. I don’t know what’d I’d do if you weren’t.”</p><p>“Your whole life was in that place.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, and my whole life is outside of it too.”</p><p>“I'm just glad Nicky didn’t see any of it- Wait. Where’s Nicky?” She frantically looked around.</p><p>“I gave him my car and sent him to Wanda’s, he called me when he thought you were in trouble.”</p><p>“You kept him safe?” Agatha’s eyes welled, maybe all of the emotions of the day catching up at once.</p><p>“I’ll always keep you two safe.”</p><p>Agatha pulled at Rio, throwing her arms around her and clinging. She felt the soft shaking of her body as Agatha wept, burrowing her face against Rio’s neck. And Rio just held her back, one hand cupping her head, the other resting on her back, letting her know she was safe. That what Rio had said was true, she’d always keep them safe, no matter the cost, or the pain. Three nights ago she said she’d be happy as long as she had Agatha and Nicky, and she hoped that Agatha felt that sentiment now. That Rio’s love was seared into her bones, coursing through her veins, an innate fact that her brain just knew. Like how the sun rises and sets, how a river ebbs and flows, and how Rio loved her and Nicky.</p><p>“Please let me drive you to the ER.” She said after a minute.</p><p>Agatha pulled back, wiping the tears. “No hospitals.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I hate them.”</p><p>“So you’ve said, is there a reason?”</p><p>She let out a sigh. “The last time I was in a hospital, I was twenty-two, giving birth, and all alone. Even with your mom there, I just..I never got past it, okay? So please, no hospital.”</p><p>Agatha had been through enough trauma for the day, they both had, and Rio wasn’t going to pile on. “Okay. I’ll call Jen, get her over here. Then I’ll call Alice so she can let the cops know to come here and take statements.”</p><p>Rio fished out her phone. “Shit, and I need to call Wanda ‘cause she has Nicky, then I need to call Nicky, and also probably Nat-”</p><p>The front door opened and Rio craned her body from the kitchen to see who it was.</p><p>Wanda called out, jogging down the hall. “Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha!” Jen’s voice screamed out at the same time.</p><p>“Oh jesus christ, please make them stop yelling.” Agatha whined.</p><p>“Kitchen!” Rio shouted back.</p><p>“Baby, please.” Agatha groaned.</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio murmured.</p><p>Jen and Wanda appeared through the doorway and reacted, well, accordingly to Agatha’s current state.</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Jen gasped.</p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha, are you okay?” Wanda yelled.</p><p>“I’m going to off myself.” Agatha whispered to Rio.</p><p>“Not funny given the circumstances, mi amor.”</p><p>“I’m fine.” Agatha huffed.</p><p>Jen set a medic bag on the table. “You’re not.”</p><p>“How’d you know to bring that?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Wanda told me what Nicky told her, figured it might come in handy…unfortunately I was right.” She said, pulling out gloves and examining the wound on her girlfriends hairline.</p><p>“Thank god you guys are alright,” Wanda smiled. “What happened?”</p><p>“She came, whacked me like she was fucking Al Capone,” Agatha started.</p><p>Rio let out a small chuckle, that was funny.</p><p>“Then Rio came in, almost killed her, confronted her, and she left.” Agatha finished. “Jennifer!” She hissed when Jen grazed the wound.</p><p>“Wait, back up-” Wanda said. “You almost killed her?”</p><p>“For fucksake, Rio, why didn’t you finish the job?!” Jen said, pushing Agatha’s hair out of her way.</p><p>“Agatha asked me not to.”</p><p>“Why the hell not? She could’ve gotten you off.” Wanda chimed in.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure that’s all Agatha does.” Jen quipped.</p><p>“Okay! I’m gonna make a few calls.” Rio segued.</p><p>Less than an hour later, Alice and Nat, along with most of Westview PD, were in Agatha’s house, collecting statements and taking photos of the office. They collected the cane and the (edited) recording off of Rio’s phone. Paramedics checked over Rio but she waved them off to go check on Agatha who was still at the table.</p><p>“If one more of you fucks poke or prod me, I swear to god-” Agatha threatened.</p><p>“Ma’am you seem agitated, that could be an indicator that you have serious trauma to your brain.” An EMT said.</p><p>Her girlfriend narrowed her eyes. “I’m sorry if I’m agitated, you know what might help? If you didn’t fucking call me ma’am!”</p><p>“She’s always like this, don’t take it personally.” Jen said, stitching up the wound. Agatha claimed she wanted a ‘real doctor’ to treat her head, which Rio supposed was fair enough.</p><p>Rio was standing at the island, finishing up with an officer before making her way over to Wanda and Nat.</p><p>“Is this your natural color? It’s beautiful.” Nat hummed, running her hand over the ends of Wanda’s hair.</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Wanda smiled.</p><p>“Nat, stop hitting on the straight woman, it makes the rest of us look bad.”</p><p>Wanda waved her off. “Oh, I don’t mind.”</p><p>Rio was going to continue but Jen called her over. “The good news is, no concussion or serious brain injury.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio checked.</p><p>Jen grinned. “Watch.” She knelt down in front of Agatha. “Agatha, can you tell me who the president is?”</p><p>Her girlfriend gagged. “Ugh, don’t make me say it.”</p><p>“See?” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“What’s the bad news?”</p><p>“Oh, her arm is fucked.”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha who was getting her battered and bruised arm wrapped with a splint by a paramedic.</p><p>“Is that the medical term?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, she has a bone fracture in her ulna.” Jen held up her forearm. “That’s the bone on the outside of her arm.” Jen displayed.</p><p>“The bitch fractured her bone?” Rio ground out through clenched teeth, she should’ve finished the job back in the office.</p><p>“Honestly, it’s a good thing the woman is the personification of osteoporosis. Any harder and she could’ve shattered the bone entirely. It’ll be sore for a while, but it should heal just fine.”</p><p>The paramedic finished wrapping Agatha’s arm and scurried away. Rio left Jen and crouched down again to check in on Agatha.</p><p>“Doin’ okay?” Rio placed a gentle hand to the side of her face. Most of the blood had been cleaned off her face, her wound was stitched closed, but she looked exhausted.</p><p>“I need a cigarette, or a drink, or a joint, or all three.”</p><p>Rio smiled and kissed the uninjured side of her head. “That can be arranged.”</p><p>The front door opened for the millionth time that night and Nicky sprinted in, scanning the room of cops and EMTs for his mom. Rio had called him last, wanting Agatha to be bandaged up before Nicky saw her.</p><p>“Mom!” He ran towards Agatha.</p><p>Rio moved out of the way as Agatha stood, letting her son engulf her.</p><p>“Hey hon.” Agatha whispered, one hand stroking her son’s hair.</p><p>“You’re okay.” He breathed, holding his mom like he was still scared.</p><p>“I’m okay.” She affirmed.</p><p>When he pulled back and really looked at her, his face fell. “Your head…” His eyes dropped to the dried blood on her shirt. “Did Nana do this to you?”</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s over, I’m fine.” Agatha consoled.</p><p>“Your arm.” He quietly spoke.</p><p>“Its nothing serious, Rio made sure I was safe.”</p><p>He looked over to Rio and turned to hug her too. “Thank you.”</p><p>She hugged him back. “Always, mijo.”</p><p>The term of endearment came out so naturally, but it had been a long day and it wasn’t even seven PM yet, so she hoped that Nicky didn’t call her on it.</p><p>He didn’t seem to mind, or maybe even notice. When he let go, he looked over Rio too. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah I’m fine.” She assured.</p><p>“The cops are going to need your statement on everything that happened tonight, do you want me to be there with you?” Agatha asked Nicky.</p><p>He shook his head. “Probably better if you didn’t, I’m not going to be nice about what I have to say.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Good man.”</p><p>More time passed, Rio wasn’t sure exactly how much, but the sun had set and most of the paramedics and police had departed. She poured herself and Agatha tumblers of whiskey, very expensive, very old whiskey per her girlfriend’s request. Everyone was sitting at the table talking about the day and next steps.</p><p>“When are you guys gonna check on Rio’s house?” Wanda asked.</p><p>Rio sat down at the table next to Agatha, handing her a glass and sipping her own. “Firefighters said we can take a look tomorrow, see if anything’s salvageable.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio. I feel awful for not catching it sooner.” Alice added.</p><p>“Don’t. Who would’ve guessed that Evanora would send a goon to light my house on fire?”</p><p>“I should’ve.” Agatha spoke over the rim of her glass.</p><p>“You couldn’t have known.” Rio grabbed her hand, the one attached to her injured arm.</p><p>“Still…” She said.</p><p>“Should you be drinking?” Nicky asked. “Like, with the whole…” And motioned to his own head.</p><p>“The real question is, why aren’t we all drinking?” Jen said. “I patched you up for free, that is unheard of in the American healthcare system.”</p><p>Agatha pointed behind herself to the island where the whiskey sat. “Help yourself. I was saving it for a special occasion, and this fucking feels like one.”</p><p>One of the few straggling officers approached the table. “Sorry ladies, I just thought you’d want to know that we got her.”</p><p>“Already?” Rio whipped her head to look at the cop.</p><p>“We contacted the NYPD to keep an eye out and we got a tip that she was at her private hanger, trying to hop a plane.”</p><p>“To where?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Uh, I think they said Italy.”</p><p>Rio threw up her arms. “I knew it!”</p><p>The cop gave a sideways glance before continuing. “She’ll be tried in Jersey for her involvement here tonight before being shipped back to New York where the feds will take over.”</p><p>“What about Sharon Davis?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Oh, she folded immediately, that woman has no poker face.” The cop said. “She’ll probably get a slap on the wrist in return for her cooperation and information.”</p><p>“Bastards.” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“What?” The officer asked.</p><p>“Thanks, officer.” Wanda politely smiled.</p><p>After a while, after everyone had finally left Agatha’s house, after Nicky made some pretty solid grilled cheeses for dinner, and after it had gotten late, Rio got ready for bed with Agatha. Luckily, her Bikini Kill shirt was in the drawer, throwing it on with some boxers and sliding into the bed with a pajama-clad Agatha next to her. Her hair was still damp from her shower, too tired to actually dry it, but Rio thought she looked beautiful. She loved getting to see her in these hidden moments.</p><p>“Does it ever get tiring?” Agatha softly asked, head on Rio’s chest, room dark and quiet.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The pain it costs to love me?”</p><p>Rio looked down, making out the shape of Agatha’s face looking back. “It’s never cost me anything to love you, mi amor.” She responded in earnest. “Now keeping you, that’s a different story.”</p><p>“We’ve lost so much time.”</p><p>“We still have a lot left.”</p><p>That seemed to satisfy her, laying back down fully.</p><p>Then Rio smiled. “I like the new bedframe by the way.”</p><p>She heard that snort she was so familiar with. “Shut up.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“What?” Rio asked in disbelief, naked in her professor’s bed on the eve of her college graduation in June 2009.</p><p>She and Hela had been seeing each other since the end of her junior year with absolutely no commitment from the other woman. Hela had claimed that since Rio was a student it’d look bad for them to be an actual couple, like publicly, and Rio had naively agreed. She thought that once she graduated, the professor would commit, stop making her settle for quick fucks in lecture halls, or Hela’s office, or one of their apartments in between classes. She always said Rio had so much promise, and talent, and intellect, but she never actually took the time to know her. And in turn, Rio didn’t really know Hela either, beyond the surface. There were never dinners, or dates, or gestures, Hela didn’t seem interested in anything beyond sex.</p><p>But Hela was older and seemed to know everything, and the fact that she wanted Rio, even if only physically, made her feel special. That is until her professor rolled over one minute ago, post-coistus, and said they need to end things.</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Hela said in a condescending tone, standing and pulling a robe on. “We always knew how this was going to end.”</p><p>Poor choice of words on her part, because that particular string of words in that particular order felt like a hot blade slicing her open. It’s exactly what Agatha had said to her four years ago under the bleachers.</p><p>“Did we?” She pulled the sheets tighter around herself, trying to use it as a physical shield.</p><p>“We had fun, but you’re twenty-two, I need someone a little more mature.”</p><p>“You chose to fuck a twenty-two year old for almost a full year, and that’s somehow my fault?”</p><p>Hela sighed. “Listen, you’re young and I’m seventeen years older than you. How would that look?”</p><p>Rio got up, hastily getting dressed and wrangling on her shirt. “You’re right, you’re so right! It’d make you look like a piece of shit who preys on her students, and we couldn’t have that, now could we?”</p><p>“You’re proving my point about the immaturity.” Hela crossed her arms.</p><p>“Not my fault, I’m twenty-two!” Rio pointedly glared as she zipped her jeans. “Even though, I’m sure that’s what attracted you to me in the first place. I bet women your own age can see this bullshit a mile away and want nothing to do with you!”</p><p>“You should leave.”</p><p>“What do you think I’m doing?!” Rio grabbed her bag, throwing her bra and underwear in. “You could’ve at least done me the courtesy of not fucking me first.”</p><p>“Good luck post-grad.” Hela mumbled.</p><p>“Puta.” She hissed and started leaving the post-modern, pretentious ass loft the professor lived in.</p><p>“I don’t know what that means!” Hela called after.</p><p>Rio kept walking, flipping her off as she reached the door. “It means bitch, of which you are one!”</p><p>She heard Hela scoff as she left.</p><p>Hela was the first in a string of many toxic relationships Rio had throughout adulthood. There was Carol when she was twenty-five, a student pilot who she dated for two years before Carol left her for her co-pilot, Maria. There was Val when Rio was twenty-nine, funny and charismatic, but came home most nights smelling like another woman’s perfume. There were casual flings in between, nothing serious or not really worth Rio’s time, just moderately okay company for one night or a couple weeks before she’d never see them again. In all honesty, Natasha had been Rio’s longest romantic relationship, and that was only because it wasn’t an actual relationship. They were friends who just happened to fuck every now and then.</p><p>She made an effort not to compare every woman to Agatha, telling herself she was romanticizing the relationship. That those rose-colored glasses were lying, that she made it all bigger in her head, that Agatha probably barely remembered their time together. But it never worked, and every time another woman came into the picture, all Rio could think was-</p><p>She’s not Agatha.</p><p>And she felt pathetic for thinking it, for feeling it, for letting her affect every relationship she’s ever had. It’s like the woman haunted her, a fucking ghost just looming over her entire life.</p><p>She fucking hated ghosts.</p><p>Or she did.</p><p>Until recently.</p><p>Until she woke up the morning after Wanda’s not birthday and found that ghost making her breakfast and committing to be better. Then she started making peace with her ghost. Then less than a week later, there was no ghost, there was only Agatha.</p><p>Agatha and her stupid little remarks.</p><p>Agatha and the way her eyes glimmer when she smiles.</p><p>Agatha and that little forehead vein that pops out when she’s pissed.</p><p>And now she had Agatha, actually had her. Not had her with an asterisk that detailed who and who couldn’t know she had her. She just had Agatha.</p><p>Rio woke up the morning after the Evanora debacle fairly early, she still felt wired from the night before. She let Agatha sleep, figuring she’d need the rest.</p><p>She made her way downstairs to the kitchen, trying to figure out how on earth to work the ridiculously bougie coffee maker Agatha had on the kitchen counter.</p><p>“You have to press the little button on the screen first.” She heard Nicky say. She turned to look at him, still his pajamas, then looked at the clock.</p><p>“It’s five in the morning, why are you up?”</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep. You?”</p><p>She jammed her thumb into the screen and the machine whirled to life, starting to brew. “Same.”</p><p>“How’s mom?” He walked into the kitchen, sitting at the island.</p><p>“Clonked the fuck out.” Rio said, grabbing a mug and looking back. “Do you drink coffee? Are you allowed?”</p><p>“I’m not four.” He chuckled.</p><p>Rio grabbed a second mug. “Well I don’t fucking know what age you’re supposed to let your kid drink coffee at.”</p><p>“Why was Nana so pissed at mom?”</p><p>She stopped her task, turning her body fully and looking at him. “It’s uh, a long story.”</p><p>“We’ve got nothing but time.”</p><p>“I don’t know if I should.” She wasn’t sure what he knew, or how to put everything delicately, or if Agatha would even want him to know.</p><p>“Please? I’m so sick of adults keeping me in the dark about things because they think I can’t handle it.” He sounded more sad than angry. “I think I proved last night that I can handle things.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath. “Your mom and I dated in high school, that’s why she has the photo, that’s why your Nana was so pissed.”</p><p>“Mom and dad dated in high school.”</p><p>“I’m sure that’s the story they told you, but your parents broke up at the beginning of senior year, then we dated, then your mom got back together with your dad.”  She explained, pouring herself a cup before handing one to Nicky.</p><p>“Were you guys in love?”</p><p>“Yeah, we were.” Rio smiled. “Like cheesy, stupid, nausea-inducing love.”</p><p>“Why’d you guys break up then? Why’d she get back with him?”</p><p>“Your Nana didn’t like it, and she made some threats. So Agatha broke things off and married your dad to make her happy, to keep me safe.”</p><p>“That’s so depressing.” Nicky looked down at his mug.</p><p>Rio nodded. “At least she got you out of the deal.”</p><p>“Did you ever stop?”</p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p>“Being in love with her.”</p><p>“Uhh, I thought I did.” She ran her thumb over the side of the mug, clutching it to her chest. “But, no. I think I left here loving her and came back just the same.”</p><p>“Then I’m happy she has you now.” Nicky said and took a sip of his coffee. “Oh, it’s so bitter.” He scrunched his face. “Could you hand me the creamer?”</p><p>Rio grinned and opened the fridge. “What’s that about you not being four?”</p><p>“People of all ages use creamer.” He took the bottle from her and opened it. “There’s also oat milk in there. It showed up randomly the weekend after last and we don’t drink it, so I'm assuming that it’s for you.”</p><p>“Your mom is such a stupid softie.” She said and added it to her coffee.</p><p>“Believe me, I know.”</p><p>She spent the whole morning talking in the kitchen with Nicky, the only indication of time being passed by was the sun rising through the massive windows along the wall. Around seven, she realized it was a school day and that the world had not stopped even if it felt like it had last night.</p><p>“Shit, you’ve got school.”</p><p>“Do I have to go? I’d rather just stay here with you guys.”</p><p>“We’re swinging by my house to check out the damage, you wanna be there for that?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Yeah. If that’s okay with you.”</p><p>“Hand me my phone.” And maybe it was overstepping, but she was pretty sure Agatha would agree that Nicky should stay home today. She dialed the school and gave her best Agatha impression. “Hi, my name is Agatha Harkness, and I’m just calling to let you know that my son, Nicholas Scratch, won’t be in attendance today. We’ve had a death in the family.” The secretary acknowledged the absence and gave her condolences. “Thanks, doll.” And hung up.</p><p>“Doll?” Nicky furrowed his brows.</p><p>“I don’t know! Felt right.”</p><p>“Why does your impression of my mom just sound like a caricature of a rich person?”</p><p>“If the shoe fits…”</p><p>Around nine, Agatha finally descended the stairs, arm still wrapped and head bruised with stitches.</p><p>Her and Nicky were on the couch, news on in the background. “How are you feeling, my love?”</p><p>She yawned. “Like I got whacked in the head.” And sat down next to Rio.</p><p>“How’s your arm?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“Fractured.” She deadpanned. “How’d you get called out of school?”</p><p>“Rio called.”</p><p>Agatha sunk into Rio’s side. “Thank you.”</p><p>She was about to respond when the CNN graphic they’d been waiting for all morning finally popped up.</p><p>It had b-roll of Evanora getting escorted off the tarmac in handcuffs, presumably screaming at the officers.</p><p>‘Millionaire CEO arrested for embezzlement, fraud, and insider trading’ The graphic said.</p><p>“And that’s only half the shit.” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“I don’t think arson and assault are as flashy, baby.”</p><p>The anchor spoke in the background. “Evanora Harkness, CEO of Harkness Inc., has been arrested on suspicion of embezzlement, fraud, and insider trading. The discovery comes after a call police received from the house of Evanora’s daughter, Agatha Harkness. Details have not been released as of right now, however we can expect a statement from the family and company soon. Harkness Inc., a development company, was founded in-”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“How about we all get dressed and see what remains of my childhood home, shall we?” She turned off the tv and got up, helping Agatha and walking down the hall, Nicky following behind.</p><p>Nicky stopped at one of the windows. “Hey guys?”</p><p>Rio and Agatha turned around.</p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>They both approached the window, looking at what Nicky saw.</p><p>Seemingly hundreds of news vans cluttered the street outside Agatha’s home.</p><p>“When I thought about how good the public humiliation would feel, I did not consider this.” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Fuuuuuuuck.” Agatha groaned. “Where’s my phone?” She said and walked upstairs. “I have like fifty missed calls and over ninety unread texts!” She called down.</p><p>“Yikes.” Nicky whispered.</p><p>“Is her getting arrested really this big a deal?” Rio whispered back.</p><p>“Nana summers in the Hamptons with the Starks on a compound next to the Kennedy’s.” He deadpanned. “...so, yeah.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Fucking rich people.”</p><p>After Agatha called the cops and the street was cleared, all three of them got dressed and climbed in Agatha’s car to drive to Rio’s. Or what was left of Rio’s.</p><p>When they pulled up, Rio could barely make out the actual shape of the home. It was still standing, but the once bright yellow siding was now black from the smoke. The roof was caved in, Rio had been there for that part, but seeing it all now, basically reduced to rubble, was too much.</p><p>She stood on the sidewalk, trying not to collapse like she did last night, trying not to blubber at the destruction of her and her mom’s life together.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha uttered in shock.</p><p>“It’s-” Rio choked on the words, eyes glazing over with tears.</p><p>She felt her girlfriend wrap her uninjured arm around her waist. “Hey, there could still be something left. Your studio looks alright.”</p><p>The detached garage had some charring on the side closest to the house itself, but other than that, it remained pretty unaffected.</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio replied softly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio.” Nicky tried to comfort.</p><p>“Thanks, kid.” She said and started walking towards the front door, or more accurately the crispy piece of wood that was once the front door. The firefighters assured her that it was safe to go in as long as they watched their footing.</p><p>The living room was toast, those floral couches her mom had thrifted from Goodwill before Rio was even born were blackened, she couldn’t even make out the shape of the flowers. The beige carpet was singed and the floor beneath them didn’t feel as sturdy as she once remembered. Going down the hall towards her room, the family photos that once adorned the wall were unrecognizable, the wood paneling had melted off the walls. She got to her room and-</p><p>It didn’t look like her room.</p><p>Looked like one of those over-the-top show rooms in a haunted house, everything shriveled and burnt. The bed with her several thousand quilts, all made by her mom, was decimated. If she didn’t know this room like the back of her hand, she wouldn’t have been able to tell what everything once was. What color things used to be, what shapes objects used to hold.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio realized that she had zoned out, standing dead still in the middle of her room for at least a few minutes, not saying a word.</p><p>“That’s where your mom used to climb in my room almost every night.” She pointed to the window and looked at Nicky with a sad smile.</p><p>“Mom, you rebel.” He quipped, seemingly interested, or at least nice enough to play along.</p><p>Agatha raised her hand in defense. “I did a lot of things back then that I wouldn’t now.”</p><p>“You climbed through that thing like two months ago.”</p><p>“Snitch.” Her girlfriend grumbled.</p><p>Rio looked over every inch of the space, trying to see if anything was salvageable. She turned to her bookcase, on the top shelf still sat Agatha’s crown, not completely melted, but slightly deformed.</p><p>“How the hell did this make it?” Rio reached up and snatched it off the shelf.</p><p>“You kept that?” Agatha looked down at the crown.</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“What…what is it?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“My crown.” His mom answered.</p><p>“You have like three of those at home.” He spoke.</p><p>“She gave this one to me under the bleachers the night of senior ball.” She ran her hand over the thin piece of metal, cheap little jewels that once sparkled now clouded over with soot. “It was the only thing I had that was ever once hers.”</p><p>Agatha wiped a rogue tear off her face. “Do you want to go see your mom’s room?”</p><p>She nodded, crown still clutched with trembling fingers, and took off down the end of the hall where Victoria’s bedroom was located. She took a deep breath and steeled herself. When she pushed open the door, she realized that nothing would steel her enough for this.</p><p>Her mom’s room always had this rosy glow about it. Pink walls, light wood tones, handmade pink and orange quilt slung over the bed with a coordinating knit blanket. She remembers sitting at the vanity in the corner as a little kid, her mom pretending to do her makeup. She remembers climbing into bed with her mom after nightmares. She remembers nights they spent talking in this room, laughing, occasionally fighting whenever Rio got a bad grade, or was just generally an asshole.</p><p>In her mind’s eye, she still saw that room and those memories on a loop.</p><p>Because there was nothing left now.</p><p>Those memories, her mom’s things-</p><p>Reduced to ashes.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand on her back, gently rubbing soothing circles. “Nicky, could you run this to the car?” She took the crown from Rio’s hands and gave it to her son. Once Nicky was out of the room Rio left herself crumble, turning in Agatha’s embrace and weeping into her girlfriend's shoulder. She hadn’t really let herself cry since last night, and hadn't wanted to feel the gravity of it all.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, baby. I’m so, so sorry.” Agatha said as she let Rio break in her arms.</p><p>She was trying to respond through the sobs when she turned her head and saw a little glimmer of light reflecting off of something. Rio walked over to the source, it was something in her mom’s half-incinerated nightstand, peeking through the drawer. She pulled it open, the drawer giving way entirely due to it having no structural integrity left.</p><p>Her mom’s jewelry box. It was vintage and made of carved metal from the 60’s. It had belonged to Victoria’s mom and was one of the few things that made it in the move from Puerto Rico to the states. Her mom always said it was one of her most prized possessions, that she wanted Rio to have it and pass it down to her daughter and so on and so on.</p><p>Rio ran her hand over the box, thumb following the intricately carved vines and flowers adorning the sides. When she undid the latch and opened it, the jewelry inside was safe, as if Victoria was still alive and had just thrown her hoops in for the night before she went to bed.</p><p>She closed the box and tucked it under her arm. “Studio?” She asked through a sniffle.</p><p>Agatha agreed, following Rio out.</p><p>The kitchen was useless, that’s where the majority of the roof had caved in, leaving wooden beams and shingles strewn about.</p><p>When they got to the studio, Nicky was already there, filing through the old paintings and drawings Rio had from high school.</p><p>“Sorry, I just figured you guys needed some time alone.” He said putting down the decades old work like he was in trouble.</p><p>“It’s okay, mijo.” Rio assured, voice still shaky. “God knows I haven’t touched them in years.”</p><p>“We can take as much as you want.” Agatha told her, referring to all the stuff in the garage.</p><p>“Agatha, that’s a lot of clutter to bring to your place.”</p><p>“It’s not clutter.” She resolutely stated and joined Nicky in going through Rio’s old artworks.</p><p>“Is this mom?” Nicky asked and held up an old charcoal drawing Rio did in between graduation and college.</p><p>It was a portrait, one Rio’s heartbroken eighteen year old brain did from memory. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“You really captured my aura and timeless beauty.” Agatha joked, looking at the paper.</p><p>They spent the rest of the afternoon going through the studio, combing through it and boxing up anything Rio wanted to take. Mostly old prints, or photos. Luckily there were a few family photo albums left in here because Victoria had made so many that they overflowed out of the kitchen where they were normally kept.</p><p>Nicky was quite honestly just used as manual labor, running boxes from the house to the car since Agatha only had one good arm and Rio was still on the verge of tears.</p><p>Rio plucked the handmade quilt off the back of the couch and roamed her eyes over the space one more time. “I think that’s it.”</p><p>“What about your camera?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Had that at school with me, it’s still in the box of my shit in my backseat.”</p><p>“Can we get food?” Nicky grumbled.</p><p>“Well, it’s two in the afternoon and seeing as nobody’s fed you yet today, yeah I think that’s a great idea.” Rio smiled and fished the car keys from her pocket.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. “Can I drive?”</p><p>“I’m not letting you do donuts with my family’s heirlooms in the back.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t do donuts!” He defended. “Not with parents in the car…”</p><p>“Ah, just what a mother to a teenager wants to hear.” Agatha sassed as she started walking out of the garage.</p><p>The night was spent with Agatha feverishly returning calls, emails, and drafting statements. Rio had to drag her away from the kitchen table where she had sprawled out all of her work to get her to come to bed. It did not slip past Rio that Agatha was not using the office, and she couldn’t blame her. Rio’s bloodied sweater was still in there, as was the folder, as was the fucking trauma of last night.</p><p>“I got a call from the superintendent while you were talking to CNN.” Rio called from the bathroom, spitting out the last of her toothpaste and coming to bed.</p><p>“What’d he say?” She asked while lotioning her hands.</p><p>“He offered me my job back.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrow. “And?”</p><p>“I told him I wouldn’t come back without a disgusting pay bump or I would sue the administration for wrongful termination and go to the press.” She smirked.</p><p>“Good, make those fuckers pay.”</p><p>“Apparently Sharon took early retirement…”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Did she now?”</p><p>“So I also get a say in whoever the next principal is…”</p><p>“Sounds like you already know who you want that to be.”</p><p>“I have an idea, yes.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over and gave her a quick kiss. “I was thinking,”</p><p>“That’s never good.”</p><p>“Shut up. I was thinking that we should do that tour of NYU you talked about doing with Nicky.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“We could leave Friday morning, take the train, stay the weekend.” She brought a hand to rest on Rio’s arm. “Get away for a little bit? I think we could all use some time not dealing with everything.”</p><p>“Family vacation?” Rio quipped.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t seem to find it funny. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Okay.” She agreed, trying to act normal about the fact that Agatha didn’t see them being a family as a joke.</p><p>“I’ll start looking at hotels.” Agatha pulled out her phone.</p><p>“Not to sound crass, but-”</p><p>“Yes, my love, I’ll get us a room far from Nicky.”</p><p>“That reminds me, I owe the kid a pair of headphones.”</p>

<p>“Is Rio moving in with us?” Her son asked as they swayed in the train car from Westview to Manhattan. She looked up from where she’d been clacking away on her laptop, then looked at Rio next to her.</p><p>They hadn’t discussed it, didn’t really come up. The past three days had been so hectic with work and journalists and the company taking a nosedive in the stock market, they’d barely come up for air. She wasn’t necessarily back to work, but she also didn’t have much of a choice when it came to dealing with the fallout.</p><p>Her head was mostly clear of bruising, now just a little coloring right by her hairline which was easy enough to cover with her hair. Her arm was still wrapped, but again, easy enough to cover with long sleeves. The most annoying part was her dominant hand being almost useless, she was able to grab basic things and type at a fucking snails pace, but it also left her a little lacking with other activities. Activities she and Rio had not done in almost a week despite the fact that she was now sharing a bed with the woman.</p><p>Maybe it was the surviving a traumatic incident, maybe it was the fact that Rio was still grieving, maybe it was her girlfriend being scared she’d hurt an already injured Agatha and not in the fun way,  maybe it was Nicky being around 24/7. Either way, Agatha was not leaving New York without getting laid.</p><p>“Ummm,” Rio looked back at her with wide eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, well-” Agatha searched for the words. “I mean-”</p><p>“I can look for other places,” Rio added to Agatha’s non-answer.</p><p>“No!” She interjected. Her and Nicky both just stared. “No, no, you don’t have to do that. We have more than enough room.”</p><p>She liked having Rio there every night and each morning, it didn't matter that they’d only been together for three weeks.</p><p>“She sleeps in your room every night.” He pointed out.</p><p>“Exactly, so it’s no trouble for her to stay.” Agatha glared at him.</p><p>“Do you not want me there?” Rio softly asked Nicky.</p><p>“Oh it’s not that, I was just gonna ask if I could catch a ride with you to school in the mornings once you’re back at work. But I didn’t want to assume…”</p><p>Rio sighed with relief. “Yeah, yeah I can drive you.”</p><p>“Cool.” Nicky nodded.</p><p>Agatha smiled and leaned over to whisper to her girlfriend. “How domestic of you.”</p><p>“Do your business.” Rio smirked and motioned to the laptop.</p><p>After an hour and a half train ride spent with Agatha fielding interview requests, and Rio teaching Nicky how to play poker, they arrived at Grand Central Station. They stopped by the hotel first to drop off their bags, where she collected the keycards from the front desk before handing them off.</p><p>She gave one to Nicky. “Junior suite, third floor, I will notice if you drink any booze from the minibar.”</p><p>“That was one time.” He grumbled.</p><p>Her son might be a good kid, but he was still a dumb teenager.</p><p>She then handed a spare keycard to Rio and kept one for herself.</p><p>“‘Manhattan King Suite’?” Rio read off the name of the room. “Was the Ritz-Carlton all booked up?”</p><p>“Yes, actually.” Agatha grinned. “Hence, the fallback.” And motioned around the lobby.</p><p>“It’s The Four Seasons, mi amor. You’re acting like it’s a Motel 6. You could’ve just gotten two Junior suites.”</p><p>“Meet back here in half an hour?” Agatha asked her son.</p><p>Nicky did a little salute and walked off towards the elevators.</p><p>She looked back at her girlfriend. “It was the only room with a deep soak tub and jacuzzi jets.”</p><p>Her face flushed, “On second thought, I love the room, let’s go to it now.” And yanked Agatha along by her good arm.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they left the hotel with Nicky and arrived at the NYU campus in Greenwich Village.</p><p>“Okay, kid,” Rio started. “Welcome to one of the most pretentious places on earth.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her son who was darting his gaze around the numerous high-rises with small purple flags waving the school’s emblem with stars in his eyes.</p><p>“There’s technically no real campus, but all of the buildings are close enough together.” Her girlfriend started walking through Washington Square Park, pointing out different things along the way.</p><p>She let Rio and Nicky lead, happily trailing behind.</p><p>“-And never eat any food from the NYU dining hall after nine pm, it's staffed by students and they're all high by then. That’s how I got food poisoning sophomore year.” She warned after talking for about forty-five minutes, only interrupted by Nicky’s questions or his gawking. She led them into one of the high-rises, “Photography is only a minor here, I doubled it with a fine arts degree, but they have a great film program.”</p><p>“I know, I have the webpage bookmarked.” He proudly responded, craning his neck around.</p><p>They turned a corner until they were outside a lecture hall.</p><p>“I figured you’d want to talk to some of the professors, this one might be an arrogant prick but she’s unfortunately very good at her job.” Rio grumbled outside the double doors.</p><p>Agatha looked at the plaque displaying the professor’s name.</p><p>No, no, no-</p><p>She didn’t think she’d still be a fucking professor here, it’s been seventeen years, why the fuck was she still employed at the same university?</p><p>Rio reached for the handle.</p><p>“Wait.” Agatha rushed to stop Rio.</p><p>“What?” Her girlfriend scrunched her face.</p><p>“Just, uh- we probably shouldn’t go in if there's a class going on.” She hurried out.</p><p>The last thing she needed was to explain to Rio how she most definitely stalked her back in 2008 because that fucking woman recognized her.</p><p>“It’s over in like one minute,” Rio said, pointing to the clock in the hall. “I’m sure we’ll be fine.” And opened the door, waving both Agatha and Nicky in.</p><p>Her son looked so excited and happy to see an actual college class, to talk to a possible future teacher. Maybe she wouldn’t recognize Agatha, maybe she’s forgotten. Maybe she’d be nice enough to not say anything, maybe Agatha could fling herself from this high-rise and save herself the embarrassment.</p><p>She idly found herself wondering if this was the very lecture hall Rio mentioned having sex in back at the bar. Must’ve been, right?</p><p>“-And don’t forget, midterms are coming up and I will not be gracious about late work.” The familiar accented voice shouted to the room of hundreds of twenty-somethings. “That wraps up our time for today.” Arctic blue eyes flickered to the back of the hall, raking over Rio, and Agatha tried not to grind her teeth. Hela smirked, “I’ll see you all on Monday.”</p><p>Students filed out and Rio grabbed Nicky, pushing past the bodies down the steps of the hall until she met Hela at the front. Agatha leisurely followed behind, not wanting the woman to pay too much attention to her.</p><p>“Rio, long time no see.” She said, disconnecting her laptop from the projector and sliding it into her bag.</p><p>“Hela.” Rio breathed out.</p><p>“You look good.” The professor smiled.</p><p>Agatha was not a violent person, she wasn’t, but jesus fucking christ this bitch was bold.</p><p>“You look older.” Her girlfriend spoke in her fake-nice voice.</p><p>“I got tenure.” She said, as if that was the reason she aged.</p><p>“That’s…good for you.” Rio tugged Nicky closer. “This is a student of mine, Nicholas, and his mom, Agatha.”</p><p>His mom? Not her girlfriend? She pursed her lips to stop the string of very inappropriate words she wanted to scream.</p><p>“Student? I wasn’t aware you were teaching. What university?” Hela assumed.</p><p>Rio smiled, but not her actual one. “Not college, high school, back home in Westview.”</p><p>“Public school?” She scoffed.</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “Anyways, Nicky here is interested in applying. I was hoping you could do an alum a favor and talk to him about the photography program.”</p><p>“Well, you were my favorite.” She winked.</p><p>Fuck her, fuck her fucking plaid blazer and tailored pants, fuck her chiseled cheekbones and infinite knowledge on something Agatha couldn’t relate to. She crossed her arms and bit her tongue. Why the hell would Rio bring her here?</p><p>“I’m only a junior but this place is at the top of my list.” Her poor, oblivious son beamed.</p><p>Oh, that would be why. Rio was setting everything else aside for Nicky’s sake.</p><p>“Well how could it not be?” Hela responded to him and slid her eyes over to Agatha for the first time since they walked in. She looked her up and down as if she was trying to place her. “Have we met?”</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha breezily lied.</p><p>Drop it, drop it, drop it-</p><p>“You look so familiar.”</p><p>Eat shit and die, god, this woman-</p><p>Agatha shook her head and politely smiled. “I get that a lot, one of those faces, ya know?”</p><p>Hela cocked her head. “No, it’s not that. You are gorgeous though.”</p><p>Did this woman just fuck anything that moved?</p><p>“Anyways-” Rio interjected. “Got a minute to talk with Nicky?” She emphasized his name.</p><p>“Yeah of course, should we do lunch? I’m done with classes for the day.”</p><p>“Oh that's not necessary-” Her girlfriend dismissed.</p><p>“Nonsense. Anything for my favorite…student.”</p><p>“That’d be great!” Nicky said.</p><p>Oh, how she loved and despised her own son at this moment.</p><p>“There’s a lovely little bistro across the street,” Hela slung her bag over her shoulder. “We can walk there together.”</p><p>So, lunch with her kid, her girlfriend, and her girlfriend’s ex slash professor-</p><p>And her girlfriend didn’t know that she knew that Hela was her ex-</p><p>And that her ex did, in fact, recognize her-</p><p>“Great.” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“Perfect!” The professor started walking, sidling up next to Rio. “We can catch up, maybe I can convince you to move back.”</p><p>“Not likely.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>They started walking out the building, “Rio, we both know the suburbs were never your pace.”</p><p>“Did we both know that?” Rio raised her eyebrows, glancing back at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha gave a soft smile and followed a few steps behind with Nicky.</p><p>“Is it just me, or is she flirting with Rio?” Her son whispered in her ear.</p><p>“Not just you.” She whispered back.</p><p>“I understand the need for a paycheck, but your talent is wasted in a tiny town like that.” Hela kept fucking talking, looping her arm through Rio’s. “With all the minivans and the soccer moms…”</p><p>And underneath the anger Agatha felt in this moment was a deep well of guilt. She knew Westview was too small and insignificant for Rio’s ambitions, for her talent, and it might not be her fault that Rio came back but it was sure as hell her fault that Rio was staying.</p><p>“Oh Hela, how I have not missed your company.” Rio laughed, passing it off as a joke, trying and failing to break her arm free from Hela’s grasp.</p><p>“Last I heard, you were getting steady work, I saw a few of your shots in Harper’s Bazaar.”</p><p>Why was she keeping track of Rio’s work?</p><p>Shit, why hadn’t Agatha?</p><p>“I was the photographer’s assistant on that shoot, amongst every other shoot. It was hardly steady.”</p><p>“There’s just something to be said about the starving artist.”</p><p>“Says the woman who makes six-figures.”</p><p>Hela laughed, it was throaty and rich and sounded like fucking music. “That stuff was too commercial for you anyways, you were always above it all.”</p><p>“I was young and pretentious, you don’t need to sugar coat it.”</p><p>They arrived at the restaurant and Hela opened the door for Rio. “We were both young.”</p><p>“But I was the only immature one, right?” Rio said, tone indicating to Agatha that it was meant to be a dig.</p><p>Hela held the door for Nicky and Agatha before following. “Sweetheart, leave the past in the past.”</p><p>Sweetheart?</p><p>Agatha felt a warm sensation throughout her body, something like unadulterated fucking rage.</p><p>They were seated quickly at a round table, Agatha sat between Rio and Nicky, Hela across from her. She did not like that it meant that Hela was still right next to her girlfriend though.</p><p>Rio was wearing jeans and this tight green cardigan with a slightly plunging neckline, nothing scandalous but Agatha had stared at her tits several times already today, sue her. However when she saw the professor’s eyes follow the same path of Rio’s sternum, and down to her cleavage, Agatha wondered how easy it was to buy a gun. Couldn’t be that hard, right? It’s America, she could probably buy one for almost nothing and come back here and pull the fucking-</p><p>“So, Nicholas,” Hela started. “Tell me about your work, what do you like? What’s your niche?”</p><p>She took a calming breath. Killing your significant other’s ex is not what well-adjusted people do.</p><p>He looked at Rio and she gave him a little nod, a little signal of comfort. Apparently that’s all he needed. “Well, right now I’m really focused on film. Miss Vidal is an awesome teacher so it makes it pretty easy to get into. I’ve also shot digital but I kind of like having to work for the final product, you know?”</p><p>“Do I ever, film is a lost artform, now everyone wants the instant gratification of shooting digital.” Hela replied.</p><p>Over lunch, Agatha tried to keep up, laughing when they did or nodding along, but for the most part she had not a fucking clue what they were talking about. The other three were talking about photography like it was basic knowledge that every human had, and she was the dumb one. It didn’t matter though, Nicky was happy, and she wasn’t going to fault him for it.</p><p>After another round of laughter, Hela looked at Agatha. “Do you shoot?”</p><p>She smiled. “God no, I don’t even know how he does it, I don’t have an artistic bone in my body.”</p><p>“Well, it’s not for everyone.” Hela dismissed.</p><p>If only she had two working hands, she could strangle her.</p><p>“It really is driving me crazy, though.” The professor kept her eyes on Agatha. “Where have we met before?”</p><p>Rio chimed in. “Probably nowhere, you two don’t really run in the same circles.”</p><p>“Did you ever donate to the university? One of those benefit galas?” Hela continued.</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha said and picked at the food she’d barely touched with her fork.</p><p>“Ever go to Covenstead in Brooklyn?”</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “What’s Covenstead?”</p><p>“Gay bar.” Rio supplied.</p><p>“It’s eating me alive!” Hela chuckled.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Maybe you’ve seen me on the news recently?”</p><p>“No, it’s not that…” Hela tutted. “Ever attended one of my showcases?”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“They’re not your showcases, Hela. They’re the university’s.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“That’s what it is!” Hela threw her hands up and snapped her fingers. “2008! You were there, I was trying to hit you up for a donation and you fled by the time I got back.”</p><p>Rio looked at her. “2008?”</p><p>“You said you were getting married the next day, I remember because I’m pretty sure that was the biggest diamond I’ve ever seen in my life.”</p><p>Agatha avoided her girlfriend’s gaze. “Well-”</p><p>“How are you and your husband doing?” Hela smiled.</p><p>“Divorced.” Agatha gritted out.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry.” She made a ‘yikes’ face as she said it.</p><p>Agatha swallowed her frustration. “Don’t be.”</p><p>“You were looking at Rio’s work funnily enough.” The professor pointed out.</p><p>“Small world, huh?” Rio was still looking at her like pissed wife looks at her husband who just fucked up.</p><p>“Microscopic.” Agatha hummed.</p><p>When lunch was over they hailed a cab, Hela hung back to say goodbye to Rio. Agatha saw her hand Rio a slip of paper before walking off. And just like that, she was twenty-one, standing at a gallery warehouse in Brooklyn, about to marry a man and watching the love of her life be admired by that fucking professor.</p><p>She shook the memory from her head, but couldn’t shake the guilt. What the fuck was she doing keeping Rio in Westview? Domesticating her? Having her haul Nicky to school everyday? Making her make coffee and fix the sconce in the hallway? What did Rio get out of that? What could Agatha give her?</p><p>The ride back to the hotel was dead silent. Nicky, the unlucky bastard, was sandwiched in between them in the backseat. He didn’t say anything though, he was smart enough not to.</p><p>They got to the hotel and Nicky hastily excused himself, basically fucking sprinting to the elevators. Agatha and Rio caught another one, and again, dead silence.</p><p>As soon as the door to their room closed, Rio went off.</p><p>“2008?!”</p><p>“I was there for less than twenty minutes-”</p><p>Rio cut her off. “I don’t care if you were only there for five, why didn’t you tell me? Find me? Talk to me?”</p><p>“I couldn’t! You know I couldn’t!”</p><p>“So why were you there?”</p><p>“To see you one last time before I made the biggest mistake of my life! Before I- I just wanted to see you.” her voice broke.</p><p>“And did you?”</p><p>“Did I what?”</p><p>Rio huffed in frustration. “Fucking see me!”</p><p>“...Yeah.”</p><p>“Were you ever going to tell me?”</p><p>“Honestly, probably not.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because it wouldn’t change things! It wouldn’t change the fact that our lives went the way they did. It wouldn’t change the fact that I would’ve held you back,” She pushed the words out against her body’s wishes. “And that maybe I still am.”</p><p>Rio’s face dropped. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“What are you doing with me in Westview, Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha,”</p><p>“I stayed away from you all those years so you could do amazing things, and now…now you’re a teacher and live in a cul-de-sac with a white picket fence. You should be somewhere great with people like Hela, creating things and changing the world.”</p><p>“Those things don’t matter to me.” Rio quietly spoke.</p><p>“Really?” Agatha defaulted to the offensive. “Then why didn’t you tell her we were together? She was flirting with you all day-”</p><p>“Yeah and I shut it down every time!”</p><p>“What’d she give you outside the restaurant?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I saw her give you a fucking piece of paper, what was it?!”</p><p>“It was her number and I threw it away before I even got into the fucking cab, Agatha!”</p><p>“Maybe you should’ve kept it.”</p><p>“What is this? What are you talking about right now?”</p><p>“Just-” She sniffled, blinking away the tears. “Maybe you deserve more than some soccer mom.”</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio tried stepping closer but it only sent Agatha further away.</p><p>“I’m gonna,” Her voice was so small, so weak. “I’m gonna take a minute to cool off.”</p><p>“Agatha, you’re not fucking running from me right now!”</p><p>She grabbed the keycard, she needed out of here. The weight of everything she just said was suffocating. “I’m not running, I’ll come back.”</p><p>She absolutely was running, however, her legs only took her as far as the hotel bar, for which she was definitely underdressed in her boots, jeans, a black sweater. She was on her second martini by four in the afternoon, and had already been hit on by two men who were old enough to be her father.</p><p>She twirled the stem of the glass as she drank, pondering the many, many missteps of her life. This being one of them.</p><p>She finally had everything she wanted and she had to go and fucking ruin it. She had to let that little voice her mother implanted in her head decades ago out to play, didn’t she? God, and she hurt Rio all to, what, protect her? It’s the same thing she said to herself twenty years ago. Maybe that day under the bleachers wasn't an act like she thought, maybe that’s who Agatha is. Maybe Evanora got that much right-</p><p>Born evil.</p><p>If she got back to the room and didn't find Rio there, Agatha wouldn’t blame her. Between the years of pain, and the loss of her house, and now Agatha acting like an insane jealous girlfriend, who would fucking stay? Who’d want to deal with all of it just to get Agatha in return?</p><p>If Agatha saw herself in a bar, she wouldn’t deal with her.</p><p>“All alone?” She heard a low voice whisper entirely too close for comfort.</p><p>“I will shove my boot so far up your ass, you’ll taste leather for a fucking week-” But when she turned to see who the son of a bitch was this time, she was met with warm brown eyes, little gold flecks throughout.</p><p>“Please, keep going, I could be into that.” She smirked and sat on the stool next to Agatha.</p><p>“Sorry, I thought you were a pervert.”</p><p>“I am, but you seem to like that about me.” She flagged down the bartender and ordered them two more drinks.</p><p>“You’re still here.”</p><p>“I’m not eighteen anymore, baby. You’re going to have to try harder than that.”</p><p>“Why? I was such a bitch.”</p><p>“You were, but I seem to like that about you.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Why are you so patient with me?”</p><p>They got their drinks and Rio took a sip. “My mom once said that people with great expectations placed on them are usually the most insecure.”</p><p>“Are you calling me insecure?” She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“I’m saying you can act insecure and I get why, I do. But you can’t pull a hit and run every time you feel that way.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I just spiraled and it got away from me.”</p><p>“I know, but that’s when you tell me you’re spiraling and we talk like two adults in a relationship.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and let Rio grab her hand.</p><p>“I don’t want Hela, or to change the world. I just want you.”</p><p>“But the amazing things-”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio looked at her with so much longing. “The most amazing thing I could ever do or have done, is love you.”</p><p>And her eyes felt wet again. “Why?”</p><p>“A long time ago, I loved someone, and they had to do something they did not want to do, and ever since-” Rio’s voice wavered.</p><p>“Ever since, I couldn’t stop loving them. I looked for her in every relationship, in every corner of my life, and I kept myself away because it hurt. It hurt losing someone like that. Someone who’d sacrifice herself before seeing me suffer. Someone who’s kind, and caring, and empathetic. Someone who might not see it, but who’s good despite everything.” A tear fell down Rio’s cheek and Agatha wiped it away. “Someone who’s good, period.”</p><p>Agatha really wanted to believe her, but that little fucking voice in her head-</p><p>She continued, “And for that love to never dissipate or waver in two decades?  That…that seems pretty amazing to me.”</p><p>“I don’t think I deserve that much credit.”</p><p>“I didn’t say it was you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Was it Hela?”</p><p>“God no, that bitch kicked me to the curb while I was still naked in her bed. She just wanted an easy lay. Probably still does.”</p><p>“I know I’ve only got the one good arm, but I could still murder her.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “And just so you know, I didn’t tell her about us because I didn’t want her to take it out on Nicky if he ends up there.”</p><p>“So you see yourself sticking around until Nicky’s in college?”</p><p>“You owe me a kid, I’m sticking around forever.” She smiled and took another sip.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Agatha smiled back. “Wanna go back to the room and practice?”</p><p>Rio threw back the rest of the martini. “Vamos!”</p><p>She hastily threw some cash down on the bar, far too much, but as Rio was dragging her away, she didn’t care.</p><p>Three minutes later, she found herself pushed against the door of their room before it had even shut all the way. Rio fisted her hands into the root of Agatha’s hair and pulled her forward without caution.</p><p>She moaned into the kiss, letting Rio slip her tongue in and devour her. She tried leaning farther in but Rio’s hips pushed her back, pinning her with nowhere to go. If it were two hours ago, Agatha might’ve fought back, shoved Rio down and fucked her senseless out of rabid jealously, needing to stake her claim. But now, now she just wanted to feel how much Rio wanted her, she wanted to turn off her brain and let Rio handle everything. She never got to do that with anyone else, never trusted anyone enough.</p><p>She brought her hands to tug at Rio’s hips, but her girlfriend quickly removed them and harshly pinned her good wrist to the door and threaded her fingers through Agatha’s and lightly pinned her bad arm. The care did not go unnoticed.</p><p>She ran her lips down Agatha’s throat before her gravely voice asked, “What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha’s mind buffered, was it not obvious what she wanted by the way she was letting Rio manhandle her? She looked into eyes that were no longer that warm brown, instead nearly all black. Like the pupil was black ink spilling into the iris.</p><p>“I-” She swallowed. “I want you.”</p><p>That fucking smug grin appeared. “How?”</p><p>She canted her hips forward as much as Rio would let her, trying to show rather than tell.</p><p>“Use your words.” Rio chided, the irony was not lost on her that the last time they fucked, it had been Agatha saying that.</p><p>Agatha just stared, breathless and pinned. Why the fuck could she not get the words out? Why was this suddenly so hard?</p><p>If she were a betting man, she’d guess the vulnerability.</p><p>Rio took mercy on her, well to some extent. “How about I go first and then you can tell me what you think?” And released her hands from Agatha before dropping to the zipper of her jeans, deftly undoing them.</p><p>She nodded as she felt fingers slide underneath the waistband of her underwear. “I wanna put on the strap,”</p><p>And she moaned and tilted her head back when she felt the softest graze of the pad of Rio’s middle finger against her clit.</p><p>“I wanna make you come until you can’t take it anymore, until you beg me to stop, until I fucking break you.”</p><p>She shuddered at the thought, and the way Rio added more pressure as though it were punctuation to her fucking sentence.</p><p>“I wanna come inside you so many times that you’re actually knocked up.”</p><p>Agatha moaned louder at the thought, the completely impossible thought that was not helping how wet she was in this moment. She hadn’t been touched in five days, and had been horny for the last three, she’d been ready since the moment the door shut but Rio’s list was not helping. Two fingers ran through her slit before teasing, only dipping into the first knuckle.</p><p>“I wanna see how well you take it.” Rio finished and sunk her fingers the rest of the way.</p><p>Her head was still resting gingerly against the door. “Rio-”</p><p>“How does that sound?” And lazily started pumping.</p><p>She was sure her legs were about to give out, they’d barely started and she was already putty.</p><p>“Yes.” She moaned, more at the words and images swimming in her brain than the actual fingers  inside of her.</p><p>Rio stopped, ignoring the resulting whine. “Your turn.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her chin back down to look at her girlfriend. “I just-” She breathed out. “I just wanna be good for you.”</p><p>And Rio’s face didn’t change, not with judgement or disdain, it was still etched with lust, with unending desire. But there was also a flicker of understanding somewhere in her expression. Like Rio knew that by saying that, admitting in this moment she needed that, went deeper than just sex. Deeper than their relationship. It went all the way to the core of who Agatha was, who she’d been led to believe she was.</p><p>She pulled her hand out of Agatha’s jeans completely before hoisting her up, prompting Agatha to wrap her legs around Rio’s waist. She walked them over to the lush king-sized bed and safely laid her down.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio standing over her. “You're always good for me.”</p><p>That little voice always seemed to quiet whenever Rio said that.</p><p>Externally she preened, smiling at Rio like she hung the moon and the stars, like-</p><p>Like she was in love.</p><p>But internally, she worried she ruined the moment, like Rio felt obligated to be gentle now.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want gentle.</p><p>But her fears were assuaged the second Rio’s self control seemed to snap on a dime and she yanked Agatha by her legs until they were dangling off the edge of the bed. She didn’t wait and was definitely not gentle as she pulled Agatha’s jeans and sweater off her body, roaming her gaze over the lingerie Agatha may or may not have worn on purpose.</p><p>Her jaw dropped as she took in Agatha in a lacy purple bra and thong contrasting against pale skin, hair haloed out on the mattress.</p><p>“So good.” She whispered and attacked the now exposed skin. Her mouth was everywhere, seeming to not be able to land on one spot to lavish. “Did you pack a turtleneck?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain was hazy and she struggled to remember something as asinine as her packing choices. “I think so, why-”</p><p>And teethed bared down on the soft skin of her throat, sucking as Rio’s hand pawed at her bra.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha whined, burying her hand into Rio’s hair and encouraging her. Her girlfriend didn't stop there, leaving a trail of bruises and marks from her neck to her sternum, finally taking off the bra and marking her tits before softly biting her left nipple. “Rio, I need you.”</p><p>She didn’t respond, just kept lavishing Agatha’s body with her tongue, lavishing kisses at some spots, hickies at others. She was on a mission to run her lips, teeth, or tongue over every square inch of free space available. She wasn’t gentle, but methodical in her worship.</p><p>“Mi amor, you’re so fucking perfect.”</p><p>By the time she finally reached her thong, Agatha was desperate. “Please my love,”</p><p>Rio looked at her and backed off the bed completely, stripping her own clothes off and grabbing the harness and the familiar green strap.</p><p>She came back to Agatha on the bed, panting, strap between her legs. Apparently she was satisfied with the state she’d thrown Agatha into, because Rio’s hand flew to the thong, and when Agatha raised her hips to help, she heard fabric rip. Her eyes dropped from Rio down to the apex of her thighs where her girlfriend had carelessly ripped the lace clean off her body. Rio gave the fabric one final tug and it was gone, discarded to the floor.</p><p>“Those are La Perla.” Agatha hoarsely moaned, she mourned the expensive underwear but the way Rio’s muscles flexed as she tore them apart like they were nothing overrode the disappointment.</p><p>She grinned, “They were.” And grabbed Agatha’s thighs, spreading them and kneeling. And for one naive second, she thought Rio was actually going to do something. But instead Agatha felt nothing but more kisses and bites, her dripping cunt completely ignored.</p><p>Agatha was too fucking needy for whatever this was. “Rio, I need you to fuck me.” She barely recognized her own voice, it was so breathy.</p><p>Her girlfriend looked up from her task as though she’d forgotten the legs she was sucking on had a person attached to them. “How?”</p><p>This shit again? Fine, she’d play if it moved things along. “Inside me.”</p><p>Rio finally climbed on top of her, returning two fingers to Agatha’s pussy and pushing in. It felt good, so, so good-</p><p>But that isn’t what she wanted.</p><p>“Rio, baby, please-”</p><p>“You said inside, I’m inside.” And curled her fingers, making Agatha moan out.</p><p>She huffed out a breath of frustration, “You know what I want,” and pouted. “Please.”</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>And now she was so aroused that it almost hurt, like if she didn’t come, and hard, in the next minute she’d pass away. She was frustrated, and Rio had made certain promises that were yet to be fulfilled. Her mind screamed even though what she said came out as more of a needy whimper-</p><p>“I want your cock, I want to be filled, I want you to come inside me, I want you to get me pregnant…” She rushed out, eyes closed in embarrassment.</p><p>And she couldn’t see it, but she knew Rio was smiling victoriously, like a predator sinking its claws into its prey.</p><p>Suddenly fingers left her, and strong hands grabbed her hips and flipped Agatha over entirely. Rio’s weight left the bed all together, instead standing at the edge. She roughly yanked Agatha’s hips back with a bruising grip and lined the strap up, slowly sinking in with no resistance.</p><p>“Fuck-” Agatha graveled at the intrusion, at the stretch, at the feeling of being taken.</p><p>“Was that so hard? Good girls get what they ask for.”</p><p>Rio barely gave her any reprieve before pulling her hips back and thrusting in again, but she knew it wasn’t the full length. She knew that if this was everything, she’d have tears pricking her eyes right now.</p><p>She gripped the sheets and lifted her head ever so slightly to speak. “Fuck me like you mean it.”</p><p>And it yielded the desired outcome, Rio’s hips stuttered for a second before she snapped her hips flush with Agatha’s ass. She felt the tip of Rio’s cock go as deep as she was sure it could, before her girlfriend started thrusting wildly.</p><p>“OH-” Was all that came from her mouth as Rio started fucking her like a madman. Her grip on the sheets tightened until her knuckles were white, she buried her face into the mattress to hide the pathetic sounds falling out of her.</p><p>Rio fisted her hand in Agatha’s hair and pulled until her neck snapped back. “‘C’mon baby, I wanna hear you as you take my cock.”</p><p>With no other choice, Agatha’s lewd moans and screams seeped into the room as Rio pounded into her without mercy. Her hips snapped faster and harder on each thrust, splitting Agatha open without a care in the world. One hand bruising her hip with how tight she was clutching, and the other tangled in her hair.</p><p>Now she wished she hadn’t taunted, because those tears pricking at her eyes were now streaming down her face as Rio’s brutally fucked her. Her jaw hung open as she let out breathy little sounds and shouts.</p><p>“How’s it feel, love?” Rio teased.</p><p>She couldn't speak a coherent sentence together, let alone think of one. All she felt was Rio inside of her, the heat pooling in her stomach.</p><p>“Baby,” She muttered through tears.. “I-” And she wanted Rio to come with her. “I’m close.”</p><p>That only encouraged Rio, somehow speeding up and fucking her like a demon. She knew she’d feel it tomorrow, but as the coil inside her tightened she couldn’t even care if tomorrow never came.</p><p>The way Rio was hitting her g-spot on every go was too much and she was about to break. “Come inside me, I need you to come inside me.”</p><p>It had to come out as babbling because Agatha was pretty sure her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p>But Rio heard it, dropping her hold on Agatha’s hair and back on her hip. She felt Rio grind ever so slightly on the next thrust before tensing.</p><p>“Come for me, mi amor.” And following command, Agatha did. Her whole body wracked with pleasure as her thighs shook and her nails tore into the several thousand thread count Egyptian sheets.</p><p>She heard Rio moan out before collapsing on top of Agatha’s back, breathing as if there were no air left in her lungs, kissing along her neck and back. Rio carded her fingers through Agatha’s hair, pushing it out of her face.</p><p>“Good girl.” She murmured.</p><p>And a dopey smile made its way across her face, finally opening her eyes and seeing Rio gaze at her with nothing but love.</p><p>The next however long was spent with Rio fulfilling her promises, she threw Agatha around like a ragdoll. On her stomach on the bed, riding on the couch, up against a wall after which Rio slid her down to the floor and fucked her there too.</p><p>Currently, she had Agatha bent over the dresser which had a gigantic mirror in front of it.</p><p>She claimed, “I want you to see how fucked-out you look for me.”</p><p>And Agatha complied, looking at herself as Rio drove into her, and-</p><p>Her hair was a mess, her mascara was smudged under eyes, hickies littered all the way down her body, dried tears stained her face, and finger-shaped bruises marked her hip bones.</p><p>This woman was going to be the death of her, or the very least the complete and utter deterioration of her body. Her body was shaking as Rio went for orgasm number six, or maybe seven? Her nails bit into the expensive wood of the dresser and dragged down, leaving carved lines in her wake, like a wild animal was trying to claw its way out of a cage.</p><p>“I- I can’t,” She whined, voice broken. “Too sensitive.”</p><p>“Just one more, one more for me.” Rio soothed.</p><p>Agatha dumbly nodded and let Rio do whatever she wanted, take whatever she wanted. She’d give it all happily.</p><p>Her thrusts weren’t rapid anymore, they were deeper, slower. She had one arm around Agatha’s waist and the other was circling her clit. “Eres mía.”</p><p>Her brain was useless at this point, but it still supplied the translation seamlessly-</p><p>You’re mine.</p><p>“Yours.” She mewled, looking into Rio’s eyes through the reflection.</p><p>Rio pressed harder on the little bundle of nerves. “Mi amor, mi vida…”</p><p>My love, My life.</p><p>“Yours, yours, yours…” Agatha chanted, as it was the only thing she could think or feel.</p><p>“My good girl.”</p><p>Fuck, Agatha should be desensitized to the praise by now, but everything between her and Rio always seemed to defy logic and reason so-</p><p>“RIO-” She screamed at the top of her lungs. “GOD FUCK-” And would’ve collapsed entirely from coming if not for Rio’s arm still looped around her waist.</p><p>She momentarily saw white spots in her vision as she tried really fucking hard to breath but the orgasm seemed neverending. She felt her thighs coated in her own arousal as they tried to collapse. Rio’s body shook before relaxing, a wanton sigh leaving her girlfriend’s throat.</p><p>They stayed there for a few minutes, Agatha needed time for her soul to return to her. Rio had apparently fucked it out of her.</p><p>She wasn’t completely sure how she got on the bed, wasn’t paying attention, but she assumed with the help of Rio. She heard her girlfriend race around the room, taking off the strap, and coming back in a robe, one in hand for Agatha. Rio helped get her dressed, taking care of her without a second thought.</p><p>“How about I run us a bath in that deep soak tub, then we order room service?”</p><p>She lazily smiled. “Sounds great.”</p><p>Wait, room service? As in dinner?</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>And to be fair, Rio looked only slightly less fucked-out than Agatha. “It’s just past eight, baby.”</p><p>No, it had just been four in the afternoon.</p><p>“Lesbian sex is like a time-warp.”</p><p>She chuckled. “I’m gonna go start the bath. When your legs start working again, meet me in there, you need to pee.”</p><p>“Ugh, you sound like my wife.” She teased.</p><p>Rio disappeared into the bathroom. “I sound like someone who doesn’t want you to get a UTI.”</p><p>Agatha slowly sat up, it’s like her muscles were fifty pounds heavier than usual, and stood. She heard a knock at the door and pulled her robe tighter in case it was Nicky.</p><p>When she swung the door open, it was a woman, probably the manager and two burly guys who also looked to work for the hotel.</p><p>The manager’s eyes widened as she took in her appearance. “Good evening ma’am, I’m sorry to bother you but we’ve received some calls about noises coming from your room. People were saying a woman sounded to be in distress and was screaming…are you alright?”</p><p>Agatha bit her cheek in an attempt not to grin. “I’m fine.”</p><p>The woman did not look convinced. “Are you safe?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Do you need help?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“If there’s someone dangerous in here with you, we can call the police.”</p><p>As entertaining as this was, she had a bath with her hot and naked girlfriend to get to.</p><p>“Hey baby?” She shouted out and a robed Rio appeared from the bathroom and walked over.</p><p>“What’s up?” Rio asked.</p><p>All three employees looked at Rio beside her and seemed to understand.</p><p>Agatha politely smiled, “Sorry for the ruckus, my girlfriend was trying to get me pregnant.” And watched as their faces fell. “We’ll keep it down next time.”</p><p>Her girlfriend placed her hands over her face in shame as the staff mumbled their apologies and left.</p><p>“You just traumatized those poor people!” Rio scolded and shut the door.</p><p>“Believe me, they’ve seen and heard worse from people way richer.”</p><p>The next morning, as Agatha, Rio and Nicky ate breakfast in the five-star restaurant the hotel provided, she kept noticing sideways glances from staff. She pulled the collar of her turtleneck higher and casually sipped her coffee. Damn, word travels fast.</p><p>“Why do people keep looking at you guys?” Nicky asked, chewing on his bacon.</p><p>Rio shoveled bites of her waffle into her mouth. “Dunno…”</p><p>“Homophobia is still alive and well, hon.” She spoke over her mug and refused eye contact with her son.</p>

<p>Rio sleepily walked down the hall of her house (because she could say that now) at seven in the morning on Christmas day. Ever since New York, her, Agatha, and Nicky had fallen into somewhat of a routine.</p><p>Rio and Nicky leave for school, Agatha either works from home, or more often than not, commutes to work in the city. Nicky hangs out and does homework in Rio’s classroom with her after school until he and Rio leave to go home, where Agatha is usually multi-tasking cooking dinner and being on some call with some business person. They eat dinner together, Rio and Nicky clean up the dishes and they spend the night doing whatever the hell they want.</p><p>A slightly less picturesque part of their routine was Agatha or Rio shouting “Headphones!” to wherever Nicky was in the house whenever they were about to have sex. She tried to feel guilty about it, but she kept up her end of the bargain and bought him the most expensive pair of noise-canceling headphones Agatha’s money could buy. And it’s not her fault that Agatha liked to corner her morning, noon, and night. They were still technically in the honeymoon stage, it’d only been just shy of three months, so if they were fucking like bunnies, at least they were being considerate about it.</p><p>Nicky never said anything, and thank fucking god for that. It was bad enough she’d have to drive him to school the morning after doing very, very perverted things to his mom the night before, she didn’t need him acknowledging it. Actually, Nicky seemed to adjust to Rio’s moving in incredibly well. She was worried at first, not wanting him to feel like there was an intruder in his home, but she kind of got the feeling he liked her there. She helped him with his homework, played the video games with him that Agatha never understood the appeal of, and taught him new things like how to use charcoal sticks without the black dust getting on every fucking surface.</p><p>He never outright said it, because he’s a teenage boy obviously, but Rio saw how much happier he seemed, brighter almost. She suspected it had something to do with the lack of a shitty dad and the gain of stable homelife. Not that it was unstable previously, it was just…more stable now. It had been radio silence from Ralph ever since Evanora got arrested, the little bitch no longer had her to hide behind. But Nicky didn’t seem to care, so neither did Rio and Agatha.</p><p>She yawned again, making her way to Nicky’s room. Agatha, now completely healed, had woken her up twenty minutes ago and forced her out of bed while she made coffee and made sure everything downstairs was perfect. She never remembered Agatha being so into Christmas back in high school, but she loved the woman so she grumbled and agreed to grab the boy.</p><p>Rio creaked open the door and shuffled in, shaking Nicky’s sleeping form. “Mijo, wake up, your mom is insane.”</p><p>He grumbled, burrowing deeper into the pillow beneath his head the same way Agatha does when she’s sleeping on Rio’s chest.</p><p>She shook him some more. “Nicky.”</p><p>“It’s Christmas…” He whined.</p><p>“I’m aware.”</p><p>His eyes barely opened to look at the clock. “Too early. It’s my winter break.”</p><p>She flung up her arms. “Yeah, mine too, but if she’s not letting me sleep in then I’m taking you down with me.”</p><p>“Rioooooo,” He whined again.</p><p>She huffed and found a pillow to hit him with. “Lo juro por dios-”</p><p>He finally got up. “Don’t yell at me in spanish on Christmas, I’m going, I’m going.”</p><p>Rio smiled victoriously, the boy always crumbled whenever she emulated Victoria and started shouting in spanish. It also worked on Agatha.</p><p>Both of them grumbled down the stairs and into the living room where an all too cheery Agatha waited. She had gone off the deep end a little bit in the amount of decorations sprawled around the house. Huge tree that she’d proudly picked off the lot that they had spent hours decorating together a few weeks ago. Garland everywhere throughout the house, lights, festive knick-knacks, and of course, stockings hung on the fireplace. One for Nicky, one for Agatha, and one for Rio.</p><p>It’s not that Rio hated Christmas, she and Victoria just usually spent it at whatever sad apartment Rio was renting in New York at the time and ate chinese food. It was the first real holiday without her mom, and she was having a harder time getting into the holiday spirit.</p><p>“Merry Christmas!” Agatha smiled, handing each of them a mug of coffee.</p><p>“Mom, we never opened presents on Christmas morning and now you’re making us do it at seven AM.” Nicky scowled, hair still mussed from sleep.</p><p>“We also never had Rio with us, but there’s always time for new traditions.”</p><p>Rio gave her girlfriend a quick kiss. “Merry Christmas, crazy lady.” And sat on the couch with her mug.</p><p>The next hour was spent opening presents, well mostly Nicky did the opening because he was the only child. When it came for Rio to give him her gift she hesitated.</p><p>“Okay, I understand you’re almost an adult,” She handed him the gift bag. “So if you hate it, there’s also a Playstation gift card in there.”</p><p>He chuckled and opened the bag, pulling out the copious amounts of tissue paper before pulling out the gift.</p><p>He looked down at the handmade brown and white stuffed rabbit and then back up at Rio.</p><p>Fearing he hated it, she tried defending herself. “It’s a new Señor Scratchy, I know you lost the old one and I figured I’d make you another.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her with amazement. “You made that?”</p><p>“Mamá was really into quilt making, I learned how to sew very early on in life.” She looked at her girlfriend to explain, before moving her gaze back to Nicky.</p><p>“I love it.” He smiled.</p><p>“You can always shove it in a drawer.” She quipped.</p><p>“I think I’ll put him on my desk, little dude’s already been stuffed in that bag for who knows how long.”</p><p>She smiled back. “Cool.”</p><p>He looked back down at the rabbit, holding it like something precious, then stood and picked up a fairly large present and brought it over to her.  “Merry Christmas.”</p><p>Rio took the box, “You didn’t have to get me anything.” And started ripping the paper.</p><p>“Well, I used mom’s credit card so it was really no trouble.”</p><p>“But it was his idea.” Agatha added.</p><p>She tore the remaining paper and took the lid off the box-</p><p>A gardening kit.</p><p>A very expensive, personalized gardening kit, complete with every tool she could ever need. A pruner, angle weeder, soil scoop, and tine fork all nestled in an embroidered leather bag with her initials. In the front pocket, she saw seed packets poking out, azaleas.</p><p>“Mom said you used to garden with your mom, and I thought you could start a garden here too.” He started. “If you wanted. You could always teach me since mom can’t keep anything alive.” Nicky smirked.</p><p>“I’ve kept you alive this long, haven’t I?” Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Rio placed the gift on the coffee table and hugged him. “I love it, thank you, Nicky.”</p><p>He pulled away and smiled. “I also got all of it from local places because I know how you feel about Amazon…”</p><p>“Oh,” She chuckled through watery eyes. “I’m radicalizing you, it's like a Christmas miracle.”</p><p>“He’s probably going to college in New York, baby. If you hadn’t, someone else would’ve.” Agatha teased.</p><p>Both Agatha and Rio agreed to give each other their presents in private later that night, so after picking up the discarded paper and getting dressed, they headed over to Alice and Jen’s for Christmas lunch. Why lunch and not dinner, Rio didn’t ask.</p><p>Jen pulled open the door. “Merry not Jesus’ real birthday!” She deadpanned. “You’re all late, Wanda and her hoard are already here.”</p><p>All three shuffled in, “Mom and Rio took suspiciously long getting ready.” Nicky grumbled and went to go find Billy and Tommy.</p><p>“Just for that I’m getting wine drunk and making you drive home!” Agatha called after.</p><p>“Who knew kids came in so handy.” Jen grinned.</p><p>Once sat at the table with an obscene amount of food and booze, everyone started eating. The conversation was casual until fucking Alice piped up-</p><p>“So, when are you guys getting married?”</p><p>Rio set her fork down. “What’s your obsession with marriage?”</p><p>Alice raised her eyebrows. “You guys live together!”</p><p>“And it’s been twenty years…” Wanda spoke.</p><p>“It’s been three months!” Agatha corrected.</p><p>“Well, if you add how long you guys were together the first round, it’s actually like ten months.” Jen stated.</p><p>“And,” Alice said. “If you add everything together, that’s basically twenty-one years.”</p><p>“No, the clock starts over.” Rio chimed in.</p><p>“So when’s your anniversary, then?” Wanda asked.</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face, trying to figure it out. “Gimme a minute…”</p><p>“This is hurting my brain.” Rio grumbled and grabbed the wine.</p><p>“Are we going from high school, when Agatha was trying to woo her, or that morning after they fucked in the cheer uniform?” Jen grinned.</p><p>All three teens at the end of the table turned their heads.</p><p>Nicky dropped his fork and covered his face with his hands. “‘C’mon, Aunt Jen…”</p><p>Billy was laughing maniacally until his mom scolded him. “William!”</p><p>He cleared his throat and frowned. “Sorry.”</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue against her cheek, “Thanks for that, Jennifer.”</p><p>“My bad.” Jen whispered.</p><p>“Hon?” Agatha called down to the end of the table.</p><p>Nicky shook his head. “I’m good.”</p><p>He definitely was not good.</p><p>Agatha looked back at Jen. “You just ruined my new favorite holiday.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas.” Alice awkwardly smiled.</p><p>“Do you guys have something against marriage?” Wanda questioned between bites.</p><p>No, she’d love to be married to Agatha, she thought about it often. Daydreamed about actually being Nicky’s parent, Agatha’s wife, having another kid in the house. But it was too soon and she didn’t even know how Nicky would feel about Rio being his step-mom, so-</p><p>“Where’s your husband, Wanda?” Rio widened her eyes.</p><p>Wanda sucked her teeth. “Vis went back to the UK to see his family for the holidays.” She said and then turned her body so the kids couldn’t hear. “Not that I particularly miss him.”</p><p>“Damn, that’s still…going on?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“The separation? Yeah.” The ginger affirmed.</p><p>“What even happened?” Jen said over the rim of her glass.</p><p>“I don’t know, I just saw you and Alice, and Rio and Agatha and…” She blew out a breath. “I need more alcohol for this- I think Vis and I got complacent, I want what you guys have.”</p><p>“Lesbianism?” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “No. Love, effort, passion.”</p><p>“I’m very passionate about lesbianism.” Alice chuckled.</p><p>“So a certain blonde had nothing to do with anything?” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Natasha?” Wanda blinked.</p><p>The other three women just stared at her with a knowing look.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “No, Grace fucking Kelly. Yes, Natasha.”</p><p>“I talked to her one time and that was after you got your head bashed in, so no.”</p><p>“I could ask her if she wants to come to your New Years party…” Rio tempted.</p><p>“No,” Wanda giggled. “That's insane, she wouldn’t wanna come. Well-” She thought for a moment. “No, no that’s crazy.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “She’d 1000% come.”</p><p>“Well, if you think she’d go…” Wanda said casually.</p><p>Jen chuckled, “One of us, one of us…” She taunted under her breath.</p><p>Once it had gotten dark, they left and made their way back home, passing by Rio’s old house. She’d gotten a huge chunk of change from the insurance payout but hadn’t done anything with the now empty lot. She couldn’t bring herself to sell it, but it wasn’t anything anymore. Her heart clenched as Nicky drove past it and she felt Agatha’s hand on her knee squeeze in comfort.</p><p>Around seven they all changed back into pajamas, Agatha had said that she’d handle dinner. Once dressed, Rio came back downstairs and walked into the kitchen to see what elaborate Christmas dinner her girlfriend had planned. It’s not that Rio wasn’t grateful, she was. Agatha was going above and beyond for them to have a nice holiday together with Nicky, but she just wished her mom was here.</p><p>Turning the corner, she saw Agatha in leggings and her old NYU hoodie pulling cartons of food from a bag.</p><p>Rio approached, eyebrows furrowed. “What’s all this?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, eyes glimmering. “Chinese.”</p><p>Rio’s heart clenched again, but for a completely different reason. “You did that for me?”</p><p>“I remember you saying it was yours and Victoria’s tradition and I figured you’d probably be missing her today.”</p><p>“Thank you, mi amor.”</p><p>“I know I’ve been a little…”</p><p>“Hostile?” Rio smiled.</p><p>“I was going to say much.” She glared. “I know I’ve been a little much today, but it’s just because it’s the first time in my life that I didn’t have to spend Christmas my mother’s way. Every year we had to go to mass all morning then come back and get ready for her annual party. Nicky usually opened his presents on the 26th once we got back from New York. I just got excited to make my own traditions…our own traditions.”</p><p>“I like our traditions so far.” Rio hummed and kissed her, looping her hands around her waist and pulling her in.</p><p>“Do you guys ever detach from one another?” Nicky walked in.</p><p>Rio pulled away, “Not if I can help it.” And went to grab the plates.</p><p>Once they had turned in for the night, Rio closed their bedroom door and pulled out her gift for Agatha from under the bed.</p><p>At the same time Agatha appeared across from her with a folder in her hand, a little bow on top.</p><p>“Not to be that guy,” Rio sarcastically spoke, holding the wrapped box. “But mine is bigger than yours.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Merry Christmas, my love.”</p><p>Rio set down the box and took the folder from her, opening it and running her eyes over what looked to be-</p><p>Blueprints?</p><p>Her brows furrowed. “Did you accidentally give me something from work?”</p><p>Agatha gently shook her head. “It’s a very tentative mock-up of what our house could look like, assuming you’re sick of that lot being empty.”</p><p>Rio looked up. “Our house?”</p><p>“This place has too many bad memories, and it’s not really ours. It’s mine and you’ve had to adapt. I want to build a home with you, where you’re reflected. You and Victoria.”</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t been back in her home office since that day and refused to do so. Just shut the door and let everything in there collect dust. Rio had lovingly gone in to retrieve her weed, however.</p><p>“You’re building me a house?” Rio softly asked.</p><p>On the lot where her and Victoria’s home used to be.</p><p>And they weren’t even married yet.</p><p>Oh-</p><p>She was going to marry the fuck out of this woman.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “This place is a fortune to heat anyways.”</p><p>Like building a house was any cheaper.</p><p>Rio smiled through the tears she felt brimming her eyes. “What’s the insurance cost?”</p><p>Her girlfriend chuckled and connected her lips with Rio’s. “You gonna ask me how much my mortgage is?”</p><p>Rio kissed her back, this insane, fucking stupid, softie of a woman.</p><p>Agatha backed away. “My turn.”</p><p>She looked at the box sitting on the bed, suddenly feeling way less confident. “Umm,” She bit her bottom lip. “So my gift might seem a little…shallow in comparison.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha quipped, picking it up and sitting on the bed. “Well now I have to know.”</p><p>And Rio was sure she was going to draw blood with how hard she was chomping on her lip, watching Agatha rip the paper.</p><p>Blue eyes shot wide as the gift was opened. “Rio…”</p><p>“I didn’t know yours was going to be so thoughtful!”</p><p>“So you got me-”</p><p>“I know!” She defended. “I’ll get you something else!” Rio reached to swipe the gift away but Agatha was quicker, moving the box away.</p><p>“I didn’t say that I didn’t like it!” Agatha laughed as Rio tried to wrestle the present away.</p><p>“It’s a box of sex toys, Agatha.” She deadpanned.</p><p>Agatha tutted, “Don’t be crass,” and read the name off the box. “It’s the ‘Pleasure For Her Fun Time Play Gift Set’.”</p><p>Rio climbed on top of her and ripped the box away. “I know its name, I bought it!”</p><p>“I got you a house, and you got me handcuffs.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“They're silk.” She huffed, as if that made their gifts even.</p><p>“You know me so well.”</p><p>“I'm not a barbarian.”</p><p>She snorted again. “I love it, thank you, baby.”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>Needless to say, the box did not help the fucking like bunnies issue. Throughout winter break, Rio or Agatha was shouting “Headphones!” at least once a day. Eventually Nicky just started leaving for Billy’s and Tommy’s after hearing it.</p><p>On New Year’s Eve, Rio and Agatha were getting ready to leave for Wanda’s. Nicky was going to some party with Billy and Tommy, when Agatha agreed to let him go, Rio tried not to laugh at her speech.</p><p>Nicky was sitting on the couch, dressed and ready to leave, with his mom standing in front of him.</p><p>“No drinking,” Agatha began.</p><p>She drank in high school.</p><p>“No smoking,”</p><p>They met and bonded over bumming a cigarette.</p><p>“No drugs.”</p><p>Rio stifled her chuckle. That’s rich.</p><p>“You keep your location on at all times and for the love of god, if you are dumb enough to drink, do not drive.”</p><p>Nicky nodded. “I got it, mom.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a hug as he left and released him. “Go have fun, don’t be stupid. I love you.”</p><p>He grinned as he opened the door to leave. “Love you too. Bye Rio!”</p><p>“Make smart choices!” Rio called back.</p><p>Make smart choices? Where the fuck did that come from? He was sixteen of course he wasn’t going to make smart choices, but her mouth said it before her brain registered it.</p><p>Agatha turned to her. “Ready to make polite chit chat for hours?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Stupid fucking ginger.”</p><p>Wanda’s party wasn’t as bad as she expected, yes she had to make polite chit chat with half of Westview, but she was able to stick with her girlfriend, Alice, and Jen for the most part. The hostess was running around from person to person like a chicken with her head cut off, Rio had barely even spoken to Wanda for most of the night.</p><p>She was standing with Alice and Jen, sans Agatha, when Nat walked in and found her. All four of them talked for a while before Natasha locked her eyes on Wanda.</p><p>“Excuse me ladies, I got a redhead to flirt with.” Nat rasped and walked over to Wanda as if there was a physical gravitational pull.</p><p>“Easy tiger.” Alice laughed as Nat disappeared.</p><p>“Where’s Agatha?” Jen chirped, arm slung around her wife’s waist.</p><p>Rio looked through the crowded home, trying to find her girlfriend. She finally spotted her over by the fireplace, drink in hand, talking to a woman. Her girlfriend was smiling and nodding along to whatever the other woman was saying, which was fine. Rio didn’t really think anything of it until the woman leaned in a little and started toying with the ends of Agatha’s hair. Then alarm bells rang out in Rio’s brain, big, rageful alarm bells.</p><p>Maybe it's having been cheated on in the past, but without even realizing it, Rio started striding from the dining room to the living room. Jealousy was not something she ever liked feeling, and so she simply chose not to feel it. She might’ve felt animosity towards Ralph, but that was more about getting to have a life with Agatha for over a decade, Rio knew he wasn’t any real competition. But when that bitch touched her future wife’s hair something in her snapped, nobody except Rio should get the privilege of feeling that fucking mane, of making Agatha smile and laugh like that.</p><p>She plastered on the fakest smile of her life as she approached the two women, wrapping a possessive hand around Agatha’s hip. “There you are, baby. I’ve been looking for you.”</p><p>Her girlfriend turned to her. “I was just talking with Wanda’s coworker, this is Monica.”</p><p>“Hi.” Monica smiled, slowly retracting her hand from Agatha.</p><p>Smart move on Monica’s part because Rio was about to chop that hand off had it been touching her girlfriend any longer.</p><p>“Hi.” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha obviously caught on to the tension between the two, but was oblivious to the reason for said tension. “Monica, this is Rio.”</p><p>“Her girlfriend.” Rio supplied, staring dead on into Monica’s eyes.</p><p>Monica nodded. “I’ll leave you guys to enjoy the party. Nice to meet you both.”</p><p>When she was gone, Agatha furrowed her brows. “What was that about?”</p><p>“She was trying to fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “No she wasn’t.”</p><p>“Agatha, she was playing with your hair, that’s like the gateway to fucking in the bathroom.”</p><p>“She said she liked my hair and wanted to know if it was my natural color-”</p><p>“Because it’s beautiful on you?” Rio finished the line she’d heard a million times.</p><p>“She said it was soft!”</p><p>“Yeah of course it is! Your hair is sexy as hell, and your the hottest person to ever live, and you smell amazing, that woman wanted to fuck you!” Rio rambled.</p><p>“Sounds like just you wanna fuck me.”</p><p>“Not the point.”</p><p>“Are you jealous?” She smirked.</p><p>“No.” Rio pouted.</p><p>Agatha softly started twirling a lock of Rio’s hair around her finger. “You’re jealous.”</p><p>She looked down at the lithe fingers currently toying with her hair, then back up to stormy blue eyes glinting with chaos. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Playing with your hair,” Agatha quietly teased. “Trying to open a gateway.”</p><p>She felt her heartbeat pick up. “Bathroom?”</p><p>“Bathroom.” Agatha murmured and tangled her fingers with Rio’s, pulling her through the house.</p><p>As soon as she locked the door, Agatha pushed Rio against the counter and pounced. The edge was biting into her back but as her girlfriend tried to consume her, Rio couldn’t really focus on anything else. She always liked kissing Agatha, but when she got this feral, Rio fucking loved it. It was all tongue and teeth, like she was trying to stake her claim on Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Those same fingers slinked over Rio’s body before landing on her waist, hoisting her onto the counter and spreading her legs. And not that Rio wasn’t enjoying this, but-</p><p>“Baby,” She panted as Agatha bunched up the skirt of her dress and placed searing hot kisses down her neck. “I don’t think we have time for this.”</p><p>Last Rio checked, it was almost midnight and they were supposed to gathered in the other room for the ball drop.</p><p>“Then come quickly.” Agatha supplied before nipping at her ear. “Not my fault you’re hot when you’re jealous.”</p><p>Of course Agatha would get off on this.</p><p>She had to keep that in mind for the future.</p><p>Her girlfriend placed one last kiss to her throat before dropping to her knees and pulling Rio closer, and what was she going to do, say no? Instead, she hastily nodded and leaned back so her head was against the mirror, “Okay.” She whispered.</p><p>Usually, Agatha would tease her, let her tongue torture Rio until she was begging for more. However, with the absence of time or an appropriate location, Agatha simply just moved her underwear aside and licked along Rio’s slit.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groaned.</p><p>Agatha hummed before circling her clit and lightly sucking.</p><p>Rio threaded her hands through Agatha’s hair and bucked her hips. “This,” And tugged on her girlfriend's locks. “Is mine.”</p><p>She felt Agatha add more pressure, bobbing her head as much as Rio allowed in agreement.</p><p>“Your mouth-” She was cut off by Agatha sucking harder. “God!”</p><p>Blue eyes looked up from between her thighs and one fucking winked.</p><p>Rio bucked her hips faster now. “Your mouth is mine.”</p><p>One of Agatha’s hands left her thigh before disappearing under her chin. Rio felt two of those lithe fingers sink inside of her, curling in the way she knew always broke her.</p><p>Rio felt herself clench around the digits, digging her nails into the root of Agatha’s hair. “Fingers…” She felt her stomach twist in that familiar way. “Mine.”</p><p>From outside the door, she heard everyone start counting down.</p><p>“10, 9, 8…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes started to close.</p><p>“7 ,6, 5…”</p><p>She threw her head back as her legs tensed.</p><p>“4, 3, 2…”</p><p>“Agatha!” She shouted as the woman between her thighs gave one last final suck and pushed Rio over the edge. Her hips moved on their own accord as she came, a feeling of ecstasy washed over her as Agatha’s fingers kept pumping inside of her, helping Rio ride out her orgasm.</p><p>“Happy New Year!” Came from several hundred voices outside the bathroom.</p><p>Rio opened her eyes and saw Agatha getting back on her feet, grabbing Rio by the back of her neck and pulling her into a bruising kiss. She could taste herself on Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>“Happy new year, baby.” Agatha whispered against her lips.</p><p>Still a little dazed, “Happy new year, mi amor.” Rio smiled.</p><p>When they got home shortly after midnight, Nicky was still out.  Agatha had given him an extended curfew for the night, which gave them the perfect opportunity to ring in the new year without having to worry about being too loud.</p><p>They hadn’t been asleep long when Rio’s phone rang from its spot on the nightstand, maybe only half an hour, but Agatha was knocked out. Rio rolled over to see who it was and immediately picked it up.</p><p>“Nicky?” She rasped, still half asleep.</p><p>“Rio?” He slurred. “I wasn’t smart…”</p><p>She shot up out of bed. “Are you drunk?”</p><p>“Lil bit.” And she swore she could see the smirk on his face even though she couldn’t actually look at him.</p><p>She checked the time on her phone. “Mijo, it’s two AM.”</p><p>He was supposed to be home right now.</p><p>“I know.” He said gingerly. “Can you pick me up, pleaaaase?”</p><p>Rio raced downstairs, pajamas and all, threw on a jacket and shoes,  and grabbed Agatha’s car keys. "Stay where you are, send me your location.”</p><p>She debated grabbing Agatha, but the location Nicky sent was only ten minutes away, and she just wanted to get to him, make sure he was safe. Luckily, she hadn’t drank tonight, but Agatha had and she didn’t need two drunk people to calm down at once.</p><p>When she pulled up to the house, she heard music still blaring from inside the house, LED lights flashing in what she guessed was the living room.</p><p>Nicky and the twins were all by the curb, all visibly drunk.</p><p>They all climbed in, three fucking drunk teenagers, laughing and bleary-eyed.</p><p>So much for not dealing with more than one drunk person at a time.</p><p>“You dumbasses!” Rio scolded as soon as everyone was in. “What the hell were you guys thinking?!”</p><p>Nicky hiccupped in the passenger's seat. “‘S not my fault, some guy dared Billy to do a keg stand and look at him! He’s like ninety pounds!”</p><p>She cocked her head. “So you did it for him?!”</p><p>“I'm an ally.” He grinned.</p><p>“Can we get Taco Bell?” Tommy called from the backseat.</p><p>Rio turned to Wanda’s spawn in the back. “You’re lucky I don’t call your mom right now, dude.”</p><p>Call your mom? Fuck, Rio sounded old.</p><p>“But what about the Taco Bell?” Billy giggled.</p><p>“You do realize I’m a mandated reporter and now I have to call the cops on this party, right? I could tell them you guys were here and drunk, and you’d all get underages.”</p><p>Nicky sank in his seat, face covered with shock. “We did not realize that…”</p><p>“Please don’t!” Billy whined.</p><p>“We’re sorry Miss Vidal.” Tommy grumbled and hung his head in shame.</p><p>She wouldn’t but they were getting too cocky for her liking. “That’s what I thought!”</p><p>Rio picked up her phone and called in the party to Westview PD before driving to Wanda’s. God, and now she was a fucking narc.</p><p>She walked both boys up to the porch and rang the doorbell rapidly. Wanda opened the door, still dressed from the party,  hair looking a little messy, and took in the sight of Rio standing behind both her sons.</p><p>“Your children are hellions.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“What the fuck? William and Thomas Maximoff, upstairs right now!”</p><p>The twins grumbled but started moving.</p><p>“Thank you for bringing them home.” Wanda breathed.</p><p>“It was against my will.” Rio supplied, and left.</p><p>When they finally got home, Rio helped Nicky to his room, which was not easy, the boy was tall and super fucking lanky.</p><p>She walked him to sit on the bed. “Okay, Gumby, I’m grabbing you water and advil, do not fall asleep.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rio.” He smiled.</p><p>Before she could leave though, he stopped her and grabbed her wrist. “Can you not tell mom about this?”</p><p>She looked at him with disbelief and cackled. “No, dude. I generally value my life, I’m not keeping this from her.”</p><p>He released her wrist. “Worth a shot.”</p><p>“Is that why you called me?”</p><p>“No, I called you because I knew you’d come.” He shrugged. “It’s nice to have another person to call…”</p><p>And on the surface, it wasn’t that much of a confession. But Rio knew it meant more, knew he meant it was nice to have someone else that cared about him. For years he only had Agatha but now he could rely on Rio too.</p><p>“You can always call me.” Rio said. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>She went to the kitchen, grabbing water and the advil and climbing the stairs yet again. When she walked in, the boy was fast asleep.</p><p>Rio placed the water and pills on the nightstand, pulling the covers over him. She never got that part of parenthood, tucking a kid in for the night, not yet anyways.</p><p>She ran her hand through his hair, “Night, mijo.” And clicked off the lamp, making her way out of his room.</p><p>“Night, mami.” He breathed, probably no longer conscious.</p><p>That stopped her dead in her tracks.</p><p>Did he?</p><p>No.</p><p>He probably said “mommy” and she misheard it. He probably thought she was Agatha, right? But Agatha didn’t call him mijo, only Rio did.</p><p>She twisted her body to look at him-</p><p>Asleep like the dead.</p><p>Rio told herself it’s because he was drunk and tired, and probably didn’t even realize he said it. But it didn’t stop her heart from swelling ever so slightly, from her lips pulling into a huge smile.</p><p>Mami.</p><p>She ran the word through her head as she closed his door and walked down the hall. She didn’t expect him to ever call her anything besides her name, but-</p><p>Mami.</p><p>She liked it, she decided as she climbed back into bed.</p><p>Even if it was only a mistake, she liked it.</p><p>Agatha roused next to her, rolling over and settling her head on Rio’s chest. “Where'd you go?” She asked, voice thick with sleep.</p><p>“Your drunk son called me to pick him up.”</p><p>Agatha nuzzled in closer. “M’kay.”</p><p>Then a beat of silence passed before Agatha shot up, awake and alert. “What?!”</p>

<p>This fucking kid. Already arriving late and yet still had the audacity to make his grand entrance in the middle of the goddamn night. When she woke up a few minutes past eleven, she tried to wake Ralph on the other side of the bed but he just grumbled saying he’d meet her at the hospital once, and quote, “They clean him off”. Her mother believed men shouldn’t be in the delivery room so Ralph agreed, but Agatha knew it was just a fucking play, a way to make her suffer.</p><p>Which fine, fuck that, women have been giving birth in caves, in the woods by rivers, on the fucking Oregon trail, for centuries. She could do this alone. So, she got dressed and got herself to Westview Presbyterian. It was the closest hospital and judging by how impatient her son seemed to be to get out of her, she didn’t have much time.</p><p>She was admitted around 11:50PM on May 31st of 2009, given a gown, and waited in a birthing suite.</p><p>She could do this alone. Plenty of women give birth alone, she was not special.</p><p>She could do this alone, she thought, as she looked up at the sunset painted on the tiling of the ceiling. Was a fake sunset supposed to be soothing as her insides compressed around the tiny body trying to claw its way out of her? That was not the comfort they thought it was.</p><p>“I hear we’re having a baby!” A male doctor with salt and pepper hair and matching goatee shouted as he walked in.</p><p>Agatha scowled as she sat up. “I’m having a baby, I don’t see it trying to destroy your vagina, doctor.”</p><p>He gave a half hearted chuckle. “I’m Dr. Strange, I’ll be leading the delivery. Are we excited?”</p><p>“Excited for you to be elbow deep in my cervix?” Agatha deadpanned. “No.”</p><p>Agatha had been going to a private practice for all of her pregnancy with a team of professionals who she felt safe with. Her doctor was a woman and didn’t talk about pregnancy like it was the greatest thing a woman could ever do, she was realistic and practical and understood Agatha. But then this child was late, so now, she was stuck with this dumbass.</p><p>He sat down at the foot of the bed, “Well, I’ve never heard of anyone who likes that part.” And smiled. “If you could get in the stirrups and scoot down for me, I need to check how dilated you are.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes but complied.</p><p>“Okay, so you’re only two centimeters dilated. You’re in early labor, but not active.” He got back up and took off his gloves.</p><p>“So what the hell does that mean?” Agatha fixed her gown and sat back up.</p><p>“It means we wait.”</p><p>“How long?”</p><p>“The paperwork you filled out said contractions weren’t that close together, so until those speed up,” He shrugged. “It’s a guessing game.”</p><p>“Is medicine not a science?” She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“So why the fuck are we guessing?”</p><p>“Ask your son.” He smiled as two nurses in pink scrubs walked in. “These two are going to assist me today, if you need anything just hit the call button and they’ll be here.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and looked at the two women behind him. One looked to be Agatha’s age, fresh out of school. No, absolutely not, she was not having a tween deliver her kid. Glancing at the other nurse-</p><p>God hated her. He hated Agatha Harkness. He saw her in a hospital bed, giving birth and sent her ex-girlfriend’s mom to her bedside.</p><p>Victoria recognized her, of course she did, and smiled brightly. Fuck, her eyes reminded her of Rio’s.</p><p>“This is Kamala,” Strange pointed to the fucking infant in scrubs, then at Victoria. “And-”</p><p>“I want different nurses.” Agatha barked.</p><p>Victoria grinned. “I’m sorry, querida, we’re what you get.”</p><p>After more preamble, Strange finally left, leaving her with what’s-her-name and Victoria.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Kamala beamed.</p><p>“Like another human is tearing my uterus apart, Doogie Howser.” She bit out.</p><p>The girl’s face fell, and if that’s all it took to get to hurt her feelings, Agatha was going to have a fucking field day.</p><p>“Kamala, why don’t you give us a minute?” Victoria patiently spoke.</p><p>Once alone, Victoria approached her. “You’ve been busy.” She laughed. “I feel like it was just yesterday I was listening to your graduation speech.”</p><p>Agatha did not need her bringing up the past right now, not while she was vulnerable, physically at least.</p><p>“Mhh.” Agatha responded, refusing to give her any attention.</p><p>“Where’s your husband? I saw the wedding in the papers, it looked beautiful.”</p><p>“Asleep at home.” Agatha muttered. “When do you guys shoot me up with drugs?”</p><p>Victoria laughed again, and Agatha hated that the sound was the most comforting thing in the room right now. That Victoria was the most comforting thing in the room right now. “Once you’re in active labor.”</p><p>She just nodded at the information.</p><p>“What about your mom?” Victoria asked.</p><p>“What about her?”</p><p>“Why isn’t she here?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “Didn’t want to be.”</p><p>“Your friends?”</p><p>“At school, most of them graduate in the next few days, couldn’t get away.”</p><p>Rio was probably graduating in a few days.</p><p>Victoria nodded, but her eyes were filled with something dangerously close to pity. “Okay.”</p><p>“I’m fine.” Agatha proudly stated.</p><p>“Of course you are.” Victoria agreed. “I gave birth alone, everyone was back home in Puerto Rico when I had-” And she cut herself off, like she was catching herself before saying a bad word. “When I gave birth.”</p><p>Good, Victoria seemingly understood that Rio was off limits, and that’s how Agatha wanted it.</p><p>“But if you’re not…okay,” Victoria softly smiled. “I’m here.”</p><p>The next several hours passed by with no movement from this damn child, for someone so eager to enter the world, he sure seemed to be taking his sweet time.</p><p>It was just past four AM when Strange came back in.</p><p>“How are we doing?”</p><p>How was she doing? She was being tortured, she was tired, her body ached, and she had a ghost as her nurse-</p><p>“Been better.” Agatha scowled.</p><p>He checked how dilated she was again, and no progress.</p><p>More hours passed, and they put a band over her stomach to monitor the baby. She saw his monitor next to hers. For all that was going wrong right now, at least her son was okay, at least he seemed comfortable.</p><p>Around mid-day on June first, another doctor took over, who he was, Agatha didn’t care. The silver-lining was that the other nurse hadn’t come back, Agatha assumed she was either done with her shift or she had scared her away. Ralph called, asking if she had their son yet.</p><p>“Don’t you think I’d call you if he was here?”</p><p>“Why’s it taking so long?” He offhandedly commented over the line.</p><p>“Why did I marry you?!” She snapped.</p><p>“I’m trying to be supportive, damn, Agatha!”</p><p>It had been less than a year of marriage, and yet every day was worse than the last. Why was she having a baby right now when she already had one at home?</p><p>“That’s not support, you nimrod.”</p><p>“Well, do you think he’ll be here before I graduate?”</p><p>Unlike Agatha, Ralph did not graduate early. In fact, she was sure it was a miracle he was graduating at all.</p><p>“You’re not here anyways, what’s it matter?!”</p><p>“Okay, you’re obviously hysterical. Call me when he’s there.” Ralph said and hung up.</p><p>She looked down at her phone’s screen, one hand protectively slung over her protruding stomach before angrily chucking the phone across the room. She heard the sound of plastic shattering before slumping against the pillows.</p><p>“Someone’s going to have to clean that up now.” Victoria joked as she walked in.</p><p>“Add it to my bill.” Agatha sniffled.</p><p>Victoria grabbed a chair and sidled up next to the bed, pulling the tray table over along with her. “You need a distraction.” And held up a deck of cards.</p><p>“Do I?” She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Victoria started shuffling. “When I was in labor, I played solitaire for hours. It was good to focus on something other than the pain.”</p><p>“How long did yours take?” Agatha sat up, engaging with this lunacy.</p><p>“Uhh, maybe a day.” She smiled. “She was stubborn, though.”</p><p>“Maybe he’ll take your cue and move it the fuck along.” Agatha said, looking down at her belly accusingly.</p><p>“Your next will go quicker, most women pop out their second baby” Victoria snapped her fingers. “Like that.”</p><p>“I’m not doing this shit again.” She looked at the other woman like she was crazy.</p><p>She did her duty. She married the wrong person, was having a baby with the wrong person. She was living as her mother wanted her to, this was it. It was bad enough this kid was being born into a fake family, she didn’t need to subject another innocent to that.</p><p>“I don’t blame you, I was done too after I had her.”</p><p>This was getting too close to talking about Rio, so Agatha pivoted.</p><p>“What are we playing?”</p><p>Victoria finished shuffling. “Know how to play poker?”</p><p>They played for hours until Victoria got called away, then night came and still no kid. The contractions were getting closer together, her body felt drained of and overloaded with energy all at once. She tried to sleep, but it was futile.</p><p>The next morning, Strange was back.</p><p>He got up from the end of the bed and snapped off his gloves. “Seven centimeters, active labor!”</p><p>Yeah, she could’ve fucking told him that, the pain burning it’s way through her bloodstream and bones could’ve fucking told him that. The way her organs were screaming could’ve told him that.</p><p>“Great, gimme the fucking drugs!” Agatha shouted.</p><p>“I’ll have them come and start the epidural now.” He walked out.</p><p>Time went by, and more nameless, faceless bodies in scrubs came in to administer it. Nobody even talked to her, just recited what they were going to do and set up. When she saw the needle, the huge, comically large needle about to go in her back, she stopped them.</p><p>She hit the call button about a million times, and Victoria rushed in. “Agatha?”</p><p>And maybe it was how disoriented she looked, maybe it was the tears in her eyes, maybe it was the way her entire body was sweaty and shaking. But Victoria looked at her with so much concern.</p><p>She was doing this alone, had been for thirty-five hours, and now everything felt real. Really real.</p><p>She was doing this alone.</p><p>Alone, in a hospital, where she had no one.</p><p>She couldn’t do this alone.</p><p>“I’m-” Her lip trembled. “I’m not okay.”</p><p>Victoria nodded, coming over and holding her hands. “I’m here.”</p><p>The scrubs started again, picking up the needle.</p><p>“Can you distract me?” Agatha croaked.</p><p>“Sure, how?” Victoria didn’t let go, didn’t look at the other people in the room, just kept her eyes on Agatha’s.</p><p>“How’s the garden doing?” She gritted out as she felt the needle break the skin.</p><p>Victoria chuckled. “The azaleas are in full bloom, almost too much, I don’t know what I’m going to do with all of them.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha winced at the extra layer of pain.</p><p>“You’re doing great, cariño.” Victoria soothed.</p><p>And maybe it was the pain, maybe it was the term of endearment, or maybe it was the drugs now entering her body, but in a moment of weakness, her curiosity got the better of her.</p><p>“How’s she doing?”</p><p>Victoria scrunched her face. “Your chart said you’re having a boy-”</p><p>She let out a shallow breath. “Victoria-” And felt a tear roll over her cheek. “I’m not talking about my son.”</p><p>Agatha could see on his monitor he was fine, but she couldn’t see Rio. Hadn’t in a little less than a year.</p><p>Victoria gave a sad smile. “She graduates tomorrow.”</p><p>And the loneliness, the agony she was enduring, the sorrow that never left her in the four years-</p><p>They seemed smaller now in comparison.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha halfheartedly laughed.</p><p>“Yup, has a few gigs lined up until she can get something of hers into a gallery.”</p><p>“Changing the world.” Agatha murmured as the numerous scrubs finished and left. “These drugs are good.”</p><p>The pain wasn’t gone, but it was bearable now.</p><p>“Enjoy it.” Victoria giggled.</p><p>Around 5:30 that evening, Agatha was drenched in sweat, sprawled out on the bed with Victoria, the other nurse, and Strange surrounding her. She’d been pushing for who knows how fucking long.</p><p>“I take it back, these drugs ssuuuck!” She screamed, throwing her head back and straining against her own skin.</p><p>“C’mon, mama, you’re almost there!” That fucking child of a nurse cheerily encouraged. Fuck, why’d she have to be back?</p><p>Agatha craned her neck from the pillow saturated in moisture. “Call me that again and I will shove your nursing degree so far up your ass, you’ll feel it in your esophagus!”</p><p>Kamala’s eyes widened. “Sorry, I was just-”</p><p>“Either find a ledge to fling yourself from or keep quiet!” She bared down again, strangling Victoria’s hand in her grasp.</p><p>The nurse’s eyes glazed over, tears brimming. She was smart enough not to speak again, just nodded.</p><p>Victoria pushed Agatha’s hair back with her free hand. “You can do it.”</p><p>“I c-can’t.” Agatha wailed, she would’ve collapsed by now if not for already being on the bed.</p><p>“Yes you can, women have been giving birth since humanity began.” Victoria smiled.</p><p>“Fuck those women!” She screamed as she pushed again. “Fuck the- the men who did it to them!”</p><p>“I see the head.” Strange said.</p><p>She hated this doctor and that fucking nurse and fucking hospitals, she hated everything right now.</p><p>“Yeah, I fucking feel the head, you d-dumb fuck!”</p><p>“You’re almost done.” She heard Victoria murmur.</p><p>“I can’t- I can’t do it.” She cried. “I can’t do this by myself.”</p><p>“You’re not by yourself, cariño.” Victoria sat her up a bit and climbed onto the bed behind her, pulling her so Agatha’s back was resting against her chest. “You’re gonna get through this, and at the end, see your son.”</p><p>Agatha clasped one of Victoria’s hands in each one of her own. “Victoria…”</p><p>“One more push, c’mon, Agatha!” Strange shouted.</p><p>She just wanted her son. She just wanted him out and safe in her arms. She just wanted-</p><p>“I want Rio!” She screamed deliriously, pushing as much as she could, as much as her body had left to give.</p><p>Everything was fuzzy, the feeling of Victoria behind her, the glow of the fluorescent lights, the screams of a newborn filling the room. She slumped back, breathless and exhausted, and Victoria caught her.</p><p>The world stopped in the next few minutes, Victoria climbed out from behind her, gently setting her back against the pillows. Agatha opened her bleary eyes and was greeted with a little bundle of limbs safely wrapped in a blue blanket.</p><p>“Wanna hold your son?” Victoria beamed.</p><p>She heard Strange declare, “Time of birth, 17:50.” In military time.</p><p>Agatha took her son, Victoria helped to place him against her chest.</p><p>She looked down at him. Looked at her son in amazement, as if he was the most beautiful thing she’d ever seen, because to her, he was. Her heart beat like a river flows, taking in his tiny nose and big brown bug eyes.</p><p>She smiled through the tears.</p><p>Her son.</p><p>It didn’t matter how he came about, it didn’t matter that Ralph wasn’t here. What mattered, is that he was hers, he was okay, he would never have to grow up the way she did. What mattered is that he was here, in her arms, safe.</p><p>He was everything.</p><p>He always would be.</p><p>And he’d always have her.</p><p>She wasn’t alone anymore.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha chirped and ran her index finger along the soft slope of his nose.</p><p>“He’s healthy, especially his lungs.” Victoria chuckled.</p><p>“He’s perfect.” She whispered.</p><p>The medical team checked them both over, making sure mom and baby were fine. After which, he was returned to her. After a couple of hours, Victoria came back from wherever she was.</p><p>“I called Ralph for you.” She said,</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha spoke, but she wouldn’t have minded if it was just her and her son forever.</p><p>“Does he have a name?”</p><p>She held him, still bundled. “Nicholas.”</p><p>“He looks like a Nicholas.”</p><p>“Thank you…for everything.”</p><p>Victoria shook her head. “Nonsense.”</p><p>And since having a child, she had a lot of time to think about the things she might’ve confessed when she wasn’t in her right state of mind. “Could you not tell her what I said?”</p><p>And Victoria looked tired too, like the day hadn’t only taken a toll on Agatha. “I don’t think it’d do her any good to know.”</p><p>No, it wouldn’t. She was married with a newborn and Rio was in New York about to start her life. It would only hurt.</p><p>Ignoring how she really felt, she deflected. “Do you ever go home?” Agatha quipped.</p><p>“I’m about to head out now, my shift was over a bit ago.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t know-”</p><p>“Agatha,” Victoria chided. “I meant it, I’m here.”</p><p>She nodded. “Thank you, Victoria.”</p><p>“Stop thanking me.” Victoria scolded. “Do you want me to stay with you until your husband’s here?”</p><p>Yes, desperately.</p><p>“No, no. You’ve done enough, go home, go pack. You have somewhere to be tomorrow.”</p><p>“Congratulations, you did amazing.” Victoria smiled one last time before leaving.</p><p>Ralph and her mother arrived shortly after, immediately flying to Nicky rather than her. Neither asked a single question about how she was, just fawned over her son.</p><p>The next day, as they filled out the birth certificate, they settled on Scratch for his last name, but they still needed a middle.</p><p>“What about Ralph?” Her husband asked, holding Nicky.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, she had mesh underwear holding her insides together and he was trying to take credit.</p><p>“I vetoed Ralph Jr. for a reason, no.”</p><p>“RJ is a cool name.” He looked at Nicky. “But Nicholas is a close second.”</p><p>“What about Victor?”</p><p>“Victor? Is that a family name?” He scrunched his face.</p><p>“Yeah.” She lied, Evanora wasn’t here to fact-check her, and Ralph was too stupid to question her further.</p><p>“Nicholas Victor. I like it, it’s strong.”</p><p>“Nicholas Victor.” She repeated before writing it down.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she did end up doing it by herself. Raising a child, that is. Early mornings and late nights, all done by Agatha. Ralph tried to pretend to help at first, but just claimed that she was knit-picking his parenting. Claimed that Agatha just changed diapers better, claimed she did better on less sleep than him.</p><p>Nicky was a month old when she woke up in the middle of the night to him screaming bloody murder through the baby monitor. She sat up and looked over, Ralph still dead asleep. She wondered how much she could smack him before he’d wake up.</p><p>She got out of bed and walked down the hall to the nursery, pushing open the door and collecting him from his crib. She knew he wasn’t hungry or in need of changing so she sat with him in the plush rocking chair they kept in the corner of the small room, walls painted light blue.</p><p>She tucked one leg under herself and started rocking with the other, soothing his cries.</p><p>“I know, I know,” She whispered. “Okay, what haven’t we tried yet?”</p><p>Nicky only ever seemed to calm when she sang to him, she’d gone through most of her repertoire in the last month. So, she started singing the first thing that came to mind-</p><p>What she always kept in mind.</p><p>“Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City? I’m a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so pretty. Yes you do-” She softly began to sing.</p><p>Nicky quieted but didn’t calm completely as she got halfway through.</p><p>“A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars. I’d walk to you if I had no other way-”</p><p>His amber eyes, the ones she had to remind herself he got from Ralph and nobody else, started getting heavy.</p><p>“Hey there Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me. Two more years and you’ll be done with school and I’ll be making history,”</p><p>She felt his breathing slow, content to listen to her go, so she did, all the way to the end.</p><p>“Oh, it’s what you do to me. Oh, it’s what you do to me, what you do to me.”</p><p>She kept humming it even after she ran out of lyrics. She kept him in her arms as she rocked in the otherwise quiet and dark room.</p><p>She sang that song to him most nights after that, sang it to him when he had nightmares when he was three. Sang it to him as she patched him up from falling off his bike when he was five.</p><p>Nicky knew that song by heart by the time he started kindergarten, but never knew why she loved it so much. It’d come on the radio and she’d hear him mumbling along in his carseat.</p><p>She can’t remember the last time she sang it to him, didn’t know it would be the last time. He grew up and stopped crying over the little discomforts of life, stopped needing her to soothe every physical or emotional wound.</p><p>He grew up, he was growing up.</p><p>The summer he turned fourteen he shot up a foot and half and was officially taller than her. A far cry from the bundle of limbs she was handed in the hospital.</p><p>And now, he was almost an adult. Content to his independence, his freedom. He didn’t need her as much anymore.</p><p>It had been two months since ‘Mami-gate’ as Agatha lovingly deemed the night her son got wasted and called Rio mami. Her girlfriend told her the next morning just before Agatha barged into his room clanging two pans together to wake him up. Was she also hungover while she did it? Yes. Did it hurt like a bitch way worse for her than it did Nicky? Definitely. Did she regret it? Absolutely not. The way he scrambled and groaned when he realized how much shit he was in gave Agatha little satisfaction. Back in Agatha’s day she at least had the decency to be clever about being stupid, but this new generation…</p><p>The punishment, aside from being obnoxious with the pans, was him being grounded for a month. No video games, no seeing friends, he went to school and came home and that was it. As far as parenting went, it felt pretty standard, enough to let him the behavior wasn’t chill but not so harsh that Agatha felt like a monster.</p><p>However, in the following months, Nicky hadn’t said it again. He went right back to calling her Rio, which she and Agatha both figured he would do. They didn’t talk to him about it, they didn’t want to embarrass him if he didn’t remember it, or make him feel guilty if he did. Rio was adamant that she didn’t want him to feel any pressure to call her something so soon, and Agatha understood, she did. But the fact that he thought or said it at all did make her smile a little, it made her heart all warm and mushy, made her excited for the future.</p><p>She had let Jen bully her into ring shopping, which she brushed off at first. But was it her fault she’d found the most perfect ring ever one random day last month in some random shop? No, no it wasn’t, and she’d take no blame for it.</p><p>She didn’t buy it, she still had to talk to Nicky about how he’d feel, but that fucking ring called to her like a siren song.</p><p>They hadn’t even started building the house yet, the blueprints weren’t even finalized. Rio insisted that Agatha was being too lavish with the design of the home. Which she disagreed with because who the fuck says no to a breakfast nook? In what world is that not a baseline need in a home?</p><p>Rio wanted them to split the cost of building the thing even though she kept reminding her that it was supposed to be a gift, but her girlfriend wouldn’t budge. So, they kept going back and forth on the blueprints until one night in early March.</p><p>“Agatha, nobody needs a five bedroom house!” Rio said as they sat on the couch, blueprints scattered around them.</p><p>She sighed. “We do!”</p><p>“There’s three of us and by the time this is actually built, Nicky’s going to be off at college.”</p><p>“Okay, one, this is literally what I do for a living and this house will be built however quickly I ask for it to be built.” Agatha cocked her head knowingly. “And two, we wouldn’t be three, we’d be four!”</p><p>Rio looked a little taken aback. “So one for us, one for Nicky…”</p><p>“Unless you plan on making our child sleep in a drawer,” She flailed her arms around to make her point. “We need a nursery.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio smiled. “What about the other two rooms?”</p><p>“My office and your studio, obviously, keep up my love.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “Obviously.”</p><p>“Can I have the keys to the Mercedes?” Nicky asked as he walked into the living room.</p><p>“Oh, hi son of mine, so nice of you to greet me first before you ask me for something.” Agatha quipped.</p><p>“Sorry, hi mom, can I please have your car tonight?”</p><p>“I blocked her in but you can take mine.” Rio offered.</p><p>He thought for a moment before shaking his head. “I can just move yours and pull it back in once I get mom’s car out.”</p><p>Agatha scrunched her face. “Why do you need my car so badly?”</p><p>“No reason.” He said, and maybe it was mother’s intuition but that was a bald-faced fucking lie.</p><p>“Really? Where are you going?”</p><p>“Movies.”</p><p>“With who?”</p><p>“Just some friends.”</p><p>“I’m gonna need names.” She raised one eyebrow.</p><p>“Just like, ya know, Billy and Tommy.”</p><p>“I can just call Wanda and ask if that’s true or not.”</p><p>Rio had been quiet through the whole standoff but then she gasped, eyes wide. “It’s a girl!”</p><p>“What?” Agatha looked over at her.</p><p>“Why else would he need the bougier car and be weird about who he’s hanging out with?” Rio said accusingly and turned her head towards Nicky.</p><p>“Do you have a date?” Agatha smiled.</p><p>He looked at both of them and groaned. “It’s not a date, Cassie and I are just hanging out.”</p><p>Agatha sat up. “Cassie?”</p><p>“Cassie Lang?” Rio asked.</p><p>“How’d you know?” Nicky asked back.</p><p>“I see you in the halls dude, you two are always talking at her locker.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me?” Agatha was a little offended that her girlfriend withheld this information.</p><p>“She’s a senior, I didn’t think he’d actually ask her out!”</p><p>“Older woman, huh?” Agatha chided. “Maybe he really is your son…”</p><p>“It was seventeen years ago, baby, let it go.”</p><p>“So the car…?” Nicky interrupted them.</p><p>“You don’t wanna pick up your date in the Honda that’s older than you are?” Rio feigned offense.</p><p>“It’s not a date!” He corrected.</p><p>“So why are you trying to impress her?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Okay,” He threw his hands up in surrender. “I think it’s a date, but I was too anxious to ask when we made the plans. Please, can I have the keys?”</p><p>“I would just like to point out, I had no car when I pulled your mom back in high school.”</p><p>Agatha almost cackled. “You did not pull me, I pulled you!”</p><p>“I kissed you first!”</p><p>“I told you to!”</p><p>“Yeah, but I kissed you the second time.”</p><p>“I asked you to be my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Actually, you asked to be my girlfriend.” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Semantics. Face it, I pulled your ass, not the other way around.”</p><p>“Nuh-uh.”</p><p>“Big talk from somebody who was a virgin when we met.”</p><p>“We both were!”</p><p>“But I took yours first!”</p><p>Nicky let out a pleading breath. “For the love of god, may I please, please have the car?”</p><p>She looked over at him. “Keys are in my purse, back by curfew.”</p><p>He smiled, “Thanks, mom!” And basically sprinted out of the room.</p><p>“Love you!” She called.</p><p>“Love you! Bye Rio!” He answered and left.</p><p>Agatha slumped back on the couch. “Fuck, I feel old.”</p><p>“Cause he’s dating?”</p><p>“You said it yourself, he’ll be in college soon. He’s dating, and driving, and drinking. I just don’t know where all the time went.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her arm, gently stoking her thumb over Agatha’s pulsepoint. “He might be growing up, but he’s still a kid.”</p><p>“When he was young, I used to pull him out of school once a year randomly and we’d play hooky. Usually we’d go to Coney Island and ride all the rides and get corn dogs and he’d always say how it was the best day ever.”</p><p>“I’m sure it was.”</p><p>“I miss that stage. I miss all the stages.”</p><p>“I’d like to experience those stages.” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “I’d like to experience those with you.”</p><p>She pulled Agatha in, placing a featherlight kiss to her lips. “So five bedrooms?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Five bedrooms.”</p>

<p>“Can I come in?” Agatha spoke as she knocked on Nicky’s door frame.</p><p>He was working at his desk, hunched over his laptop, textbook open. “Yeah.”</p><p>She crossed over the threshold and sat on the bed. “How’d last night go?”</p><p>Nicky’s fingers stopped typing, swiveling in his chair to look at his mom. “Are you here to gather information and report back?”</p><p>To put it bluntly; yes.</p><p>Rio was out of the house, instead going to Lilia’s for a wine night. Those became pretty frequent ever since Lilia accepted the principal position, apparently being the boss’ favorite had its perks. Every week like clockwork, Rio went to Lilia’s and listened to whatever drama was going on in the district or amongst the teachers. But that left Agatha at home alone with Nicky, which was rare. If anything, usually Agatha was the one staying late at work and it was Rio and Nicky left at home.</p><p>So last night, after Nicky got home and said nothing about the date, she assured Rio she’d ask and report back anything he told her. It was kind of endearing how Rio was as invested in this as she was.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean.” Agatha pursed her lips.</p><p>“Mmmh.” He hummed.</p><p>“But if you wanted to tell me how your date went-”</p><p>“It wasn’t a date-”</p><p>“Then I’m just saying, I’m listening!”</p><p>He rolled his eyes. “It was good.”</p><p>“Yeah?” She smiled.</p><p>“I think we’ve got another one planned, so that’s cool…”</p><p>“When do we get to meet her?”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Preferably never.”</p><p>“Why not?” She faked a gasp, placing one hand on her chest as if she was offended.</p><p>“You’re gonna embarrass me by showing her baby pictures or something,”</p><p>“Moi?”</p><p>“And Rio will be well, Rio, and scare her off.”</p><p>And that led her to the other reason she was in here, her ulterior motive-</p><p>“Speaking of,” Agatha scooted closer. “I need to talk to you about something.”</p><p>“Okay…” He furrowed his brows.</p><p>How she was going to get through this, she didn’t have a fucking clue. She never thought about having to ask her teenage son if he’d be okay with her getting married again. And she didn’t want to think about the possibility of him shooting her down. That would be it for her and Rio’s future. She couldn’t marry and have a kid with someone her son couldn’t see in his life long-term.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>“I know there’s been a lot of changes lately,” She started. “With Rio moving in and having to share the house with another person. Especially when it’s always been just us two against the world for a long time.”</p><p>His face was still scrunched as he nodded along.</p><p>“And I would never want you to feel like your opinion doesn’t matter, or that I’m just uprooting your life. I love you and if you don’t think it's a good idea, I’ll drop it, okay?”</p><p>“I don’t even know what you’re trying to say right now, mom.” Nicky cocked his head.</p><p>She took a breath and rushed out the words. “I’m thinking about proposing to Rio.”</p><p>Her son just blinked.</p><p>She blinked back.</p><p>“Thoughts?” She prompted.</p><p>“Fork found in kitchen.” He deadpanned.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Water found in ocean, cloud found in sky, yeah mom, it’s been twenty years.”</p><p>“You’re saying a lot, but I understand almost none of it.”</p><p>“I’m saying, I can use context clues. You’re building her a house, I saw the writing on the wall.”</p><p>“Okay, but how does that make you feel?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Kinda already assumed it was happening. I told you I like Rio. She’s cool and dependable and she knows how to play Fallout which you suck at-”</p><p>“What the fuck is a stimpak and why do I always need one?!” She defended herself.</p><p>“Because you always let yourself get shot at!”</p><p>“I couldn’t see who was-” She started before stopping and refocusing on the topic at hand. “I just want to make sure you’d be fine with this. Rio would be your stepmom.”</p><p>“That’s usually how it goes when one of your parents gets remarried, yes.”</p><p>“Don’t be a smartass right now. “ She chided.</p><p>He leaned forward in his desk chair, placing his elbows on his knees. “Mom, I am okay if you marry Rio. You deserve to be happy, and she makes you happy. We’ve been on our own long enough.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, almost feeling guilty. She’d already changed his life so much in such a short span of time, and now she was just piling on. “Rio and I have also talked about having a kid together…”</p><p>Nicky’s posture didn’t falter. “I’ve been an only child long enough.”</p><p>She looked up, trying to scan his face for any indicators that he was lying. Just trying to spare her feelings. She always knew when he was lying, and right now, he wasn’t.</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Thanks, hon.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about, I did literally nothing but let you yap at me and distract me from my homework.” He started to swivel in his chair again, but she caught him.</p><p>“Now that you know, I’m gonna need your help.”</p><p>He turned to face her again. “I’m listening.”</p><p>The next day, Agatha bought the ring.</p><p>The next month, she bided her time.</p><p>The day of, she set the plan into motion.</p><p>It was a Friday after school in late April as she waited under the bleachers. She expected to feel nervous, people were always nervous when they proposed. However as she waited, Agatha felt strangely calm. Serene, as she went over her speech again and again in her head. She dreamed of days like these when she was seventeen, she dreamed of days like these always.</p><p>She’d only ever been sure about two things in life-</p><p>Her son, and Rio.</p><p>“Lilia, this is ridiculous.” She heard Rio’s voice carry from across the field.</p><p>Agatha had recruited Lilia to lure Rio here, she’d also tried to subtly suggest to Rio this morning that she might wear something a little nicer to work. Maybe even wear her hair down instead of clipped up.</p><p>Yeah, Rio did not listen, throwing on a band tee and jeans before throwing her hair up.</p><p>Lilia yanked Rio along as they got closer. “C’mon it’s just over here.”</p><p>“Whatever wounded animal is out here, I am not equipped to deal with it!”</p><p>Wounded animal, really Lilia? Agatha thought as she lit her Newport, upon taking a drag, she almost keeled over from where she sat on the equipment crate. Fuck, Rio was right, menthols are foul.</p><p>“I thought you were a nature lover!” Lilia scolded.</p><p>“I cant heal an injured animal, I’m not Snow fucking White.”</p><p>Lilia harshly turned them to walk towards the bleachers.</p><p>“Almost there.” Lilia groaned.</p><p>“It’s under the bleachers?” Her girlfriend's incredulous voice was now only a couple feet away.</p><p>They rounded the bleachers and Rio’s eyes widened as they met Agatha’s.</p><p>“Here, your wounded animal.” Lilia pointed at Agatha before tugging off Rio’s lanyard with her school ID and taking the clip out of her hair. “You’ll thank me later.”</p><p>Agatha smiled as she took another drag. “Hi.”</p><p>“What the fuck was all that?” Rio asked. “Why are you smoking under the bleachers?”</p><p>She held up the pack, saying the same line she said when they first met. “If I let you bum one, will you promise not to rat on me?”</p><p>The deja vu seemed to hit her at that moment, because Rio smiled and said the same thing she had twenty-one years ago. “I’m not a snitch.”</p><p>Agatha helped her light the cigarette before discarding the pack.</p><p>“You know if you really wanted to add to the nostalgia, you should’ve worn one of those miniskirts.” Her girlfriend said as she inhaled, sitting on the crate next to her. “Fuck, menthol again? Baby, I‘ve seen your checking account.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled her smoke. “I’m setting the scene!”</p><p>“What scene?”</p><p>“Do you know what today is?” She asked, idly rolling the cigarette in her fingers.</p><p>“Friday.” Rio answered, grimacing at the taste of the smoke in her lungs.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “The date, my love.”</p><p>“Well, there’s two months until summer break. So, April.” She took another drag. “And a kid handed in an assignment three days late today, so carry the one…” Rio pretended to calculate. “The 22nd.”</p><p>And Agatha just stared knowingly, smirking.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio realized. “April 22nd.”</p><p>“I knew you’d get there eventually.” Agatha quipped as she put out her cigarette.</p><p>“So you dragged me out here to remember one of the most traumatic days of our youth?” She followed suit, putting out hers too. “I’m too fucking old to do menthol.”</p><p>“I’ve thought a lot about what I’d do if I ever got you here again.”</p><p>“Are you trying to fuck me under these bleachers again?” Rio joked. “Cause I’m game, but it’s a school day…”</p><p>This fucking woman.</p><p>“Contrary to popular belief, I’m not always trying to fuck you.”</p><p>“Belief? It’s fact.”</p><p>“You know, I stayed here for a long time that day. After you left, after I hurt you. I wished so much that I didn’t do it. That I could be someone else, someone you deserved.”</p><p>“Mi amor-”</p><p>“Let me finish.” Agatha turned her body so she was fully facing Rio. “I went home that day and all I wanted was you. I cried myself to sleep every night for, god, I don’t even know how long. Because doing that to you, hurting you. It tore me apart. I hated that I couldn’t fix it, and I hated that I made you hate me. I hated myself for a long time too.”</p><p>And Rio turned her body too, listening.</p><p>“I wasted so much time hating myself and living for someone else. I spent my whole life trying to forget you, but there was always some part of my brain that was yours, some part of me. You just…never quite left.”</p><p>“Why are you saying all this now?” She softly asked.</p><p>“Because it’s different this time.” Agatha quietly reasoned. “Because I think our spot deserves a better ending. Because I love you and I want a life with you. Because I have spent most of my life in love with you, looking for you, missing you. Because I promised to always keep you in mind, and I did. I always have. I always will.”</p><p>Rio stared, breathing shallow.</p><p>“And because, I’m not losing any more time with you.” She said, eyes welling, and reached into her pocket where the ring was nestled.</p><p>She purposely left the box at home so as not to tip Rio off right away. Agatha had debated getting down on one knee, but it felt too formal, too chivalrous for their spot. They were never polite about good manners under here, and she wouldn’t start now.</p><p>She held the ring pinched between her fingers, looking as Rio’s eyes widened.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Is it not obvious?” Agatha snarked through her bright smile and tears flowing. “Rio Vidal-”</p><p>“Motherfucker.” Her girlfriend looked almost annoyed. “Noooo-”</p><p>Okay, suddenly she felt a lot less confident.</p><p>She assumed Nicky would be the wildcard, not Rio.</p><p>She had said no.</p><p>Well, more specifically-</p><p>Noooo.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>That was fine.</p><p>No, it was fine.</p><p>She’d have to kill herself tomorrow, but-</p><p>“No?” Agatha echoed.</p><p>Rio scrunched her face in confusion before realizing. “No! No, no, no. I didn’t mean ‘no’ as in- I meant-” She rambled. “Ask me again.”</p><p>“I didn’t even ask you the first time!”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio’s voice was firm. “Ask me again.”</p><p>Either Rio was a bigger sadist than Agatha realized, or she meant it. So, taking a blind leap of faith-</p><p>“Rio Vidal, will you marry me?”</p><p>And that stupid fucking grin, the lopsided one, overtook Rio’s face. “Yes.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You’re so fucking impossible.” Rio murmured before closing the distance, colliding her lips with Agatha’s.</p><p>What Agatha had done to warrant the frustration, she didn’t know. She didn’t really care as Rio pulled her as close as possible and kissed her. They hadn’t kissed under here, at their spot, in too long. So, she kissed her back, she kissed her like she never lost her, like the world stopped. Because Agatha’s did, for twenty years, her world had stopped. She kissed her like she had an eternity to spend doing this and absolutely nothing else, because now, she did.</p><p>After what was probably a very inappropriate amount of time making out, Rio broke away.</p><p>“Not bad.” She whispered it the same way Agatha had after their first kiss.</p><p>Trying to catch up, she knit her brows together. “What?”</p><p>“The ring.” Rio pointed at the jewelry Agatha forgot she was still holding.</p><p>The perfect ring, with a simple gold band and a radiant cut emerald that was several carats too big for something Rio would pick out for herself, but that Agatha couldn’t wait to see on her hand for the rest of her life.</p><p>“How much did you spend on this?” Her fiancée asked as Agatha slid it on her finger.</p><p>“Do you like it?” She asked, holding Rio’s left hand out while she inspected it.</p><p>“I love it.” Rio beamed.</p><p>“Then it doesn’t matter how much I spent.”</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>“What was the no about?” She questioned, more out of curiosity but also as a distraction. She was certain Rio would force her to swap the ring for something cheaper if she knew how much money Agatha had blown on it.</p><p>“I um-” She tucked her tongue against her cheek. “I was going to propose-”</p><p>Agatha jumped up. “I beat you to it, I pulled your ass!”</p><p>“Really? You’re gloating right now?” Rio smirked.</p><p>“You accepted, you’re stuck with me, baby.”</p><p>She stood. “No, I think for the first time in a long time, we’re both free.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her waist. “Don’t make it sappy.”</p><p>“You just proposed to me at our spot, you made it sappy all by yourself.”</p><p>“Shut up.” She smiled as they kissed again, feeling Rio’s hand in her hair, now adorned with the ring.</p><p>Who knows how long they spent like that, like they were eighteen again.</p><p>“WE’RE STILL HERE!” Was shouted after a while from far away, around the trees that surrounded the fence of the field. That voice was definitely Lilia’s.</p><p>Rio kissed her one more time before cocking her head. “What was that?”</p><p>“Nicky and Lilia might’ve been hiding with cameras through everything.”</p><p>“That fucking snake.” Her fiancée muttered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“CAN WE COME OUT NOW?!” And that was Nicky’s.</p><p>She reluctantly let go of Rio and spun around. “ALL CLEAR.”</p><p>They both crossed the field, cameras in hand, Nicky with his film and Lilia with her digital.</p><p>As they approached, Rio crossed her arms. “You lying little fuck.”</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you, dude.” He shrugged. “Be fucking faster.”</p><p>“I need context to know who’s right, right now.” Agatha looked between the two.</p><p>“I asked Nicky like a month ago if he’d be okay with me proposing.”</p><p>Her heart melted a little at that, but she would not cry again. “How chivalrous of you.”</p><p>“It would’ve been if he wasn’t a double agent!”</p><p>He slung his camera over his neck. “I have no loyalty.”</p><p>“That’s my boy.” Agatha looked over at Lilia who was hastily wiping her face. “Are you crying?”</p><p>“No.” Lilia pouted.</p><p>“She was sobbing the whole time, I’m surprised Rio couldn’t hear it.” Nicky grinned.</p><p>“I will expel you.” Lilia grumbled.</p><p>“Okay.” He clapped his hands together. “Well, in that case, I gotta run home and pack a bag.”</p><p>“A bag?” Agatha raised her brows.</p><p>“I’m sleeping over at Billy and Tommy’s tonight.” He avoided eye contact. “Just thought it’d be a good idea.”</p><p>Easier than shouting “Headphones!” as soon as they got home.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s for the best I think.” She agreed.</p><p>“Here.” Rio handed him her keys. “We’ll take your mom’s.”</p><p>As they all left for the parking lot, Lilia yanked Rio next to her, fawning over the ring and asking about wedding details like they hadn’t been engaged for only ten fucking minutes.</p><p>“You guys could do this summer,” Her eyes lit up. “Or fall! Oh do a fall wedding, they’re always so pretty with the leaves changing. And if you need a caterer, I know a guy, great Italian food, he’ll give you a deal if I yell at him loud enough…”</p><p>She held Rio’s other hand and blissfully nodded along until they reached the car. Nicky had a head start, already leaving as Lilia hugged them both before departing.</p><p>Once in the car alone, Agatha started it, grabbing Rio’s hand again and placing a soft kiss to the back of it.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Rio looked over at her like it was the most natural thing in the world. “I love you, too.”</p><p>She had considered making a night of it, a nice dinner reservation, maybe a hotel room in the city. Not at The Four Seasons though, she was pretty sure they were not welcome back there. But something about going home with Rio and spending the night together before ordering in just sounded better.</p><p>When they got home, Rio’s car was in the driveway, as were several others.</p><p>“Fuck.” She muttered as they got out.</p><p>“This is a trap, the bitch trapped us.” Her fiancée added.</p><p>Motherfucking coven.</p><p>“How likely do you think it is that we could make a break for it?” She reached for the handle of the car door.</p><p>The front door swung open-</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, I swear to god!” Wanda yelled.</p><p>“I think we’ve been spotted.” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>She didn’t even tell her friends she was proposing, specifically because she knew they’d pull something like this. And yes, the sentiment was endearing, but it was also prohibiting her from shoving her wife-to-be against a wall right now and fucking her senseless.</p><p>“Calm down, Chucky, we’re coming.” She acquiesced and grabbed Rio, pulling her along into the house.</p><p>They walked in and were greeted very loudly by people. Too many people. More than just Wanda, Jen and Alice.</p><p>Lilia and Nicky were there, Billy and Tommy. Natasha and Yelena. And Agatha swore half of fucking Westview.</p><p>There was a huge banner inscribed with the word ‘Congratulations!’ and fucking waiters going around with trays of drinks.</p><p>“Holy shit.” Rio whispered.</p><p>“I’m feeling very violent at this current moment…” Agatha whispered back.</p><p>To say they were swarmed by guests was a fucking understatement. After being hugged by far too many acquaintances, Agatha finally grabbed her son and pulled him aside from everyone else.</p><p>“You sneaky motherfucker.” She accused.</p><p>“I love you too, mom.” He smiled. “And for the record, I talked down Aunt Wanda from an ice sculpture, so you’re welcome.”</p><p>“Betrayed by my own blood.” She threw her arms up. “Why an engagement party?”</p><p>“I wanted you and Rio to know that I’m good.” He motioned around. “With, ya know, everything.”</p><p>She hugged him. “You traitor. That is so sweet.”</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her. “It’s really not a big deal, I barely did anything after suggesting it. Aunt Jen really took the idea and ran with it.”</p><p>When Agatha pulled away she grabbed his face. “I mean it, this was very thoughtful and I’m so grateful for you.”</p><p>“I’m grateful for you and Rio too.” He mumbled. “Now can you gimme my face back?”</p><p>She did so, but then continued. “Tell me what Rio’s plan was.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What’s the ring look like?”</p><p>“Sparkly.”</p><p>“C’mon, help me out.”</p><p>“I don't know, it was a ring with a stone in the middle.”</p><p>“What cut?”</p><p>“How the fuck would I know the cut?”</p><p>“Did Billy see the ring?”</p><p>“No, why would that matter?”</p><p>“He’d probably know the cut.”</p><p>“Cause he’s gay?”</p><p>“Yeah.” She said like he was dumb.</p><p>“Go find your fiancée and ask.”</p><p>“Then I have to go through the crowd of people and talk to them.”</p><p>“So you’re gonna let your future wife and mother of your child suffer?” He chuckled.</p><p>And there was something in the way he said ‘mother of your child’ that she caught.</p><p>“You’re secretly so excited about this, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I’m the normal amount of excited.” He deflected the same way she does when she’s downplaying something.</p><p>“You are. You’re excited to have Rio as a stepmom and be a big brother.” She teased.</p><p>“Go find your almost wife.”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, love you too.”</p><p>She steeled herself as she weaved through the people she did not invite into her home, finally locating Rio in the living room surrounded by the coven and Lilia.</p><p>“I can plan everything for you guys, I’m kind of amazing at it if you couldn’t already tell.” Jen bragged.</p><p>“Babe, let them enjoy the engagement before you pounce on the wedding planning.” Alice looked at her wife.</p><p>“Can I be your maid of honor? Or best man?” Wanda asked, invading Rio’s personal space.</p><p>“Why would Rio have a best man?” Jen questioned.</p><p>“Just feels right.” Wanda shrugged. “Plus I look really good in a suit.”</p><p>“Rio, honey, have you given any thought to what you’re wearing, because I have connections-” Lilia added.</p><p>She looked like she was calculating how quickly she could escape before her eyes landed on Agatha.</p><p>“Thank god.” Rio grabbed her wrist and tugged her down onto the couch. “You fed me to the wolves.”</p><p>“I did no such thing, and I take no accountability for it.” Agatha tucked herself next to her.</p><p>Natasha quickly walked by, wordlessly handing Wanda one of the glasses of champagne she was holding and smiling.</p><p>She looked to Rio and Agatha. “Congratulations.” And sauntered off, presumably to find Yelena.</p><p>Wanda didn’t say anything, just sipped the champagne as they all stared.</p><p>“What?” She said after swallowing.</p><p>“Wands.” Jen glared.</p><p>“What?!” She insisted.</p><p>“Wanda…” Alice chided.</p><p>“Nothing happened!” Wanda shouted.</p><p>“And on New Years?” Rio raised her brows, waiting.</p><p>“Everyone kisses on New Years, that’s like the whole thing. And that was three months ago, and she lives in New York, and I only just told the twins about Vision.”</p><p>“New York isn’t that far.” Jen taunted.</p><p>“I gotta give it to Natasha, she’s playing the long game.” Alice spoke.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Talk to me after she’s waited twenty years.”</p><p>“Nothing happened!” Wanda shouted again.</p><p>“Methinks the lady doth protest too much.” Lilia chimed in.</p><p>“Really, Lilia?” Wanda gripped her glass in frustration. “Fine, we made out after my New Years party.” She exclaimed in hushed tones. “Vultures, all of you.”</p><p>“I knew it!” Rio yelled and looked at Jen. “You owe me twenty bucks.”</p><p>“You made a bet?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Not fair, you saw her again when you dropped the boys off!” Jen sniped.</p><p>“Then you shouldn’t have taken the bet.” Her fiancée smugly stated.</p><p>“What was the bet?” Wanda looked horrified.</p><p>“That you and Nat had something going on this whole time.” Rio extended her hand towards Jen. “Pay me.”</p><p>Jen grumbled but got the money from her wallet. “As if you need the money.”</p><p>“There’s nothing going on!” Wanda muttered.</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“Good luck, babe!” Jen said as she slapped the twenty dollar bill in Rio’s palm.</p><p>After several more hours, she started kicking people out as respectfully as possible.</p><p>“I will find a landmine to set off if you don’t get these people out of my home.” She whispered over Jen’s shoulder.</p><p>She just wanted to be alone with her fiancée, at this point in the night they should’ve already been on round three of fucking and instead she was listening to everyone’s opinions on wedding planning. Agatha didn’t care who wore a dress or a suit, what the wedding colors were, or picking a date. She’d marry Rio in the middle of a fucking snowstorm, at the courthouse, or just sign the papers while wearing sweatpants and mail them off. She had Rio and that was all that mattered, everything else was just extra. If Rio wanted a big wedding then she’d spare no expense, but right now, she had two decades of longing to make up for.</p><p>Half an hour later, the place was cleared out with the exception of their friends, Nicky had already left with Billy and Tommy.</p><p>“Alice, can I get a ride home? I let the boys take my car.” Wanda said.</p><p>“I can drive you.” Nat offered, standing by the door. “Yelena headed out hours ago.”</p><p>Jen smiled. “Perfect! There’s no room in our car anyways.”</p><p>Wanda’s nostrils flared. “You guys drive a sedan and there’s two of you.”</p><p>Alice shrugged. “My wife said there’s no room, there must not be room.”</p><p>“Thank you for the party against our wills.” Agatha opened the door and watched as they all started filing out. “Now, please get the fuck out.”</p><p>The door closed and she allowed herself to slump against it momentarily, exhaling a deep breath. She pushed herself off and walked to the kitchen where she had last seen Rio.</p><p>She walked in, and no Rio.</p><p>She checked the living room, and no Rio.</p><p>“Baby?” She called with no answer.</p><p>Agatha smiled, striding down the hall and climbing up the stairs.</p><p>“My love?” She called out again as she opened the door to their bedroom.</p><p>And she expected Rio waiting to pounce, maybe in some lingerie, maybe already starting without her. Which was a threat Rio had followed through on more than once. But instead, the door opened and there Rio sat on the bed fully clothed, a little box in her hand. When she had the time to light as many candles as she did, Agatha wasn’t sure, wrangling people out of their house had taken longer than she thought.</p><p>“Stealing my thunder?’ Agatha smirked.</p><p>“If you had waited, I wouldn’t have to.”</p><p>“Have you ever known me for my patience?”</p><p>“Come here.” She extended her hand for Agatha to grab and pulled her onto the bed.</p><p>“I was going to do this at the end of the school year,” Rio said. “In the darkroom with all the pictures I’d ever taken of you hung around. And I had a really sappy thing planned with Nicky-” She huffed. “But I did not fall in love with you for your patience.”</p><p>And she could’ve responded with some quick retort, something clever or witty. But looking at Rio, nothing but how much she loved her came to mind. So she let her keep going.</p><p>“I fell in love with you because you have no patience, or filter. Because you frustrate me and never let me live anything down.”</p><p>“Those don’t sound nice-”</p><p>“But I stayed in love with you all this time because you’re also the only person I wanna talk to after a shitty day. Because you’re not someone who bends, but you do for me, for Nicky. Because you never let a day go by without keeping your promise to me-” Rio’s voice wavered, throat cracking from unushered tears.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand in gentle encouragement.</p><p>“Because despite what you might think, it has never cost me anything to love you, mi amor. Loving you is the easiest thing I’ve ever done.”</p><p>And the way Rio said it, made Agatha start to believe it.</p><p>“I uh, I had a better speech prepared but now I’m just going based off memory, and this all sounded better in my head-”</p><p>“It was good.” She reassured. “I liked it.”</p><p>Her fiancée blew out a breath and opened the box that had been eating away at her. “Agatha Hark-”</p><p>“Yes.” She quietly said.</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish.”</p><p>“You didn’t fall in love with me for my patience.”</p><p>Rio let out a watery chuckle. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>“Well, it’d be awkward to say no now.” She dramatically extended her left hand.</p><p>She grabbed Agatha’s hand and slid the ring on. It had a gold band with an oval cut stone, if she had to guess, maybe sapphire. As she shifted her hand, in some light the stone was navy blue, but she’d shift again and it looked a deep royal purple. And unlike her first engagement ring-</p><p>It was something she’d actually wear.</p><p>“It was my abuelita's, I found it going through mamá’s jewelry box. She never did anything with it, obviously. Because, you know, she had me out of sinful wedlock. But I think she’d like for you to have it, would've made her happy to know that she had a part in this.”</p><p>"I love it.” She clutched her left hand to her chest like the ring was something precious.</p><p>And now it was something she’d never take off.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It wasn’t every weekend, but it was most of them. They’d been engaged a month and those past four weekends went the same way. Agatha put in a sixty hour work week only to get roped into some call or crisis over the weekend.</p><p>And Rio understood, she really did. This is what she was signing up for, her fiancée owned and ran a company. But Jesus fucking Christ it was getting ridiculous. And sue her, she was feeling a bit neglected.</p><p>With the construction of the new house finally underway, Agatha had resorted to one of the half-packed guest rooms to convert into her home office for the meantime. She’d been on a call for at least an hour and at first Rio had been understanding, excusing herself to another guest room serving as her makeshift studio. But once it had hit the three hour mark, she’d hit her limit, packing up her charcoals before washing her hands and sliding her engagement ring back on. It might’ve been beautiful, but it was not conducive to anything artistic.</p><p>Nicky was out of the house with Cassie, who Rio and Agatha had still yet to meet. Though now that she was officially his girlfriend, Rio was guessing her fiancée was going to demand he bring her home soon.</p><p>The one good thing about Agatha’s never ending work calls? She was easier to fuck with. Rio and Nicky had discovered that while on the phone, they could hand Agatha virtually anything and she’d take it without question, too enthralled in whatever she was discussing to notice. One time she was cooking dinner and asked Rio to hand her a knife, and damn near grabbed it blade side first as she talked about quarterly earnings. They made it a game after that, whoever could hand her the most obscure object before she took note, won. Eventually Nicky got too brazen and handed her a literal lamp off the side table in the living room- she actually did almost take it though.</p><p>All this to say, she was confident that Agatha would be distracted enough not to notice Rio trying to distract her.</p><p>She walked down the hall and briefly listened in on the conversation to make sure it wasn’t something important, well, not too important.</p><p>“How many more times are we going to go in this circle, Tony?” Agatha groaned, obviously exhausted with whatever they were discussing.</p><p>She creaked open the door and saw her fiancée at the desk, head tipped back , rubbing her temples.</p><p>“Your mother and I had a deal-” He started.</p><p>“My mother is in prison awaiting trial, I doubt she’s gonna honor the deal anymore than I will.”</p><p>“Agatha, I was promised that Stark smart homes would be fast tracked and rolled out by the end of this year.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha cackled, not yet knowing she was in the room. “Did you get that in writing?”</p><p>“It was a gentleman's agreement.” Tony huffed.</p><p>“I am no gentleman.” Agatha retorted.</p><p>Yeah, Rio was counting on it.</p><p>“And didn’t your daddy ever tell you that verbal contracts aren’t worth shit? He paid enough for your degree, you think you would’ve learned something.” She finally brought her head back, facing forward and locking eyes with Rio.</p><p>“Didn’t your mommy ever tell you that this relationship between our companies is mutually beneficial?”</p><p>“Gimme a sec, Tony.” Agatha muted herself. “I know, I know, I’m sorry.” She held up her hand in apology. “He’s being a little bitch, and I am trying-”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Rio smiled. “I can wait.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced, but she nodded anyway before unmuting herself. “Regardless of how our parents did business, I’m not wasting capital on your self-aggrandizing money grab into the housing market.”</p><p>“You won’t waste capital on it, really? Agatha, I’ve seen what you are wasting your money on-”</p><p>And as Rio overheard how one of the richest men in the world was speaking to her future wife, she felt a lot of things. Anger, hatred, disgust, but most of all, lust. Not because of the man, obviously, but because of how Agatha was speaking to him as if he were no more important than an ant on the sidewalk.</p><p>She didn’t get to see CEO Agatha a lot, most of the time she spoke about work casually, but seeing her like this? All corporate-y and cocky?</p><p>It was turning her on in a way she did not see coming.</p><p>“You hired out union contractors instead of independent ones. That’s money. You extended paid parental leave. That’s eating away at your overhead.  You’re giving people free homes, your profits are shrinking-”</p><p>“I am not giving people free homes, it’s a reduced down payment program for first time homebuyers. And as for the other things you listed, they’ve rehabilitated the company’s image. An image, that might I remind you, my mother incinerated by embezzling and defrauding the company. As for our profits, they have only increased since Evanora was arrested.”</p><p>Rio rounded the desk, standing behind her chair and dipping down to briefly kiss her on the cheek. Something simple and inconspicuous.</p><p>Agatha seemed unaffected as Tony responded.</p><p>“You aren’t making nearly as much as when your mother was in charge…” And even Rio could see the smug look on his face over the line.</p><p>“The snake was about to eat its own tail, you can only gauge people for so much before it all comes crashing down.”</p><p>She gently moved Agatha’s hair out of the way before softly pressing her lips against her neck. Her fiancée’s eyes fluttered shut for a millisecond before snapping open again.</p><p>“Stark smart homes would give Harkness Inc. a much needed shot in the arm, some new life blood.”</p><p>As her lips continued their descent along Agatha’s neck, Rio swore she heard the slightest hitch in her breath. “I don’t want your life blood, Tony. Probably give me hepatitis anyways.”</p><p>She muted herself again, now speaking to her. “Baby, I promise, give me five minutes and I’m all yours.”</p><p>Rio smiled against her neck. “I can do five minutes.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll go to one of your competitors and pitch it to them.” Tony argued.</p><p>She quietly slipped out of the room, bolting to their bedroom and grabbing what she needed before gingerly entering again.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and unmuted herself. “Be my guest, it’ll bankrupt whoever’s dumb enough to agree to the idea and leave a hole in the market for me. People don’t want to live inside an iPad where their blender goes awol anytime you turn on the light in the linen closet.”</p><p>She sounded solidly distracted, looking at her phone instead of Rio.</p><p>“You know, I wasn’t going to do this, but I’ll be nice and offer to absorb the cost of any prototype show homes you build.”</p><p>“I’m not building anything.” She firmly stated.</p><p>Rio leaned over and very fairly whispered. “Can you hold this for me, baby?”</p><p>Agatha took it without looking away from the screen displaying the caller ID.</p><p>“We can do it on the cheap, you’re able to mass produce homes at breakneck speed, it shouldn’t be a problem.”</p><p>She wondered how long it’d take for her to catch on, still oblivious as Rio sunk onto to her knees in front of her.</p><p>“That is a lawsuit waiting to happen and it’s my name on the hovels you’re trying to lure innocent people into spending their life savings on.”</p><p>“Oh, no one with enough money and sense would buy one of these-” He snarked.</p><p>And her fiancée’s head finally turned as she deftly undid the button of her jeans. Eyes bugging in realization of what Rio was doing, and more importantly what she was holding.</p><p>She was already working the jeans down her legs when Agatha spoke.</p><p>“Shut up for a minute.” She barked and muted herself. “Rio, I said five minutes.”</p><p>She threw the denim behind her before hooking her thumbs into the waistband of the lace underwear Agatha had on. “We both know it won’t take me five minutes to make you come.”</p><p>“And the strap?” She questioned, raising it in her hand.</p><p>Rio quirked her eyebrow, “Incentive.” And pulled the lace down too. “Finish your call.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, seemingly trying to pray for strength, set the strap down on the desk, and unmuted herself. “You were saying?”</p><p>“Has dating a commoner robbed you of all pleasantries?” Tony sarcastically asked.</p><p>Apparently.</p><p>And Rio could think of no better time to yank Agatha’s hips to the edge of the chair and surge forward.</p><p>“You speak-” Agatha clamped her mouth shut as Rio’s tongue made contact, holding back a moan. “Speak ill of my future wife again, and I’ll release the emails from your father where he’s complicit in insider trading.”</p><p>Oh, she deserved a reward for that. Rio’s fingers dug into her hip bones as she added more pressure, tongue pressing against her clit.</p><p>Agatha’s hands flew to her hair as her back arched, biting her lip to stay quiet.</p><p>Tony huffed a humorless chuckle. “That would only drag you down with me in the court of public opinion.”</p><p>“I’ll live.” She replied, slightly breathy. “Now, are we done?”</p><p>Not that she wasn’t having the time of her life suffocating between Agatha’s thighs, but fuck, she hoped he’d finally take the hint and fuck off. The sooner this call was done, the sooner her fiancée would retaliate.</p><p>And god, was Rio ready for it.</p><p>“No.” He said. “What do I have to do for you to give me this?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat to cover the moan that had escaped when Rio’s lips wrapped around her clit and sucked.</p><p>“Noth- nothing.” Her eyes fluttered shut. “It’s not happening, Tony, let it go.”</p><p>“You don’t sound too sure there, Harkness. Maybe mommy was the real business woman of the family.”</p><p>Blue eyes snapped open, filled with rage.</p><p>Rio took the cue and backed off, only to have the hands in her hair roughly pull her forward again. Her hips ground down against Rio’s face, the rage encouraging her to take control.</p><p>Now Agatha was angry, on the edge of coming, and had the strap in her arsenal.</p><p>Maybe Rio should’ve been scared for her life, but happily returned her mouth to Agatha’s waiting cunt.</p><p>“Stark, I’m going to say this one more time since men like you have a hard time understanding when a woman tells you no.” Her voice was a lot more solid now despite the fact that Rio could tell she was close. “My mother no longer heads this company, I do. And as the head, I am not sinking one singular cent into your stupid fucking smart homes. Now either get that through your pea brain or fuck off, either way, I will not be coerced by a limp dicked daddy’s boy. Are we clear?”</p><p>Rio sucked harder as she strained in her office chair, slapping her hand over her mouth to muffle the breathy sounds falling out.</p><p>There was a long pause where she heard Tony exhale a deep breath. “Always a pleasure, Agatha.”</p><p>“Wish I could say the same.” Agatha grumbled before hanging up and letting a vicious moan rip from her throat. “God-”</p><p>Still sucking, Rio flicked her tongue over her fiancée’s clit once, twice-</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha shouted as she threw her head back, shaky thighs clamping down around her head.</p><p>She looked up at Agatha through her lashes. “I think that was only four minutes.”</p><p>The steel grip in her hair yanked her upwards until she was spilling onto Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Did you have fun?” Agatha asked, tone cold.</p><p>“The man being there wasn’t ideal, but otherwise, I enjoyed myself.” Rio grinned.</p><p>Her gaze was dark, her chest was heaving, and she looked almost murderous as she lowly spoke. “Get on the desk.”</p><p>Rio scrambled to comply, sitting in front of her, legs spread and waiting.</p><p>Agatha stood, grabbing the harness and slipping it on. Over the past few months, they had explored other options considering Agatha’s first pick didn’t do anything to stimulate her while she was fucking Rio. The one she had on now was both their favorite, about seven inches, not too thick, with a grind pad for the wearer and of course, purple.</p><p>Rio took off her shirt before reaching to undo her jeans, finding Agatha’s hand atop her own helping until they were discarded on the floor. She reached to take off Agatha’s button up when those same hands slapped her away.</p><p>“So fucking needy.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Fine, keep the Winnie-the-Pooh look while you fuck me.” She smirked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but quickly undid the buttons on her shirt and flung it elsewhere.</p><p>When her hand, the one wearing the sapphire ring, snaked up her thigh, Rio thought it might be to take off her underwear. Instead, she just pushed them aside and trailed two fingers through Rio’s slit.</p><p>Agatha cruelly chuckled at how wet she was. “Is this all from you getting on your knees for me? From me using you like that?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio breathed out.</p><p>The pair of digits teased her entrance before dipping in ever so slightly. “How desperate are you?” She whispered and brought her lips to skim along Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>“So fucking-” Rio choked on her words as Agatha’s fingers sunk in. “Baby…”</p><p>“Answer me.” She said, thrusting leisurely.</p><p>Her eyes lidded. “So desperate for you.”</p><p>“Mmmh.” Was all she responded with as she brought her free hand to the cup of Rio’s bra and pulled it down enough to where she could take one of her nipples into her mouth.</p><p>The strap was resting against her thigh, she could feel how close it was, but her fiancée didn’t seem to have any intention of using it.</p><p>“Please, mi amor.”</p><p>“Please what?” Agatha asked, as if she hadn’t the slightest idea as to what Rio could want.</p><p>Unlike Rio, Agatha liked to make her work for it, liked to make her beg. And Rio loved it just as much, but she couldn’t withstand the torture right now. She had to choose her next move carefully, something to make Agatha snap. Something that would end with her getting railed on this desk and quickly.</p><p>Two little words sprang to mind, ones she knew would get her everything she wanted-</p><p>“Use me.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up from where she was leaving a hickey on her tit, pupils blown wide.</p><p>“What was that?” She asked, even though she heard perfectly well the first time.</p><p>Fingers left her as she repeated herself. “Use me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled the same way a fucking cartoon villain does.</p><p>Rio had apparently chosen the right words.</p><p>Her underwear was hastily ripped down her legs before Agatha lined herself up. “Beg for it.”</p><p>She did not need to be told twice.</p><p>“Please use me, baby. Please, please. I need you to use me.”</p><p>One hand flew up to grip her throat while the other guided the strap forward, teasing.</p><p>“You sure you’re ready?”</p><p>Now she was just being cruel, they could both see the way she was practically dripping onto the desk, probably ruining whatever fucking spreadsheet she was sitting on.</p><p>“I’m ready, baby, please-” Her voice broke.</p><p>Agatha gave her neck a quick squeeze before finally slowly sinking her cock into Rio, not stopping until she had bottomed out.</p><p>She involuntarily mewled at the feeling, the feeling of being so fucking full, the feeling of her walls stretching to accommodate her fiancée.</p><p>“Oh, love.” Agatha offered in false sincerity. “All you needed was my cock and it shut you right up.”</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could say much with the  hand still clutched around her throat and hips slowly pulling back before snapping forward again, but she tried anyway.</p><p>“Ye- yeah.” Rio agreed.</p><p>“Here’s how this is going to go,” Agatha calmly said as she thrusted. “I’m gonna come as many times as I want, you’re going to take it,” She moved both hands to splay on each one of Rio’s thighs and hooked them around her waist. “And you’re not coming till I say, got it?”</p><p>She nodded, her hips now flush with Agatha’s.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t move, just stayed stationary while splitting Rio open.</p><p>She raised her brows expectantly and Rio got the message-</p><p>Words.</p><p>“Got it.” She whimpered, digging her heel into Agatha’s ass to make her move.</p><p>And thank whatever heinous fucking god, at last her fiancée began moving, using her grasp on Rio’s thighs as leverage to drive into her.</p><p>Rio threw her arms over Agatha’s shoulders and dug her nails into her back, dragging angry red lines into the soft expanse of skin. Desperately trying to ground herself as she was, in fact, railed mercilessly on this desk.</p><p>“Fuck, you take me so well, baby.” She heard Agatha whisper, lips brushing the shell of her ear. “Feel so good.”</p><p>The way Agatha was pounding into her at that current moment, she had the fleeting thought of if it was possible to bruise one’s cervix with a silicone dick.</p><p>No, right?</p><p>Right??</p><p>Her eyes screwed shut as she ground her hips down in time with Agatha, feeling the friction against her clit. Her fiancée stuttered in her movements, dropping her head to burrow against Rio’s neck. She didn’t stop thrusting but her hips slowed and Rio felt her body tense and a soft shuddering breath slip from Agatha’s lips. It wasn’t surprising she’d come that quickly, she was already worked up from earlier and something about wielding a fake cock did something for Agatha, she never lasted long while wearing it.</p><p>“Short fuse?” Rio taunted, because she clearly didn’t value her life.</p><p>Agatha lifted her head up to look at her, withdrawing almost completely before slamming back in all in one fluid motion.</p><p>“Fuck!” She yelped.</p><p>“I liked it better when you were quiet.” Agatha brought the two fingers that had previously been inside her up to her lips, and Rio obeyed, opening her mouth and sucking on the digits.</p><p>She could taste herself as she swirled her tongue around them, helpless to stop Agatha’s punishing pace from resuming. All she could hear was the muffled sounds of her own moans and the lude echo of desk creaking under the brutality of Agatha’s movements.</p><p>Rio lost track of how many times Agatha had come while she had been denied. It got worse when her fiancée started playing with her clit as she fucked her, getting Rio so close she could feel her abs locking up, before pulling her hand away or stopping entirely.</p><p>She was splayed out on the desk, body covered in sweat as Agatha came again, biting down into the skin of Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Please, Agatha,” Her voice was hoarse, her plea broken. “Let me come.”</p><p>She looked down at her, satisfied smile plastered on her face. “You need to come?”</p><p>Did she not just fucking say she needed to? If she had anymore fight left in her, she would’ve said as much but instead-</p><p>Rio frantically nodded.</p><p>Agatha seemed to think for a moment before lifting her body from the desk like a fucking ragdoll and sitting back down in her chair, forcing Rio to straddle her. The new angle was somehow deeper, the tip pressing perfectly against her g-spot.</p><p>“Ride me well enough and I’ll consider it.”</p><p>And her body was already tired, the apex of her thighs sensitive, but this woman could tell her to jump off a cliff and she would do it with a smile.</p><p>As she used the last of her strength to lift herself up before sinking back down, Agatha  grabbed a fistful of her hair at the base of her neck. Her head snapped back and her eyes closed as Agatha kissed and nipped along her neck.</p><p>With Rio being around Nicky 24/7, unfortunately they really did have to instate a no hickey rule, well, no visible hickeys. But that never stopped Agatha from biting wherever she could find the space.</p><p>Agatha didn’t help as Rio rode, content to watch her struggle. “You look so good.” She praised.</p><p>It fueled her, snapping her hips faster. “For you…” Rio affirmed, feeling Agatha’s nails on her other hand dragging down her thigh.</p><p>Her fiancée finally lifted her hips, matching Rio’s rhythm, and her eyes nearly rolled back in her skull. Every nerve ending was on fire, her muscles were sore, and she felt that familiar twist of pleasure sitting low in her stomach. She was so close and had been edge too many times-</p><p>Tears were welling in her eyes as pathetic noises dropped from her lips when Agatha looked up from where she had been leaving a mark on the top of Rio’s breast.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>And if Rio had all her faculties right now, she probably would’ve told her to fuck off, but she felt like a puddle. So she simply looked down at Agatha and listened.</p><p>Agatha slung an arm around Rio’s waist, the other still in her hair, matching her hips in time with Rio’s.</p><p>“Come for me.”</p><p>Her body reacted before her brain could, falling apart at the demand. Her back bowed before slumping, feeling her walls pulse around the strap buried inside of her. She vaguely heard herself scream, but couldn’t make out what words she was trying to say. She swore she saw stars behind her eyelids as she shook, clinging to her fiancée like a lifeline.</p><p>Agatha held her, gently rubbing her back, soft little touches as Rio panted for air and came back down to earth.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Rio smiled. “No more working weekends.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I don’t know, it kinda worked out in my favor this time.”</p><p>The next weekend, Agatha didn’t work.</p><p>The weekend after that, was Nicky’s seventeenth birthday.</p><p>Per his request, they didn’t have a party, just the immediate family and a few of his friends. They were in the kitchen with Jen, Alice, and Wanda, the twins and Nicky were at the table fucking around with whatever they had given him for his birthday.</p><p>“Any summer plans?” Alice asked.</p><p>There were only a few days left before the school year ended, and Rio would be off for three months. Before her and Agatha reconciled, she had fully planned to waitress over the break. But now that she had a rock on her finger, a house being built for her, and was about to get a new car, Rio looked forward to holing up in her studio for the summer. They also talked about taking a family vacation, a real one, like one that required getting on a plane.</p><p>“Is that your not so subtle way of asking about wedding planning?” Agatha raised her brows as she frosted Nicky’s cake.</p><p>Because yes, of course this woman would make her son a cake from scratch.</p><p>Jen swiped some frosting from the bowl. “Well? Where are you guys with wedding planning?”</p><p>Agatha smacked her hand away. “Jesus, Kale!”</p><p>“We haven’t given it much thought.” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“What about family planning?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“What about it?” Agatha glared.</p><p>“You guys said you wanted a second kid, might wanna get on that-” Wanda raised her hands in defense.</p><p>Yes, they were overtly aware of that fact, and had discussed possibly starting that process this summer too. After researching reciprocal IVF, Rio thought it best to do it while she had the time off work. Teaching while being shot with hormones did not sound enticing, but they had settled on the plan of it being Rio’s egg, and Agatha carrying. And they had been through worse, so if she had to repeatedly stab herself to get her fiancée pregnant, she’d grin and bear it.</p><p>“What are you insinuating?” Agatha cocked her head.</p><p>“Just, ya know, you’re both getting older…” Wanda mumbled.</p><p>Agatha stopped her task. “Stay out of my uterus, Carrot Top.”</p><p>“No, Wanda’s right.” Jen spoke. “Your chances of conceiving and then carrying are slashed by forty.”</p><p>Rio gave her a death stare.</p><p>“Fine.” Jen deadpanned. “What do I know, right? Just went to fucking med school…”</p><p>Agatha looked like she was about to bite back, when the doorbell rang.</p><p>“I got it!” Nicky bolted up and down the hall.</p><p>“Who’s that?” Alice craned her neck to try to see from where she sat at the island.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Fuck if I know, we know like five people and all of you are already here.”</p><p>Nicky reappeared in the kitchen, a blonde girl following close behind.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha with wide eyes, Agatha looked back at her, just as shocked.</p><p>He hadn’t mentioned he was inviting Cassie, probably so Rio and Agatha couldn’t plan to embarrass him ahead of time.</p><p>Nicky approached the island where they were talking and flourished his hand at her.</p><p>“Cassie, my parents.” He said to her before looking at them. “Parents, Cassie.”</p><p>She smiled. “Hi, Ms. Harkness, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>Okay, maybe Wanda and Jen did have a point, because now she felt really fucking old. Now she understood why her mom only ever wanted to go by Victoria.</p><p>Agatha set down the knife. “It’s so good to finally meet you!” She smiled wide before dropping her face. “Never call me that again.”</p><p>“Oh,” Cassie’s face fell. “Sorry, I-”</p><p>“She’s fucking with you.” Nicky comforted.</p><p>“Please excuse her, she's a little abrasive.” Rio smirked. “Nice to meet you, Cassie.”</p><p>“You guys too,” Cassie recovered. “It’s nice to finally meet Nicky’s moms, he talks about you constantly.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio both looked at him.</p><p>“Does he?” Agatha gasped.</p><p>“No I don’t.” He shook his head.</p><p>Cassie chuckled. “Yes you do.”</p><p>“No, no, I don’t.” He averted eye contact.</p><p>Rio poked his shoulder. “Don’t gaslight your girlfriend, mijo. I know you were raised better than that.”</p><p>“Cassie,” Agatha slung her arm around her shoulder, and started walking away with her. “I would just love to hear everything he’s said.”</p><p>“Oh my god, he showed me all the photos from the engagement, he was so proud of them!” Cassie said, voice getting further away.</p><p>“You like pictures, Cassie?” Agatha quipped.</p><p>Nicky looked at Rio. “That’s not gonna end well for me is it?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’d hide the baby pictures now if I were you.”</p><p>After cake, Nicky opened more presents, he had a few left as everyone sat around the table.</p><p>He grabbed a gift bag and started rustling through it. “Who’s this from?”</p><p>Wanda smiled. “Me!”</p><p>Nicky pulled out the tissue paper before unraveling a folded t-shirt. His eyebrows shot up, his face trying to stay neutral. Cassie next to him saw the shirt and started laughing.</p><p>“I almost got you one of those.” She teased him.</p><p>“I noticed you had a gap in your wardrobe.” Wanda deviously smiled.</p><p>“Well don’t leave us waiting in suspense,” Agatha said. “Let us see.”</p><p>Nicky huffed and turned the shirt so the rest of the table could see it.</p><p>“Oh my fucking god-” Rio grumbled through her smile.</p><p>Alice threw her head back and laughed. “Wanda!”</p><p>The white shirt had black text written across it-</p><p>‘I love my two moms’</p><p>With a little red heart where ‘love’ would go.</p><p>“It also comes in a onesie version.” Wanda side-eyed Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“Thanks Aunt Wanda.” Nicky politely smiled. “I’ll cherish it forever.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio stood. “Time for our present.”</p><p>Agatha stood too. “It’s in the driveway.”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up. “You got me a car?!”</p><p>“Don’t know.” Rio shrugged. “Gonna have to check to find out.”</p><p>He briefly looked at Cassie before sprinting out of the house.</p><p>Everyone followed outside to meet Nicky in the driveway where he stood, looking around.</p><p>“Where is it?” He asked.</p><p>The only cars in the driveway were Rio’s and Agatha’s.</p><p>Rio walked up next to him, handing him her keys. “Treat her well, mijo.”</p><p>He looked down at the keys in his hand. “These are the keys to your car.”</p><p>“No, they’re the keys to yours.” She corrected.</p><p>“You’re giving me the Honda?”</p><p>“Her name is Joan.” Rio informed. “Like Joan Jett.”</p><p>“God that’s dykey of you.” Jen murmured.</p><p>Rio flipped her off.</p><p>“What’ll you drive?” He asked.</p><p>“I’m going to the dealership tomorrow.” Agatha said. “The lease was up on my car, so I just bought it and gave it to Rio. She drives it more than me at this point anyways. I’ll pick something else out.”</p><p>Because her future wife could just do that, just pick out a new car on a whim.</p><p>“Not to sound ungrateful,” Nicky scrunched his face. “But couldn’t you have just kept your cars and gotten me a new one?”</p><p>“Gotta keep you humble.” Rio smiled.</p><p>He chuckled, “Thank you.” And hugged her before hugging Agatha too.</p><p>He turned to Cassie, Billy, and Tommy, flashing the keys. “Wanna take it for a spin?”</p><p>All the teenagers agreed, walking over to the car.</p><p>Billy reached for the passenger side door before Nicky slapped his hand away. “Dude, get in the back.”</p><p>“I always ride shotgun!” Billy said.</p><p>“Not when my girlfriend is here!”</p><p>Billy groaned but got in the back.</p><p>Nicky opened the door for Cassie and dorkily bowed. “M’lady.”</p><p>She giggled and got in. “Thanks.”</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio. “I think you’ve rubbed off on him too much.”</p><p>She grabbed her waist as they watched Nicky back out of the driveway.</p><p>“Oh, you don’t even know.”</p>

<p>“Sssss” Rio hissed. “Fuuuucking bitch.”</p><p>Agatha looked up from where she knelt in their bathroom, face twisted with concern.</p><p>“Not you.” She quickly corrected, holding the hem of her shirt with a white-knuckle grip.</p><p>Agatha retracted the needle from her fiancée’s abdomen. “You think you’d be used to it by now.”</p><p>Rio dropped her shirt. “You try getting injected with hormones ten days in a row and tell me how you feel.”</p><p>“I’ll be pushing the kid out, you really wanna compare struggles right now?” She snorted and threw out the needle.</p><p>“And when that happens, I will show you empathy. But right now, I’m bloated and hot, and why the FUCK is there not an easier way of doing this by now!?”</p><p>“Because medicine hates women.” Agatha deadpanned, putting the IVF medication back in the cabinet.</p><p>Rio’s lip quivered and her voice broke. “I feel crazy.”</p><p>And in short, she was.</p><p>After Nicky’s birthday, they made an appointment at a private practice, starting the process of getting pregnant. In tandem, they were also wedding planning and in constant contact with contractors over the house being built. It’s like they were speedrunning trying to catch up on life, the one they had missed out on for twenty years.</p><p>As a result, Rio had started injections so they could collect her eggs, and it had been…interesting.</p><p>The first day, she squirmed a little around the needle but felt no different. The third day, she had a meltdown in the kitchen when Nicky had forgotten to tie off the full garbage bag. By day five, Agatha woke up to Rio angrily whipping the covers off their bed because of a hot flash. Day seven was easily the worst, Rio had been playing a video game with Nicky in the living room and was killed for the millionth time when she chucked the controller at the TV and shattered the screen completely. Then she felt guilty and started sobbing uncontrollably, crying about how she was acting like incel for raging over pixels.</p><p>Agatha and Nicky had taken all the outbursts in stride, just letting her do what she needed in order to be comfortable. It was the side effects of the hormones, and honestly, usually Rio was the level-headed one of the two of them, so she got to be a little crazy, she was doing it for them.</p><p>That being said, Agatha could not wait for these fourteen days to be up and the implantation process to happen.</p><p>Agatha grabbed her waist without thinking, and Rio winced, her stomach tender from the shots. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>“You’re not crazy, you’re putting your body through a lot.” She softly spoke. ”You’re making sacrifices for our kid already and she’s not even here yet.”</p><p>“We don’t know if it'll be a girl.” Rio wiped her eyes.</p><p>“Yes we do, I willed for Nicky to be a boy. I’ll do it again.” Agatha smirked.</p><p>“You think you forced your body into creating an XY chromosome?”</p><p>“I don’t think, I know.”</p><p>“That’s not how science-”</p><p>“I know it’s not how that works, but I still did it.”</p><p>“Why’d you want a boy so badly?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a tired breath. “Because I knew how my mother would treat a girl.”</p><p>And usually Rio would comfort her, say the perfect thing and make it all better. But Rio wasn’t really Rio right now, so-</p><p>Her eyes flooded. “That’s so fucking sad!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and wrapped her arms gently around her fiancée, pulling Rio into her chest.</p><p>“Don’t laugh at me.” She blubbered.</p><p>“I’m not laughing at you, I’m laughing at the hormones, love.”</p><p>“Hey guys, you ready-” Nicky walked in, stopping when he realized Rio was crying. “What caused it this time?”</p><p>Rio whipped around and looked at him. “What caused it? I’m being pumped full of shit to make my ovaries work overtime! My insides feel like they’re about to explode and your grandmother is a cunt! That’s what fucking caused it, mijo!”</p><p>He stared, eyes wide. “Right…”</p><p>“What do you need, hon?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I was just, uh, asking you guys if you were ready to go.” He spoke like Rio was a horse he was trying not to spook.</p><p>She looked at Rio. “You still want to?”</p><p>“Yeah,” She sniffled. “It’ll be good to get out of the house, I’ve been cooped up here losing my mind for over a week.”</p><p>“You sure you’re good to be around people?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Rio glared at him. “Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p>“I-” He started.</p><p>“Hon,” Agatha interjected, sparing her son from another meltdown. “Walk away.”</p><p>He nodded, throwing his hands up in surrender and slowly backing out of the bathroom.</p><p>They all climbed in the car, Agatha’s brand new SUV, probably overkill considering Nicky was almost an adult and they’d only have one kid at home in a year but she liked the idea of having a family car so she bought it. They were going to Alice and Jen’s house for a barbeque that was explicitly not celebrating the fourth of July, even though it fell on that day.</p><p>As they pulled up, all three turned their heads to check on the process of the new house. It was started in May and Agatha had paid too much fucking money to expedite the process of getting it built. It was craftsman style, five bedrooms, a huge porch with white pillars holding up the roof. The siding was a sage green because she let Rio pick that, but the trim was a warm wood tone, and the ceiling in the living room was vaulted.</p><p>Or at least it would be a craftsman style home with all of those features, right now it was just a shell. Construction was supposed to be done by September, but every day there was a call about something. As long as it was done before another kid was here, she’d consider it a win.</p><p>“I thought I told them that the porch should end ten feet from the boundary line.” Agatha muttered as they all got out.</p><p>“They’re not done yet, mi amor.” Rio chided.</p><p>“I think it looks good.” Nicky shrugged.</p><p>“Remind me to call the contractors on Monday.” She said.</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Okay.”</p><p>They walked through the gate to the backyard where everyone was, and Wanda immediately bound up to them.</p><p>“There’s the blushing brides!”</p><p>Rio had her Ray-Bans on and peeked over them in disdain. “Too perky.”</p><p>“What?” Wanda questioned.</p><p>“We’re having a day.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio chuckled. “Are WE?”</p><p>“I’m going to run far, far away from here.” Nicky smiled and walked off to find Billy and Tommy.</p><p>“Why are you more apathetic than usual?” Wanda scrunched her face.</p><p>“Yeah, what crawled up your ass and died?” Jen shouted from the deck.</p><p>“Suddenly I understand what family annihilators feel.” Her fiancée grumbled.</p><p>Jen walked down the steps. “Seriously, you look terrible.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to say anything when her future wife had left the house in stretchy shorts and a wrinkled shirt with her hair in a messy bun, but Jen could, Agatha would plan her a lovely funeral.</p><p>“You look terrible all the time, what's your excuse, Jen?” Rio barked.</p><p>She looked at Rio inquisitively. “I rarely ask this, because it usually stems from a place of misogyny, but now it’s actually genuine– are you PMSing or something?”</p><p>“I fucking wish!” Rio shouted.</p><p>Agatha huffed. “It’s the shots.”</p><p>Wanda beamed. “You guys are doing IVF?”</p><p>“More like it’s doing me.” Rio pushed some of the loose hairs framing her face behind her ear.</p><p>“Fuck, am I so happy with my life choices.” Alice chimed in from where she stood at the grill.</p><p>Wanda ignored her. “Why didn’t you guys say anything?”</p><p>“Because,” Rio said as if they were all stupid. “If it doesn’t work, then you’ll make a big thing of it.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha agreed. “Apparently my pregnancy would be considered geriatric, so I'm really feeling confident.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “And what’d you say when the doctor told you that?”</p><p>“I was completely rational about it.” She shrugged.</p><p>“She threatened to break his nose if he said it again.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“Yeah….rational.” Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Between this, the house, and a wedding,” Her fiancée whined. “Can we just fucking elope?”</p><p>“Fuck yes.” She replied before Rio was finished speaking.</p><p>Alice, Jen and Wanda didn’t seem to agree.</p><p>“What about us?” Wanda exclaimed. “I already had a suit picked out!”</p><p>“I have a list of vendors for nothing?!” Jen sniped.</p><p>Alice closed the grill lid and walked over. “I was really just looking forward to the open bar.”</p><p>“Thank you all for the support, I need a drink.” Agatha spoke and went in search of alcohol.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be drinking if you’re trying to get pregnant!” Jen called after.</p><p>“Worked out just fine for me when I was twenty-one!”</p><p>Near the end of the night, all the adults sat around the bonfire talking while Nicky and the twins played football. Well, Nicky and Tommy played football, Billy tried not to get hit with the ball.</p><p>“When are you guys doing the embryo transfer?” Jen said.</p><p>“Whenever we know we have embryos to begin with.” Agatha said and sipped her beer.</p><p>Alice poked at the fire. “So would you guys get married before or after?”</p><p>“Who cares? We’re basically married anyways.” Rio answered from where she sat on Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“We could do it when we take that family vacation.” She offered. “All we need is you, me, and Nicky.”</p><p>“What the fuck-” Jen threw up her hands. “We’re family too, bitch.”</p><p>“Yeah...bitch.” Wanda nodded.</p><p>“I have just enough rage in my body to smack whoever calls my wife a bitch next.” Rio smirked.</p><p>“Just let us go with you!” Wanda pouted.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “We don’t even know where we’re going yet.”</p><p>Alice gasped in realization. “Fiji!”</p><p>They all looked at her in curiosity.</p><p>She continued. “Remember when you threw up on your wedding day after seeing me and Jen fucking in the bathroom?”</p><p>“That’s so problematic of you, baby.” Rio joked.</p><p>“It was because I had to marry Ralph!” Agatha shouted before looking over to Nicky. “Sorry, hon.”</p><p>“Hey,” He caught the ball. “I get it.”</p><p>“We said we should escape to Fiji!” Alice smiled. “So we could all go to Fiji, drink on the beach for a week and be there for when you guys get hitched.”</p><p>“Kind of poetic.” Agatha raised one brow.</p><p>Rio laughed. “You also thought fucking under the bleachers was poetic.”</p><p>“It was.”</p><p>“It wasn’t.”</p><p>“I could do Fiji next month.” Jen said.</p><p>“Me too!” Wanda raised her hand.</p><p>“I could close the store for a week.” Alice added.</p><p>“What do you think, my love?” Agatha looked at her fiancée.</p><p>She meant it, she’d marry Rio anywhere, and if that meant Fiji, then all the better.</p><p>“Only if Lilia will come.” Rio spoke.</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed. “Lilia?”</p><p>“She got ordained in the hopes we’d ask her to marry us.” Rio grinned.</p><p>“Okay so barring Lilia’s schedule...” Alice lit up. “Fiji?”</p><p>Agatha looked at Nicky. “Hon? Fiji?”</p><p>“Oh hell yeah.” He agreed without even looking away from Tommy.</p><p>Agatha looked at everyone else. “Fiji.”</p><p>As it turns out, Fiji is a bitch.</p><p>After some very light research, her and Rio discovered that the country doesn’t allow same-sex marriage. It didn’t really matter considering they’d file the marriage license in New Jersey and just sign it at the actual ceremony, but it still pissed her off.</p><p>Regardless, at the beginning of August, everyone boarded a plane for the resort. It was one of those luxury ones with individual bungalows on the water, and because her friends were moochers, Agatha paid for them all.</p><p>The travel group consisted of herself, Rio and Nicky, obviously. Alice and Jen, Wanda sans the twins because Vision had finally gotten his own place, and Lilia. When Rio had asked her to marry them, Agatha swore she had never seen a grown woman wail so incredibly loudly.</p><p>As they all waited for their keycards in the lobby, Alice poked her.</p><p>“Hey,” She whispered. “We finally made it to Fiji.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha smiled and looked at where Rio and Nicky stood, fucking around and playing that stupid hand slap game. “We did.”</p><p>“Nicholas!” Rio sarcastically scolded as he smacked her hands in victory.</p><p>He shot his arms up. “Fuck yeah, I finally won!”</p><p>“Only took you almost a year.” She deadpanned.</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you, be fucking faster, dude.” He smirked.</p><p>“You cheated!”</p><p>“I did not, you were just staring at mom!”</p><p>Rio quickly raised her brows. “Yeah I was…”</p><p>Lilia walked passed and pinched her. “Stop traumatizing your son!”</p><p>“Yeah, stop traumatizing me.” Nicky smugly echoed.</p><p>They all dispersed to their respective bungalows, when Agatha walked into theirs, she immediately collapsed on the bed.</p><p>She felt Rio lay next to her and play with her hair. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>After the egg retrieval process, they got the call that eight eggs made it, from that they got four embryos, one of which they had already implanted in mid July. With the chances of conceiving and carrying already so low, and the chance of the pregnancy not sticking so high, Agatha and Rio didn’t tell anyone. They didn’t even know if she was pregnant yet, they had to wait fourteen days before taking a test. But then Agatha got scared, so now they were on day nineteen. She just couldn’t handle the possible rejection so close to their wedding, so she decided to put it off until after they got back.</p><p>“Like I just got off a twelve hour flight.” Agatha said against the mattress.</p><p>“You know that’s not what I meant…”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head. “Are you asking me for the millionth time if I feel pregnant?”</p><p>“Well, do you?”</p><p>She snorted. “Nothing yet, but if I upchuck and my tits start hurting, I promise, you’ll be the first to know.”</p><p>“That’s all I ask.”</p><p>The only problem with them keeping it a secret was the fact that they were on vacation with their friends who kept trying to ply Agatha with alcohol. All day, every day, it was mimosas at breakfast, then margaritas on the beach, and wine with dinner. By their fourth night at the resort, their friends started catching on.</p><p>“Who wants shots?” Jen set down her menu.</p><p>Everyone agreed as Agatha just stared down at her menu.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen zeroed her gaze on her. “Shots?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I’m good.”</p><p>“You know,” Wanda said through the piece of bread she was picking at. “I haven’t seen you drink at all during this trip.”</p><p>“Don’t wanna be puffy for the wedding tomorrow, Nicky can only do so much in photoshop.”</p><p>“But Rio’s been drinking.” She pointed out.</p><p>“She doesn’t get puffy.” Agatha dismissed.</p><p>“Yeah, but-” Alice began.</p><p>“Fine!” She huffed. “I will do a damn shot.”</p><p>Rio gave her a look, Agatha gave her a look back, communicating the plan without a word.</p><p>Her fiancée gave a subtle nod and took a deep breath.</p><p>A few minutes later, the shots came and everyone clinked their glasses together before throwing them back. As it happened, Agatha watched, pretending to take the shot. Nicky looked at her, cocking his head. After Rio had done hers, she hastily gave Agatha her empty glass before shooting her full one. Nicky’s eyes bugged, understanding what was happening.</p><p>She smiled and placed a finger to lips and silently shushed him.</p><p>Everyone swallowed the booze and looked forward again.</p><p>“Fuck-” Rio choked out, contorting her face.</p><p>“Since when can’t you handle a shot?” Wanda taunted.</p><p>Rio could handle a shot, what she couldn’t handle was two shots in the span of time it took everyone else to do one.</p><p>Rio scowled. “Must be getting old.”</p><p>Wanda did not seem convinced, sliding her line of sight over to Agatha. “Right.”</p><p>The next morning, Agatha rolled over in bed and found the other side empty. For some cruel reason her fiancée was hellbent on not seeing one another on the day of their wedding until the ceremony. So Rio must’ve gotten up early to head over to Lilia’s bungalow. As she got up, she winced ever so slightly, bringing her hands to her chest. They felt tender, kind of like how they felt on her period, or when-</p><p>When she was pregnant with Nicky.</p><p>It was day twenty-two after embryo transfer, long enough to start feeling symptoms.</p><p>Well, symptom, singular.</p><p>And she could just be getting her period, it’d crush her, but it’s plausible.</p><p>A few hours later, Alice, Jen, and Wanda were all in her room. The coven plus Nicky kept running between the two bungalows, he was with Lilia and Rio right now as they helped her get dressed.</p><p>“Did you alter this?” Jen asked as she fiddled with the zipper of the simple silk dress.</p><p>The wedding was on the beach and Agatha had trauma from big frilly gowns, so her and Rio both kept it simple. The dress was a champagne color, flowy but clung to her waist and stopped right at her ankles.</p><p>“I spent like eighty dollars on it, why would I alter it?”  Agatha said as Jen tugged the fabric.</p><p>“Okay, well did you gain weight?”</p><p>“No, it fit perfectly last-” She stopped as her stomach seemingly dropped, a wave of nausea pooling.</p><p>Jen yanked her again, the fabric constricting around her torso.</p><p>“Jen,” She choked. “I can’t-”</p><p>She pulled away, dress half done, and sprinted for the bathroom. She pushed the door open and-</p><p>Wanda was on facetime with Nat, who was currently topless as Wanda smiled like a blushing idiot.</p><p>That was a new development.</p><p>But she couldn’t say anything as the bile rose in her throat, she bolted past the scene, keeling over in front of the toilet and spilling her guts.</p><p>“Oh my god!” Wanda shrieked, throwing her phone on the counter and running over to hold her hair back.</p><p>“What happened?” Jen asked with Alice following behind.</p><p>“I knew it, you’re fucking pregnant!” Wanda gloated.</p><p>Agatha spit out the last of the saliva and looked up. “Yeah and you’re fucking gay!”</p><p>“Huh?” Alice looked between them.</p><p>Agatha smirked, “Her and Nat.” And made a scissoring motion with her hands.</p><p>“Okay that’s not surprising-” Jen widened her eyes. “You’re pregnant?!”</p><p>Wanda pointed at her. “That's why she wasn’t drinking!”</p><p>“Since when?” Alice handed her a tissue.</p><p>“Since right now apparently, I haven’t taken a test yet, and–” She realized her fiancée needed to be here. “Shit, can somebody grab Rio?”</p><p>“I thought she didn’t want--” Alice said.</p><p>“It’s her kid doing this to me, fuck her rules.” Agatha bit out, trying not to puke again.</p><p>“I’m on it.” Alice assured and raced out of the bathroom.</p><p>“So you and Natasha, huh?” Jen looked at the ginger.</p><p>“It’s new.” She responded.</p><p>“Yeah, I got that from the whole you having facetime sex at my wedding.” Agatha spoke through another gag.</p><p>“Good for you.” Jen grinned.</p><p>“It wasn’t sex…it was just…”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “Foreplay?”</p><p>“Your dress isn’t zipped all the way.” Wanda observed.</p><p>“Yeah,” She pushed her hair back. “Got a little sidetracked.”</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio’s voice shouted as footsteps ran in from the bedroom.</p><p>Ten seconds later, her almost wife appeared through the door. Rio was dressed in these white linen trousers and a matching vest. Her hair was down and wavy, and Agatha thought she looked stupid hot.</p><p>Rio crouched down next to her.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” She smirked.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Pregnant.”</p><p>Rio gave a small laugh, tears pricking her eyes. “I wasn’t the first to know.”</p><p>“Take that up with your child.”</p><p>Her fiancée gazed at her like nothing else mattered. “You look beautiful.”</p><p>“Thanks, I feel like a princess.” She motioned to herself on the floor next to the toilet.</p><p>Rio leaned in to kiss her, but at that exact same moment, she wretched, turning her head and puking again.</p><p>She felt Rio hold her hair back as she threw up. “I’ll try not to take that personally.”</p><p>“Take that up with your child too.”</p><p>Vomiting aside, the rest of the day went well. Their small, intimate ceremony on the beach went off without a hitch. Lilia officiated while Nicky took photos, Jen and Alice signed the marriage license as their witnesses. Afterwards they had dinner at a private table overlooking the ocean, Wanda made some sappy speech, along with Lilia and the rest of the coven. Agatha assumed it’d end there, when Nicky clinked his glass and stood.</p><p>“Uh, I wasn’t going to say anything, but then Aunt Jen threatened me…” He smiled as he tugged on his suit jacket.</p><p>“Make it good, kid.” Jen glared.</p><p>“Um, my mom and I have been alone for a long time, even when dad was around.” His face sobered. “And I know that couldn’t have been easy, especially now that I know everything.”</p><p>Fuck, she was already crying, and would definitely blame on pregnancy hormones later.</p><p>“But despite it all, I think my mom did a great job. She picked me up when I fell, and supported me in anything I wanted to do. We may have been alone but it never felt that way because she was always there.”</p><p>She felt Rio lace their fingers together as they listened.</p><p>“And Rio,” He looked at her. “I know I don’t say it a lot, but I like you being a part of my family. I’m not used to having someone else care about me and love me the same way mom does, and it’s been really…” Nicky cleared his throat, probably to cover for him starting to get choked up. “It’s been really nice.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her wife, who was smiling and blinking back tears.</p><p>“I’m really happy that you’re my step–” He took a breath. “That you’re my mom now too.” He anxiously fixed his tie. “And, uh, I love you guys and I’m sure I’ll love whatever demonspawn sibling you give me.”</p><p>They stared at him, the whole table quiet.</p><p>He looked at everyone. “Okay, that’s it, don’t make it weird.”</p><p>Agatha got up and walked over to him, pulling him into a bruising hug.</p><p>“The speech was good.” She said as he hugged her back.</p><p>“Thank god, Jen said she’d set my PS5 on fire if it wasn’t.” He pulled away.</p><p>Rio got up and hugged him too. “Thank you for that, mijo.”</p><p>He threw his arms around her wife. “No problem,” Nicky waited for a beat, almost summoning the courage to continue. “Mami.”</p><p>When they got back to the states, it was just in time. They had forgone a real honeymoon, just opting to stay in Fiji for a few extra days after everyone else had gone home.</p><p>It was August fifteenth when Agatha walked into their kitchen and found Rio and Nicky eating breakfast together.</p><p>She dropped the bouquet of azaleas on the island. “Get dressed.”</p><p>Her wife looked up from her cheerios. “Why?”</p><p>“We have a visit to make today.”</p><p>“A visit?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“It’s August fifteenth.” She looked at her wife.</p><p>Rio dropped her spoon. “Fuck, how’d I forget?”</p><p>“There’s been a lot going on, baby.”</p><p>“Or I’m just a shit daughter.”</p><p>“What’s so important about today?” Nicky looked at them.</p><p>Rio sighed. “It’s the anniversary of my moms death.”</p><p>“We’re going to the cemetery.” Agatha said. “You guys get dressed, I’m going to go throw up again.”</p><p>Unlike her last pregnancy, when she was in her early twenties and barely felt the symptoms, this time around she felt every symptom.  Her morning sickness was around the clock, she had to pee every hour, and she couldn’t smell eggs cooking without wanting to hurl.</p><p>They arrived at the Westview cemetery less than an hour later, walking down the path until they were at Victoria’s grave.</p><p>She handed Rio the bouquet, giving her hand a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Her wife placed the flowers in front of the headstone, wiping off any dirt or grime that had accumulated.</p><p>“Hey, mamá.” Rio said as she sat down.</p><p>Agatha sat down next to her, Nicky silently sitting on Rio’s other side.</p><p>“I'm sorry I haven’t made more of an effort to visit,” She sniffled. “Life got a little crazy since the last time I saw you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and rubbed a gentle hand on her wife’s back.</p><p>“I got married. You were right, eyes don’t lie.” She wistfully smiled. “And I finally gave you a grandkid, or well, grandkids. Plural.”</p><p>Rio took a shaky breath.</p><p>“I wish you could’ve been here to see it all.” Her wife wept. “I wish it didn’t take you going for this to happen.”</p><p>She saw Nicky grab her hand, trying to offer comfort.</p><p>“And I miss you everyday.”</p><p>Nicky looked at the headstone. “Uh, I know we never met, but thanks for the name.”</p><p>Rio looked at him and chuckled. “Oh, please, she probably fucking loves it.”</p><p>After a little more time, they all got up and started heading for the car, but Agatha hung back for a moment.</p><p>She looked at Victoria’s headstone.</p><p>“I promise to take care of her.” Agatha softly whispered.</p><p>“I promise you…” She thought back to the last time she saw her mother-in-law, June 2nd 2009, and parroted the same words Victoria had said to soothe her.</p><p>“I’m here.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio sat in her shoebox apartment at thirty-seven years old, on Christmas day 2024, as her mom unboxed their chinese food.</p><p>“I told you, mija, it’s nothing serious.” Victoria spoke, emptying her lo mein onto her plate.</p><p>“If it’s not serious then why didn’t you tell me sooner?” Rio picked at her rice.</p><p>“Because I didn’t want you to worry over nothing, it’s probably benign.”</p><p>About five minutes earlier, her mom had mentioned getting a skin graft over a suspicious looking spot on her forearm. Her mom had mentioned it in passing, waving off any concern.</p><p>“And if it’s not?”</p><p>Victoria smiled. “It will be.”</p><p>“Do you need me to come home?”</p><p>“You are home.”</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Mija,” Victoria set her fork down. “You have a life here. Work, friends, god forbid maybe a girlfriend one day-”</p><p>“Mamá…” Rio scolded.</p><p>“It would only hurt, is what I’m trying to say.”</p><p>“I would, you know.” Rio softly admitted. “If you needed me to.”</p><p>“I know.” Victoria grabbed her hand and smiled. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p>Her and Victoria spoke on the phone every week without fail, so when Rio hadn’t heard an update, she assumed it was because everything had come back clear. Until August came.</p><p>Rio was at a shoot when her phone rang, she ducked out into the hall and answered.</p><p>“Mamá, I’m at work right now, can I call you back?”</p><p>“Rio,” Victoria’s voice wavered. “You need to come home.”</p><p>And it was the way she said, so resolutely. Knowing Rio’s vow never to return, knowing how painful it would be, knowing that Westview was like one giant scar.</p><p>Maybe that’s why her mom didn’t tell her when her health declined, when the cancer had spread. Maybe she kept Rio in the dark for so long out of love, out of the need to protect her.</p><p>She thought about that phone call a lot as time went on, about if she had gotten it earlier. If Victoria could’ve been there even for a fraction of her and Agatha reuniting.</p><p>She’d never forget the way her heart dropped during that call, how everything fell apart so quickly, and how she came back to Westview with her childhood home half packed up.</p><p>Rio was thirty-nine when she got a similar call from her wife. It was the middle of the school day in November, and she was helping some freshman with the shading on his self portrait when her phone rang in her back pocket.</p><p>She peeked at the caller ID, and since she wasn’t stupid, she picked up.</p><p>“Baby, I’m at work right now, can I call you back?” She whispered so the teenagers wouldn’t give her shit.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice wavered. “You need to come home.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped, along with her breathing.</p><p>“Are you okay? What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha was four months along at this point, and though every doctor's appointment confirmed that the baby was fine, they never felt quite out of the woods. They were both nearing forty and were constantly on high-alert, or well, Rio was.</p><p>She made sure Agatha took her prenatal pills and checked her blood pressure. She didn’t let her wife lift anything heavier than a pound, just in case, and especially nothing over her head. She begged Agatha to cut back her hours at work, making sure the first thing she did when they moved into their brand new home was set up Agatha’s home office so she wouldn’t have to commute to the city as often. Rio and Nicky took over most of the chores, even after her wife’s protests, because Rio said she shouldn’t have to be on her feet as much.</p><p>Basically, she hovered over her wife at every possible moment. Agatha had finally snapped the day that Rio offered to help her up the stairs, citing that she wasn’t dying, just pregnant.</p><p>Yeah, she was painfully aware that Agatha was pregnant because her wife jumped her every chance she got. Agatha’s sex drive had always been high, but something about the pregnancy hormones sent it into fucking orbit. Once she was out of the first trimester, Agatha was constantly trying to fuck her. Not that Rio had a problem with it, quite the opposite.</p><p>Because in turn, Rio felt feral around her wife. Maybe the hormones were rubbing off on her, maybe it was some primal fucking parental urge, maybe it was her wife becoming even hotter than she ever thought possible. All she knew was that it was like their honeymoon stage all over again. Fortunately, Nicky’s room was on the other side of the house from them.</p><p>Their master bedroom was off the den on the first floor, along with the nursery. Rio’s studio, Nicky’s room, and the office were all on the second floor. Meaning, they didn’t need to give their son a heads up any time Agatha decided she needed to get railed into another dimension. Which were actual words her wife had spoken to her one night on the couch while they were watching their show together.</p><p>“Just get here.”</p><p>“I have a class-”</p><p>“Rio.” Her wife said in that tone, the tone that let her know this was not a discussion but a demand.</p><p>“Okay,” She agreed, trying not to panic. “Okay, I’ll be there in twenty.”</p><p>After hanging up, Rio told her class to behave while she ran out the door. She sprinted down to the first floor, through the office and burst into Lilia’s office.</p><p>“I need you to watch my class.” She proclaimed, slightly out of breath.</p><p>Lilia looked up from her computer. “Whatever happened to hello? How are you-”</p><p>“I’m serious, Lilia.”</p><p>“I have things I have to do, Rio!”</p><p>“Agatha called me, I need to go home.”</p><p>Lilia stood, now looking as worried as Rio felt. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but if it’s bad-” She didn’t want to finish the sentence, and Lilia seemed to understand.</p><p>“Go, I got it.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Why are you still standing here, your wife is pregnant, go!”</p><p>Rio turned on her heel and sprinted for the main doors. “Thank you!”</p><p>She may not have obeyed every traffic rule and sign as she floored it home, but she’d risk a ticket if it meant getting the fuck home. She haphazardly parked her car, barely checking to make sure it was in park before storming through the front door.</p><p>“Agatha!” She shouted, checking the living room, kitchen, and den. “Agatha!”</p><p>“Baby?” She heard her wife call back from their bedroom.</p><p>Rio nearly tripped over her own feet with the furoscity at which she moved to open their bedroom door. She tried to brace herself for the worst case scenario, if her wife was in their en suite bathroom right now, losing their child. She’d try and make peace with that, make sure Agatha knew it wasn’t her fault, that they’d be okay.</p><p>When she got in the room, she found her wife completely fucking fine. A little too fine, actually.</p><p>She stumbled in, seeing Agatha on the bed, unharmed, and in lingerie.</p><p>“Baby, what the fuck?” Rio panted, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>“What?” She played dumb.</p><p>“I thought there was something wrong with the baby! I thought you were dying!”</p><p>“Nope, we’re good.” Agatha smirked, placing one hand on her bump.</p><p>“I made Lilia watch my class!”</p><p>“Tell her thank you from me.”</p><p>“You made me leave work because you’re horny?!”</p><p>Her wife simply shrugged. “Are you complaining?”</p><p>“No, it’s just…I-” She trailed off, because was she complaining? Why should she complain? Her very sexy, very horny, very scantily clad wife was sitting in front of her ready and waiting.</p><p>“C’mon…” Agatha crawled to the edge of the bed, grabbing at Rio and pulling her in by the belt loop of her jeans. “Be a good boy and help a girl out.”</p><p>Okay, not fucking fair, Agatha was bringing out the big guns.</p><p>There was something addictive about her wife using traditionally masculine terms for her now that Agatha was pregnant. The first time Agatha had jokingly referred to Rio as her baby daddy, Rio pinned her against the wall of the bedroom and fucked her until her wife tapped out.</p><p>Rio looked down at her wife, already working to rid herself of her sweater, leaving her in a beater tank. “Which one?”</p><p>Agatha smiled victoriously. “Vibrating one.”</p><p>Rio quickly ripped off her pants before going to her nightstand where ‘the drawer’ was, opening it and retrieving the strap and securing it to her hips. She returned to her wife, grabbing her head and pulling her into a messy kiss, being rewarded with a groan from Agatha.</p><p>She slipped a hand under the waistband of Agatha’s poor excuse for underwear, feeling how wet she already was. Rio pulled back questioningly.</p><p>“I might’ve pregamed as I called you.” Her wife smirked.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her ribcage. “You were masturbating when you called me, and you still made me come home?”</p><p>“I needed the real thing.”</p><p>And the way Agatha was on the bed, hair wild and untamed, glowing like a fucking otherworldly apparition, feeling no remorse for summoning Rio here in the middle of a work day-</p><p>Just fucking melted Rio.</p><p>Twenty-two years and Agatha’s hold never lessened, now it only grew.</p><p>“Turn over.” Rio graveled out. It was her favorite position to put Agatha in, but it was also one of the very few still available considering her wife’s center of gravity was a little…skewed.</p><p>“Wait…” Agatha lightly pushed Rio back so she could get off the bed before dropping to her knees. “I think you deserve a reward for being so eager to please.”</p><p>She then revered their positions, having Rio sit on the edge of the bed and settling between her thighs. Agatha looked in her eyes as she leisurely licked up the shaft of the strap before swirling it around the head.</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell in quick succession at the view of her wife, pregnant, on her knees, about to blow her.</p><p>One of Agatha’s hands rested on her hip while the other slid under the harness, under her underwear and teasing.</p><p>Rio took two fistfuls of her wife’s hair and watched as the shaft disappeared down Agatha’s throat at the same time she felt two long fingers slowly sink into her.</p><p>“Fuuuuuck-” Her eyes fluttered shut at the sensation but Agatha’s free hand gave a firm tap to her hip, a nonverbal reprimand to open her eyes.</p><p>When she pried her eyes open again, Agatha was still looking up at her, but not for approval like the other times they did this. It was almost a smug, all-knowing look, like she was getting off on the effect she was having on Rio.</p><p>As Agatha’s fingers started to thrust, Rio canted her hips to meet them, effectively pushing her cock further down her wifes throat, hearing little moans and gags as a result.</p><p>She kept herself in check by the fucking skin of her teeth, she didn’t want to cut off airflow to the mother of her child, well not while she was still carrying said child, any other time it would’ve been fair game.</p><p>Her wife’s fingers curled inside of her, causing Rio to moan out. “Oh, fucking, fuck, baby…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just kept moving her head and fingers in tandem pushing her more and more.</p><p>Rio finally lost it when Agatha’s nose brushed her abs, staying there momentarily while her fingers repetitively hit her g-spot over and over again. Her fingers, still twisted around unruly locks scrunched, desperately trying to just hold rather than pull.</p><p>Her back arched as her orgasm crashed into her with no regard or subtlety, just mind-numbing pleasure. She let out a silent scream, leaving her eyes cracked open just enough to see her wife almost smirking around the strap. Which did not help the aftershocks, only prolonging her return to reality.</p><p>She finally let go of Agatha, watching her wife let the strap go with a wet popping sound and smiling.</p><p>She stood again, leaning over to kiss Rio, gently whispering against her lips. “Good boy.”</p><p>And that was Rio’s last straw, pulling Agatha down so her back hit the mattress. She pinned both of her wife’s wrist above her head as she feverishly kissed down her neck, digging her teeth in at the one sensitive spot behind her ear.</p><p>Straddling Agatha was a bit of a challenge, being mindful of her stomach, but it was a small discomfort to deal with if it meant she kept hearing those breathy little noises leave Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Rio let go of her wrists, opting to bring them to palm her wife’s breasts. Agatha had gone up two cup sizes in the past four months, and it made Rio feel carnal. She pushed her bra up and out of the way before licking an already hard nipple, squeezing the neglected breast with her other hand.</p><p>“Rio-” Agatha moaned out, digging her nails into Rio’s back, which quite frankly, was starting to look like a scratching post with how often they were doing this.</p><p>“Yes?” She mumbled, moving her mouth greedily over Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Either fuck me or I’ll tie you down and fuck myself without your help.”</p><p>Rio’s head popped up at the image. Maybe not this time but in the future-</p><p>Yeah, definitely in the future.</p><p>She nodded, finally unclipping Agatha’s bra and pulling her underwear down afterwards. She helped Agatha turn over, making sure she was stable on her hands and knees before situating herself behind her wife.</p><p>“Don’t be gentle.” Agatha groaned.</p><p>Ever since Agatha started showing, Rio had noticeably been not gentle, but more considerate? Not because her wife was any less beautiful, if anything Rio had strangely never been more attracted to her. But because she’d freak herself out about doing something to disrupt the baby or hurt Agatha.</p><p>“Mi amor..”</p><p>Agatha whipped her head back to look at her. “C’mon, pretty boy, your wife needs it.”</p><p>That sentence, strung together with those words, in that fucking order…</p><p>Rio clicked on the strap, hearing the soft hums of the vibration, and reached forward to grab her wife’s hair right at the base of her skull, snapping her head back. “You asked for it.”</p><p>Agatha lowly chuckled, pushing her hips back before Rio could realize, sinking herself onto her cock. “Ahhhhh, god.”</p><p>Even while demanding to be railed, her wife still had the fucking upperhand.</p><p>In retaliation, Rio placed one hand on her wife's hip, forcing her to keep going, taking it all in one fluid motion. Agatha shrieked but immediately crumpled onto her elbows, dropping her head down onto the bed.</p><p>Rio withdrew slightly before thrusting back in, gradually picking up the pace, gripping Agatha’s hips and thighs with the utmost strength. When she was sure her wife could take it, Rio sped up, pushing into again and again at a punishing rhythm. Agatha’s moans were sinful as they ripped out from her throat.</p><p>“Just like-” She bit her lip on a particularly hard thrust. “Just like that, baby!’</p><p>“You look so good for me, love.” Rio husked as she pumped. “Never looked better.”</p><p>Her wife didn’t respond, her face now fully planted against the sheets, her fingers buried in the bedding as Rio continued to drive into her.</p><p>Rio grinned, starting to feel a familiar resistance around the strap. “C’mon, be a good girl and come, your wife needs it.” And gave her wife’s ass a harsh smack.</p><p>And that sentence, strung together with those words, in that order, undid Agatha completely.</p><p>Her wife’s body tensed as she released a guttural moan, the reverberations bouncing off the walls. Rio felt her clamp down on the strap, her orgasm heightened by the vibrations. Agatha twitched momentarily and Rio sat back, pulling her wife along with her. Effectively having Agatha straddle her, with her back pressed against Rio’s front.</p><p>She didn’t move her hips again, just forced Agatha to sit with the strap still turned on as she snaked a hand between her wife’s legs. Rio brought two fingers to Agath’s clit, circling.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha whimpered.</p><p>She placed her hand over her wife’s bump. “You’re so beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha reached behind her head to grab at Rio’s, nuzzling into the crook of her neck. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio didn’t, keeping her fingers moving, adding more pressure. “I love you so much, baby.”</p><p>Her wife didn’t seem to be all there right now, but let out a content sigh against her throat. “Love you.”</p><p>Everything on Agatha was so sensitive with pregnancy, so she knew her wife wouldn't take long to come again.</p><p>“You’re always so pretty around my cock, show me how much you love it.” And pressed hard, circled faster.</p><p>She let out a high pitched wail as she shook on Rio’s lap, straining against herself as she came. After a moment, Agatha slumped back against her, breathless with a hazy look in her eyes.</p><p>“Again.” Her wife muttered.</p><p>Needless to say, Rio did not go back to class that day.</p><p>By month five, Rio and Agatha were waiting in a doctor's office for her twenty-two week scan. Rio liked their doctor enough, and Agatha seemed to feel comfortable with her. Maybe a little too comfortable, laughing and giggling whenever the woman spoke in her thick Russian accent. If Rio were a worse wife, she might say something, but given how much Agatha did not like hospitals and doctors already, Rio decided to let it go.</p><p>The door swung open and the doctor walked in, Rio put a lid on her jealousy, though it didn’t help that the woman was insanely fucking hot.</p><p>“How are we feeling today, Mrs. Vidal?” Dr. Vostokoff asked as she sat down on one of those stools with the wheels on it next to where Agatha laid.</p><p>Her wife groaned. “Morning sickness is almost gone, but my back feels like it’s constantly being snapped in half and not for the fun reason.”</p><p>Melina chuckled, setting up the ultrasound machine. “Well, at least they're not kicking yet.”</p><p>“Oh the day that happens, it is so on.” Agatha pointed an accusatory finger at her stomach. “I’ll remember your betrayal.”</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand before lowering herself to the bump. “No she won’t, all the hormones will make her forget.”</p><p>“Please let me have our child before you radicalize them against me.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Gotta start them young.”</p><p>“Okay,” Melina turned from where she had set up the machine, rolling to Agatha. “Can you lift your shirt for me?”</p><p>“Buy me a drink first, doc.” Her wife quipped.</p><p>And Rio felt totally fine with how Melina giggled a little too hard at that.</p><p>She waved the wand around on Agatha’s stomach, the picture displaying on the monitor in front of them. “Do we wanna know the sex today?”</p><p>Internally, Rio was screaming, yelling, and clawing her own eyes out to know. But expecting parents aren’t supposed to have a preference. They’re supposed to feel lucky enough to have a healthy baby and that be it.</p><p>“What do you think, my love?” Rio looked at Agatha.</p><p>Her wife looked at her like she was stupid. “Fucking, obviously.”</p><p>Melina laughed again, the fucking bitch, and nodded. She looked at the screen intently for a minute, the silence enveloping the room.</p><p>She looked back at Rio and Agatha.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’re having a girl.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding as she looked back at her wife.</p><p>Agatha smiled brightly. “Told you so.”</p><p>Referring to her definitely not real ability to decide an embryos sex with sheer force of will.</p><p>But it didn’t matter, they were having a girl, by some miracle, they were getting everything they wanted.</p><p>“You’re so right, baby.” Rio smiled back.</p><p>They told Nicky when they got home, and he seemed happy for them, if not trying to act casual.</p><p>“Another girl in the house, that’s so fun for me.” He said sarcastically from where he was formatting his portfolio for NYU at the kitchen table.</p><p>Rio was in by the stove, cooking. Or attempting to cook since Agatha was on the couch trying to get comfortable enough to nap.</p><p>“Hey, that bullshit stems from the patriarchy, don’t say that again, mijo.” Rio scolded as she boiled water, which holy shit was boring.</p><p>“Lo siento, mami.” Nicky grumbled, looking at his photos. “Do you think I should add this one?” He held up a print for her to look at.</p><p>She walked away from the stove and took the photo into her hands. It was one from their wedding, they were on the beach and Agatha was looking at Rio. The amount of love in her eyes, even if in black and white, translated so clearly.</p><p>She nodded. “Yeah, clarity is good, so is the exposure. Maybe a little grainy but you could pass it off as your artistic choice.”</p><p>He took the picture back. “Mom, what do you think?” He shouted into the living room, holding it up.</p><p>No response.</p><p>They looked at each other and crept in to find Agatha passed out on her side, blissfully asleep at six pm.</p><p>“Should we wake her?” He asked.</p><p>Rio widened her eyes. “My god man, are you insane?”</p><p>“She’s gonna wake up and her neck is gonna feel fucked!” He defended while grabbing the throw blanket from off the couch, slinging it over his mom.</p><p>“Your mom has not slept at all in the past two weeks, you know who she yells at for that?” Rio whisper-shouted. “Me!”</p><p>“Making a human from scratch seems taxing.”</p><p>“Yeah, and having two people lurk over you while you do it is even worse.” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“Bruja!” Rio dramatically stepped away, grabbing Nicky along with her.</p><p>They both scurried back to the kitchen, pretending nothing had happened. Upon their return, however, Rio saw the pot boiling over.</p><p>“Fuck!” She shouted as she ran over to turn off the stove.</p><p>“Maybe we just order in tonight.” Nicky suggested through his chuckles.</p><p>She threw the pot into the sink. “Yeah, I think so.”</p><p>The next weekend, Rio and Agatha were in the nursery as they waited for their friends to come over. She was putting together the crib while her wife supervised, or what Agatha considered supervising. Rio would call it micromanaging.</p><p>“Beam A doesn’t go into joint D.” Agatha stated as she held the directions.</p><p>Rio sat on the floor, screwdriver in hand, and reached up to flip the directions around for her wife. “And now?”</p><p>Agatha scowled, “I swear to all fuck-” And stopped, placing a hand on her stomach.</p><p>She shot up off the ground. “Baby?”</p><p>Her wife just stood there with wide eyes.</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha. “Mi amor, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “She kicked.”</p><p>Her body felt relief, then it felt something like joy. “She did?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and placed it on her bump. “Feel.”</p><p>A beat went by, but then Rio felt it. A faint little motion against her wife’s stomach, and she nearly broke down crying.</p><p>“Fuck, she’s really in there.” She grinned ear-to-ear.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I could have told you that.”</p><p>“No, but like, I can feel her.”</p><p>“Finally makes two of us.” Her wife deadpanned.</p><p>They heard the front door open on the other side of the house, alerting them to the coven’s presence.</p><p>Wanda immediately found them, rushing in. “What is it?”</p><p>They hadn’t told their friends the sex yet, but they were aware that Rio and Agatha both knew.</p><p>The redhead’s eyes darted around the nursery, trying to find clues.</p><p>“Why the fuck is your baby’s room gray?”</p><p>The wall was a soft gray, not too cold, and not too dark, with little gold moons and stars hand painted by Rio. They saw a similar nursery on Pinterest and agreed on doing the same thing in their home. Agatha had vetoed Rio’s nature theme with dinosaur wallpaper because she thought it’d look tacky, even though Rio was certain any child of hers would appreciate a dinosaur themed room.</p><p>“It’s not gray,” Agatha pursued her lips. “It’s Drifting Snow.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t it be blue or pink?” Wanda asked.</p><p>Jen popped her head in. “I like it.” Which was high praise from the woman.</p><p>Alice followed in after. “Very whismigothic, I approve.”</p><p>“Thanks?” Rio said, because they didn’t ask for their opinions, they just gave them readily.</p><p>“So,” Jen fiddled with a quilt Rio was working on. “Are we getting another nephew or have you guys done the world a favor by not bringing another man into it?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, resting both hands on the small of her back. “It’s definitely a child.”</p><p>“One we have been assured is of human origin.” Rio added.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda approached her wife. “If you don’t tell me, so help me god, I’ll throw you a fucking baby shower.”</p><p>Her wife dropped her face in shock and horror. “You wouldn’t.”</p><p>“We’ll play all those stupid games I know you hate, we’ll measure your bump-“ Wanda raised her eyebrows in challenge.</p><p>“You fucking sociopath.” Rio looked at her.</p><p>“Just tell me!” Wanda snapped.</p><p>“Calm down, we’re having a girl, Raggedy Ann.” Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>The whole coven cheered and congratulated them, eventually moving to the living room.</p><p>Agatha caught Wanda’s arm. “Just for that, Alice and Jen are the godparents.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes bugged. “What?!”</p><p>“Heard.” Alice nodded.</p><p>Jen cackled. “Suck it, Red.”</p>

<p>“Get your hand off me before I remove it via machete.” Agatha hissed, sitting at the kitchen table.</p><p>Her lovely wife had made the grave lapse in judgement to kiss her cheek while resting her hand on her thigh. Truly a heinous act in Agatha’s book because being almost nine months pregnant, she was fucking miserable. Her body ached all the time, everything was sore, and it’s like their daughter knew when Rio was around because she’d start battering Agatha’s uterus like crazy. How feet so tiny could cause so much discomfort, she’d never know.</p><p>“You are just a breath of fresh air today, my love.” Rio quipped, grabbing her fork and tucking into her meal. Over the past few months, she’d actually learned to cook. Maybe not well, but well enough. She made decent pasta, okay chicken, and surprisingly really good herb-crusted salmon.</p><p>Tonight was risotto, and Agatha stared at her plate, not because it didn’t look appetizing, but because recently, their daughter had decided to provoke waves of nausea at any given time.</p><p>“Mami,” Nicky spoke through a mouth full of food. “What time are we leaving tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio and their son were headed to New York for the weekend, some incoming freshman event at NYU. Agatha was staying home since she was not walking around Washington Square Park while being this fucking exhausted. She still had two weeks until she was due and if Victoria was anything like Nicky, she’d take her sweet motherfucking time vacating Agatha’s body.</p><p>“I’m thinking we catch the 8 AM train, be there a little before ten. We can grab some breakfast before heading to campus.” Rio replied.</p><p>“Do you think I can stay in the dorms Saturday night?” He asked.</p><p>Rio and Agatha looked at each other, and god bless her wife, she saw how over everything Agatha was and answered for them.</p><p>“Fuck no.” Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because we know you. You’ll do something stupid.”</p><p>“I’m almost eighteen!”</p><p>“Yeah, so you do the stupid shit then.”</p><p>“Once we’re not liable for it.” Agatha smiled.</p><p>“What could I possibly do?”</p><p>“Drugs.” Her wife immediately responded.</p><p>“Get a girl pregnant.” Agatha raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Nicky and Cassie had broken up over Christmas break, he came home sobbing and it was the first time in years Agatha actually got to comfort her son. Rio on the other hand suggested making a bad decision, saying she did the same thing with her first heartbreak. Agatha didn’t say anything about how she was the cause of that first heartbreak, but agreed when letting Nicky get a nose piercing. Thankfully, it was short lived after he didn’t take care of it properly and took it out a month later. She made that face and the son of bitch stuck metal through it.</p><p>“Get so drunk you scale a building and debate your own mortality while looking over the city on a rooftop like Batman.” Rio calmly stated.</p><p>“Did you do that in college?” Nicky smiled.</p><p>Her wife smirked. “Not important, the answer is no.”</p><p>When they got ready for bed that night, Rio was finishing packing as Agatha slumped around her body pillow, barely awake.</p><p>“You sure you’ll be okay while we’re gone?” Rio said and threw a pair of socks into her overnight bag.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “My love, I will be fine, I am not immobile, dead, or dying. I can survive, like, thirty-six hours without you.”</p><p>“What if you fall or something? Or go into labor? Or Vic-”</p><p>“Rio.” She groaned. “I was pregnant once before with zero help, I’ll be okay.”</p><p>Her wife climbed in bed next to her. “I’m making Wanda and Jen take shifts checking on you.”</p><p>Agatha sat up. “You what?”</p><p>“I just won’t be able to focus on Nicky or the trip if I know you’re alone this close to your due date.”</p><p>“Baby, Nicky was a week late, my guess is this child is no different.”</p><p>Rio slouched next to her, lowering her head next to Agatha’s stomach. “You better not fucking pull anything.”</p><p>And right on cue, she started kicking like a UFC fighter.</p><p>“I don’t think your intimidation tactics are working.”</p><p>“That’s what Wanda and Jen are for.” Rio smiled.</p><p>“What do you think I’m gonna do here all weekend that constitutes babysitters?”</p><p>“They’re not babysitting, they’re just-”</p><p>“Making sure that I, an almost forty year old woman, can handle being alone?”</p><p>“Okay well when you say it like that, I sound like a dick.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Then don’t be a dick.”</p><p>“Just let me worry about you, woman!” Rio exclaimed.</p><p>“Turn off the light, Vic’s been using my uterus as a bounce house all day and I need a break.”</p><p>Rio ducked down to her stomach again. “Dude, I am begging you, be cool.”</p><p>The next morning, she felt her wife kiss her temple and say her goodbyes, Agatha roused but definitely wasn’t fully awake.</p><p>“See you Sunday, I love you.” Rio whispered, the bedroom still dark.</p><p>“Love you.” Agatha hoarsely sighed, falling back asleep.</p><p>She woke up a couple hours later to voices in the kitchen, must’ve been someone's first shift checking to make sure she was alive.</p><p>She waddled out of the their bedroom after peeing, she always had to fucking pee. She didn’t bother trying to look presentable, entering the kitchen in her XXL Bjork shirt and maternity sweats.</p><p>“Morning, sunshine.” Nat smirked, sipping her coffee.</p><p>“You’re always around now, why is that?” Agatha snarked.</p><p>She knew, obviously. Wanda and Natasha were in that phase of a sapphic relationship where they're joined at the hip, can’t have one without the other.</p><p>“We have breakfast, and coffee. Decaf for you obviously.” Wanda said brightly from the kitchen island. “How’s my niece doing?”</p><p>Agatha cocked her head. “She’s public enemy number one right now, thanks.”</p><p>Wanda pulled out a bagel wrapped in wax paper from the bag. “Your wife told me your usual. Asiago bagel, chive cream cheese. Jesus, Rio is brave for kissing you after that.”</p><p>She took the bagel and sat next to Nat at the island. “Perks of marriage, she has no choice.”</p><p>“How much longer do you have? Your body looks like it's about to snap like a twig.” Nat commented.</p><p>“Two long, tortuous, unending weeks.” Agatha took a bite. “Probably more with my track record.”</p><p>“I remember when I was pregnant with the twins,” Wanda laughed. “I basically sneezed and they were out.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “Of course you did.”</p><p>Near the end of breakfast, she finally shuffled them out, walking them to the door and wincing at her daughter jostling around.</p><p>“You okay?” Wanda asked as Nat opened the front door.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. “Yeah, Braxton Hicks, happened last week too and Rio freaked the fuck out.”</p><p>“You sure it’s false labor, not the real thing?” Wanda started to move towards her, but Agatha held up her hand.</p><p>“Wanda, I’m fine, she’s not going anywhere.”</p><p>The couple finally left after that, thank god. Agatha didn’t know how long it’d be until the next shift, but carried on with her day anyway. She showered, got dressed, tried to put on socks but couldn’t because Rio had been doing that for her for the past month.<br/>
And went upstairs to her office, needing to catch up on all the work she’s missed or neglected with her constant absence from the office in the city. She couldn’t take a real maternity leave, but was trying to delegate as much as humanly possible.</p><p>Despite what her wife thought, Agatha was fine. Sure the false labor contractions were still pummeling her, but she survived. Around six, she heard Jen and Alice waltz in, a bag of food in hand. Walking downstairs and into the kitchen only made the contractions worse, literally slumping into the nearest chair at the kitchen table.</p><p>“Okay, I have Thai food and I thought we’d rent a movie while we eat. Billy keeps bugging me to watch something called Bottoms.” Jen began pulling food out.</p><p>“Oh, I love Ayo Edebiri.” Alice wistfully sighed as she reached for the plates.</p><p>“Why do you guys keep bringing me food? I can feed myself.” Agatha grumbled, hands clutching her bump.</p><p>She had technically made herself lunch, reheating the risotto from last night.</p><p>“We know, but you shouldn’t have to, that’s why you have a wife.” Alice said. “But since she’s gone, we’re all your wife until tomorrow afternoon.”</p><p>“I swear to fucking god, you little gremlin!” Agatha shouted at her unborn daughter, still fucking wriggling around.</p><p>“Okay, unwarranted.” Alice scoffed as though she were offended.</p><p>“Not you, Vic’s been a demon all day.”</p><p>Jen, always the medical professional, looked at Agatha. “All day?”</p><p>“Yeah, Braxton Hicks, they usually calm by now, but she must be in a mood. Maybe it’s cause Rio’s gone, I’m pretty sure she likes her better than me.”</p><p>Jen walked over. “False labor doesn’t last all day. Does it feel better or worse when you walk?”</p><p>“Worse.”</p><p>“And does sitting make it go away?”</p><p>Agatha did not like where this was headed. “...No.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen asked, obviously frustrated. “How long has it been since the last contraction?”</p><p>She shrugged, suddenly feeling very panicked. “Five, six minutes?”</p><p>“You’re in labor!” Jen screamed at her, at the pregnant woman in labor. “You dumb bitch-”</p><p>“Not helpful!” Alice scolded her wife. “We have to get her to a hospital.”</p><p>No, absolutely fucking not, she had a plan to go into their private practice in two weeks and give birth there. She had even gotten Dr. Vostokoff’s word that she’d adjust things in case their daughter was late. This time was supposed to be different.</p><p>“No, no hospitals!” Agatha yelled. “My water hasn’t even broken, and Rio and Nicky are in New York. I can’t be in labor!”</p><p>“Babe,” Jen crouched down to hold Agatha’s hand. “Your daughter doesn’t give a shit.”</p><p>“Fine, then just-” Agatha grunted, another contraction hitting. “You just deliver this damn kid here.”</p><p>“It’s a child exiting your body,” Jen said through her shock. “That’s not something I can treat with a sewing kit in your kitchen!”</p><p>“Then what’s even the point of your fucking medical degree?!” She wailed.</p><p>“Okay,” Jen hoisted her up. “Let’s get you to the car.”</p><p>Alice already had her phone to her ear. “I’m calling Rio.”</p><p>“Jen, stop pulling me.” She said, feeling the other woman trying to move her towards the door.</p><p>“Stop making yourself heavier!”</p><p>“No answer!” Alice called, following them.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha yanked herself away from Jen’s hold. “Jen, grab my phone, I need to call my doctor and see if she’ll meet us at Westview Presbyterian.” She looked at Alice. “Grab a towel from the linen closet down the hall and keep calling Rio.”</p><p>She’s fine. That’s what she told herself. She’d done this once before, she’d do it again. She’s fine. Plenty of women give birth without their spouse there, she wasn’t special. Plenty of people hate hospitals, that wasn’t a new fear. She’s just being dramatic, she’s not scared, she’s fine.</p><p>“What’s the towel for?” Alice questioned.</p><p>“In case my water breaks in your car, I’m considerate of Jen’s leather seats.”</p><p>“Thank you!” Jen called from the office upstairs where Agatha had left her phone.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they were checking into the hospital. Same linoleum flooring, same fluorescent lighting, same gut wrenching feeling. Rio was in another state, her doctor said she’d try to be there, but couldn’t guarantee anything. Her water did in fact break in the car, and she’d make sure to rub it in Jen’s stupid face what a good friend she was.<br/>
She found herself in an eerily similar birthing suite as before, staring at what was probably the same decades old sunset painted on the ceiling. And the cherry on top walked in, the same way he did eighteen years ago.</p><p>“I hear we’re having a baby-” Dr. Strange smiled. He was older now but she didn’t hate him any less.</p><p>“NO.” Agatha shouted from her hospital bed.</p><p>He looked taken aback, peeking at her chart. “I’m sorry…Mrs. Vidal, is there something wrong?”</p><p>“Yes. You! Get out!”</p><p>Jen was standing by her bedside. “Agatha…”</p><p>“I’ll come back in a few minutes.” He said as he slowly backed out of the room.</p><p>“Did Alice get a hold of Rio yet?”</p><p>Jen looked guilty. “I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Fuck-” Agatha slumped back. “Fuck. It- it was supposed to be-” Her lip trembled. “It was supposed to be different this time.”</p><p>“Hey,” Jen grabbed her hand. “I’m here, Alice is here, Wanda’s on her way with a bag for you. We got you.”</p><p>And she loved her friends for it, she did. But it wasn’t the same.</p><p>“Thanks.” She muttered, blinking back tears.</p><p>“I got her!” Alice bolted in, arm outstretched with her phone. “I got her on the phone!”</p><p>Agatha sat up and swiped the phone. “Our son better be critically fucking injured and that’s why you haven’t been picking up.”</p><p>“Baby, I am so, so, sorry. We were at this presentation thing and my phone was on silent. I swear, we’re coming home right now.”</p><p>“You’re almost two hours away! She’s gonna be here by the time you get back.”</p><p>“I’m renting a car and speeding the whole way there.” Her wife casually mentioned her plan. “I’ll cut the time in half.”</p><p>“You’re insane. I love you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha felt another contraction and groaned. “Me and this daughter of yours are gonna have words when she gets here.”</p><p>“Oh, now she’s my daughter?”</p><p>“Very Vidal of her to give me a hard time.”</p><p>“Sounds like she’s got your impatience and dramatic flair to me.”</p><p>“Pedal to the metal, baby, c’mon.”</p><p>“Cross your legs ‘till I’m there.” Rio said and Agatha heard keys jingling and what sounded like a car starting.</p><p>“That’s not how it works.”</p><p>“No, I'm pretty sure it is.”</p><p>“Put Nicky on the phone.”</p><p>There was some rustling before her son spoke. “Mom?”</p><p>“Hey hon, how was the freshman thingy?” She asked and gritted her teeth in pain. “I’m sorry you had to leave.”</p><p>“Don’t be, mami is weaving through the streets of New York like she’s playing GTA, I’m entertained.”</p><p>She heard several honks and her wife cuss. “Well that’s…great.”</p><p>“Okay, I gotta go, I think I’m getting nauseous with the way she’s whipping this car around.” Nicky grumbled.</p><p>“Love you, hon.”</p><p>“Love you too, mom.”</p><p>“One hour, mi amor, fucking time it!” She heard Rio scream in the background before she hung up.</p><p>“She’s on her way, though I’m not sure in one piece.” Agatha told Jen.</p><p>She smiled. “See? All we have to do is wait and-”</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Agatha yelled, clutching her stomach in agony.</p><p>“I’m here.” Dr. Vostokoff knocked on the door, popping her head in. “Okay, if I come in?”</p><p>“Thank god.” Jen muttered.</p><p>“Yes, please come in!” Agatha shouted.</p><p>“How are you doing, Agatha?” Milena asked, already in scrubs and trying to find gloves.</p><p>“I don’t remember it hurting this much last time.”</p><p>“Cruel god designed it that way.” She replied, snapping on the latex gloves. “Alright, you know the drill, feet in stirrups.”</p><p>Agatha compiled, hoping to the aforementioned cruel god that her daughter was going to take her sweet time.</p><p>“Nine centimeters.” She evenly stated.</p><p>“What? No!” Agatha said, as if she knew better. “Nicky took almost two days!”</p><p>Milena stood. “Well he was your first, most women pop out their second baby” She snapped her fingers. “Like that.”</p><p>And oh, Victoria motherfucking Vidal must be laughing from heaven right now, telling Agatha “I told you so” from beyond the grave.</p><p>“Your cervix is thinner after you’ve given birth once, this little girl is coming.”</p><p>“Doc, I love you, but right now, you need to shut the fuck up.” She groaned.</p><p>“Where’s your wife?”</p><p>“What did I just say?!” Agatha barked.</p><p>Milena did not seem affected by angry women in labor screaming at her. “I’m going to go connect with the doctor they gave you when you were admitted, but once I’m back, I’m sorry Agatha, it’s happening.”</p><p>She left the room and Agatha immediately turned to Jen. “If she gets back before my wife, you’re barricading that fucking door.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Jen huffed.</p><p>“C’mon, like we did with Mrs. Hart’s office in high school!”</p><p>“We almost got expelled for that!”</p><p>“Jen!” She scolded.</p><p>She rolled her eyes but stood by the door.</p><p>The first half hour was light work, it was the following thirty minutes that caused trouble. Melina walked back in, much to Agatha’s dismay.</p><p>“Jen, what the hell?!”</p><p>“You actually expected me to block her with my body?”</p><p>Agatha gestured wildly. “Yes!”</p><p>“Agatha,” Melina started. “I need to see if you're at ten centimeters, and if you are, I need to deliver this baby.”</p><p>“Can’t you just come back in twenty minutes? Get a coffee, or a- AHhh-” She tried to speak through the thousandth contraction.</p><p>The doctor looked at her, unamused. “No. Stirrups.”</p><p>“Doc, I will get violent if necessary.”</p><p>“I’m Russian, you think I can’t fight?”</p><p>Fuck, Pilates did not prepare her to take down a scary Russian lady. She surrendered, slumping back and getting in the stirrups. All she needed was a little more time-</p><p>“Ten centimeters.” Her evil bitch of her doctor confirmed.</p><p>But time was never on their fucking side, was it?</p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” Alice said to her, holding her hand. “We’re here.”</p><p>Another tsunami of torture hit and Agatha squeezed Alice’s hand, screaming bloody murder.</p><p>“Fucking hell-“ Alice winced. “My bones…”</p><p>On the other side, Jen was trying to be supportive. Keyword being ‘trying’.</p><p>“It’s all okay, Rio’s only like ten minutes away.”</p><p>The way Agatha felt like she was being chainsawed internally told her that she did not have ten minutes.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha, I’m gonna need you to start pushing.” Milena spoke.</p><p>“FUCK YOU.” Agatha cried out from both the physical and emotional pain.</p><p>“Well you’re married, so…” Melina chuckled.</p><p>That’s right Agatha was married. She was married to Rio. She was supposed to have Rio here with her right now. She just wanted her wife, she just wanted to wait a little longer, she just-</p><p>Agatha pushed and wailed. “I want Rio!”</p><p>“I know, I know.” Jen soothed.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha!” Alice whined. “Please god, my hand-“</p><p>Agatha didn’t loosen her grip, if she had to feel this, she’d make it everyone else’s fucking problem.</p><p>“Oh I’m sorry, Alice.” She barked. “ARE YOU IN PAIN RIGHT NOW?!”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened in terror. “Nah… I’m- I’m good.”</p><p>“Agatha, focus, push again for me.” Milena almost demanded.</p><p>If she physically could, she’d strangle that woman.</p><p>“Get fucked for me.” Agatha retorted.</p><p>The door swung open, producing her very out of breath, very anxious wife.</p><p>“I’m here!” Rio sprinted to the bed, shoving Jen aside.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t have time or wherewithal to give her much greeting but she finally released Alice.</p><p>“Fuck you! Fuck you!” She screamed as Rio clasped her hand.</p><p>“You’re doing great, baby.” Her wife smirked, letting Agatha’s screams roll right off her.</p><p>“I know I am!” Agatha’s whole body was covered in sweat, exhausted.</p><p>“Just making sure.” Rio smiled like Agatha looked beautiful, like she did on their wedding day, like she did when they were eighteen and stupid.</p><p>“I can’t-“ Her voice broke. “I can’t do this.”</p><p>“Well no one else is gonna do it for you, so let me know when you’re ready.” Milena stated.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio murmured, climbing on the bed behind Agatha and resting her back against her chest. “You can do this. I’m here.”</p><p>Rio was right.</p><p>She was here.</p><p>And that’s all Agatha wanted.</p><p>She tried catching as much of her breath as she could before baring down again. Rio seemed to take Agatha’s deathgrip of both her hands like a champ, just whispering encouragement in her ear as she continued to push. Agatha couldn’t feel much other than the blinding agony, but her brain was more than aware of Rio holding her through it.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t say how much time she’d spent pushing, only what that first cry sounded like as it echoed off the walls.</p><p>Even when the medical team briefly took their daughter away to get her bundled up, Rio didn’t leave, she stayed with Agatha, stayed holding her.</p><p>“You did amazing, mi amor.” Rio whispered and placed a gentle kiss to Agatha’s sweaty temple, just like she had earlier this morning.</p><p>“You wanna hold your daughter?” Melina asked, a ball of wailing limbs wrapped in a little pink blanket in her arms.</p><p>Agatha weakly nodded, taking her daughter and resting her against her chest. Rio had her chin placed on her shoulder, looking down.</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha chirped, gently trailing her index finger along her cheek.</p><p>“She’s perfect.” Her wife whispered.</p><p>“Well I made her, did you expect anything less?” Agatha weakly joked through her tears.</p><p>Rio softly chuckled. “Never doubted you for a second.”</p><p>Several hours later, after Agatha had slept and was no longer covered in bodily fluids, they finally took visitors. Everyone barreled in at once, all checking on Agatha and the baby. Rio had not let go of her all night, Agatha fell asleep with their daughter in Rio’s arms and woke up from her nap to the same sight.</p><p>“Guys, this is Victoria.” Rio smiled, proudly presenting her to their friends and Nicky.</p><p>Everyone cooed and awed, Lilia especially, making little grabby hands at the infant.</p><p>“Can I hold her?” Nicky asked.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Of course, come here.”</p><p>He sat down in a chair near the bed, sanitizing his hands and waiting.</p><p>Her wife gently passed her over, positioning her in their son’s arms.</p><p>“Hey.” Nicky smiled. “She has my eyes.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “She has my eyes.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her own eyes. “They’re brown!”</p><p>Nicky looked back down at his sister, almost like he was conspiring with her. “Thank god you’re here, I don’t have to be alone with them anymore.”</p><p>And Agatha realized that she was wrong.</p><p>This time, it was different.</p><p>It was also different having a newborn with a real partner this time, throughout the months Rio was there. The late night feedings and changings, the getting out of bed at two in the morning, the soothing. Her wife was there for it all and most of the time, sent Agatha back to bed while she handled it.</p><p>Victoria was two months old when she cried out in the middle of the night, the baby monitor blaring into their otherwise silent bedroom. Agatha sat up, starting to push the covers off herself when Rio stopped her.</p><p>“I got it.”</p><p>Agatha yawned. “You got her last time, my turn.”</p><p>Rio got out of bed. “Well I’m already up so…” And disappeared out the door.</p><p>Agatha heard Victoria quiet on the monitor, assuming Rio had gotten there, but then her wife walked back in, pulling Agatha out of bed.</p><p>“Baby, c’mere, you have to see this.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>They made the short walk to the nursery, barely creaking open the door to see that Nicky had gotten there first. They didn’t ask him to help a lot, especially not in the middle of the night, but that didn’t stop him from trying.</p><p>He had been camped out on the couch in the den for the last week, studying for finals before graduation in a couple of weeks. So, it made sense that he got there before they did.</p><p>Agatha watched as her son held her daughter, sitting in the rocking chair and gently swaying, singing the same song she could’ve sworn he had forgotten she ever sang to him at that age.</p><p>“Hey there Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me. Two more years and you’ll be done with school and I’ll be making history…” He sang in hushed tones.</p><p>“I used to sing that to him.” Agatha said, still staring from the barely open door.</p><p>Rio peered in, still trying to stay hidden. “She seems to like it.”</p><p>“Good, I’d be worried if our daughter didn’t respect the musical stylings of The Plain White T’s.”</p><p>“Oh we’d be so fucked.”</p><p>Rio pulled her in, wrapping her arm around her waist as they watched their kids.</p><p>As Agatha watched the hypothetical future she’d always fantasize about unfolding right in front of her, she smiled to herself, leaning into her wife, listening to their son start the chorus over again.</p>

<p>“How the hell is it that I got a three month old ready before you two?” Agatha called up the stairs where her wife and son were.</p><p>Rio’s voice called back. “Mijo needed help with his tie!”</p><p>“I told you, mami, I had it right.” Nicky said, exiting his bedroom in his button up, slacks, and perfectly done tie.</p><p>“No, you didn’t, and then the pictures would forever be haunted by the noose you knotted around your neck on the first go.” Rio corrected as she descended the stairs, meeting Agatha.</p><p>“You clean up nice.” Agatha husked, admiring her wife in a suit and loafers, hair down and messy.</p><p>“Have you forgotten what I look like not covered in spit-up?”</p><p>“I don’t know, the old boxers and Bikini Kill shirt at two am with a bottle in your hand really does something to me.”</p><p>“Mmmhh,” Rio pulled her in by her waist. “Well this,” She motioned to Agatha’s simple black dress. “Is really doing something to me.”</p><p>“We could do something about that-” She whispered, placing a kiss on Rio's lips.</p><p>“Ew.” Nicky said from the last step on the staircase right next to them. “I’m still here.”</p><p>Rio let go. “So you are.”</p><p>“I just gotta grab Vic and we can go.” Agatha stated.</p><p>“I got the diaper bag.” Her wife agreed. “Nicky, can you move the car seat from my car to your moms? We’re giving Alice and Jen a ride.”</p><p>“On it.” He said, grabbing his cap and gown on his way out the door.</p><p>Agatha reached down into the bassinet that had become a permanent fixture in the den, hoisting Victoria up. She was freshly changed, fed, burped and had woken up from a nap five minutes ago, meaning they had a ninety minute window before she had a meltdown, just long enough for a graduation ceremony.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha cooed at her daughter’s little gurgle. “Ready, hon?”</p><p>Since Victoria could officially hold her head up, she just stared at Agatha with the same big brown doe eyes her wife had.</p><p>“Perfect.” She chirped, as if Victoria had actually spoken.</p><p>She met Rio at the door, her wife held the bag and opened the door for her, locking it behind them and getting to the car. Alice and Jen met them in the driveway, climbing in the way backseat and talking to Nicky as Rio drove, one hand on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>When they got to the school, Nicky sprinted off to find his friends, cap barely secured to his head. Rio helped Agatha situate Victoria before kissing her on the cheek and heading to the teacher section.</p><p>“How are you holding up?” Agatha heard a familiar voice behind her as she held Victoria in one arm, back turned to him since she was speaking to Jen and Alice until one second ago.</p><p>“Fucks sake.” She whispered under her breath and plastered on the fakest smile she could manage. “Ralph.” She turned and greeted.</p><p>His eyes widened momentarily, hand reaching out. “Who’s this little cutie?”</p><p>Agatha smacked it away. “Please don't perceive my child, it’s bad enough I had one with you.”</p><p>“Your child?” He asked as though he hadn’t spoken with Nicky a handful of times over the past year or so.</p><p>“Yeah.” She said like he was a fucking moron, because he was. “I know Nicky told you.”</p><p>“He said you were getting remarried and that he was a big brother, but I guess it’s just different seeing it…you know, in person.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you showed up at all.”</p><p>Nicky had invited him to his graduation as a courtesy more than anything, he didn’t even expect him to come, he never had before.</p><p>“My only kid is done with school, felt important.” Ralph shrugged.</p><p>“But not all the other times?”</p><p>“I’m not trying to fight with you, Agatha. It’s our son's day, maybe keep the dramatics to a minimum.”</p><p>“Alice, hold Vic.” Agatha said, giving her daughter to her aunt and taking a step closer to her ex.</p><p>“Vic? Like Nicky’s middle name?” Ralph off-handedly asked.</p><p>“Let's go find our seats, how ‘bout that?” Jen softly asked Victoria, bouncing happily in Alice’s arms. “I have a feeling this is going to get loud and hurt your tiny little ears.”</p><p>“Be there in a minute.” Agatha confirmed.</p><p>“What now?” He whined.</p><p>“I won’t be the one ruining this day for Nicky, you will. So when he sees you, you will be pleasant, and cordial, and you’ll ask him about NYU and his summer plans.”</p><p>“He’s going to NYU?”</p><p>Nicky had told him, Agatha knew Nicky had told him that, and yet, he still acted surprised.</p><p>“You will keep your mouth shut, you won’t make it about you, you will say nothing about my daughter or my wife, is that understood?”</p><p>He threw his hands up, playing the victim. “I’m just here for my son, you and your…wife have kept him from me long enough.”</p><p>He said “wife” like it was unnatural.</p><p>She wanted to rip her hair out. “We didn’t keep him from you! You left! He didn’t want to see you anymore because having a piece of shit father is worse than having no father at all!”</p><p>“Don’t act all innocent, Agatha, you fucking love that you got him. That you’re his favorite, that I’m the fuck-up. Congratulations! I’m the worst person to ever exist and you’re a fucking saint!” He yelled.</p><p>“Am I his favorite or was I just a fucking parent?!” She screamed back, on a Saturday afternoon in June, in the parking lot of their old high school. “It’s not my fault he grew up and saw who you really are.”</p><p>“Who I really am? What about the twelve years where we were married and you didn't tell me you were a lesbian?”</p><p>“God, Ralph-”</p><p>“No, how many women did you fuck while we were married, Agatha?!”</p><p>“How many did you?!”</p><p>“And now to make things worse, you married the woman who punched me!”</p><p>“That was like two years ago and you deserved it, let it go.”</p><p>“I should’ve pressed charges.”</p><p>“Why stop there? I’ll deck you right now, make it count for something.”</p><p>He didn’t look spooked. “Then you’d ruin the day for Nicky.”</p><p>Fuck, he was right.</p><p>“Also, I hear condolences are in order.” He said.</p><p>“Condolences?”</p><p>“Evanora..? News said she died last month.”</p><p>Oh, right. Agatha hadn’t really paid attention to that, the prison called one day, said she died in her sleep, and asked Agatha what she wanted them to do with the body. She settled for cremation and dumped the ashes in the nearest trash bin, leaving her mother on the curb to be collected on the next trash pick-up day. She even pumped extra milk that day so she could enjoy a glass of champagne without getting her then two-month old drunk.</p><p>Still, her ex-husband had no poker face.</p><p>“Is that why you’re here?” Agatha asked. “You know my mother cut me out of the will and left everything to Nicky. You’re trying to mend your relationship with him so he’ll give you money?”</p><p>It’s not like Evanora had a massive fortune left after the feds took everything, a few million and some parcels of land. More than enough should her son ever need it, but not enough to bail out his fuck- up of a father over and over again.</p><p>Ralph tried to pretend, but the façade was wearing thin. “Listen, I made a few bad investments-”</p><p>“How much?” She cut to the chase.</p><p>“Two, three hundred grand?”</p><p>“You lost three hundred thousand dollars?!”</p><p>“The market tanked!”</p><p>“No, it didn’t!”</p><p>“I just- I need to get out of this hole. He’s my son, your kids are supposed to take care of you-”</p><p>“That’s in your old age, we’re forty!”</p><p>“I’m gonna take him out to dinner, ask him then, I’ll be gentle about it.”</p><p>“He’s freshly eighteen, you’re trying to take advantage of him.”</p><p>“I gave him life, he could give me a little money.” Ralph spat.</p><p>“I gave him life! You came in two seconds and most of it was on my thigh.”</p><p>He placed one hand on his hip, the other waving his finger around. “He’s an adult, he can make his own choices! That includes helping out his dad.”</p><p>Oh what she wouldn’t give to break that fucking finger.</p><p>She couldn’t believe she was saying this, but she knew her son. He was kind and empathetic to a fault, he’d probably give Ralph the money in good faith and be abandoned again until Ralph needed more.</p><p>“I’ll give you the money.”</p><p>He relaxed. “Really?”</p><p>“But you never see him again, if he reaches out, then fine. Until that happens though, you’re nothing to him. You’re not his dad, you don't come around here, after today, you leave and we never see you again. Got it?”</p><p>“You really expect me to never see my son again?”</p><p>“How’s it any different than the last eighteen years?”</p><p>“And if he finds out you paid me off?”</p><p>Agatha looked at him, setting her jaw. “I’ll tell him myself.”</p><p>She would, just not today.</p><p>“Fine, but I want the check today, cleared by Monday.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “If only you cared about your son the way you do yourself.”</p><p>“My parents cut me off when we ended things, I don’t have another way out of this.”</p><p>“You know, if you had just seen your son because you really, genuinely wanted to see him, he might have forgiven you. Might’ve given you the money anyways, but you never got your head out of your ass long enough to realize that.”</p><p>“He’s fine.” Ralph dismissed. “Builds character.”</p><p>“Yeah, he is, but not because of you. It’s because of me, and Rio, and because he’s an amazing kid and good human being! You contributed nothing to that.”</p><p>“We should find our seats.” He started to brush past her, but she caught him.</p><p>“One photo after the ceremony and you’re on the first plane out, or you get nothing, got it?”</p><p>“Yeah,” He acknowledged, not even having the decency to look ashamed. “Got it.”</p><p>She found Jen, Alice and Wanda in the stands, telling Ralph to sit as far away from them as possible. She slid in next to Alice, no longer holding her child, instead finding her in Wanda’s lap, who was gushing and smiling.</p><p>“Who’s my favorite niece in the whole wide world?” Wanda baby-talked.</p><p>Victoria just smiled and blinked, content to be fawned over.</p><p>“She’s your only niece.” Agatha said.</p><p>“How’d things go with Ralph?” Jen peered over her wife to ask.</p><p>“Fine. I don’t think he’ll be much of an issue anymore.”</p><p>“What?” Alice questioned.</p><p>“Tell you later.” Agatha whispered as Lilia walked onto the stage, beginning the ceremony.</p><p>They all sat and clapped as student after student traipsed across the stage on the football field, alphabetically getting closer and closer to the end. Jen and Alice had taken pictures of Billy and Tommy while Wanda sobbed and clutched Victoria close, probably something to do with her kids being grown while having a baby in her arms. When they had finally gotten to ‘S’, Agatha sat a little straighter, preparing to sob as her son accepted his diploma.</p><p>Except it never happened, all the ‘S’s were called, moving right on to the ‘T’s.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Alice turned her head. “Where was Nicky?”</p><p>“No clue.” She whipped her head around, making confused eye contact with her wife who was in a staff section on the field.</p><p>She tried to find Nicky in the crowd of red polyester, but it was useless. Agatha sat and did the only thing she could do, wait.</p><p>Luckily, there were no ‘U’s, so they moved to the ‘V’s. That’s when she saw her son’s head in the line of students headed for the stage. Her face twisted in confusion as to why he was just walking up now.</p><p>A few names were called by Lilia until she smiled a little wider, leaning into the microphone.</p><p>“Nicholas Victor Vidal.”</p><p>She swore her eyes almost fell out of her skull, making eye contact with her wife again. Rio looked equally as shocked, but endeared.</p><p>Alice was taking photos as Nicky walked across the stage, taking the diploma and shaking Lilia’s hand. He looked at Rio and mouthed something, to which she mouthed something back. He then found Agatha, mouthing the same thing-</p><p>“Love you.”</p><p>She wiped her teary eyes and mouthed them back to him. “Love you.”</p><p>After the ceremony, they met Nicky down on the field, Rio was already there, already hugging him.</p><p>“You sneaky son of bitch.” She said through a watery laugh.</p><p>“Hey, you married this bitch.” Agatha replied before narrowing her gaze at her son. “Why didn’t you tell us?”</p><p>“It’s not official yet, there’s like a fuck ton of paperwork but Lilia did me a favor by getting my diploma with Vidal on it.” He said, slightly bashful.</p><p>“You know you didn’t need to do that, right?” Her wife said.</p><p>“I know.” He shrugged. “But Scratch isn’t really my family’s name, Vidal is. You’re my mom and you have it, mom has it, my little sister has it.” Nicky held up his diploma. “So I wanted it too.”</p><p>See? So fucking empathetic, so good, so amazing. He was everything that Agatha and Rio could ever ask for.</p><p>“Thank you, mijo.” Rio threw her arms around him again, probably crushing him.</p><p>“Yeah,” He brushed it off. “Love you, mami.”</p><p>“I love you.” She mumbled over his shoulder.</p><p>“I was told to find you guys after for a picture?” Ralph approached.</p><p>Of course he had to pick right now.</p><p>Rio let go of their son, barely giving Ralph a courtesy glance.</p><p>“Dad, I didn’t know you came.” Nicky awkwardly spoke.</p><p>He laughed. “And miss my son’s graduation? The next time we’ll be doing this is gonna be when you’re done at NYU.”</p><p>“You remembered?” Her son asked, genuinely asked, dumbfounded that his own father would remember where he’s going to college.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Ralph lied. “Go birds!”</p><p>Nicky seemed to see through the bullshit. “Bobcats.”</p><p>“Hmm?” He cocked his head.</p><p>“NYU’s mascot is the bobcats.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Oh, Rio, didn’t see you there-”</p><p>Nicky then cocked his head. “She right in front of you-”</p><p>Ralph continued. “Good to see you again.”</p><p>“Likewise.” Her wife’s tone was curt, almost unkind but could be passed off as casual.</p><p>Everyone just stood for a moment.</p><p>“Picture?” Agatha clapped her hands together.</p><p>They all nodded their heads in agreement, Wanda finally gave Victoria back to Agatha. She held her daughter and stood next to her son, Rio on her other side. Ralph stood on the other side of Nicky, wrapping a possessive arm around their son’s shoulders.</p><p>Alice held up her phone. “Smile!”</p><p>They all did as she took several photos in quick succession of one another.</p><p>“How about one with just me and your mom, bud?” Ralph asked.</p><p>And Agatha had to remind herself that she had her daughter in her arms or she would’ve bitch slapped him right then.</p><p>“Ralph.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Why?” Nicky asked.</p><p>“You know, the original three?” He laughed but Nicky knew what he was doing.</p><p>“I said one picture, we got it, you can go.” She motioned for him to leave.</p><p>“I think I’d like a picture with mom and mami.” He said, not making eye contact with Ralph.</p><p>“Who’s mommy?” He furrowed his brows.</p><p>“My god,” Rio groaned. “Mami, not mommy.”</p><p>Ralph looked at Nicky. “So you get rid of my family's name and call her mommy?”</p><p>Agatha handed a now fussy Victoria to Jen, turning to her ex and physically blocking him from Nicky. “Ralph, it’s his day, do not make a scene. If he wants a picture with me and Rio, that’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>“Agatha,” He grabbed her arm, not forcefully, but enough to try to move her. “I’m trying to talk to my son.”</p><p>Rio was on him in a flash, ripping his arm off of her and speaking lowly. “Need I remind you what happened the last time you touched my wife?”</p><p>“I wasn’t doing anything.”</p><p>“I don’t care, you touch her again or intimidate my son, I will not hesitate to put you on your ass. Are we clear?”</p><p>“Your son?!” He shouted.</p><p>“Ralph.” Agatha chided.</p><p>“Are. We. Clear?” Rio repeated.</p><p>“Nicky…” He looked past her wife, past her, to her son.</p><p>His eyes were a little glassy. “Just go, dad.”</p><p>He yanked himself away from Rio, fixing his suit jacket and pouting. “Money better be there by Monday.”</p><p>As he stormed off the field, Nicky and Rio looked at her.</p><p>“Money?” Her wife asked.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to tell you guys today, because I didn’t want it to overshadow Nicky.” Agatha sighed and looked at her son. “But Ralph was going to hit you up for some of the money nana left you, I offered to pay it if he stayed away until you said otherwise.”</p><p>“You bribed him out of my life?” He confirmed.</p><p>Well when he put it like that-</p><p>“Yeah.” She squeaked.</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“Three hundred thousand.”</p><p>“So that's all it took for him to never see me again?”</p><p>“Hon, I am so sorry, and-”</p><p>He chuckled. “You should’ve paid it years ago.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Mom, he was gonna hit me up for money, he treated mami and Vic like they were the guests and not him. Plus, he’s been absent for most of my life, the rest of it shouldn’t feel any different.”</p><p>“You’re sure you’re okay?” She placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>He shrugged. “Can’t really miss something you never had, you know?”</p><p>“Do you guys still want a picture? Cause your child is two seconds away from acting like her mama and throwing a tantrum.” Jen said, referring to Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky smiled, pulling Rio on one side of him, Agatha on the other, holding his degree with pride.</p><p>Agatha and Rio locked eyes for a second, smiling at one another, at their son, at how fucking smart, and kind, and grounded he was.</p><p>“Rio, stop eye-fucking Agatha, I gotta get this shot.” Alice yelled from behind the phone.</p><p>As Alice clicked the button, Rio flipped her off, ironically catching the perfect moment to describe them as a family.</p><p>The rest of summer was decidedly more tame, most of their time was spent packing Nicky up for college, or enjoying Victoria’s milestones. Rio sat for twenty minutes on the floor one day, filming Victoria as she tried to roll over on her own. Eventually, Victoria did roll over, but at the expense of her wife’s knees. And yes, Agatha made several jokes about Rio being on her knees for so long she had bruises and not even getting an orgasm out of it.</p><p>It was mid August when Agatha came home from work one day, tired and content to sink into the couch with her wife and kids. However, when she opened the door and walked into the den, Rio had other ideas.</p><p>She whipped around, holding their six-month old. “Look at cariño!”</p><p>She couldn’t just look at Victoria, because there was so much going on, she had to look everywhere. First, their daughter was in a dinosaur costume. Olive green, plush, with a hood that looked like the dinosaur’s head covering half of Victoria’s face, leaving her crooked little smile and double chin visible, but nothing else.</p><p>Next, their son was in an abridged version of their daughter’s get-up. His was a blue, different dinosaur head, almost a onesie. Her wife’s was a dark green and she had a purple one in the hand not holding Victoria.</p><p>“No.” Agatha shook her head before Rio could ask.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio tutted. “We gotta take our Christmas card photos before Nicky goes off to college next week.”</p><p>“Why must it be dinosaurs? Why not just a family photo?”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Because look at how fucking cute Vic is as a dinosaur!”</p><p>Agatha ducked down to see her daughter’s face under the hood, grabbing her chubby little hand. “Did mami make you a little T-rex?”</p><p>Her wife looked at her like she was crazy. “She’s obviously a triceratops.”</p><p>“I’m the T-rex.” Nicky grumbled, arms crossed and waiting.</p><p>“Vic,” Rio whispered into their baby’s ear. “What do the dinos say?”</p><p>And though she couldn’t speak, Victoria giggled and let out a quiet sound. “...raaahh.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Rio nodded. “That’s right, mija!”</p><p>“Fine, it’s really fucking cute.”</p><p>“Then put yours on,” Rio tossed it over her arm. “Tripods already set up.”</p><p>Agatha picked up the fabric. “Do I have to?”</p><p>“Happy wife, happy life.” Rio smirked.</p><p>It was one week later when Agatha and Rio were moving Nicky into the dorms at NYU, lovingly hauling his shit up many, many floors.</p><p>Victoria was at Jen and Alice’s, getting some quality godparent time, they didn’t want to pack a whole day's worth of baby things when they already had Nicky’s mini fridge and various trinkets to worry about.</p><p>They were almost done unpacking when another teenage boy entered the room, name unimportant to Agatha, but he and Nicky seemed to get along.</p><p>“Who are they?” His roommate asked.</p><p>Nicky was fumbling with his phone charger. “My moms.”</p><p>“Hot.” The boy said, prompting both Agatha and her wife to stare the boy down.</p><p>He understood his mistake. “No, not because you’re lesbians! Because you’re MILFs! I’m not fetishizing you, well not in that way-“</p><p>“Dude,” Nicky grimaced.</p><p>Rio walked over to their son. “He’s right, mijo, accept it.”</p><p>He put Señor Scratchy 2.0. on the shelf near his bed, adorned with a blue and white quilt Rio had made. “So, you guys heading out soon, or…?”</p><p>And no, she didn’t ever want to head out. She felt like her heart was broken into three pieces. One was in Westview with her aunts, another right beside her in the dorm, and the third she was about to leave in New York for four years.</p><p>“Yeah, I think you’re all set.” Agatha evenly stated instead of crying and holding her son.</p><p>“You have your ID and meal card?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yes.” He said.</p><p>“And your camera and toiletries?” Agatha checked.</p><p>“Yup.” He said again.</p><p>“Okay…well.” She took a deep breath. “This is it.”</p><p>“I’ll be okay, mom.”</p><p>“I-“ Her voice wavered. “I know.”</p><p>“And I’m only two hours away, and I’ll come home on weekends, and see Vic.”</p><p>“We know.” Rio spoke, but it felt forced.</p><p>“So…” He trailed off.</p><p>“Right, we’ll fuck off.” Her wife grabbed her.</p><p>“Make smart choices, and never walk alone at night, and wear shower shoes in the bathroom!” Agatha rushed out, feeling like a mythical clock was about to buzz and send her packing.</p><p>Nicky, her fully grown child, smiled. “I know.”</p><p>“And condoms, use them. It’s not just the woman’s responsibility. And consent, it should always be enthusiastic-“</p><p>“Mom!” He cut her off, motioning to his roommate. “You gave me that talk years ago, I know.”</p><p>Yeah she fucking knew that he knew, but she wished she hadn’t prepared him as much. Maybe he’d feel as scared as she did.</p><p>But she couldn’t do this forever.</p><p>“Okay.” She gave up. “You’re right. You know everything.”</p><p>“C’mon, baby.” Rio lightly tugged her. “Let the boy live.”</p><p>Agatha shot forward and embraced Nicky like it was the last time she’d ever see him, which wasn’t true, he’d be home in a couple weeks to do laundry.</p><p>But it was a couple weeks longer than she’d ever gone without her son.</p><p>“I love you so, so much, hon.” She choked back tears.</p><p>He hugged her back. “I love you too, mom.”</p><p>She kept him in her grasp for a minute, not wanting to leave, to no longer see him every morning in the kitchen eating his cheerios.</p><p>“Mi amor, you need to let him go.” Her wife whispered.</p><p>She didn’t want to, couldn’t believe she’d come to this point in her life.</p><p>“I want more time.” She whispered back, not daring to drop her hold.</p><p>Rio nodded, letting have her moment. Her son seemed to understand what this meant for her, him leaving. It meant that she had done it, everything her mother wanted, and had not only survived-</p><p>But got the best kid out of it too.</p><p>“I want more time.”</p>

<p>“Victoria Lilia Vidal!” Her wife’s voice lovingly called, followed by the light pitter-patter of tiny four-year old feet sprinting down the hall.</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself, getting up from where she was packing in their bedroom and craning her body out the doorway to catch their daughter mid-toddle.</p><p>She heard her daughter’s delighted squeal as she scooped her up. “Are you giving mami a hard time?”</p><p>Victoria mischievously giggled. “Maybe.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and grinned. “Good.”</p><p>Rio rounded the corner, breathing heavily. “She’s getting faster.”</p><p>“Or you’re getting slower.” Agatha raised her brows, looking over Victoria’s current outfit. “Maybe that’s why she’s in a fairy costume and spiderman crocs.”</p><p>“It’s fashion!” Vic proudly stated, swinging her legs in Agatha’s hold.</p><p>The girl’s genetics might've been Vidal, but fuck, if she didn’t have the blind confidence and self-righteous tendencies of a Harkness.</p><p>“I was packing her bag, I’ll get her dressed in something more appropriate later, my love.” Rio huffed, still catching her breath.</p><p>“We can get her dressed at the hotel, the ceremony isn’t until four anyways.” She shrugged. “Are you excited to see your brother?” Agatha asked, looking at Victoria.</p><p>“Yeah!” Victoria squealed again.</p><p>Oh, to have the energy of a four-year old again, Agatha thought to herself.</p><p>“Then we have to finish getting you packed, mija.” Rio said. “C’mon, come pick out which jammies you want.”</p><p>Agatha set her daughter down, “Remember hon, always get the head start.” And winked.</p><p>Victoria smiled and nodded before bolting off again, past her wife, and down the hall.</p><p>Rio watched Vic go and looked at Agatha. “If she trips and falls, I’m laughing first before I check on her.”</p><p>“And that’s why you have the ‘World’s #1 Mami’ mug.” She quipped, giving Rio a light peck before parting ways again.</p><p>An hour later, they were on the train, headed for New York, Agatha was reading with her wife sitting next to her, their daughter blissfully distracted with her coloring book and headphones. They were bluetooth connected to Rio’s phone since her wife refused to raise an iPad baby, stating that there would be no hope for humanity if they added one more to the population.</p><p>Halfway through the ride, Victoria looked up from where she was concentrating on scribbling in Bluey. “Mami, play the dandelion song.”</p><p>Rio smirked and looked at Agatha, pulling out her phone and switching the music. The dandelion song was what Victoria lovingly thought ‘Hey There Delilah’ was, which, close enough she supposed.</p><p>When they arrived in Manhattan, they were greeted by their son waiting for them in the train station. He smiled, immediately ducking down to catch an already bounding child headed his way, her little legs carrying her as fast as possible.</p><p>“Nicky!” She shouted, entirely too loud for a public place.</p><p>He caught her, scooping her up. “How’s it going, gremlin?”</p><p>Nicky came home for every holiday, and most weekends over the last four years. He was present enough that Victoria knew who he was and had a bond with him, but not so present that seeing him wasn’t considered special.</p><p>“Hi, hon.” Agatha murmured and hugged him on the side Victoria wasn’t currently clinging to.</p><p>“She’s getting big.” He smiled before pretending to drop her. “Like a sack of potatoes.”</p><p>Vic giggled as she was jostled. “I’m bigger than a sack of potatoes.”</p><p>“No, I don’t think so.” He shrugged.</p><p>“Please don’t kill your sister.” Rio scolded. “Not in her crocs.”</p><p>“Looking fly as fuck.” He looked at Victoria.</p><p>“Fuck.” She parroted.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head, giving her twenty-two year old son that patented mom look. “She’s repeating everything.”</p><p>“I’m gonna have fun with that.” He said.</p><p>“No.” Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Fine,” Nicky replied. “Lunch?”</p><p>“We gotta get checked in first, but yeah.” Agatha slung Victoria’s duffle bag over her shoulder.</p><p>They chose a place not far from campus, some place that Agatha wouldn’t have pictured herself ever being in while in her mid-forties, but Nicky swore by it. They sat down and talked as they waited to order.</p><p>“Any news on post-grad plans?” Rio asked.</p><p>Nicky looked up from where he was playing a much gentler version of the hand slapping game with his sister. “I was gonna tell you guys…”</p><p>Agatha looked at her wife, suddenly worried. “Tell us what?”</p><p>“I got that National Geographic job.”</p><p>She beamed, reaching over and tapping his shoulder. “Hon, that’s great! Why’d you make it sound like we’d be upset?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Because it’s National Geographic.”</p><p>He almost looked guilty. “I’m gonna be traveling, like, nine months out of the year to wherever they send me.”</p><p>Oh-</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, now aware of the fact that her son was probably going to be going to places that were dangerous or so remote, they had no cell service.</p><p>But it was a job, a real job, shooting and living, and-</p><p>“You’re gonna be changing the world.” Agatha smirked, tears welling as she looked at her wife.</p><p>“Well, I had a great teacher.” He said, keeping eye contact with Rio.</p><p>“We’re so proud of you, mijo.” Rio spoke in earnest.</p><p>“Mama, can I have chicken tenders?” Victoria’s voice chirped, oblivious to her brother’s news.</p><p>“Yeah, of course.” Agatha said, grabbing her wife’s hand under the table for dear life. “I think I'm going to order a cocktail.”</p><p>“Oh, me too, since you guys are paying.” Nicky grinned. “Better than Jäger.”</p><p>“What did I tell you about drinking that stuff?” Agatha widened her eyes. “It’s no proofs that high and-”</p><p>“Those diet energy drinks, yes mom, I know.” He finished for her. “But I have lived off both for the last several years.”</p><p>Agatha continued. “They’re so bad for your insides!”</p><p>“Fuck, I’m so happy to be done with college.” Rio grimaced.</p><p>“Fuck!” Victoria parroted, yet again.</p><p>“That time is on you.” Nicky pointed out.</p><p>By four pm, they watched as their son graduated with his bachelor’s degree with a major in film and a minor in photography. Ralph had kept up his end of the bargain, not making any contact for the past four years. Nicky didn’t want to see him, and though they were relieved, Rio and Agatha also let him know that they wouldn’t be upset if that ever changed. Yeah, he was adamant that things would not change.</p><p>They took pictures, and went out for a nice dinner where Nicky drooled over his steak. He was technically a millionaire, but hadn’t touched any of the money, not when Agatha or Rio sent him some whenever he needed. He had a part-time job at an art store, not enough to pay his bills but it was something so that he wasn’t some rich, entitled prick. Her wife made sure of that.</p><p>It was a month later when they helped their son move out of his little shoebox apartment, taking the overflow back to Westview. Nicky was leaving for Antarctica, photographing the melting ice caps, which Agatha didn’t think was necessary considering they were always melting and there were already a thousand photos to prove that, but her son was excited. Excited to freeze his ass off and shoot, so she didn’t say anything. He still had his room at their place so whenever he was between assignments, he could stay with them.</p><p>September came, and Rio and Agatha dropped their daughter off at her first day of kindergarten. Between Nicky, and Victoria, Agatha felt obsolete, they were both basically grown.</p><p>She was kneeling on the cold tile of the elementary school hallway, hugging her daughter. “You’re gonna have so much fun!”</p><p>“I know, mama.” Victoria said resolutely, like there was no alternative.</p><p>Rio was knelt down beside her. “And we’ll be back at the end of the day to pick you up.”</p><p>“Who else would?” Their daughter sassily cocked her head.</p><p>“No one, that’s a good thing we should go over in the future…” Her wife said.</p><p>Victoria adjusted her purple and green backpack, her name embroidered across the top by Rio. “Can I go?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Yes, hon, go, learn lots.”</p><p>Vic waved at them both before striding into the classroom, sitting down at a table with a group of kids and yapping like she never thought to hesitate. Fuck, she really was Agatha’s daughter.</p><p>“We had a harder time than she did.” She pouted.</p><p>Rio smiled. “I think that means we’re doing something right, mi amor.”</p><p>“God knows what.” Agatha said, leaning into her wife’s side, watching Victoria, their daughter, go off into the world on her own for the first time.</p><p>That night, as Agatha tucked her daughter into bed, she learned that her first day went great. She made friends, and played, and was probably the smartest kid in her whole class. Agatha swept a few stray hairs from her daughter's face, little hands clutching Señor Scratchy 2.0. close to her chest, a parting gift from her big brother.</p><p>“And there's three Nevaehs in my class.” Victoria grumbled.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, scrunching her face. “It’s heaven backwards.”</p><p>Her daughter knit her eyebrows together. “What’s my name mean?”</p><p>Agatha softly smiled. “Well, victory, like you’re a winner.”</p><p>Vic lit up. “That’s why I always beat you in Mario Kart.”</p><p>Well, no, it was because Agatha still couldn’t figure out the fucking controls, but-</p><p>“It’s also a family name, after your abuelita.”</p><p>“How come I don’t know her?”</p><p>“She’s not here anymore, but I know she would love you.”</p><p>“Why’s she not here?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “She got sick, and her body needed to rest.”</p><p>“Do you miss her?”</p><p>“Of course, but I think mami misses her more.”</p><p>Her daughter thought for a minute, twirling the rabbit’s ear around her finger. “Have you and mami always been in love?”</p><p>“Why do you ask?”</p><p>“One of my friends today said her parents aren’t in love anymore.”</p><p>Okay, just cause those dumbasses failed at marriage didn’t mean they did. But she couldn’t say that, so she settled for the alternative.</p><p>“Do you wanna know a secret?” She whispered.</p><p>Victoria nodded.</p><p>“Mami and I have been in love for twenty-six years.”</p><p>Brown eyes bulged. “That’s forever.”</p><p>“Kid, you don’t even know the half of it.” Agatha grinned. “The stories I’m gonna tell you when you’re older-”</p><p>The door opened, letting a soft ray of light in from the hall, producing her wife.</p><p>“My ears are burning,” Rio sat down on the edge of the bed next to Agatha. “And you’re supposed to be asleep, mija.”</p><p>“My name means I’m a winner!” She said, head held high.</p><p>“Time to win at sleeping.” Agatha said and kissed her daughter’s forehead.</p><p>Rio did the same before tucking Victoria in. “Night, gremlin. Love the shirt, love you.”</p><p>Victoria smiled that same crooked smile Rio was wearing right now, she smoothed her hands over the decades old Bikini Kill shirt that was much too large for her.</p><p>“Night, mami.” Vic looked at Agatha. “Night, mama.”</p><p>“Night, hon. Love you.” She whispered, turning on the projecting night light and slipping out of the room with her wife in tow.</p><p>As soon as Agatha reached their bed, she flopped onto it face first, letting her body melt against the mattress. Rio closed the door and laid down next to her, reaching over and gently kneading her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha moaned at the feeling. “Keep doing that.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Long day?”</p><p>“Several thousand meaningless meetings.” She supplied, feeling Rio’s thumb dig into a muscle that hadn’t relaxed all day. “Baby…”</p><p>“Take off your shirt.”</p><p>“You’re just trying to fuck me right now.”</p><p>“Correction, I’m always trying to fuck you.” Rio said, getting on her knees. “But I can’t give you a massage through fabric.”</p><p>“Mmh.” She groaned, momentarily sitting up, whipping off her shirt and bra before laying back down.</p><p>Her wife straddled her and dug her fingers into the muscles of her back, silently working, only letting out quiet laughs at Agatha’s continuous moans. “Don’t come, baby.”</p><p>“Shut up.” She said, voice muffled in a pillow. Even after five years of marriage, Agatha would not give Rio the satisfaction of letting her know she was getting turned on by this.</p><p>Their room was quiet and cozy, the lighting was warm and soft. Agatha had banned the overhead light from ever being used, that thing was evil and it hurt her eyes. Rio’s hands continued until they were replaced by her lips, trailing searing hot kisses up her spine before arriving at her neck.</p><p>“Turn over.” Rio whispered against her ear, teeth nipping along the shell.</p><p>She complied without a second thought, flipping over to see her wife. Rio was smiling down at her the same way she always did, the same way she always had. Nearly three decades had passed since those eyes first locked onto Agatha’s, and they still looked at her with love. Something more than love, something like worship, life affection, like complete and utter devotion.</p><p>Her wife undid and pulled her pants, freeing her legs, sending them flying elsewhere. Agatha sat up, yanking off Rio’s shirt and discarding the fabric. The hand adorned with an emerald engagement ring and matching wedding band pushed her back down against the bed.</p><p>“Let me take care of you.” Rio hummed, bringing her mouth back to Agatha’s neck.</p><p>The way Rio said it, it was more than just sex, it was a promise, an oath. It was their life together, their past, their kids, their home, Agatha-</p><p>Rio cared for it all, took care of it all.</p><p>Agatha nodded, threading her fingers into her wife’s hair, arching her back to get more contact. Rio took the hint, dragging her mouth to her chest, leaving indentations of her teeth and hickies across Agatha’s breasts.</p><p>She threw her head back as her wife took one of her nipples into her mouth, one hand snaking into her ruined underwear.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha husked, “Need your mouth.”</p><p>Like a fucking gunshot, Rio was on the move, leaving a trail of spit down her abdomen, mouthing over Agatha’s skin, paying special attention to the stretch marks on her lower stomach. Agatha always insisted she hated them, carrying two kids later, the evidence was still there. But Rio loved those marks, fucking praised them.</p><p>“My wife is so fucking sexy.” Rio spoke, hooking her thumbs into the lace of Agatha’s underwear and pulling them down her legs.</p><p>“I’m already a sure thing, you don’t have to flatter me.” She smiled, kicking off the rest of the fabric.</p><p>“Fine.” Her wife smirked. “My wife is so fucking easy.”</p><p>“Only for you.” Agatha corrected, hooking a leg over Rio’s shoulder and pulling her down.</p><p>Rio caught herself, if only fractionally, chuckling and looking up. A pair of dark eyes caught her own, gazing. “I really love you, you know that?”</p><p>Yes, she knew it.</p><p>She fucking felt it.</p><p>It was seared into her bones, coursing through her veins, an innate fact that her brain just knew. Like how the sun rises and sets, how a river ebbs and flows, how Rio loved her, and how she loved Rio in return.</p><p>She grinned. “I’ve always suspected as much.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, just brought her lips down to Agatha’s thigh, kissing, teasing, and smiling against the flesh. Agatha tried to yank her down to where she needed her, but her wife wouldn’t budge. After a couple of minutes, she huffed, using the leverage she had on her wife’s shoulder and flipping them so that Agatha hovered directly over Rio and her shit eating grin.</p><p>“What happened to taking care of me?” She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Both of Rio’s hands flew to her hips, tugging her down. “I was getting to it.”</p><p>“Not fast enough.” Agatha grumbled before Rio’s tongue finally made contact. “God-”</p><p>“I doubt he’s here.” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s cunt, flattening her tongue for her to grind on.</p><p>She rolled her hips, gripping their headboard for dear life as her wife reached her arm up to squeeze one of her breasts.</p><p>“If you’re talking, that means you’re doing something wrong.” Agatha scolded, moaning when Rio purposely lapped her clit. “Fu- fuck.”</p><p>When she felt nails dig and drag against her ass, she bucked her hips faster, arching her back. Her jaw went slack as her eyes lidded, the only thing in her vision being the wall in front of her. The wall covered in framed photos of their life together. Their wedding, their engagement, a few family photos, mostly in black and white, mostly taken by Rio or Nicky. But the picture framed in the center, that was her favorite.</p><p>The picture that was taken twenty-six years ago by Agatha in Rio’s old garage studio. Her wife, then seventeen, smiling up at Agatha behind the camera. The photo that caused so much pain, but kept her alive in the time between. The photo that was creased and slightly discolored, that photo that used to reflect the best time in her life. Now she could confidently say the best time in her life was the present.</p><p>The photo that she used to hide in her jewelry box away from prying eyes. The photo that was shoved into some dark place along with who Agatha really was, now openly on display. Where they had started at the exact center of the wall, surrounded by everything they achieved.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at that photo most days before she saw Rio again, her brain had the image memorized. The curve of Rio’s smile, the microscopic gap in between her two front teeth, the exact placement of each hair splayed out on that old couch.</p><p>She thought of Rio most days in their time apart, and August 20th of 2025 was no exception.</p><p>Agatha remembers walking through the town square on her way to Sunday brunch with Jen, Alice, and Wanda. Her mother had berated her about something or other earlier that morning, Nicky was stressed that black and white photography was going to be cut, and Ralph was being a bitch about who fucking knows what.</p><p>She was a block away from the restaurant, passing the same coffee shop she had several billion times over the years, when her phone started buzzing in quick succession. Agatha fished it out of her pocket, glancing at the group chat, everyone confirming that they were already there. She only looked down for a millisecond before she collided with someone.</p><p>Instinctively she reached out, catching whoever she had just bulldozed by their waist. God, she hoped it wasn’t a man. But as her hands clutched, they felt the soft slope of a woman’s figure. The scent of bergamot, and she wanted to say cedar, engulfed her.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>When the other person had not fallen to the concrete of the sidewalk and Agatha steadied them, she finally raised her line of sight to see the mystery woman, and-</p><p>Blue eyes locked onto the deep copper she’d seen before, she’d never forgotten. A copper that she had gazed into a hundred times before.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t seen her in seventeen years, not since the art gallery in Brooklyn the night before her wedding. The memories took her down like a wave crashing to shore, pulling her into their every moment together.</p><p>‘Our spot.’</p><p>‘But I just wanted to say it because I mean it. I love you.’</p><p>‘Whether the distance be the other side of the country or only an hour and nine minutes.’</p><p>‘Plea- please don’t- Please, my love.’</p><p>‘I want Rio!’</p><p>All of them reflected back at her as Rio raised her sunglasses atop her head. Her face scrunched in shock for a beat before her eyes bugged and she smirked.</p><p>That smirk, that smile-</p><p>‘Please keep me in mind.’</p><p>Agatha’s heart strained, she felt her breathing shallow in sheer proximity to her first love.</p><p>Her only love.</p><p>“Boo.” Rio dramatically whispered.</p><p>She realized that she probably did not need to hold onto Rio’s waist anymore, and against every instinct in her body, she let go. She set her jaw, swallowing the emotion threatening to suffocate her entirely.</p><p>She fisted her hands by her sides, restraining herself from touching her, pulling at her, fucking mauling her and kissing her like the last twenty years hadn’t happened.</p><p>Stupid fucking small town.</p><p>Agatha took a step back, though it hurt like a bitch, preparing to walk away. Rio didn’t deserve to have to deal with all of this again, Agatha or her mother. Rio deserved better, she always had.</p><p>So, she did what she does best-</p><p>Run.</p><p>“No.” Agatha uttered, devoid of any real conversation.</p><p>She couldn’t have that with Rio, because if she did, then she’d do something selfish like confess how she had never broken the promise they made in high school. That Agatha would always keep her in mind. And she had, against her own fucking will, against her own grain, Agatha had kept that promise.</p><p>She let her eyes linger on her ex for a moment longer than necessary before walking in the opposite direction. Agatha made a very valiant effort not to look back, but she was only human, and Rio was less than a hundred feet from her.</p><p>She peeked over her shoulder, finding Rio walking away.</p><p>Agatha choked back the disappointment, it had been long enough, Rio was a grown up, of course she was past Agatha’s adolescent cruelty by now.</p><p>Of course she was past Agatha by now.</p><p>She was one minute away from the restaurant when her traitorous mind conjured the moment she had just lived. Rio in a t-shirt and jeans, hair tied up and damp, face free of make up. She still looked beautiful, a little tired, probably from  the grief, but just as perfect as Agatha remembered.</p><p>She walked in and found the table of her friends, sitting down and wearing that practiced smile she always did.</p><p>“We were just about to order drinks.” Wanda greeted and motioned to the waiter standing next to their table.</p><p>Perfect, she’d just get hammered and then she wouldn’t think about her ex at all. Agatha looked at the server.</p><p>“Bloody Mary, extra vodka.” She stated.</p><p>The waiter scribbled it down and ran off.</p><p>“Long day?” Alice chuckled.</p><p>“Just got longer.” Agatha mumbled under her breath.</p><p>Jen looked up from her menu. “Oh my god, guess who I saw at the coffee shop this morning!”</p><p>Agatha could guess.</p><p>Wanda looked at her. “Why were you getting coffee before brunch?”</p><p>“The coffee here sucks.” Jen replied. “Anyways, guess.”</p><p>“Zsa Zsa Gabor?” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“Rio fucking Vidal.” Jen slapped her hands down on the table.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just looked down at her menu, pursing her lips like eggs benedict was the most fascinating thing in the world.</p><p>“She must be back in her mom’s place.” Wanda said. “I knew Victoria had a funeral, I just didn’t think Rio would stick around afterwards, thought she’d head back to the city.”</p><p>Yeah, so did Agatha, that’s why she sent flowers without a name.</p><p>“Why did nobody tell me her mom died? I looked like a bitch asking her why she was back!” Jen shouted.</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha sarcastically soothed. “That’s probably only because you are kind of a bitch.”</p><p>“Maybe she’s back for the long haul.” Alice shrugged.</p><p>God damnit, Agatha internally cursed.</p><p>She sighed. “Goody.”</p><p>Westview fucking New Jersey.</p>
