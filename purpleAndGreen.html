<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha, a perfectionist business student hiding her passion for music, finds her carefully constructed world upended when she meets Rio, a chaotic and charming drummer with a penchant for pushing boundaries. As Agatha grapples with the suffocating expectations of her cold, controlling mother, Rio’s relentless humor and free spirit draw her into a whirlwind of spontaneous adventures and emotional honesty. Through stolen moments in music halls, coffee shops, and art galleries, their connection deepens, breaking down Agatha’s walls and igniting a slow-burn romance that culminates in an intimate kiss during a vulnerable late-night game. Together, they begin to redefine what it means to live authentically—and to love unapologetically.</p><p>Or</p><p>Agatha and Rio meet in college, Rio helps Agatha to discover who she really is and shows her how fun (and naughty) life can be.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Singing had always been Agatha's sanctuary. It wasn’t just a hobby—it was her lifeline, the only way she knew to make sense of the chaos inside her. When she sang, the tangled threads of her relationship with her mother seemed to loosen, the ache of unspoken love softened, and the hollow emptiness that often swallowed her whole began to echo with meaning. Every note carried a piece of her pain, her longing, her hope, until it became something she could bear—something she could survive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Singing was the one place where Agatha didn’t have to be perfect, even if no one else knew that. It was ironic, really, considering how carefully she curated every other part of her life. But when she sat behind the keyboard, the rest of the world faded away, and for a few fleeting moments, she could just be. Her fingers danced over the keys as her voice filled the empty music hall, raw and unrestrained, weaving a story of longing and heartbreak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought she was alone—she always made sure of it—but the sharp clap of applause broke the spell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her hands stilling on the keys, and turned toward the sound. A girl with messy brown hair and the most beautiful and cocky smirk Agatha had ever seen stood in the doorway, lazily twirling drumsticks between her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not bad, Mozart. A little heavy on the angst, though, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened, her instinct to shield herself kicking in immediately. “Who the hell are you, and why are you eavesdropping?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl stepped into the room, unbothered by Agatha’s glare. She was wearing ripped jeans and a faded green band tee, her whole demeanor radiating chaos and confidence. “Name’s Rio. I play the drums. I didn’t mean to scare you, I just heard something worth sticking around for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Sticking around isn’t an option. Some of us actually take our practice seriously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Rio said with a lopsided grin, plopping down into one of the chairs. “You keep playing like that, and I’ll stay out of your way. Unless you’d rather kick me out, in which case, good luck. I’m stubborn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. “Is this your thing? Annoying random people for fun?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only when they’re good enough to make it worth my time,” Rio shot back. Her tone was teasing, but there was a spark of sincerity in her eyes. “You’ve got talent, you know. It’s not everyday someone in this place sings like they mean it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond right away. She hated how her heart was still racing, how her carefully maintained facade felt dangerously close to cracking. “And you think you’re the authority on that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Rio said with a shrug. “Or maybe I just know what it sounds like when someone’s actually feeling something. It’s kind of rare around here, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away, her hands resting idly on the keys. “I don’t sing for an audience,” she said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio replied, leaning forward. “Then you’ll sing for me. I’m not an audience—I’m just someone who gets it. And for the record, I think you’re better than you let on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this some weird recruitment pitch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More like an invitation,” Rio said, standing and heading toward the door. “Play something with me sometime. Or don’t. Either way, I think you’re pretty and you’ve got talent. - the comment made Agatha blush.</span>
</p><p>
<span> See you around, Mozart.” - Rio added with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could come up with a retort, Rio was gone, leaving the room quieter than before. For a moment, she just sat there, staring at the doorway, her emotions in a jumble she couldn’t quite name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, as much as she hated to admit it, she was already looking forward to the next interruption.</span>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>We all agree Evanora is a bitch, right?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The keys felt colder under Agatha’s fingertips as she packed up for the day, Rio’s words replaying in her mind. “You’ll sing for me.” It wasn’t a demand—it was an invitation, one that left her unsettled in ways she didn’t fully understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she arrived home, her mood had shifted, as it always did when she crossed the threshold of the big house. The air inside was heavy, thick with unspoken words and expectations that always seemed just out of reach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother was seated at the dining table, a glass of wine in one hand and her phone in the other, scrolling through her emails. She didn’t look up as Agatha walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late,” her mother said flatly, her voice cutting through the silence like a blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had practice,” Agatha replied, keeping her tone neutral as she set her bag down by the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother finally looked up, her eyes sharp and cold. “Practice for what? Playing dress-up for some piano recital? Or wasting more time on that singing nonsense?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, forcing herself to stay calm. “It’s not nonsense. It’s part of my coursework.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coursework.” Her mother scoffed, setting her phone down. “You’re not fooling anyone, Agatha. You’ve got a decent voice, fine, but that’s not going to pay the bills, is it? When are you going to stop chasing these pointless dreams and focus on something real?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched, the familiar ache of frustration and hurt building in her chest. “I’m already doing what I’m supposed to. I’m at the top of my class—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the bare minimum,” her mother interrupted sharply. “You think I care about your little awards or compliments from your professors? None of that means anything in the real world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her hands curling into fists at her sides. “I know,” she said quietly. It was always easier to agree, to avoid prolonging the argument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother’s gaze lingered on her, cold and calculating. “I don’t know why you’re so insistent on wasting your potential. You could be extraordinary if you just stopped being so… fragile.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fragile. The word hit her like a punch to the gut, the final twist of the knife. She didn’t reply, didn’t trust herself to speak without breaking the careful mask she wore. She decided to retreat to her room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely had time to drop her bag in her room before Evanora’s sharp voice rang through the apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Don’t walk away when I’m speaking to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Turning back, she walked to the dining room, where Evanora was now standing, her arms crossed, the epitome of cold authority in her tailored black suit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes?” Agatha asked, keeping her tone neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t ‘yes’ me with that attitude.” Evanora’s gaze swept over her daughter, taking in the loose cardigan, the scuffed sneakers, the lack of polish. “Look at you. You’re an embarrassment, Agatha. What if someone important saw you like this? How would that reflect on me, on our family?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled, her fingers curling into fists by her sides. “I went to class and then practice, not a gala. I don’t think anyone cared what I was wearing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And there’s the problem,” Evanora snapped, her tone icy. “You don’t care about the image you project, about the </span>
<em>
<span>responsibility</span>
</em>
<span> that comes with your name. You’re so self-centered, wasting time on frivolous nonsense when you should be preparing for your future. A future I’ve worked tirelessly to secure for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> preparing for my future,” Agatha said, her voice firmer now. “I’m excelling in my courses. I’m doing everything you’ve asked of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s laugh was cold and humorless. “Everything I’ve asked? Don’t flatter yourself. You’re doing the bare minimum while indulging in childish fantasies about music. Do you think I don’t know what you’re doing at that school? Sneaking into music halls, playing piano like some common street performer. You’re a </span>
<em>
<span>disgrace.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the sting of the words like a slap. “I’m not sneaking around. I’m working hard, at both business and music. And I’m good at both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good at both?” Evanora’s eyebrows shot up in mock surprise. “How charming. But ‘good’ isn’t enough. You think this family is built on </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>? It’s built on </span>
<em>
<span>excellence,</span>
</em>
<span> on perfection. And your little hobby doesn’t fit into that. You want to waste your talent playing piano for tips, is that it? Throw away everything I’ve sacrificed for you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a waste to follow something I love,” Agatha said, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love?” Evanora spat the word as if it were venom. “Love doesn’t build empires, Agatha. Discipline does. Vision. And you—” She gestured to Agatha, her eyes full of disdain. “You don’t have any of that. You’re nothing but a waste of space, clinging to childish dreams instead of growing up and taking your place where you belong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hit Agatha like a freight train. She swallowed the lump in her throat, forcing herself to stand tall. “Maybe I don’t want to belong to your world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s eyes narrowed, her voice dropping to a deadly calm. “You don’t have a choice. This company, this family, is your legacy, and you will not embarrass me by throwing it away. If you want to play piano, fine—do it in your free time. But don’t you dare forget what matters. If you do, you’ll find out just how replaceable you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, but she met her mother’s gaze with defiance. “I’ve done everything you’ve ever asked, but I won’t give up music. I can do both, whether you like it or not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s lips curled into a thin, cruel smile. “You’ll do what I say, Agatha. Or you’ll have nothing. No inheritance, no place in this family. Don’t test me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned on her heel and walked away, her hands trembling as she closed the door to her room. She leaned against it, closing her eyes as her mother’s words replayed in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, the weight of it all threatened to crush her. But then, unbidden, Rio’s voice echoed in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>“You’re better than you let on.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat down at her keyboard, her fingers hovering over the keys. The music came slowly at first, hesitant, but then it grew louder, stronger, until it drowned out everything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, it was enough.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Silence reigned at the Westview University library. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the glowing screen of her laptop. It was well past midnight, and the essay she was working on blurred in and out of focus. Her head buzzed—not with clarity, but with the jittery, restless haze that came from too much caffeine and another Vyvanse she hadn’t needed. She tapped her pen against the desk in rapid succession, her jaw tight as she tried to will her brain into sorting out the words in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just another hour. I can do this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pill bottle sat on the corner of her desk, its label worn from being hidden away in her bag, her drawers, anywhere Evanora wouldn’t look. No one knew she was taking them. Not her professors, not her peers, not her so-called friends. And certainly not her mother. They were her secret weapon, her purple pills, the edge she needed to stay ahead, to keep up with the endless grind of being everything everyone demanded of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except, lately, they weren’t enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers drifted through the wooded table mimicking the motions of a song. She wanted to play. She wanted to sing. But the text on her laptop screen seemed to mock her. There was no time for music. Not when she still had an essay due by 8 a.m. and a meeting to prepare for with one of her business professors. Be perfect, a voice whispered in her mind—her mother’s voice. Always her mother’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Mozart.” - that definitely wasn’t her mother’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked and looked up to see Rio standing beside her, twirling a drumstick in one hand, the other shoved into the pocket of her ripped jeans. Her brown eyes sparkled with mischief. “You look like you’ve been hit by a truck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered, shoving her notebook into her bag. “Really appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, unbothered by the sarcasm. “Seriously, though. You okay? You look… tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine?” Rio mimicked, her voice dripping with playful skepticism. “The kind of fine that means actually fine, or the kind that means ‘leave me alone before I stab you with this pen?’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, caught off guard by the oddly specific question. “Somewhere in between.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, good,” Rio said, falling into the chair next to her. “Because if you’re planning on stabbing me, I’d at least like a heads-up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a small smile. “Why are you here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looking for a good place to hide a body,” Rio said simply, her grin softening into something more genuine. “Just kidding, I couldn’t sleep and decided to look for a book .”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow at Rio, her lips quirking despite herself. “A book? What kind of book would someone like you be reading at midnight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, leaning back in the chair with a casual confidence that somehow made the sterile library feel less suffocating. “Probably something with murder or witches. Bonus points if there’s both.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds about right,” Agatha muttered, returning her attention to her laptop. She didn’t want to admit how much Rio’s presence disrupted her focus—not in a bad way, but in a way that made her feel strangely… lighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You didn’t answer my question earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What question?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio’s voice had softened, her playful smirk replaced by a look that was disarmingly earnest. “You look like you’re carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. “I’m fine,” she said finally, her tone sharper than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t flinch. “You know, people who are actually fine don’t usually say it like they’re trying to convince themselves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her laptop with a sigh, leaning back in her chair. “What do you want from me, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly?” Rio’s grin returned, but it was gentler now. “I just want to annoy you until you smile again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the sincerity in her voice. She opened her mouth to retort, but no words came. Instead, she shook her head and stood, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “Good luck with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her go, her drumstick tapping idly against the table. “You’re not as tough as you pretend to be, Mozart,” she called after her. “And I mean that in a good way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I have a name, right? And it is definitely not Mozart.” - Agatha added, feeling she had the upper hand for the first time in that conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beethoven?” - Rio added not being able to hold a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha” - the singer added, looking straight into Rio’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha… A beautiful name for a beautiful girl, that tracks.” - And with that, Rio did an exaggerated reference, pulling a random book from a shelf and leaving Agatha dumbfounded, again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night, Agatha sat in her room, staring at the keyboard she hadn’t touched in days. The weight of her responsibilities bore down on her, the pressure to be perfect gnawing at her from every angle. But Rio’s words lingered in her mind, cutting through the noise.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You’re not as tough as you pretend to be. And I mean that in a good way.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>With a deep breath, she placed her fingers on the keys. The first note came hesitantly, then another, and another, until the music poured out of her in a flood of emotion she couldn’t put into words. For the first time in what felt like forever, she let herself feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning, Agatha was surprised to find Rio waiting outside the music hall, leaning against the wall with a book in her hand. When Rio spotted her, she grinned and held up the book. “No witches, but it’s got murder.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asked, adjusting the strap of her bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thought I’d see if you wanted to grab coffee,” Rio said casually, as if they’d been friends for years. “Unless you’re too busy being perfect to hang out with a mere mortal like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but felt the corners of her mouth twitch upward. “I don’t have time for coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, tea then,” Rio said with an exaggerated sigh. “Or whatever it is Mozart types drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. Part of her wanted to say no, to keep her walls firmly in place. But another part—the part that felt alive when she played music—whispered that maybe, just maybe, she didn’t have to be alone all the time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she said at last. “One coffee. But if you annoy me, I’m leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened. “Deal. Let’s go, Mozart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked together, Agatha couldn’t help but think that, for the first time in a long time, she wasn’t dreading the day ahead.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha sat across from Rio in a small, tucked-away coffee shop that seemed far too lively for 11 a.m. She stirred her black coffee absentmindedly, wondering what on earth had possessed her to agree to this. Rio had been talking for the past five minutes about a drummer she admired, her hands moving animatedly to mimic drum patterns, and Agatha found herself oddly captivated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?” Rio asked suddenly, snapping Agatha out of her trance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of music do you actually like?” Rio leaned forward, her elbows resting on the table. “Let me guess… classical, maybe a little jazz. Something proper and polished, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled, feeling an instinctive need to defend herself. “That’s a bit presumptuous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, fine,” Rio said, smirking. “Then surprise me, Mozart. What’s your guilty pleasure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, the truth caught somewhere between her mind and her lips. She wanted to tell Rio about the playlists she had hidden on her phone—ones filled with indie rock and old punk songs—but the fear of judgment stopped her. “I don’t have time for guilty pleasures,” she said instead, her voice colder than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, studying her like she was trying to solve a puzzle. “You know, for someone who plays music like their soul depends on it, you sure know how to suck the fun out of a conversation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened. “I didn’t ask for your opinion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, you’re getting it anyway,” Rio shot back, her grin softening. “You’ve got walls for days, Agatha, but they’re not as solid as you think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught, and for a moment, she couldn’t think of a single thing to say. Rio had this way of cutting through her defenses with infuriating ease, and it left her feeling both exposed and oddly… seen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know anything about me,” Agatha said finally, her tone sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Rio replied, unfazed. “But I’d like to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next few weeks, Rio’s presence became a regular part of Agatha’s routine. Whether it was a casual comment in the library, a surprise appearance outside her lecture hall, or an impromptu jam session in the music hall, Rio always seemed to find her. And, much to Agatha’s frustration, she didn’t entirely mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One afternoon, as Agatha was packing up her keyboard, Rio walked in with her usual swagger. “Thought I’d find you here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want now?” Agatha asked, though there was no real bite in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Relax, Mozart. I’m not here to mess with you. I just wanted to show you something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could protest, Rio pulled a small speaker from her bag and connected it to her phone. A moment later, the opening chords of a song filled the room—soft, raw, and undeniably beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ever heard of this band?” Rio asked, sitting cross-legged on the floor as the music played.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, her curiosity piqued. “No. Who are they?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re called Coven. Their drummer’s a beast, and the singer’s got this crazy, soulful voice. Reminds me of someone I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks warmed at the implication, but she refused to let Rio see the effect her words had. “It’s… nice,” she said, keeping her tone neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice?” Rio gasped, clutching her chest in mock offense. “Mozart, you wound me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a small smile. “Fine. It’s more than nice. It’s… good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good enough to jam to?” Rio asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said firmly, though the idea wasn’t as unappealing as she wanted it to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Suit yourself,” Rio said with a shrug, leaning back on her hands. “But I’m not giving up that easily.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t doubt it. And as much as she hated to admit it, she was starting to look forward to see where Rio’s relentless determination would lead them too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, as they sat on the steps outside the music hall, Rio turned to her with a mischievous grin. “You know, you’re kind of terrible at taking compliments.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, caught off guard by the statement. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means you deflect every time I tell you you’re amazing,” Rio said, her tone light but her eyes serious. “Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t…” Agatha trailed off, unsure how to explain. Compliments felt foreign, like something she hadn’t earned. “I just don’t think about myself that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you should,” Rio said, her voice softer now. “Because you are pretty great, Agatha. And not just when you’re playing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart raced, her usual defenses crumbling under the weight of Rio’s sincerity. She didn’t know how to respond, so she did the only thing she could—she looked away, her cheeks burning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leaning back against the step. “Don’t worry, Mozart. I’ll keep reminding you until you believe it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in a long time, Agatha didn’t feel like arguing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are not so bad, either.” - It was all Agatha could come up with. </span>

<p>
<span>A cool autumn breeze swept through the campus, rustling the golden leaves scattered on the pathways. Agatha found herself standing outside the library, a place she’d usually retreat to for solitude, but this time, she wasn’t alone. Rio had somehow convinced her to take a break from her relentless studying schedule, claiming they needed to “live a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what exactly are we doing?” Agatha asked, eyeing Rio suspiciously as they walked toward a row of food trucks parked on the quad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re getting tacos,” Rio announced like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tacos?” Agatha repeated, incredulous. “You dragged me out here for tacos?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not just any tacos. Life-changing tacos.” Rio smirked, grabbing Agatha’s wrist and pulling her toward the shortest line. “Trust me, Mozart. You’re gonna thank me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allowed herself to be tugged along, her resistance half-hearted. As they waited, Rio leaned against the counter and glanced at Agatha. “You’re not allergic to fun, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m starting to think I might be,” Agatha deadpanned, earning a laugh from Rio that was as warm and unguarded as the sun breaking through the clouds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ended up sitting on a bench overlooking the quad, the tacos in hand. Rio wasted no time digging in, humming with exaggerated delight after her first bite. Agatha took hers with more caution, but to her surprise, the flavors burst across her tongue in a way that was almost… exhilarating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she admitted after a moment. “These are pretty good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty good?” Rio feigned outrage. “Mozart, these are a revelation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled, her defenses cracking under Rio’s infectious enthusiasm. “You’re ridiculous. And, can you stop calling me Mozart?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ridiculously charming, you mean. And no, definitely not.” Rio said with a wink, making Agatha’s cheeks flush. “So, tell me something about you that’s not music or business-related.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, caught off guard. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like… what do you do for fun? Hobbies, weird habits, secret obsessions. You know, the stuff that makes you human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have time for hobbies,” Agatha said automatically, but Rio’s raised eyebrow made her falter. “I mean… I guess I like to read.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See? That wasn’t so hard,” Rio said with a grin. “What kind of books?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mostly fiction,” Agatha replied, feeling oddly vulnerable under Rio’s gaze. “I like stories that… take me somewhere else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded thoughtfully. “Makes sense. You’ve got this whole dreamer vibe going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not,” Agatha protested, but the corner of her mouth twitched upward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you totally do.” Rio leaned closer, her voice dropping conspiratorially. “And I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her pulse quickening. She looked away, focusing on the taco in her hands as if it held the answer to the universe. “You’re crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re starting to enjoy it,” Rio teased, her smile softening. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about you? What do you like to read? Or you were being serious about witches and murder?” - the business major asked, realizing that she didn’t know much about Rio as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean…I love a good old fashioned murder, and witches are fucking cool. But I also love flowers and nature, so most of what I read is related to that. Botanics, I mean. I’m a biology major after all. - Rio answered with her mouth full, letting the taco sauce get in her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but stare, equal parts horrified and amused, as Rio wiped at her face with the back of her hand, smearing the taco sauce even further. The contrast between Rio’s chaotic energy and the soft, almost poetic way she talked about flowers was… oddly endearing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Botanics?” Agatha repeated, raising an eyebrow. “I didn’t peg you as the flower type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Rio asked, grinning. “Flowers are tough. People think they’re delicate, but some of them grow in the harshest conditions. I like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued despite herself. “You’re full of surprises.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re full of mysteries,” Rio shot back, her tone teasing but her gaze piercing. “But that’s okay. I’ve got time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her cheeks flush again and quickly looked away, focusing on the taco in her hands. But her mind betrayed her, wandering to the way Rio’s brown eyes sparkled when she talked about something she loved, the way her messy hair framed her face, and that maddening, cocky smirk that seemed to be permanently etched onto her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s attractive,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha thought, the realization hitting her like a freight train. </span>
<em>
<span>Too attractive.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Mozart,” Rio said, breaking through her spiraling thoughts. “What’s your favorite flower?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I don’t have one,” Agatha stammered, caught off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Rio pressed, leaning in slightly. “Everyone has a favorite flower. Even you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, genuinely trying to think of an answer. “I guess… azaleas? They’re simple but elegant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk softened into a genuine smile. “Good choice. Azaleas are beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, feeling suddenly exposed. “What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dandelions,” Rio said immediately, her voice warm. “They’re weird, unapologetic, and always fun to play with. Kinda like how I try to live my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That checks out,” Agatha muttered, unable to hide the small smile that tugged at her lips. “You’re definitely… weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her gaze lingering on Agatha. “And you’re definitely trying not to say what you really mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened again, but this time, she didn’t look away. “Maybe,” she admitted quietly, surprising herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of their conversation settling between them. It wasn’t uncomfortable, though. It was… something else. Something Agatha couldn’t quite put into words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said finally, breaking the silence. “What’s something you’ve always wanted to do but never had the guts to try?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, startled by the question. “I don’t know. I’ve never really thought about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Liar,” Rio said, grinning. “Come on, Mozart. There’s gotta be something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then sighed. “Okay, fine. I’ve always wanted to go to a live concert. Like, a real one, not the classical ones that happen in big events, but the big festivals, with crowds and stuff. But I’ve never had the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened. “NO!!!” - I can’t believe you’ve never been to a concert” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are what? 22/23? How on earth you never went to a fucking concert? - Rio talked fast like a two year old that had just eaten a bag of candy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted. “Mother never likes them that much, and I didn’t push for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded thoughtfully. “That’s crap, we gotta fiz that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened. “What? No. I didn’t mean—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too late,” Rio said, standing and stretching. “Now it’s on the list.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her, half-annoyed and half-amused. “What list?.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t ask questions you are not ready to hear the answers, </span>
<em>
<span>linda</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio teased, tossing her empty taco wrapper into the trash. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chose not to press on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your turn. Pick something fun for us to do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, feeling a strange mix of excitement and nerves. “Okay,” she said slowly, standing and brushing off her hands. “There’s this art gallery downtown. They’re doing a special exhibit on impressionism.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised but not displeased. “An art gallery, huh? I like it. Lead the way, Mozart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, shaking her head. “You’re ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re finally having fun,” Rio said, falling into step beside her. “Admit it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply, but as they walked together, her smile lingered. For once, she wasn’t thinking about her mother or her studies. She was thinking about Rio, about the strange, wonderful way she was starting to make life feel a little less heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that week, Rio convinced Agatha to join her for what she called “the ultimate bonding experience.” Agatha had no idea what to expect but found herself standing in an old record shop downtown, the walls lined with albums of every genre imaginable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I come here to clear my head,” Rio explained, flipping through a bin of vinyl. “Something about all these stories, all this music—it’s like a million different worlds, just waiting to be explored.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha found herself drawn to a section labeled </span>
<em>
<span>Classics</span>
</em>
<span>. Her fingers traced over the edges of the records, each one a piece of history. She picked up an album and turned it over, studying the cover art.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good choice,” Rio said, appearing beside her. “That one’s a masterpiece.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her. “You’ve heard it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” Rio said, her tone matter-of-fact. “But I think you should hear it for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could reply, Rio had already taken the album from her hands and brought it to the counter. When she returned, she handed the bag to Agatha with a triumphant grin. “Consider it a gift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to do that,” Agatha said, feeling a mix of gratitude and embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, I wanted to,” Rio replied with a shrug. “Besides, now you owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I intend on cashing it out one day” Rio quipped, her eyes twinkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night, as Agatha sat in her room with the record spinning on her old turntable, she found herself smiling. For the first time in what felt like forever, she felt lighter, freer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning, she found Rio leaning against the wall outside the music hall, as usual. But this time, it was Agatha who spoke first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to get coffee?” she asked, surprising even herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened. “Finally! I was starting to think I’d have to drag you kicking and screaming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her smile betrayed her. “Don’t make me regret it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You won’t,” Rio said, falling into step beside her. “Promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked together, Agatha realized she wasn’t just enjoying Rio’s company—she was starting to look forward to it.</span>

<p>
<span>The pastries were, as promised, exceptional. Rio practically inhaled her chocolate croissant, humming in exaggerated delight while Agatha nibbled at hers, a quiet smile tugging at her lips as she watched Rio’s antics.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Told you,” Rio said, wiping a crumb off her cheek. “Life-changing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re good,” Agatha admitted, her tone deliberately neutral to avoid inflating Rio’s already oversized ego. “But life-changing might be a stretch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped dramatically. “Blasphemy. Clearly, you don’t understand the profound art of pastry appreciation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, the sound slipping out before she could stop it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. There was something infectious about Rio’s energy, something that made her feel lighter, like the weight she carried was manageable—at least for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked back to Agatha’s house, the evening air carried the crispness of approaching autumn. The faint scent of rain lingered, mingling with the warm glow of streetlights that lined the path.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you… want to come over?” Agatha asked, her voice more tentative than she intended. “We could hang out or something. Watch a movie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, clearly surprised by the invitation, but then her face lit up. “Are you kidding? Hell yeah, I’m in. Do I get to raid your snacks too, or is this a bring-your-own situation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked despite herself. “You couldn’t handle the amount of snacks I hid in that house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Challenge accepted,” Rio said with a playful grin. “Lead the way, Mozart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s house, as always, looked more like a designer’s showroom than a home. Immaculate white walls, sharp modern furniture, and a sterile perfection that felt distinctly her mother’s, not hers. Rio paused in the entryway, looking around with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn,” Rio said, turning in a slow circle. “This place looks like it’s waiting for a photo shoot. You actually live here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Barely,” Agatha muttered, motioning toward the living room. “My mother likes… order.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dropped onto the pristine white couch with exaggerated care. “Are you sure I’m allowed to sit here? Feels like I need a permission slip.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re fine,” Agatha said, disappearing into the kitchen. She returned moments later with a bottle of wine and two glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fancy,” Rio teased, raising an eyebrow. “Are you trying to impress me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow right back. “Not everything is about you, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, taking the offered glass. “You say that, but here you are, serving me wine on a silver platter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s glass,” Agatha corrected, pouring a glass for herself. “And if you don’t behave, you’ll be drinking water.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her glass with mock solemnity. “To behaving. Sort of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The movie started with eerie music and plenty of jump scares, but as the wine flowed and Rio’s running commentary grew increasingly absurd, the fear factor dissolved into laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it,” Rio declared during a particularly over-the-top chase scene. “I’m starting a petition for horror villains to unionize. They deserve better representation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly spit out her wine, laughing harder than she had in weeks. By the time the credits rolled, her cheeks hurt from smiling, and the space between them on the couch had all but disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was terrible,” Agatha said, shaking her head as she set her empty glass on the coffee table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Terribly amazing,” Rio corrected, stretching her arms over her head. “You’re welcome for that cinematic masterpiece.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, the buzz of the wine making her limbs feel warm and weightless. “So,” she said, tilting her head to look at Rio, “what now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “We play a game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of game?” Agatha asked, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t look at me like that,” Rio said, holding up her hands. “It’s just ‘Never Have I Ever.’ You’ve played before, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her lips twitching into a smile. “I’ve… heard of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped in mock horror. “Well, Mozart, we’re about to change that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat cross-legged on the couch, glasses freshly refilled. Rio tapped her glass against Agatha’s with a cheeky grin. “I’ll start. Never have I ever… broken a bone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a sip, earning a triumphant laugh from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha said, her turn. “Never have I ever… snuck out of the house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio immediately took a long sip. “Guilty as charged. How about you? Never?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “I didn’t exactly have the freedom to sneak out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boring,” Rio teased, though her gaze softened. “But we’ll fix that. Never have I ever… kissed someone in the rain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her glass halfway to her lips. “That’s oddly specific.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, smirking. “It’s romantic. Don’t judge me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t,” Agatha said quietly, setting her glass down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in slightly, her voice softer. “Your turn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened under Rio’s gaze. “Never have I ever… dated a musician.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened, and she took another sip. “Guilty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The game continued, each question growing more personal, the air between them crackling with unspoken tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never have I ever… wanted to kiss someone but been too afraid to do it,” Rio said finally, her voice quiet and steady, their bodies closer than they should be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her breath catching. The weight of the statement hung between them, heavy and undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she set her glass down and turned to Rio, her voice barely above a whisper. “You’re direct.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re stalling,” Rio replied, her voice soft but teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t let herself think. She leaned in, her lips brushing against Rio’s in a tentative, trembling kiss. Rio responded immediately, her hand sliding to cup Agatha’s cheek, the kiss deepening, slow and deliberate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled apart, Agatha’s cheeks were flushed, her heart pounding in her chest. Rio smiled at her, warm and a little smug. “See?” she murmured, her voice low and playful. “Told you horror movies were bonding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound light and unguarded. For once, she didn’t feel the need to argue. Instead, she closed the distance between them again, the rest of the world fading away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second kiss was slower, more certain. Agatha felt herself leaning into Rio, the warmth of her touch and the gentle pressure of her lips dissolving any lingering doubts. The rest of the world disappeared—the sterile perfection of her mother’s house, the weight of expectations, the constant hum of self-doubt. For the first time, she felt grounded, present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled apart, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, her eyes still closed, a soft smile playing on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha murmured, her voice teasing but tender, “are we officially ditching the ‘Mozart’ nickname now, or do I have to kiss you a third time for that privilege?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, her cheeks still flushed. “Agatha… Yeah, I kinda love the way your name sounds on my tongue.” - Rio replied, leaning back slightly to look at her. Her brown eyes were warm, filled with an openness that made Agatha feel both exposed and safe. “But seriously, how are you feeling? No regrets, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her gaze dropping to where their hands were now lightly brushing. She shook her head. “No regrets,” she said softly, then smirked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her confidence returning in full force. She reached for her glass of wine and took a long sip, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s. “Your move, Agatha. What’s next?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question. She wasn’t used to being asked what she wanted—not by her mother, her professors, or even herself. But with Rio, the question felt genuine, unpressured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha began slowly, “we could…” Her voice trailed off as she glanced around the room, searching for something to anchor her thoughts. “We could… hm… you wanna see upstairs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Upstairs? Like, your room?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her pulse quickening. “I mean, you’re always asking me about myself, my life. It’s just a thought, hm.. maybe you would like to see it and….” - Rio forced herself not to enjoy seeing Agatha get wordless, she knew how hard it was for the singer to open up and be sincere with what she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood and offered her hand. “Lead the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s room wasn’t as pristine as the rest of the house, it felt more personal. There were soft touches of her personality—a stack of books on the nightstand, a collection of candles on a nearby shelf, and, of course, her keyboard set up near the window. The sight of it, her sanctuary, made her chest tighten slightly. The room had bold colors, mainly purple with some details in silver and black, her bed was big and occupied one of the corners of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is cozy,” Rio said. “Way less intimidating than your living room.” - the comment made Agatha roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, observing Rio as trying to print in her memory every reaction and snarky comment the biology student made about every trinket she found in Agatha’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart raced as she watched Rio move around her space with the kind of ease that made it seem as though she belonged there. Her touch was light, grazing over bookshelves, flicking at the corner of a framed photo, but it felt as though Rio was mapping her soul instead of her room. Every casual comment, every curious glance, felt like an intrusion—not unwelcome, but disarming, like Rio was seeing pieces of Agatha she’d long hidden from everyone else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped by the keyboard near the window, her fingers ghosting over the keys without pressing down. She turned, resting her hip against it as her smirk softened into something more genuine. “So, this is where it happens, huh? Where you transform from business-school prodigy to a secret Mozart?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, partly to feign nonchalance and partly to anchor herself. “I told you to stop calling me Mozart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, unbothered, but the teasing in her eyes gave way to something warmer. “Fine. But seriously, this is yours, isn’t it? Not all the other stuff. Not business school, not the pressure. Just this.” She motioned toward the keyboard. “This is you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hit Agatha like a bolt of lightning. She swallowed hard, trying to form a response, but the truth lodged itself somewhere between her mind and her throat. “I guess,” she said finally, her voice quieter than she intended. “Music is… different. It doesn’t come with expectations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression shifted, her brown eyes darkening with understanding. “That’s heavy,” she murmured, stepping closer. Her movements were slow, deliberate, as if she didn’t want to startle her. “But you know you’re allowed to have things that are just yours, right? Not things for your mom, or your professors, or anyone else. Just for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened as Rio moved closer. Her instincts screamed to retreat, to put up her walls, but Rio’s gaze held her in place. It wasn’t demanding or probing—it was patient, like she could wait all night if she had to. “I don’t think it’s that simple,” Agatha said, her voice shaky but honest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It could be,” Rio said softly, her words a quiet invitation. She was close now, close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth radiating off her. “So, what do you want? Not what you’re supposed to want. Not what anyone expects. What do </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> want, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question lingered in the air between them, charged and heavy. Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but the truth terrified her. The weight of her upbringing, her mother’s constant voice in her head, all fought to keep her silent. </span>
<em>
<span>You don’t deserve this. This isn’t who you’re supposed to be.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” she whispered, the words trembling with vulnerability.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out then, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand. The contact was light, almost hesitant, but it sent a spark up Agatha’s arm, scattering her thoughts. “I think you do,” Rio said, her voice gentle. “You’re just scared to say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her hand instinctively turning to grasp Rio’s. The warmth of her skin was grounding, steadying. She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to shut out the noise in her head. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible. “I want… you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The admission felt like stepping off the edge of a cliff, but instead of falling, Agatha felt weightless. Rio’s eyes widened slightly, but her surprise melted into something softer, deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got me,” Rio said, her voice steady, certain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next moment, Rio’s lips were on hers, and everything else vanished. The kiss was a collision—urgent, charged, a meeting of two forces that had been building toward this for weeks. Agatha’s hands found their way to Rio’s shoulders, clinging to her like a lifeline as her heart thundered in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands cupped Agatha’s face, her touch firm but tender. She kissed her like she had all the time in the world, as though this moment was the only thing that mattered. Agatha’s carefully constructed walls crumbled, piece by piece, as she leaned into the kiss, letting herself feel—really feel—for the first time in what felt like forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, they were both breathing heavily, their foreheads resting together. Agatha’s cheeks were flushed, her lips tingling, and her mind was a whirlwind of conflicting emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s cheek. “You okay?” she asked, her voice low and full of care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her gaze dropping to their hands, still lightly brushing. “I don’t know how to be okay with this,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I don’t want to stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to figure it all out tonight,” Rio said, her tone soothing. “We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m gonna make an educated guess and say your mom wouldn’t be okay with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her grip on Rio tightening as she fought back the doubts clawing at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took Rio’s hand leading her to the bed. They sat together, side by side enjoying the silence until Agatha let out a heavy sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the sigh linger in the air, heavy and filled with the weight of things she didn’t know how to say. Her fingers nervously played with the edge of her comforter, and she glanced at Rio, who was watching her with a quiet patience that made Agatha’s chest ache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother,” Agatha started, her voice hesitant, “she’s always had this way of making me feel like… I wasn’t good enough. Like I was defective somehow.” She hesitated, her hands clenched into fists. “I don’t think she ever wanted a daughter who—” Her voice broke slightly. “—a daughter like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow furrowed, but she didn’t interrupt, letting Agatha take her time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think she’s always known,” Agatha admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “About me. About how I… like women too.” She swallowed hard, her throat tight. “She never said it outright, but she didn’t have to. The way she’d make these comments about how I wasn’t ‘normal’ enough, how I needed to stop ‘acting out’ or being ‘strange.’ She’d find little ways to reprimand me, to push me back into this box of what she thought I should be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice wavered, and she glanced down at her lap, her fingers twisting together. “When I was twelve, I made a friend at school—a girl. I didn’t know what it meant then, but I think my mom did. She’d say things like, ‘That girl isn’t the right kind of influence for you,’ or, ‘You don’t want people thinking you’re strange.’” Agatha let out a bitter laugh. “Strange. That’s what she called it. Like it was something ugly, something shameful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out, her hand brushing against Agatha’s. “That’s not okay,” she said softly, her voice steady. “You know that, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do. But when you hear it enough, you start to believe it.” Agatha’s lips twisted into a sad smile. “When I was sixteen, she told me I was born evil.” The words hung in the air, cold and cutting. “It was after I skipped class to go to the movies with a friend. She found out and said, ‘You were born with something wrong in you, Agatha. You have this darkness that needs to be controlled.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tightened, her hand gripping Agatha’s. “That’s not true, you were just  being a kid”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “I know that now—or at least I think I do. But back then? It felt like I was suffocating. I try so hard to be what she wants, to be perfect. But no matter how much I give, it is never enough. She always finds something else to criticize, to tear apart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grip on her hand tightened, grounding her. “You don’t have to be perfect for anyone. Especially not for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio, her eyes glassy with unshed tears. “You say that it's easy, but it’s not. I’ve spent my whole life trying to live up to this impossible standard. And I’ve given up so much because of her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like what?” Rio asked gently, her thumb brushing over the back of Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then laughed softly, the sound tinged with sadness. “Stupid things. Crazy things. I’ve never tried drugs. Never had a phase where I didn’t care what people thought. I’ve never gotten a tattoo, even though I’ve wanted one since I was seventeen. I’ve never just… let go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her smile small but full of warmth. “You’ve thought about it, though. What kind of tattoo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, surprised by the question. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “Something small. Maybe a star or a moon. Something that feels like… me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then let’s do it,” Rio said, her voice firm but playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, her eyes widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not tonight,” Rio said with a grin. “But someday. We’ll get you that tattoo. And if you want, we’ll try other stuff too. Maybe not all at once—I’m not suggesting we do a line of coke and buy a motorcycle or anything. But we’ll do the things that make you feel free.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, a lump forming in her throat. “Why do you care so much?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened, her hand cupping Agatha’s cheek. “Because you deserve to be happy, Agatha. And because I like seeing the real you—the one who smiles like the world doesn’t matter, the one who agrees that villains should have a union, that is bold enough to paint her room purple, and that sings with her entire soul. I want to see more of her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tears that had been threatening to fall finally spilled over, and Agatha leaned into Rio’s touch. “It’s hard,” she admitted, her voice trembling. “Letting go of all the things she’s put in my head. It’s like I’m always going to be carrying her voice around, telling me I’m not enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re more than enough,” Rio said fiercely, her thumb brushing away a tear. “You’re everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond with words. Instead, she closed the distance between them, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that was both desperate and tender. It was a kiss filled with everything she couldn’t say, everything she was still too scared to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss deepened, Agatha’s hands held Rio’s face with less tenderness, while the drummer reached for her lover’s t-shirt, pressing her fingers to the blue-eyed woman’s skin and feeling the warmth of her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss grew more heated, and Agatha felt her breath hitch as Rio’s hands slid under her shirt, her touch firm yet careful, as if Rio were trying to memorize every inch of her. Agatha’s skin tingled under Rio’s fingers, and for once, she didn’t pull away. Instead, she let herself lean in, her hands tangling in Rio’s hair as their lips moved together in a rhythm that felt natural, electric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned against Agatha’s mouth, her hands traveling higher, drawing goosebumps in their wake. “You’re full of surprises, you know that?” Rio murmured, her voice husky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t start,” Agatha said, but the words lacked their usual bite, her tone breathy and soft. She tugged at Rio’s shirt in response, her movements hesitant but eager. Rio’s confidence made it easier, her steady gaze silently reassuring her that this was okay—this was them, and nothing else mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her own shirt off with ease, her lips never straying far from Agatha’s. “Your turn,” she teased, her hands moving to the hem of Agatha’s shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her fingers frozen for a moment. The noise in her head threatened to rise again—her mother’s voice, the years of repression—but Rio’s eyes were locked on hers, warm and patient, not rushing her. “I’ve got you,” Rio said softly, her voice like a tether in the storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a shaky breath, Agatha let Rio lift her shirt off, the air cool against her heated skin. Rio’s hands lingered on her sides, her touch both grounding and electric. “Beautiful,” Rio said, her voice almost reverent as she traced a line down Agatha’s arm. The word made Agatha’s heart stutter, but instead of shrinking away, she leaned into it, into Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They shifted to the middle of the bed, Rio guiding Agatha gently until she was lying back against the pillows. Rio hovered over her, her movements slow and deliberate, giving Agatha time to adjust, to take in every moment. “Tell me if it’s too much,” Rio said, her voice a low murmur.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not,” Agatha replied, surprising herself with the certainty in her tone. “It’s… it’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile was soft as she leaned down, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s collarbone, then to her neck, her lips leaving a trail of warmth that made Agatha shiver. Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist, her fingers brushing against the curve of her hips. She felt bold, reckless in a way she never had before, and she reveled in it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s kisses grew deeper, more insistent, her body pressing against Agatha’s as they moved together, the world outside fading to nothing. Agatha felt her inhibitions slipping away, piece by piece, replaced by the raw, aching joy of being seen, of being wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then the sound of the front door slamming open shattered the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Evanora’s voice rang out, sharp and cold, cutting through the haze like a knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her heart lurching in her chest. The warmth and safety of Rio’s presence evaporated in an instant, replaced by a flood of panic. She scrambled upright, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps as she yanked her shirt back on, her hands shaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved quickly, sitting up and grabbing her own shirt, her expression shifting to one of concern. “Hey, it’s okay,” she said softly, reaching for Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not okay,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling. Her mother’s voice was closer now, her footsteps echoing through the house like a storm. “She can’t find you here. She can’t—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Evanora’s voice was just outside the door now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at the door, then back at Agatha. “I’ll go. It’s fine. We’ll figure this out later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could respond, the door flew open, and Evanora stood there, her icy gaze sweeping over the room. The sight of Rio, still in the process of pulling her shirt over her head, made Evanora’s expression harden into something cold and furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What,” Evanora said, her voice dangerously low, “is going on here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice failed her, the words lodging in her throat as the weight of her mother’s judgment crashed over her like a tidal wave.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>The silence that followed Evanora’s question was deafening. Agatha’s mind raced, her thoughts tangled in panic and shame as she stood frozen on the bed. Rio, however, didn’t flinch. She finished pulling her shirt on and straightened up, meeting Evanora’s icy glare with a calm confidence that seemed utterly unshakable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Rio,” she said, her tone even but firm, as if Evanora’s anger didn’t faze her in the slightest. “Agatha’s friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s lips curled into a sharp, cruel smile. “Friend?” she repeated, the word dripping with disdain. “Is that what we’re calling this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom—” Agatha finally found her voice, but it came out shaky, almost inaudible. “It’s not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quiet.” Evanora’s command was cold and final, her gaze snapping to Agatha like a whip. “I don’t need your excuses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped forward, placing herself slightly in front of Agatha. Her stance was protective but not aggressive. “With all due respect, Ms. Harkness, Agatha doesn’t need to explain anything to you. She’s an adult.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s eyes narrowed, her icy composure cracking slightly. “And who do you think you are, coming into my house and lecturing me about my daughter?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone who cares about her,” Rio replied simply, her voice steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted. This wasn’t happening. She couldn’t believe Rio was standing up to Evanora, and part of her wanted to scream for her to stop—to leave before things got worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You care about her?” Evanora let out a humorless laugh, her eyes cutting back to Agatha. “Do you hear that, Agatha? Your little ‘friend’ thinks she knows what’s best for you. That’s cute. Really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands were trembling, and she struggled to find the words to diffuse the situation. “Mom, please, let’s just talk—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think we have anything to talk about,” Evanora snapped, her voice sharp enough to make Agatha flinch. “Except for how you’re wasting everything I’ve given you. Sneaking around like some rebellious teenager instead of focusing on your future.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not sneaking around,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I’m just—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re just embarrassing yourself. And me.” Evanora’s words hit like daggers, her tone dripping with contempt. “Do you know what people would say if they found out about this? About her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s enough,” Rio said sharply, stepping forward again. Her calm demeanor had shifted, her voice firm and unyielding. “You don’t get to talk to her like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s gaze snapped to Rio, her expression venomous. “And you don’t get to speak to me in my house. Leave. Now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, glancing back at Agatha. Her brown eyes softened, her voice lowering. “Do you want me to go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened. She felt torn, pulled between the suffocating weight of her mother’s fury and the fragile hope Rio represented. “I—” she started, but the words wouldn’t come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go,” Evanora ordered, her voice slicing through the room like a blade. “And don’t come back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio straightened, her jaw tightening. She knew how hard it was for Agatha to stand up to her mother, but part of her wished the girl would ask her to stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes burned with unshed tears, but she couldn’t bring herself to respond. She watched in silence as Rio walked to the door, pausing only to give her one last, lingering look before leaving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door clicked shut, and the silence that followed was suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora turned to Agatha, her expression colder than ever. “Do you see now what happens when you stray from the path? This… distraction will ruin you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not a distraction,” Agatha said, her voice trembling but stronger than before. “She’s… she’s the only person who makes me feel like I can breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with disdain. “And what does that say about you, Agatha? That you need someone like her to feel whole?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides. For the first time, anger overpowered the shame. “It says that I’m tired, Mom. Tired of trying to be everything you want me to be. Tired of feeling like I’ll never be enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora stepped closer, her voice lowering to a deadly calm. “You will stop this. Do you understand me? Whatever this… phase is, it ends now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a phase,” Agatha said, her voice shaking but defiant. “And you can’t control me forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s expression didn’t falter, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes—anger, yes, but also fear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha took her first step toward the door, Evanora’s voice lashed out behind her, a sharp, venomous sound that froze her mid-stride. “Don’t you dare walk away from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, her chest heaving with defiance and fear. “You can’t stop me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>What happened next made Agatha relive every part of her childhood she vowed to ignore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s expression darkened, her cold fury morphing into something feral. Before Agatha could react, her mother closed the distance between them in two swift strides and grabbed her arm, yanking her back with enough force to make her stumble. “I gave you </span>
<em>
<span>everything,</span>
</em>
<span>” Evanora hissed, her grip like iron. “And this is how you repay me? By throwing it all away for some… </span>
<em>
<span>girl</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me go,” Agatha demanded, her voice trembling as she tried to wrench herself free, but Evanora’s grip tightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think you can just walk out of here and live your little fantasy life?” Evanora’s voice rose, shrill and cutting. “You are mine, Agatha. I made you. And I will not let you ruin yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s hand struck out again, this time against Agatha’s side, her nails raking across the fabric of her shirt and scratching her skin beneath. Agatha stumbled backward, her breath hitching as the force knocked her off balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Years of memories flooded her mind, vivid and cruel. She was eight years old again, hiding under her bed after spilling juice on one of Evanora’s silk rugs. She remembered the sound of her mother’s footsteps approaching, each one measured, deliberate. The fear in her chest had been suffocating as Evanora knelt down, her voice calm yet cold as ice. </span>
<em>
<span>“Come out, Agatha. Don’t make me wait.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>When she didn’t move fast enough, Evanora grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out, her nails biting into Agatha’s small wrist. </span>
<em>
<span>“You’re ungrateful, clumsy, and weak,”</span>
</em>
<span> her mother had said, punctuating her words with a slap that left a mark on Agatha’s cheek for days. </span>
<em>
<span>“If you don’t learn to be better, no one will ever care about you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>That moment had set the tone for the rest of her childhood. Evanora’s discipline was always swift, precise, and cruel, leaving bruises that were easy to hide but impossible to forget.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, standing in her room, Agatha felt that same fear clawing at her. But this time, it was met with something stronger: anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t own me,” Agatha spat, her voice trembling but defiant. “I’m not a child anymore. I don’t need you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s face twisted into something monstrous. “You’ll always need me. Without me, you’re nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next slap was harder, knocking Agatha to the floor. Her vision blurred, and the sting on her cheek radiated down her neck. She tried to get up, but Evanora’s foot pressed against her side, pinning her in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll never survive out there without me,” Evanora sneered, her voice dripping with cruelty. “No one will want you. Not Rio. Not anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body trembled under the weight of her mother’s words, but the thought of Rio—her warmth, her steady presence—gave her strength. She shoved Evanora’s foot away and scrambled to her feet, her breaths coming in short, desperate gasps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d rather have no one than live another day under your control,” Agatha said, her voice cracking but resolute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora raised her hand again, but this time, Agatha caught her wrist. “You can’t hurt me anymore,” she whispered, her grip steady despite the tears streaming down her face. “I won’t let you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s eyes widened, shocked by her daughter’s defiance. For a moment, neither of them moved, the tension between them like a taut wire ready to snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha released her mother’s wrist and turned, bolting for the door before Evanora could react. She burst outside, the cool night air hitting her like a lifeline. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha stumbled down the street, her heart pounding and her limbs trembling with adrenaline and fear. She didn’t know where she was going; she just knew she couldn’t stop. The cool night air stung her bruised cheek and the raw scratches on her side. She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to hold everything in as the weight of her mother’s words echoed in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one will want you. Not Rio. Not anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of going to Rio crossed her mind, but it was fleeting. Agatha couldn’t bear the idea of showing up at Rio’s place, broken and bruised, her vulnerability on full display. She didn’t want to be seen like this—weak and unhinged. So, she kept walking, her steps unsteady as her emotions spiraled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she saw the glowing neon sign of a bar on the corner, she hesitated for only a moment before pushing the door open. The noise hit her immediately: the hum of conversation, the clinking of glasses, and the faint sound of music playing in the background. It was exactly what she needed—a place to disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding onto a stool at the bar, Agatha ordered a drink without even looking at the menu. The bartender, a middle-aged man with a kind smile, handed her a glass of something amber-colored. She took a sip, the burn of alcohol spreading through her chest, grounding her for the first time all night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One drink turned into two, then three, and by the time she ordered her fourth, she felt the buzz of alcohol softening the edges of her pain. She wasn’t entirely numb, but she was untethered enough to let her guard down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rough night?” a voice asked from beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to see a woman with bright red and black hair and a leather jacket. Her piercing black eyes sparkled with curiosity. She was joined by two others: a brunette with a grin and an older woman with sharp features and a confident air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve had better,” Agatha slurred, her words tumbling out with far less precision than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Alice,” the red-haired woman said, sliding onto the stool next to her. She motioned to the others. “That’s Lilia, and the one who looks like she could fight a bear and win is Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a weak laugh, feeling a flicker of warmth in their presence. “Agatha,” she said, raising her glass in an unsteady salute. “Nice to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you here alone?” Lilia asked, her tone more concerned than nosy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. “Just needed… to get away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tilted her head, studying her. “Bad breakup?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head vigorously, the room spinning slightly at the motion. “Not a breakup. Just… everything. My mother is…” She trailed off, gesturing vaguely. “A nightmare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen snorted, taking a swig of her beer. “Aren’t they all?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound raw and unfiltered. “You don’t know the half of it. She’s controlling, cruel, and… God, she slapped me tonight. She hit me.” The words spilled out before she could stop them, and the weight of the admission made her head spin even more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The trio exchanged glances, their expressions shifting from casual to concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” Lilia said softly. “That’s heavy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Understatement of the year,” Agatha muttered, downing the rest of her drink. “And now she’s ruined everything. Rio probably thinks I’m pathetic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s Rio?” Alice asked, her lips curving into a sly smile. “Sounds like there’s a story there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, the alcohol loosening her inhibitions enough to let her talk but not enough to stop her from blushing. “She’s… someone who makes me feel like I’m not drowning. She’s chaotic and confident and everything I’m too afraid to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raised an eyebrow. “And you think she’d judge you for what happened tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She wouldn’t,” Agatha admitted, her voice soft. “That’s the problem. She’d see all the mess, and she’d still stay. And I… I don’t know how to handle that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned forward, her expression serious for the first time. “Sounds like she cares about you. And if she does, she won’t care about the mess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes burned, tears threatening to spill again. “She stood up to my mother tonight. No one’s ever done that for me before. And I just… let her leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then call her,” Lilia said simply. “Or don’t. But don’t sit here beating yourself up for being human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at them, their faces open and kind, and felt an unfamiliar pang of gratitude. “Why are you guys being so nice to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shrugged. “Because you look like you need it. And because we’ve all been there—different reasons, same pain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raised her beer in a mock toast. “To surviving shitty situations and finding your way out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, a genuine one this time, and clinked her empty glass against Jen’s. “To that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time that night, the weight on her chest felt a little lighter. And as the hours passed, filled with laughter and stories from her new friends, Agatha realized she wasn’t as alone as she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The hours blurred together as Agatha, Alice, Lilia, and Jen sat around a high-top table in the corner of the bar, drinks multiplying on the tabletop like magic. The initial edge of awkwardness wore off quickly, replaced by the loose, vibrant energy of shared laughter and alcohol-fueled honesty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So let me get this straight,” Alice said, leaning forward with a conspiratorial grin. “Rio is hot, brave, and totally into you. And your reaction is… what, to run away and get drunk with us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands. “You make it sound so stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is stupid,” Jen cut in bluntly, but her smile softened the blow. “But hey, sometimes we’re all a little stupid. Especially when it comes to feelings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not good at feelings,” Agatha muttered, peeking out from behind her fingers. Her face was flushed—not just from the alcohol but from the way Alice and Lilia were looking at her, like they were rooting for her in a way that felt almost too kind to be real. “Rio… she’s so—God, she’s so Rio. Confident, chaotic, not afraid of anything. And then there’s me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you?” Lilia asked, her tone gentle. “What’s so wrong with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything.” Agatha gestured vaguely at herself, nearly knocking over her drink. “I’m a mess. My mom has been in my head my whole life, telling me I’m not good enough. And tonight? She—” Her voice cracked, and she hesitated before continuing. She said Rio would never want me because I’m broken.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The table fell quiet for a moment, the weight of her words sinking in. Alice reached across and put a hand on Agatha’s arm. “Listen to me,” she said, her voice firm but kind. “You’re not broken. You’re hurt, yeah, but that’s not the same thing. And if Rio is even half as great as you say she is, she’s not going to care about any of that. She’ll just care about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if she doesn’t,” Jen added, “she’s an idiot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia leaned in, her eyes twinkling mischievously. “You know what you need? A rebound night. Forget Rio for a bit, let loose, and have some fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, laughing despite herself. “I’m not exactly the ‘let loose’ type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you are tonight,” Alice declared, raising her glass. “Here’s to getting drunk and making bad decisions with strangers who are now your friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clinked her glass against Alice’s, a small, tipsy smile tugging at her lips. “You guys are terrible influences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We prefer the term ‘necessary distractions,’” Lilia said, grinning. “So, tell us something embarrassing about Rio. There’s gotta be something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, the alcohol making her more candid than she intended. “She plays the drums, and she’s amazing at it, but—” She giggled, covering her mouth. “She’s also a total klutz. Like, she trips over her own drumsticks if they’re on the floor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice burst out laughing. “No way! That’s adorable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is adorable,” Agatha admitted, her cheeks heating. “And she has this way of looking at me, like… like I’m the only person in the room. It’s infuriating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not infuriating,” Lilia said with mock seriousness. “That’s romantic as hell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s terrifying,” Agatha countered, her voice rising slightly. “Because what if she realizes I’m not… I’m not who she thinks I am?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop it,” Jen said, pointing at her with her beer bottle. “Don’t you dare talk about yourself like that. You’re a damn catch, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded in agreement. “Absolutely. And if Rio doesn’t see that, then we’ll all go beat her up for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound bubbling up from somewhere deep inside her. It felt good, even if it was tinged with sadness. “You guys are ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome to the club,” Lilia said, raising her glass. “We specialize in chaos and bad decisions. Speaking of which, do you wanna sing karaoke? There’s a setup in the corner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no,” Agatha said, shaking her head vehemently. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes,” Alice said, her grin wicked. “You don’t get to tell us you’re a singer and not prove it. Come on!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could protest further, the three women were dragging her toward the small karaoke stage in the corner of the bar. She tried to resist, but the alcohol in her system made her limbs feel uncooperative, and the infectious enthusiasm of her new friends was impossible to fight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What should she sing?” Jen asked, scrolling through the song options.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something dramatic,” Alice suggested. “She seems like the dramatic type.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a smile. “Fine. But if I’m doing this, you’re all singing backup.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Lilia said, grabbing a second microphone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the opening chords of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”, Agatha took a deep breath and stepped up to the microphone. Her heart pounded, but as she sang the first note, the world seemed to fade away. For a moment, it was just her and the music, and the weight of the night lifted, if only for a little while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time the song ended, the bar erupted into cheers, and Agatha felt a genuine smile stretch across her face. Maybe she wasn’t okay—maybe she wouldn’t be for a while. But surrounded by these chaotic, supportive strangers, she felt like she might get there someday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio woke up abruptly at 4:57 a.m., her phone ringing. The voice of a drunken Agatha slurred through the line. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Riiiooooo,” Agatha dragged out her name, her voice a mix of laughter and hiccups. “Did you know... did you know... you’re like… like, perfect? But also infuriating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up in bed, her heart immediately racing. She rubbed her eyes, trying to shake off the haze of sleep. “Agatha? Where are you? Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I okay? Am I okay?” Agatha’s laugh was loud, and Rio could hear the background noise of music and chatter. “Nope! Definitely not. But I’m also… also having so much fun! You should be here, Rio. You’d love my new friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“New friends?” Rio frowned, throwing on a hoodie and grabbing her keys. “Where are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um…” Agatha trailed off, giggling. “I’m at… at a bar. A bar with… Alice, Lilia, and Jen. They’re awesome, Rio. They said you’re stupid if you don’t love me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze mid-step, her heart skipping a beat. “Wait, what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup!” Agatha sang. “Stuuupid. And you know what? They’re right! You’d have to be stupid because I’m great! Even if I’m… a mess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath, her chest tightening. “Agatha, just tell me the name of the bar, okay? I’m coming to get you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, you’re coming for me?” Agatha said, her voice softening, almost wistful. “You’re always coming for me, Rio. That’s why I’m scared, you know? Because you don’t… you don’t run away when I’m a mess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” Rio’s voice broke slightly. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to stay calm. “Where are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, um, um…” Agatha hummed, clearly struggling to focus. In the background, a voice—Alice, maybe—called out, “She’s at Salem’s!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Salem’s. Got it. Stay there, okay? Don’t move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again. “I’m not moving. I’m just… I’m just spinning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hung up, grabbed her sneakers, and bolted out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At Salem’s, Agatha was slumped against a high-top table, her head resting on her arms. Alice, Lilia, and Jen sat around her, each nursing a drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s fine,” Alice said when Rio approached, her tone casual but her eyes sharp. “Just drunk and a little heartbroken, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knelt beside Agatha, brushing a strand of hair out of her face. “Agatha, it’s me. I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head slowly, her eyes glassy and unfocused. When she saw Rio, her face lit up. “Rio! You came. My hero.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightened. “Always. Let’s get you out of here, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nooo,” Agatha whined, slumping back down. “I’m talking to my friends. They’re nice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked. “For the record, she’s been talking about you all night. Very complimentary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, standing up and looking at the trio. “Thank you for looking out for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem,” Lilia said, raising her glass in a mock toast. “She’s good company. Very dramatic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s usually not like this,” Rio muttered, pulling Agatha gently to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned heavily on Rio, her head lolling against her shoulder. “Rio, don’t be mad. They made me sing karaoke. I sang… what did I sing, Alice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“‘Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,’” Alice replied, laughing. “And you crushed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but smile despite herself. “I’m not mad, Agatha. Let’s just get you home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t wanna go home,” Agatha mumbled, her voice thick with emotion. “Home sucks. Home is mean. Let’s go to your place. Your place is warm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve never been to my place, Agatha. - Rio hesitated, then nodded. “Okay. My place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they turned to leave, Jen called out, “Hey, Rio? She’s a good one. Just saying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her grip on Agatha tightening. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back at Rio’s apartment, Agatha sat on the couch, swaying slightly as Rio handed her a glass of water. “Drink,” Rio ordered softly, sitting beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a sip of the water, then stared at the glass as though it were a magical artifact. “Did you know… water is, like, so wet?” she mused, her voice slurring with drunken awe. She set the glass down carefully—too carefully—and turned her attention to Rio. “And you… you’re like… the opposite of water. You’re warm. Like… like the sun. Or a really big blanket.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back a smile, shaking her head. “Agatha, you’re drunk. You need to rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t wanna rest,” Agatha protested, leaning dramatically against the back of the couch. Her eyes roamed the apartment, taking in the abundance of plants that filled every available surface. “Whoa. Look at all your plants. It’s like… a jungle here. Are you secretly a plant witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, shaking her head as she grabbed a blanket from a nearby chair. “Not a witch, just someone who likes plants. They’re good company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, pointing unsteadily at a tall “monstera”. “That one’s judging me. I can feel it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, unfolding the blanket. “Pretty sure it’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it is,” Agatha insisted, pouting. She turned back to Rio, her expression suddenly shifting to something soft and sincere. “You’re so good at this, you know? Taking care of things. Of plants. Of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s movements stilled for a moment, her eyes meeting Agatha’s. “It’s not hard to take care of someone you care about,” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, though whether it was from the alcohol or Rio’s words, she wasn’t sure. “You care about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, draping the blanket over Agatha’s lap. “Of course I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes filled with drunken mischief as she leaned closer to Rio, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “You wanna kiss me, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Admit it,” Agatha said, grinning. “You think I’m cute. And talented. And you love my voice.” She waved her hands dramatically. “I’m like… a goddess. A chaotic, drunk goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips together, fighting the urge to laugh. “You’re definitely something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something irresistible?” Agatha batted her lashes, her grin widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something drunk,” Rio corrected, her tone firm but amused. She stood up, gesturing toward the bedroom. “Come on. You need to sleep this off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her, spotting the drum set in the corner of the room. Her eyes lit up with childlike wonder. “Ooh, your drums! I wanna play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not,” Rio said, moving to block her path. But Agatha was already on her feet, wobbling slightly as she made her way toward the drums.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me just… let me try!” Agatha pleaded, sitting on the stool and grabbing the drumsticks with an uncoordinated flourish. She tapped out a sloppy rhythm, the noise loud and chaotic. “See? I’m amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow. “You’re making my drums cry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha giggled, dropping one of the sticks and leaning precariously forward. Rio rushed to steady her, placing her hands on Agatha’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, that’s enough,” Rio said firmly, guiding her away from the drum set. “You’re going to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha allowed herself to be led, leaning heavily against Rio as they walked. “You’re so bossy,” she mumbled, her words muffled against Rio’s shoulder. “But also… you smell really nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I guess?” Rio replied, helping Agatha onto the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flopped onto the mattress with a contented sigh, her arms spread wide. “Your bed is so comfy. Can I stay forever?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just start with tonight,” Rio said, pulling the blanket over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, grabbing Rio’s hand before she could step away. “You’re my favorite person, you know that? You make me feel safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart softened, and she gave Agatha’s hand a gentle squeeze. “Get some rest, okay? I’ll be right here if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, a sleepy smile tugging at her lips. “Goodnight, plant witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Goodnight, chaotic goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha’s breathing evened out, Rio sat beside her, watching the peaceful rise and fall of her chest. The night had been a whirlwind, but in this quiet moment, Rio felt an overwhelming sense of certainty: whatever chaos Agatha brought into her life, she wouldn’t have it any other way.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha woke the next morning to a throbbing headache and the distinct sense that she had lost a battle with her dignity. The sunlight filtering through Rio’s blinds felt like it was stabbing directly into her brain, and she groaned, burying her face in the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, chaotic goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha peeked out to find Rio standing in the doorway, a mug in hand and an infuriatingly amused expression on her face. Her messy hair and comfortable tank top gave her a casual warmth that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat, even in her hungover state.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha mumbled, pulling the blanket over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, setting the mug on the nightstand. “I made you some tea. Thought it might help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha poked her head out again, eyeing the mug warily. “Tea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “It’s ginger and mint. Good for hangovers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffed the air, wrinkling her nose. “I hate tea. It tastes like wet leaves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “And yet, you drink coffee, which is literally bean water.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t disrespect coffee,” Agatha said with mock seriousness. “It’s the nectar of life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted,” Rio said, sitting on the edge of the bed. “But you’re drinking this tea first. Doctor’s orders.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned but sat up, taking the mug begrudgingly. She sipped it and immediately made a face. “Disgusting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Charming,” Rio said dryly, handing her a bottle of water. “Wash it down with this, drama queen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drank gratefully, the cold water soothing her parched throat. She looked at Rio, who was watching her with a mix of amusement and concern. “Thanks,” she said quietly, setting the mug down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Feeling a little more human?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Barely,” Agatha admitted. Her gaze drifted to Rio’s plants, which seemed impossibly vibrant in the morning light. “Do your plants judge everyone, or just me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They love you,” Rio said, grinning. “They told me so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a weak laugh, leaning back against the headboard. Her amusement faded as she noticed a tender ache in her side. When she shifted, a sharp sting made her wince.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, her tone softening. “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nothing,” Agatha said quickly, trying to sit up straighter, but the movement pulled at her side again, making her flinch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.” Rio’s voice was gentle but firm. “Let me see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her face flushing. “I… It’s not a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “I don’t care if it’s a paper cut or a broken bone. Let me help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening. Slowly, she lifted her shirt, revealing the faint red scratches running along her side. Rio’s expression darkened, her jaw tightening as her eyes traced the marks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She did this, didn’t she?” Rio’s voice was low, filled with barely restrained anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her throat too tight to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out, her fingers hovering just above the bruised skin, careful not to touch. “Does it hurt?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only when I move too much,” Agatha said softly, her voice trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, her brown eyes filled with a mixture of tenderness and fury. “You don’t deserve this, Agatha. None of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a shaky laugh, pulling her shirt back down. “I guess I make a habit of disappointing people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” Rio’s voice was sharp but not unkind. She placed a hand over Agatha’s, her grip warm and steady. “You are not a disappointment. Not to me. Not to anyone who matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes filled with tears, and she looked away, embarrassed. “You don’t understand. If you knew everything about me…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do know,” Rio interrupted, her voice firm but gentle. “I see you, Agatha. All of you. And you’re incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders shook as the tears she had been holding back finally spilled over. Rio pulled her into a hug, her arms wrapping around her securely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to carry this alone,” Rio murmured, her hand running soothingly over Agatha’s back. “Not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in a long time, Agatha let herself believe it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Rio pulled back, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Come on. Let’s get you cleaned up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated but nodded, allowing Rio to help her to her feet. They made their way to the bathroom, where Rio handed her a fresh towel and turned on the shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll wait right outside,” Rio said, her voice gentle. “Take your time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped into the warm water, letting it cascade over her, washing away the remnants of the night before. As she cleaned herself, she caught sight of the faint scars along her arms and sides—evidence of years of silent battles. She traced them with her fingers, a mix of shame and defiance welling up inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The steam filled the small bathroom, fogging the mirror and blurring the sharp edges of reality. The hot water soothed her sore muscles, but the ache in her chest lingered—a mixture of exhaustion, relief, and a strange, unfamiliar hope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned her face up to the spray, trying to clear her mind, but Rio’s voice lingered, soft and steady. </span>
<em>
<span>You’re incredible. You’re not alone.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips curved into a faint, unbidden smile. And then, almost as if the thought carried a will of its own, Agatha spoke aloud, her voice barely audible over the rush of water. “Rio…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the silence that followed, she thought better of it. But then she remembered the way Rio had looked at her—unwavering, full of care—and felt a surge of boldness rise within her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she called out louder this time, her voice steadier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a hesitant knock at the door. “Yeah? Everything okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, clutching the edge of the shower curtain. “Come in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked open, and Rio stepped inside, her face cautious but concerned. Her eyes softened as they met Agatha’s. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her cheeks warming under the flush of the steam. “Stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows furrowed, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. “In here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, the boldness in her chest battling with the nervous flutter in her stomach. “I don’t… I don’t want to be alone right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her gaze searching Agatha’s for any sign of uncertainty. When she found none, she smiled softly and nodded. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped closer, her movements slow and deliberate, as if giving Agatha every chance to change her mind. But Agatha didn’t waver. She reached out, her wet fingers brushing Rio’s hand, pulling her gently closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched as their eyes met, the steam curling around them like a cocoon. “Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with vulnerability but steady in its conviction. “I want you here. With me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped into the shower, fully clothed, the water soaking through her tank top and sweatpants. Agatha let out a surprised laugh, a mix of amusement and relief breaking through her nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to strip down or just… go with it,” Rio said with a sheepish grin, her damp hair sticking to her forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again, the sound lighter this time. Rio’s hands found Agatha’s waist, her touch tentative yet firm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laughter faded as she met Rio’s gaze, the intensity in her brown eyes stealing her breath. “You really care about me, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More than you know,” Rio murmured, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart raced as she closed the distance between them, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that was slow and searching. The warmth of Rio’s touch, combined with the heat of the water, sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. She felt her walls crumble, the weight of her past momentarily lifting as she leaned into Rio, her hands tangling in her wet hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio deepened the kiss, her hands sliding up Agatha’s back, tracing the faint scars with a tenderness that made Agatha’s chest ache. It wasn’t just passion; it was care, understanding, and something deeper that neither of them dared to name just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world outside the bathroom faded, leaving only the sound of the water and the steady rhythm of their breaths. For the first time in years, Agatha felt truly seen—not as the perfect daughter, not as a fractured soul, but simply as herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled apart, their foreheads resting together, Agatha’s eyes burned with unshed tears as she smiled, her voice barely a whisper. “Thank you for being here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always,” Rio promised, pulling her close again as the water continued to fall around them, washing away the pain of yesterday and leaving behind something new—something fragile but full of possibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are we like this?” - Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hot and wet?” - Rio kid. “Well, that’s the implication of making out at the shower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“ I meant, awkward and intense, but that fits better.” - Agatha responded by taking Rio’s wet hair out of her face, tracing her jaw with her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly at Agatha's response, her breath warm against Agatha's lips. “We’re like this because we’re figuring it out, and it’s messy,” she said, her voice low and steady. “But I don’t mind being messy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her cheeks flush, though whether it was from the steam or the weight of Rio’s gaze, she wasn’t sure. “I don’t either,” she whispered, her fingers lingering on Rio’s jaw before sliding down to rest on her shoulders. “At least, not with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened, her hands steady as they rested on Agatha’s waist. “Then let’s stop overthinking,” she murmured, leaning in to capture Agatha’s lips in another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, the kiss deepened quickly, their movements becoming less hesitant and more assured. Agatha’s arms wrapped around Rio’s neck, pulling her closer as the water cascaded over them, soaking them both completely. Rio’s hands roamed gently, sliding along Agatha’s sides, her thumbs brushing the edges of the faint scars she’d noticed earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re beautiful,” Rio murmured against Agatha’s lips, her voice sincere and unshaken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, the words sending a ripple of warmth through her chest. She pulled back slightly, her blue eyes searching Rio’s face. “You mean that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every word,” Rio replied, her hands steadying on Agatha’s hips. “You’re strong, Agatha. And you’re beautiful in ways you don’t even realize.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears pricked at the corners of Agatha’s eyes, but they didn’t fall. Instead, she surged forward, her lips meeting Rio’s in a kiss that was full of gratitude and something much deeper—a trust she hadn’t given anyone before. The water slicked their skin, making their movements fluid as they explored the connection between them with unspoken understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha murmured against her lips, her hands sliding down to rest against Rio’s chest. “Let’s… go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, her eyes meeting Agatha’s in a moment of surprise and tenderness. “Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling but resolute. “I want this. I want you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her expression softening with emotion. She turned off the water and reached for the towels, wrapping one around Agatha before grabbing another for herself. They dried off quickly, the weight of the moment making every small touch feel charged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took Rio’s hand, leading her into the bedroom. The bed was unmade, the sunlight spilling across the rumpled sheets, and Agatha felt a pang of nervousness. But Rio’s steady presence grounded her, and she turned to face her, the vulnerability in her expression clear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They moved to the bed together, their movements unhurried and filled with care. Agatha sat on the edge, her hands resting on her thighs as Rio knelt in front of her, her hands covering Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled at the sincerity in Rio’s eyes. She leaned forward, cupping Rio’s face in her hands as she kissed her deeply. The kiss grew more intense, their breaths mingling as they moved together in perfect rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio guided Agatha onto the bed, her hands exploring with a reverence that made Agatha’s skin tingle. Every touch was careful, deliberate, as though Rio were memorizing every inch of her. Agatha’s hands mirrored Rio’s movements, growing bolder as she let herself feel, really feel, for the first time in so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s clothes were shed gradually, each piece falling away to reveal more of the raw, unguarded connection between them. Agatha’s fingers trembled slightly as she traced the lines of Rio’s body, her breaths shallow but steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re incredible,” Agatha whispered, her voice full of awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her gaze warm as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s forehead, then her cheek, then her lips. “So are you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they moved together, the rest of the world faded away. It was just them—two souls finding solace and passion in each other’s arms. For the first time, Agatha felt free—free to be herself, free to feel, and free to love. And in Rio’s touch, she found something she hadn’t known she was searching for: a sense of home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As their bodies mingled with the sheets, Rio made sure she felt every bit of Agatha’s body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned softly as their kisses deepened, her legs wrapping around Rio's waist. She felt the warmth in her belly spreading to every corner of her body, a heady mix of desire and relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands started gently caressing Agatha’s breasts, she planned on being soft, making Agatha feel loved and idolized, she wanted to make love to Agatha, but as she tentatively explored her the pale skin of Agatha’s body, Rio realized the girl had other plans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to feel, to feel powerful, sexy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you to fuck me.” - were the words that came out of the singer's mouth. Direct, assertive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped mid touch, her face flushed with surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything, she just looked at Rio with those big blue eyes of hers, pleading. Her hands tracing down Rio's back, commanding attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, and I really want to experience everything with you, but right now I need… messy. I need us.” - Agatha added, a hint of nervousness crossing her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it, hermosa.” - Rio smiled, her heart melting for this girl. She positioned herself between Agatha's spread legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's bare sex, already glistening with arousal. Rio's eyes widened with hunger as she leaned in, her tongue feeling the full extension of her pussy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped as Rio's tongue flicked over her clit, sending shivers down her spine. "Oh, goddess," she moaned, arching her hips upwards, craving more contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rio," Agatha whimpered, her hands gripping the sheets as Rio fingered her relentlessly. "I... I need you... inside me... now."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio continued to tease her folds, circling and flicking her clit. Agatha cried out, her hips jerking forward as she felt the fullness. Rio leaned in and kissed her hard, their tongues tangling as she prepared her for penetration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without further hesitation, Rio lined up two fingers and pushed inside Agatha's body, slowly at first, gazing at her face for any sign of discomfort. But all she saw was desire, and that gave her the confidence to pick up the pace. Agatha's breath hitched as she felt Rio filling her completely, their skin slapping together in time with each thrust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rio," Agatha breathed, wrapping her legs around Rio's waist. "Don't stop."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn't plan on stopping. She pushed deeper, hitting that spot inside Agatha that made her moan even louder. The bed creaked under their bodies as they moved together in a rhythm that was both familiar and electrifying. Sounds filled the room: their gasps, moans, and the slap of skin against skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's nails dug into Rio's shoulders as she neared climax. "Oh god," she groaned, arching her back. "Rio... I'm close."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold it, I’m not done with you princess.” - Rio’s voice was raspy and commanding, Agatha loved it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fought against her orgasm, ravishing in the feeling of Rio’s body on her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wanted to feel, right?” - Rio switched her tone to alluring, almost defyant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then, sit on my face. I wanna feel you come in my mouth, and I want to hear that pretty voice of yours say my name. Is that clear, linda?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened with excitement, she had never felt so desired. With a quick movement, Agatha crawled up to sit on Rio's face. Her heart pounded in her ear as Rio's tongue circled her entrance, making her wetter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Rio," she moaned, unable to contain the desire any longer. "I need... I need you."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn't wait for permission, she positioned herself at Agatha's entrance and pushed in, their bodies connecting deeply. Agatha let out a scream that echoed off the walls as she felt every inch of her lover inside her. Rio started moving slowly, setting a pace that would drive both of them wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your name... on my lips..." Agatha murmured wantonly, her voice husky from their earlier encounters. "Oh god... fuck me, Rio."</span>
</p><p>
<span>And so Rio did, claiming every part of Agatha’s body until all they could hear were their ragged breaths and the sound of skin slapping against skin. Finally, Agatha came undone, her orgasm taking over her body like a tidal wave. She screamed out Rio's name as wave after wave of pleasure consumed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lovemaking was messy and beautiful, two broken souls finding solace in each other's arms. As they collapsed together, sweaty and satisfied, they knew this was just the beginning of their journey. But for now, they basked in the afterglow of their passionate encounter—a bond stronger than either of them had ever known before.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha woke to the soft afternoon light streaming through the blinds, casting golden stripes across the rumpled sheets. She stretched, the soreness from the night before making her smile. Turning her head, she saw Rio still asleep beside her, her messy brown hair fanned out over the pillow, her lips slightly parted in a soft, peaceful expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened as she watched her. Rio looked so vulnerable in this moment, and the sight filled her with an unfamiliar but welcome warmth. Quietly, she slipped out of bed, pulling one of Rio’s oversized hoodies over her bare shoulders. The soft fabric smelled like her—earthy and fresh, like the plants that filled her apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Padding softly to the kitchen, Agatha decided to cook. She wasn’t much of a chef, but she could manage something simple. After a quick search of Rio’s pantry, she found eggs, bread, and some fresh vegetables. Perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she cracked eggs into a bowl and whisked them with precision, she felt a strange sense of satisfaction. Cooking for someone wasn’t something she often did—it was an act of care, of love, and she realized how much she wanted to give that to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of sizzling butter filled the air as she poured the eggs into the pan, adding diced peppers and onions. She popped bread into the toaster and glanced around, spotting Rio’s small collection of mismatched plates. The homey chaos of Rio’s space made Agatha feel strangely at ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was just plating the scrambled eggs and toast when Rio shuffled into the kitchen, her hair adorably messy, her eyes still heavy with sleep. She paused in the doorway, leaning against the frame with a lazy grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this?” Rio asked, her voice husky from sleep. “Breakfast in bed was an option, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, smirking. “You mean breakfast in the middle of your plant jungle? I’d rather not risk spilling coffee on your Monstera.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, moving closer and wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist from behind. “You didn’t have to do this, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to,” Agatha said softly, setting the plates on the small dining table. “Besides, you took care of me last night. It’s only fair that I return the favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat across from each other, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm eggs filling the space. Rio dug in immediately, letting out an exaggerated moan of delight after her first bite. “Mozart, is there anything you’re not good at?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide her smile. “It’s just scrambled eggs, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but they’re amazing scrambled eggs,” Rio insisted, pointing her fork at her. “You’re officially in charge of breakfast forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, sipping her coffee. “Noted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in a chair, her coffee cup warm in her hands, watching Rio devour her breakfast with a mixture of amusement and affection. The sunlight filtering through the window illuminated Rio’s features—the delicate freckles on her nose, the curve of her lips as she smiled between bites. It was such a simple moment, yet it felt monumental.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Agatha began, swirling the last sip of coffee in her mug, “I don’t usually do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, cocking an eyebrow. “Cook breakfast? I mean, judging by these eggs, you should do it more often.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “No, I mean… this. Being with someone. Letting someone in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set her fork down, her expression softening. “I kind of figured. You’ve got this whole ‘fortress of solitude’ vibe going on. But you let me in, and I’m not planning on leaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened at the sincerity in Rio’s voice. She felt her walls crumble a little more, replaced by the steady warmth of Rio’s presence. “Good,” she murmured, a small smile playing on her lips. “Because I’m starting to like having you around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, leaning her elbows on the table. “Starting? Come on, Mozart. You’re already smitten.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t deny the truth behind Rio’s teasing. She reached across the table, her fingers brushing Rio’s. “Maybe I am. What about you? You’re the confident, chaotic drummer who’s got everyone wrapped around her finger. Why me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin softened, her gaze steady. “Because you’re real,” she said simply. “You’ve got this quiet strength, even when you don’t see it. And when you let your guard down? You’re kind, funny, and a little bit bossy, which I weirdly love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Bossy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, absolutely,” Rio teased. “Last night you were ordering me around like a pro.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her cheeks flush, but she couldn’t stop the laughter that bubbled up. “Well, you didn’t seem to mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, her brown eyes twinkling. “I didn’t. Not one bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the clinking of plates and the soft rustle of leaves from Rio’s plants filling the space. Agatha hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her coffee cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I ask you something?” she said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mentioned before that you like taking care of people,” Agatha began, her voice soft. “Is that why you always seem to know what I need? Like last night, when you didn’t even hesitate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, her expression thoughtful. “Maybe. I think it’s just… part of who I am. After my parents died, I had to grow up fast. My aunt was amazing, but she worked a lot, so I learned to take care of myself—and her, in some ways. It became my way of connecting with people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart ached at the vulnerability in Rio’s tone. “That must have been hard,” she said gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was,” Rio admitted, a faint smile on her lips. “But it also taught me a lot. Like how to listen, how to be patient. I guess I just want to make people feel safe, you know? Because I know what it’s like to not have that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, taking Rio’s hand in hers. “You do make me feel safe. And I don’t think I’ve ever felt that with anyone before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers tightened around hers, her gaze warm and steady. “You deserve to feel safe, Agatha. To feel loved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hung between them, heavy with meaning. Agatha’s chest swelled with an emotion she didn’t quite know how to name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a while, their hands intertwined, the world outside forgotten. In that moment, surrounded by the quiet hum of Rio’s apartment, Agatha realized she wasn’t just starting to let Rio in—she was starting to believe that she deserved to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t want to leave the cocoon of Rio’s apartment, but as the day crept on, reality began to intrude. She stood by the window, gazing out at the street below while Rio cleaned up the remnants of their mid afternoon breakfast. Agatha’s fingers traced the edge of the windowsill, her thoughts tangled with emotions she wasn’t quite ready to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio appeared behind her, slipping her arms around Agatha’s waist and resting her chin on her shoulder. “Penny for your thoughts?” she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly, leaning into her. “I’m just… thinking about how nice this is. How much I don’t want it to end.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t have to,” Rio said, her voice steady. “Not if we don’t want it to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to face her, her hands settling on Rio’s shoulders. “It’s not that simple. My mom, school, everything—it’s like I’m juggling a million things, and I’m terrified of dropping them all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cupped Agatha’s face, her touch grounding. “You don’t have to do it alone, you know. I’m here. We can figure it out together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked back the sting of tears, nodding slowly. “Thank you,” she whispered. “For being you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, leaning in to kiss her softly. “It’s a tough job, but someone’s gotta do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their moment was interrupted by the sound of Agatha’s phone buzzing on the table. She pulled away reluctantly to check the screen, her stomach twisting when she saw her mother’s name flashing. She hesitated, her hand hovering over the phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to answer that,” Rio said gently, watching her carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, setting the phone back down without picking it up. “Not right now,” she said firmly. “Not today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her pride evident. “Good call.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, glancing at the clock. “I should probably go. My mom will lose her mind if I don’t show up at the house eventually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin faded slightly, but she nodded. “Do you want me to come with you? Or wait nearby, just in case?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled at the offer. “No,” she said softly. “I think I need to do this on my own. But knowing you’re a call away helps.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down, pressing a lingering kiss to her forehead. “Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally walked through the door of her family’s pristine home, the tension in the air was palpable. Evanora was waiting in the living room, her icy demeanor as sharp as ever. She turned her head slowly as Agatha entered, her eyes narrowing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late,” Evanora said, her tone dripping with disapproval.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t aware I was on a schedule,” Agatha replied, surprising even herself with the boldness in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s expression darkened. “Don’t take that tone with me, Agatha. After the stunt you pulled last night—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t pull a stunt,” Agatha interrupted, her voice steady despite the rapid thudding of her heart. “I left because I needed space. And I came back because I want to set some boundaries.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s eyes widened, the rare expression of shock quickly replaced by anger. “Boundaries? You don’t get to set boundaries with me. I’m your mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re my mother,” Agatha agreed, her voice unwavering. “But that doesn’t give you the right to control every aspect of my life. I’m done living under your thumb, Mom. I’m done trying to be perfect for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora stood, her presence towering and cold. “You’re being ridiculous. Everything I’ve done has been for your benefit, and this is how you repay me? By rebelling? By chasing… distractions?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her name is Rio,” Agatha said, her voice rising. “And she’s not a distraction. She’s the first person who’s ever made me feel like I’m enough just as I am. Something I’ve never gotten from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora’s jaw tightened, but Agatha didn’t stop. “I’m going to live my life the way I choose. I’m going to pursue music, and I’m going to love who I want. And if you can’t accept that, then maybe you’re the one who doesn’t deserve to be part of my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, silence hung between them, heavy and electric. Evanora’s face twisted with a mixture of anger and disbelief, but Agatha stood her ground, her heart racing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And just so you know, I’m tired of being afraid of you, so if you ever consider laying a finger on me again I’ll purposely do something that you consider so egregious and embarrassing that the name Harkness will never leave people’s mouths, it’s that cleat?” - Evanora seemed too stunned to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be in my room, I need to grab some things.” Agatha said finally, turning and walking away before her mother could respond. For the first time, she felt the weight of her mother’s control start to lift, replaced by a shaky but exhilarating sense of freedom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back at Rio’s apartment that evening, Agatha recounted the confrontation as they lay tangled together on the couch. Rio listened quietly, her fingers brushing through Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m proud of you,” Rio said softly when Agatha finished. “That took a lot of courage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her heart feeling lighter than it had in years. “It’s a start. And it helps knowing I have you in my corner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always,” Rio said, pulling her closer. As they lay together, the chaos of the world outside faded away, leaving only the steady rhythm of their breathing and the quiet promise of a future they would navigate together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next few weeks, Agatha began to change—not drastically, but in ways that felt significant to her. She’d spent years stifling her personality to fit the mold her mother had cast, and now, she was slowly peeling away the layers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It started with her wardrobe. Agatha traded her structured blouses and pencil skirts for fitted jeans, vintage band tees, and oversized flannels. She even dyed the tips of her long brown hair a vibrant shade of electric purple, much to Rio’s enthusiastic approval.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Purple suits you,” Rio had said, twirling a lock of Agatha’s hair between her fingers. “It’s bold. Like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had laughed but secretly tucked the compliment away, letting it bolster her growing confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her personality shifted too. The meekness she’d once carried gave way to sharp wit and a snarky humor that Rio adored. Agatha found herself cracking jokes in public, rolling her eyes at Rio’s antics in ways that felt playful instead of guarded, and occasionally offering sarcastic one-liners that left her girlfriend grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, while waiting in line for a concert Rio had dragged her to, a guy behind them commented on Agatha’s hair. “Cool look. Are you in a band?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, glancing at Rio. “Not yet, but give me a mic and an ego, and I’ll fit right in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed so hard she nearly choked on her soda. “You’re insufferable,” she managed, kissing Agatha’s cheek. “And I love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha also began to indulge in things she’d always denied herself. She started eating dessert without worrying about the calories, stayed up late watching old horror movies with Rio, and even went to her first live punk show—an experience that left her ears ringing and her adrenaline soaring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha admitted as they left the venue, her voice hoarse. “That was… incredible. I get it now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, slinging an arm around her shoulders. “Told you. Welcome to the dark side, Mozart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>One Saturday afternoon, Agatha and Rio decided to grab coffee downtown. As they walked hand-in-hand through the bustling streets, Agatha felt lighter than she had in years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were laughing about a terrible joke Rio had made when a familiar voice called out. “Agatha!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze mid-step, turning to see Alice, Lilia, and Jen sitting at an outdoor café table, waving them over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no,” Agatha muttered under her breath, though her smile betrayed her amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Aren’t these your bar friends?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate myself,” Agatha replied, pulling her toward the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned as they approached, her red-and-black hair catching the sunlight. “Look who decided to show up looking all cool and mysterious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Girls, I would like to properly present Rio.” Agatha said, her voice steady but warm. “My girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s grin widened. “Oh, we’ve met… briefly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, hiding her face in her hands. “Can we not bring that up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia laughed, her eyes twinkling with mischief. -  “It's nice to see you happy. And confident. You’ve got this whole badass vibe going on now. I’m into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Agatha, her expression soft. “I told you. You’ve always had it in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t stop the small smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit with us,” Alice said, gesturing to the empty chairs. “We were just debating the merits of pop-punk versus emo. You two can settle it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha exchanged a glance, silently agreeing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they joined the conversation, Agatha felt a strange sense of belonging. She bantered easily with the group, her sharp wit earning laughter and teasing in return. Rio fit in effortlessly, her chaotic charm and easygoing nature endearing her to everyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they left, the sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the city.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They like you,” Agatha said as they walked back to Rio’s apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They like </span>
<em>
<span>you,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio corrected, squeezing her hand. “And they should. You’re incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, her blue-tipped hair catching the light. “You’re biased.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Rio said with a grin. “But I’m also right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached Rio’s building, Agatha paused, turning to face her. “Thank you,” she said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “For what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For… everything,” Agatha replied, her voice steady. “For showing me I can be more than what I thought I was. For making me brave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened, her hands sliding to rest on Agatha’s hips. “You’re the one who’s brave, Mozart. I’m just here to cheer you on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, their foreheads touching. “Well, don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never,” Rio whispered before kissing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world around them faded, leaving only the promise of who they were becoming—together.</span>

<p>
<span>5 months later</span>
</p><p>
<span>The university’s auditorium buzzed with excitement as students, families, and friends filled every seat. Agatha adjusted her cap nervously, her valedictorian sash draped proudly over her shoulders. Beside her, Rio stood adjusting her own cap, grinning like she’d already won an award.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ready, Mozart?” Rio teased, nudging Agatha lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Agatha replied, her lips curling into a small but confident smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their names were called in quick succession, and they walked across the stage together, diplomas in hand. Rio made an exaggerated bow to the audience, eliciting a wave of laughter and cheers, while Agatha shook the dean’s hand with poise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was time for her speech, Agatha felt her nerves bubble, but as she scanned the crowd and locked eyes with Rio— then Alice, Lilia, and Jen, all cheering obnoxiously—she found her calm. Rio had brought a glittery handmade sign that read, “Mozart Rules the World!” and held it high.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Her speech poured out of her, heartfelt and strong, filled with reflections on resilience, finding one’s voice, and embracing life’s chaos. They were words not just for her classmates, but for herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she finished, the applause was thunderous. Agatha felt as though she were floating as she returned to her seat, where Rio gave her a playful thumbs-up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You crushed it,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “It was the sign. Really sold the message.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the ceremony, the courtyard erupted in a whirlwind of hugs, laughter, and congratulations. Evanora was noticeably absent, but Agatha hardly cared. She was surrounded by her chosen family.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wrapped Agatha in a hug that lifted her off the ground. “Valedictorian and the love of my life? You’re just showing off now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, her arms wrapped tightly around Rio. “You’re one to talk. You turned graduation into your own stand-up routine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gotta keep it interesting,” Rio said with a wink. “Now, what’s the plan? Fancy dinner? Rooftop drinks? Karaokê?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her lips curling into a mischievous smile. “Actually… I was thinking something a little more spontaneous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her puzzled, but decided not to ruin the surprise of whatever Agatha was thinking of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours and several celebratory drinks later, Agatha and Rio were leading the group down a lively street lit by neon signs. Bars spilled music into the night, and tattoo parlors glowed with inviting lights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped abruptly in front of one, her gaze fixed on the flickering "Open" sign. “I want a tattoo,” she announced, her voice steady despite the tequila coursing through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, clearly amused. “You? A tattoo? Are we sure about this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I said “spontaneous” earlier, right?” Agatha declared. “I’m graduating, I’m valedictorian, and I’m feeling bold.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice let out a delighted laugh. “This is fantastic. Do it, Agatha!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With Rio leading the way, the group piled into the tattoo parlor. The atmosphere was electric, their buzz of excitement contagious. Agatha flipped through the design book with focus, ignoring the light teasing from Alice and Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you thinking?” Rio asked, leaning over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tapped on a small design—a crescent moon intertwined with musical notes. “This one. It feels… right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened. “It’s perfect. It’s you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tattoo artist, a laid-back guy with an armful of colorful ink, smiled. “Great choice. Who’s holding your hand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me,” Rio said immediately, pulling a chair next to Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the tattoo took shape on Agatha’s wrist, Rio held her hand and cracked jokes to distract her from the sting. Agatha barely flinched, her focus on the steady buzz of the needle and the image forming on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was done, she stared at it, her heart swelling with pride. “It’s perfect,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, kissing her temple. “So are you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the night passed in a blur of dancing, laughter, and an impromptu sing-along at a dive bar. By the time Agatha and Rio stumbled back to the plant lover’s apartment, the sky was beginning to brighten with dawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha collapsed onto the couch, holding her wrist up to admire the tattoo again. “Do you think I’ll regret this?” she asked, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat beside her, pulling her close. “Not a chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed Agatha tenderly, only breaking them apart to look at her girlfriend with a hint of mischief in her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… I’ve got a surprise for you.” - Rio added, pulling Agatha by the arm, leading her to the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio positioned Agatha in front of her drawers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ta da!!!” - Rio screamed with an exaggerated flourish, after opening theatrically three of her six drawers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a drawer.” - Agatha couldn’t contain her confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her eyes sparkling with delight. “No, my love. </span>
<em>
<span>Three drawers.</span>
</em>
<span> Three completely empty drawers. For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, her confusion melting into a slow realization. “Wait… are you saying—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m saying move in with me,” Rio interrupted, bouncing slightly on her heels. “I mean, you basically live here already. Half your stuff is always scattered around, and don’t think I haven’t noticed your toothbrush permanently chilling next to mine. So… I figured it’s time to make it official. No pressure, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, her heart racing. The tequila buzz was still there, but it was fading, leaving her with the full force of what Rio was offering. She wasn’t just offering her space—she was offering permanence, a future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha started, her voice soft. “Are you sure about this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her expression playful but earnest. “Let me think… the love of my life, who just graduated as valedictorian, who’s brave enough to get a tattoo after three shots, and who’s somehow managed to make my life infinitely better? Yeah, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a lump rise in her throat, but she managed a smirk. “You really know how to lay it on thick, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s part of my charm,” Rio said, leaning in to kiss her cheek. “So, what do you say? Want to claim your drawers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, resting her hands on Rio’s waist. “I’d love to. But only if we agree that I get to take over at least one of the shelves eventually. You know, for my books.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, her arms looping around Agatha’s neck. “Deal. But only if I get veto power over </span>
<em>
<span>which</span>
</em>
<span> books. I’m not sharing space with every obscure business textbook you’ve hoarded.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, leaning her forehead against Rio’s. “I think I can compromise. You’re worth it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn right I am,” Rio teased, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they simply stood there, holding each other, the weight of the decision settling comfortably between them. Agatha realized how far she’d come—not just in her life or her newfound confidence, but in allowing herself to truly be seen and loved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said, breaking the silence with a mischievous grin, “now that we’re official cohabitors, I think this calls for a toast. Except we’re out of champagne, so…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tequila again?” Agatha guessed, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “Nope. Orange juice. Hydration is key, bonita. Can’t have you passing out on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, following Rio into the kitchen, where they poured orange juice into mismatched glasses and clinked them together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To new beginnings,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To not regretting tattoos—or anything else,” Agatha added, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They drank, their laughter filling the small apartment. It was chaotic, imperfect, and utterly theirs—a life they’d built together, one bold decision at a time.</span>

<p>3 Years Later</p><p>
<span>The morning sun filtered through the large windows of their cozy yet eclectic apartment, casting golden streaks over the stacks of books, scattered vinyl records, and thriving houseplants. Agatha sat at the dining table, her laptop open, headphones perched over her brown hair—now streaked with hints of black. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, making subtle edits to the final mix of her latest track.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A faint hum of a melody drifted from the other side of the room where Rio lounged on the couch, a notebook balanced on her knees. Her handwriting—small and precise—filled the pages with descriptions of poisonous plants, anecdotes, and care tips for her upcoming book, her third, titled </span>
<em>
<span>Beautifully Lethal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"Rio," Agatha called, pulling her headphones off and turning toward her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mm?" Rio answered, not looking up, her pen tapping rhythmically against her notebook.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I think </span>
<em>
<span>The Witch’s Road</span>
</em>
<span> just hit 50 million streams."</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got Rio’s attention. She whipped her head up, her brown eyes wide with excitement. "Shut up!"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. "I’m serious. Check the stats."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bolted from the couch, rushing over to Agatha and peering over her shoulder at the laptop screen. "Holy shit," she whispered, her grin spreading. "That’s amazing, Mozart! We’re celebrating tonight."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, leaning back in her chair. "We have dinner with the girls. Isn’t that enough celebrating?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, mock horror in her expression. "Not even close. This is 50 million streams, babe. We’re going big."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress her smile. Rio always knew how to make every milestone feel monumental.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night</span>
</p><p>
<span>The restaurant buzzed with lively conversation as Agatha, Rio, Alice, Lilia, and Jen toasted to success, friendship, and life in general. Lilia had secured a promotion at her design firm, and Alice was glowing from the announcement of her engagement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To </span>
<em>
<span>The Witch’s Road</span>
</em>
<span> and its genius creator!” Alice said, raising her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And to Rio, who somehow knows more about plants than anyone should but makes it sexy,” Agatha added with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, nudging Agatha. “I think that means you’re rubbing off on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, sipping her wine. Her eyes flicked to Rio, her heart swelling with a familiar warmth. Tonight was the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, back at their apartment, Agatha asked Rio to sit on the couch. Rio eyed her suspiciously but complied, tucking her legs underneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this about?” Rio asked, her tone playful but curious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha retrieved her keyboard from its stand in the corner and positioned it in front of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we first met,” Agatha began, her voice steady but soft, “I was still figuring out who I was. You saw me before I even saw myself. And I wrote this song not long after that night at the bar when you heard me sing. I never showed it to you because… I wasn’t ready. But now I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, her teasing demeanor melting into quiet awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers danced over the keys, the melody simple but hauntingly beautiful. Her voice, rich and steady, filled the room with lyrics that told their story—of chaos, courage, love, and the freedom Rio had helped her find.</span>
</p><p>
<b>"Chaos in Harmony"</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<em>
<span>(A song by Agatha, written for Rio)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>[Verse 1]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>I was a shipwreck, stranded and bare</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You were the tempest, wild in the air</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You caught my eyes, I didn’t stand a chance</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>A chance…</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>You whispered, “Come closer, rewrite your scars”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You made me brave, aimed for the stars</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Marked as yours with a kiss in the rain</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The rain…</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Chorus]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>You’re the calm in my storm, the pulse in my vein</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The light in my dark, the joy in my pain</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When the world spins too fast, you hold me sane</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You’re my chaos in harmony, always the same</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Verse 2]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>I was a secret, hidden and small</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You were the echo that shattered my walls</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Now every chord, every note that I play</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Carries your fire, lighting my way</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>You whispered, “Come closer, rewrite your scars”</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You made me brave, aimed for the stars</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Marked as yours with a kiss in the rain</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The rain…</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Chorus]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>You’re the calm in my storm, the pulse in my vein</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The light in my dark, the joy in my pain</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When the world spins too fast, you hold me sane</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You’re my chaos in harmony, always the same</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Bridge]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>And when I falter, you’re the ground beneath my feet</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When I’m a symphony unfinished, you make me complete</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>With every heartbeat, every breath, every sigh</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You’re my forever, my wings when I fly</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Final Chorus]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>You’re the calm in my storm, the pulse in my vein</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The light in my dark, the joy in my pain</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>When the world spins too fast, you hold me sane</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You’re my chaos in harmony, always the same</span>
</p><p>
<b>[Outro]</b>
<b><br/>
</b>
<span>So here’s my promise, my song, my vow</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>I’ll love you fiercely, here and now</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>For the rest of my days, through the highs and the lows</span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>You’re my chaos in harmony, the one my heart chose</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the final note hung in the air, Agatha reached into her pocket and pulled out a small velvet box. She opened it to reveal a delicate silver ring with a crescent moon and a tiny amethyst gemstone, mirroring her tattoo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she said, her voice trembling slightly, “you are the chaos I never knew I needed and the calm I never knew I deserved. You make me brave, you make me laugh, and you make me want to keep growing. Will you marry me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, stunned, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re serious?” Rio whispered, her voice breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, a single brow arching. “Do I look like I’m joking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed through her tears, nodding furiously. “Yes! A thousand times, yes!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slid the ring onto Rio’s finger, and Rio immediately pulled her into a tight embrace, their laughter and tears mingling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know this means I get to plan a plant-themed wedding, right?” Rio teased, her voice muffled against Agatha’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned dramatically but grinned. “Fine. But no poisonous centerpieces.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Rio said, kissing her soundly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they held each other, the city lights twinkling outside their window, they knew that this was only the beginning of the next chapter in their beautifully chaotic life together.</span>

<p>
<span>The moonlight poured through the window, bathing their apartment in a soft, silver glow. The song lingered in the air, its last note trembling with unspoken promises. Agatha could still feel the weight of Rio’s body pressing into hers as they embraced, their laughter and tears blending into one perfect moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when Rio pulled back to look into Agatha’s eyes, her gaze was smoldering, electric. Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio cupped her face, her thumb brushing lightly against her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you plan that whole proposal just to make me cry?” Rio teased, her voice husky, her lips quirking into a small smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, her fingers skimming along the edges of Rio’s jaw. “Not just to make you cry,” she murmured. “To make you say yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mission accomplished.” Rio leaned forward, her lips brushing against Agatha’s in a kiss that started tender, but quickly deepened. Her fingers tangled in Agatha’s dark hair, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart race as Rio’s touch shifted, trailing down her back with deliberate slowness. Their bodies pressed together, fitting as perfectly as they always had, but tonight there was something more—something urgent, raw, and undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back for a moment, her breath coming in soft pants. “You know I love you, right?” Her eyes searched Agatha’s face, their warmth undercut by a flicker of vulnerability.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “I’ve never been so certain of anything in my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her hands sliding to Agatha’s waist, guiding her gently toward the bedroom. The world outside their apartment dissolved, leaving only the quiet hum of their shared heartbeat and the heat building between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once inside, Agatha found herself pressed against the edge of the bed, Rio’s lips trailing a line of fire down her neck. She tilted her head back, her fingers clinging to Rio’s blouse, desperate to feel her closer. When Rio pulled away just enough to tug the fabric of her clothes over her head, Agatha’s breath caught at the sight of her—bare, unguarded, and impossibly beautiful in the moonlight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, you’re stunning,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding of her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, stepping forward until their bodies were flush again. “Funny,” she murmured, her lips ghosting over Agatha’s ear, “I was just thinking the same thing about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They fell onto the bed in a tangle of limbs, laughter giving way to soft gasps as hands roamed, exploring familiar territory in ways that still felt brand new. Agatha shivered as Rio’s fingers traced the edge of her tattoo, her lips following the path with a tenderness that sent sparks shooting through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, her voice trembling as her hands found their way to Rio’s hips, pulling her closer. She felt like she was coming undone, every touch unraveling her carefully composed exterior until there was nothing left but the truth of how deeply she loved this woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio whispered in reply, her voice thick with emotion. “Make love to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hung in the air, and though they’d been spoken countless times before, tonight they felt like vows—a promise sealed in every kiss, every touch, every whispered confession.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The taste of Rio's skin was intoxicating, like a sweet symphony of salt and heat against her tongue. Agatha savored every moment as she trailed kisses down Rio's collarbone, pressing light love bites along the way. She could feel the pounding of Rio's heart beneath her lips, matching the rhythm of her own. When her teeth grazed the soft flesh of Rio's breast, a moan escaped her lover's throat, sending a shiver down Agatha's spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's hands tangled in her hair, pulling her up for a searing kiss that made Agatha's world spin. Their bodies pressed close together, skin slipping and sliding as they moved in perfect harmony. The smell of their sweat mingled with the scent of their sex, creating an intoxicating aphrodisiac that left Agatha breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They rolled over, their mouths locked in an endless dance as they teased and pleasured each other with their tongues. Agatha ran her fingers through Rio's hair, feeling the silkiness between her fingers as it slipped through her grip. A low growl rumbled in Rio's throat. She pulled back just enough to capture one perfect nipple in her mouth, sucking gently as she cupped Rio's ass and drew her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched her back, moaning loudly as Agatha played with her sensitive bud. The sound echoed throughout the room, bouncing off the walls like a heartbeat. It was then that Agatha realized how alive she felt—how much she loved this woman who was giving herself so freely to her. She moved between Rio’s legs, her tongue darting out to tease the slick folds of skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp gasp escaped Rio's lips as Agatha’s tongue circled her clit, followed by a low groan of pleasure. Agatha smiled against her skin, taking in the taste and texture of Rio's arousal. She slid two fingers inside her lover, feeling the tightness that matched her own desperation. Rio bucked against her touch, pulling her close for another deep kiss that left them both panting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their movements grew more urgent now, fueled by a need that had been simmering beneath the surface for far too long. As Agatha picked up the pace, Rio arched her back, tossing her head back with a cry of ecstasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since it’s a special ocasion… I wanted to try something.” - Rio added licking her own juices in Agatha’s fingers, earning a low moan from the musician.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Close your eyes, Harkness.” - Rio used her serious voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, Agatha complied without any sarcastic comments, feeling Rio meant business.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The writer took a box from under the desk and delicately took out a dark green blindfold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trust me, darling.” - Rio's whisper was soft but firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha obeyed, bending her head as Rio tied the fabric around her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Rio's cool fingers tracing her skin, marking a path down from her shoulders to her wrists. Then, something cold and hard pressed against her skin—the tip of a vibrator. Agatha gasped at the unexpected sensation, her body arching in anticipation. She could feel Rio smile against her skin as she guided the toy lower, teasing the entrance to her body with soft touches until she found the right spot. With one firm push, Agatha cried out loudly, her hips bucking up to meet the intense sensation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands held her tight, anchoring her in place as the vibrations reverberated through them both. The sound filled the room, echoing off the walls and drowning out any other thoughts but pleasure. It was a symphony of need and love and connection, and they moved together in perfect harmony until Agatha felt herself falling over the edge—a shattering release that left her breathless and floating on a cloud of bliss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even after coming down from that high, they continued moving together, their bodies locked in a dance that went on long into the night—a testament to their love and everything they'd been through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Two years later</b>
</p><p>
<span>The house was quiet except for the soft hum of Rio’s voice as she spoke to their newborn son. She stood in the nursery they had painstakingly decorated together, rocking baby Nicky gently in her arms. The moonlight streamed through the window, casting a silver glow over the room, just as it had on the night Agatha proposed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the doorway, Agatha leaned against the frame, her face softened with a look of absolute love. Her body still ached from childbirth, but the sight of Rio cradling their son made every moment worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a natural,” Agatha said softly, her voice carrying the weight of awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, her smile warm and radiant. “And you’re a superhero,” she replied, kissing Nicky’s forehead before walking over to Agatha. “How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tired. Sore. Completely overwhelmed,” Agatha admitted, her eyes brimming with happy tears. “But mostly… I just can’t believe he’s here. That we’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s temple, careful not to disturb the baby between them. “We’re here,” she whispered. “Together. And that’s all that matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They brought Nicky to the living room, where a bassinet waited. Once he was settled, sleeping peacefully, Rio wrapped an arm around Agatha, guiding her to the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you remember when we first talked about having kids?” Rio asked, her voice laced with nostalgia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. “You mean when I panicked about ruining my career and you said, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll just make the coolest kid ever’?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Rio said, grinning. “And look. Mission accomplished.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned her head against Rio’s shoulder, a deep contentment settling in her chest. “He’s perfect,” she murmured. “Just like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her brown eyes sparkling. “You know, I think he’s already inherited your knack for music. Did you hear those cries earlier? Kid’s got lungs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, nudging her playfully. “If he starts banging on your drums before he can walk, I’m blaming you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fair enough,” Rio said, her grin widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The doorbell rang, breaking the quiet moment. Agatha groaned as Rio stood to answer it, returning moments later with Alice, Lilia, and Jen—all armed with gifts and food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it visiting hours already?” Agatha teased, though her smile betrayed her delight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Visiting hours don’t apply to honorary aunts,” Alice declared, holding up a tiny onesie that read, </span>
<em>
<span>Future Rock Star.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia cooed over Nicky while Jen unloaded what appeared to be enough food to feed an army. The room quickly filled with laughter, the sound of their chosen family celebrating this new chapter of their lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the evening wore on, Agatha watched her friends fuss over her son, her heart swelling with gratitude. This was her life now—a beautiful, chaotic symphony of love, friendship, and family. And she wouldn’t trade it for anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the house finally quieted again, Rio joined Agatha in their bedroom, collapsing beside her on the bed. They lay there in the soft darkness, their hands intertwined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think we’re ready for this?” Agatha asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to her, her expression both teasing and earnest. “Agatha Harkness, if we can survive grad school, a music career, three houseplants that refuse to die, your mother and Alice’s karaoke nights, we can handle one tiny human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly, turning to kiss Rio’s cheek. “I love you, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened, her fingers brushing Agatha’s cheek. “And I love you. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they drifted off to sleep, the faint sound of Nicky’s breathing through the baby monitor filling the air, Agatha knew this was it. The happy ending she had never dared to dream of. And yet, she realized, it wasn’t an ending at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the beginning of something extraordinary—a life filled with music, laughter, love, and the kind of chaos only Rio could bring. Together, they would write the next chapters, one beautiful, messy, and magical day at a time.</span>
