<p>Agatha was looking through instagram, randomly scrolling on a Saturday afternoon when she seen a new bookstore that had recently opened near by. Vidal Books.</p><p>“That looks interesting. I wonder if Wanda would go with me.” Agatha said to herself and she sent it to her best-friend with a couple question marks.</p><p>~across town~</p><p>Wanda was on her third date this week with just as many men. This was a coffee date at  a small shop he picked. The man across from her was quite attractive but terribly dull. All he could talk about was his job, which was mundane and irritating. He was an accountant.</p><p>Her phone buzzed on the table and she glanced at it quickly realizing it was Agatha.</p><p>“Another guy?” The man asked in an arrogant tone.</p><p>“Wow. If you must know it’s my best-friend.” Wanda said as she shot the man a glare and she picked up the phone.</p><p>“Really Wanda, if you can’t focus on a conversation I don’t see this going anywhere.” The man said in a snarky tone.</p><p>“I don’t see this going anywhere either. Thanks for the coffee Chad. Don’t call me.” Wanda said as she got up and walked away after collecting her things. She made her way to her car and got in before calling Agatha. The phone rang twice before Agatha picked up.</p><p>“Hey, I thought you were on a date.” Agatha said as she leaned back against the couch.</p><p>“Dude was a dud. What did you send me? I didn’t get a chance to look at it.”</p><p>“A new book store 20 minutes away.” Agatha said hopefully.</p><p>Wanda sighed. “You wanna check it out don’t you, you fucking nerd.”</p><p>“Of course I do! It’s stunning! Plus books…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll be there in 10. You better look fantastic because I’m not going out with a frump when I got dressed up for a shit ass date.” Wanda said before hanging up the phone.</p><p>“Alright see you soon then.” Agatha said sassily to the disconnected phone as she got up and headed to her bedroom. She put on a nice pair of charcoal gray slacks, a deep purple button up, and the matching vest to her pants. She left the top two buttons unbuttoned on her shirt and rolled her sleeves up so her forearms were showing. She grabbed a wide brimmed black hat and set it aside while she did her hair in two braids. She did light make up and grabbed her hat before walking out of her bedroom.</p><p>Wanda was sitting on the couch waiting for Agatha. “Well at least you listened and look nice.”</p><p>“So do you! Wow, how bad did he fuck up.” Agatha asked as she checked her friend out. Wanda was wearing a nice red dress with a cute small white jacket.</p><p>“You actually saved me unintentionally. When you messaged me he asked ‘another guy?’ In an arrogant tone. The whole date left a bad taste in my mouth.” Wanda said as she got up from the couch.</p><p>“Let me grab my purse and we can head out.” Agatha said as she walked over to the table next to the door and grabbed her purse.</p><p>“You forgot all your rings.” Wanda said as she pointed at her best friend’s hands.</p><p>“Leave it to you to hold up a trip to the bookstore.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, you’d really leave with out all your jewelry?” Wanda teased as she snapped her fingers and Agatha’s jewelry appeared on her hands.</p><p>“I could’ve done that.” Agatha said with a grumble.</p><p>“How dare someone else use their magical energy on you. Common let’s go.” Wanda said as she opened the door and shooed her best friend out. Wanda shut the door and Agatha pushed her out of the way and locked it.</p><p>“I’ll drive.” Agatha said as she pulled her phone out and found the address before they walked over to her car. They got in and Agatha started the car before pulling out of the driveway and heading to the book store. Wanda got on her phone and actually looked at the post Agatha sent her.</p><p>“Ooo this place does look stunning.” Wanda said excitedly.</p><p>“Right? That’s why I wanted to go.”</p><p>“Ohhh the owner is hot too! Just your type.”</p><p>“Could be straight.” Agatha dismissed her bestfriend.</p><p>“Nope right here, lgbtq+ safe space owned by a lesbian.” Wanda said as she looked at the profile online.</p><p>“Don’t… I just want to look. Plus I didn’t see her in the post I sent you so I have no idea what she looks like.” Agatha answered as she continued to drive.</p><p>“I’d show you but you always yell at me when I distract you while driving.”</p><p>“I don’t need to know what she looks like. We are going for books.” Agatha said in a serious tone.</p><p>“You are no fun.” Wanda griped as she looked out the window.</p><p>“I know.” Agatha answered with a smirk.</p><p>The rest of the drive was in comfortable silence. Agatha smiled brightly as she pulled up in front of the deep forest green book store with the words “Vidal Book’s” in gold leaf painted on the front window and across the top.</p><p>“Let’s go.” Wanda said as she climbed out of the car and headed toward the door. Agatha put the car in park and shut it off before grabbing her purse and getting out of the car. Before heading into the store.</p><p>“Really you couldn’t wait for me?” Agatha said quietly to herself as she opened the door.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal books, your girlfriend went that way.” A stunning woman with rich brown eyes, sun kissed skin, and long brown hair said from behind the counter.</p><p>“Not my girlfriend. Just my annoying best friend. Who has zero patience.” Agatha said as she walked into the store and took all of the books in. “This is stunning.”</p><p>“Thank you for the compliment. I put a lot of energy into this store.” The woman said as she surveyed Agatha. “Go ahead and take a look around. There’s a spell book section in the back.” Rio said pointing to where Wanda disappeared to.</p><p>“How did.. never mind. Doesn’t matter. Thank you.” Agatha said as she headed toward the back, she could feel the woman’s eyes on her, following her as she made her way to the back of the store.</p><p>“Did you see the owner?” Wanda whispered to Agatha who just rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Yes, now leave it alone. I want to look at books.” Agatha said as she walked away from her best friend. Agatha looked over the spell books and found one she had never seen before. She plucked it from the shelf and skimmed through it. It had a few rituals and spells she hadn’t heard of and decided to tuck it into her arm before she walked over to the romance section.</p><p>She found a few sapphic books that she didn’t own and then walked around the store and checked out the other sections. “Anything I can help you find?” The woman asked Agatha pulling her from her focus.</p><p>“Not at this moment in time, I’m just soaking in your beautiful store.” Agatha said as she crouched down and continued reading the titles.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be around if you need me.” The owner said as she walked away.  Wanda walked over to Agatha again and looked down at her best friend with a glare.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Wanda hissed.</p><p>“Looking for books, what are you doing?” Agatha asked as she looked at Wanda pointedly, who glared back at her.</p><p>“Are you done or do I need to go occupy myself?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I’m sure there’s a cafe around the corner you can go get a drink at if you are bored?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Fine, I can take a hint. Here buy these for me.” Wanda said handing two books to Agatha.</p><p>“Fine, only because I dragged you along. Now shoo ya bother me.” Agatha said as she took the books and waved a hand as if brushing her best friend off. Wanda left the store quickly leaving Agatha alone with the owner.</p><p>Agatha found a couple more books and walked over to the counter to set them down. “Find everything you were looking for?” The gorgeous brunette asked as she started ringing the books up.</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” Agatha said appreciatively as she watched the woman press a couple buttons on the screen.</p><p>“Your total is $85.60.” The owner said with a smile. Agatha’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“Surely that isn’t right. I have 6 books here. Each of these are easily $20.”</p><p>“Cute customer discount.” The owner flirted.</p><p>“How about this, charge me the full amount and the next time I come to visit I won’t bring my best friend.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Only if I get to find out what your name is as well.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, and yours?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal, The Green Witch.” Rio said as she offered her hand to Agatha. Agatha took it, a rush of magical energy surged between them.</p><p>“Well that was different.” Agatha said as she took her hand from the woman.</p><p>“Interesting.” Rio said as she looked into Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“Now, what’s my actual total.” Agatha said honing her eyes on the woman, challenging her.</p><p>“$120 even.” Rio said as she packed the books into a bag</p><p>“If I get home and the total is inaccurate I will be coming back and correcting your mistake.” Agatha said as she handed over the cash and took her bag from Rio.</p><p>“What if I want you to come back?” Rio flirted.</p><p>“Don’t you worry about that. I’ll be back.” Agatha said as she took her receipt from the woman and smiled brightly at her.</p><p>“Te Veo Agatha.”</p><p>“Have a wonderful day Rio.” Agatha said as she pushed the door open and headed down the street toward the coffee shop. Wanda was walking out carrying two drinks right as Agatha arrived.</p><p>“Got you the sweetest, girliest drink they had on the menu Agatha, here ya go.” Wanda said as she handed Agatha the drink.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said appreciatively as she took a drink.</p><p>“Soo…” Wanda trailed off.</p><p>“Soo..” Agatha mocked back.</p><p>“Oh come on! She was flirting with you!” Wanda griped.</p><p>“Oh I know, next time I come I have to come solo.” Agatha said as she guided Wanda back to the car.</p><p>“Oh? And why is that Harkness?” Wanda asked as she opened the passenger side door and got in. Agatha got in and started the car.</p><p>“She tried to give me a discount for being cute.” Agatha said as she pulled out of the parking spot.</p><p>“How much of a discount?” Wanda pried.</p><p>“$35 give or take.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Girl what are we doing here? Why are we leaving? Turn the car around right now. You didn’t get her number did you? What’s wrong with you?” Wanda asked as she turned around and looked out the back window.</p><p>“I know where she works Wanda, chill.” Agatha said as she turned the corner and headed home.</p><p>“But you two would look so good together!” Wanda whined getting ahead of herself.</p><p>“Chill Witch Chill.” Agatha said with an irritated tone as she drove home.</p><p>Once Agatha was parked she turned and looked at Wanda with a serious face. “Do not ruin this for me.”</p><p>“How…”</p><p>“I have been your best friend since we were six. If you ruin this for me I will make sure you never get laid again.” Agatha threatened as she turned the car off and took the keys out of the ignition grasping them in her hand firmly.</p><p>“I’ll stay away from the bookstore.” Wanda relented, knowing Agatha wasn’t joking. Agatha pulled Wanda’s books out of the bag.</p><p>“Thank you. Here’s your two books.” Agatha said as she handed the books over to her bestfriend.</p><p>“Let me check to see if she stuck her number in either of these.” Wanda said as she opened the books and shook them out.</p><p>“I doubt it.” Agatha said as she watched as nothing fell out of the books.</p><p>“Hey, I just wanted to be sure.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“Go home. I’ll see you tomorrow maybe?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I have another date. I’ll text you details in the morning.”</p><p>“What’s this one’s name?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I don’t remember right now. I’d have to open bumble.”  Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“I don’t understand how you have the energy for this many dates in one week.”</p><p>“Well, Harkness. Some of us don’t want to die alone.” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“Are any of these men witches? Because you will out live them if they aren’t.” Agatha jabbed back.</p><p>“Oh that was low.”</p><p>“So was yours. Now get outta my car. I wanna go read this new spell book.” Agatha said as she grabbed her drink, purse and her bag of books and got out. Wanda rolled her eyes and got out of the car and followed Agatha to the door.</p><p>“What no offer to cook me dinner?” Wanda joked.</p><p>“I will literally stab you.” Agatha said as she unlocked her front door and headed inside. Wanda followed suit, intending to annoy. Agatha set her purse down in its designated spot then removed her hat and hung it on a hook by the door. “You know, I clearly remember telling you to go home.”</p><p>“What’s the fun in that when I’m already here.” Wanda said as she collapsed on the living room couch.</p><p>“You act like we don’t live 2 minutes away from each other.” Agatha said with a sigh as she unbuttoned her vest and shrugged it off. “Spill Maximoff, what’s really bugging you.”</p><p>“I’m lonely.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Read a book, go for a hike, call me, learn how to be alone, all great options.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Is that why you read so much?” Wanda pried.</p><p>“You’ve met my mother.” Agatha answered pointedly, reminding Wanda of the years of abuse and neglect.</p><p>“Got it. Alright, I think I will head home now. Enjoy your books.” Wanda said as she walked toward the front door.</p><p>“Wanda, I love you.” Agatha said in a moment of vulnerability and honesty.</p><p>“Love you too Aggie.” Wanda said with a smile before she ducked out the door. A blast of purple magic flying at her head and hitting the door frame making it splinter. A wicked cackle emanated from outside the door and down the driveway.</p><p>“Pain in my ass.” Agatha grumbled under her breath. With a wave of her hand the door frame was fixed and her outfit changed into something comfortable. Agatha grabbed her phone, the drink, all the books and settled down comfortably in the couch. She pulled the four books she got out of the bag.</p><p>The one that had captured her interest the most was the dark green spell book with gold filigree on the corners and gold leaf embellishments. The pages were also edged in gold. The longer she looked at the outside of this book the more she realized she didn’t pay enough for it. She dug the receipt out and it was only for 5 books.</p><p>“That woman.” Agatha said in a soft but frustrated tone. She sighed and looked at the time on her phone; it was 6:30 p.m. then checked the receipt to see what time the store closed. 6 p.m. and closed on Sunday- Monday. That was frustrating to say the least.</p><p>With a sigh Agatha opened the book that she had accidentally borrowed for the next two days to the front page. To find written on the page dead center in neat pretty handwriting that had amassed the whole book Property of Rio Vidal, if found return immediately to 824 Green St. Southview MA. Text or call (666)-333-7777. Agatha’s stomach dropped. She was holding the woman’s personal spell book.</p><p>“Who in their right mind would leave this on a shelf for anyone to see and pick up?” Agatha asked as she grabbed her phone and placed her hand over the page so that Wanda couldn’t read the number and took a photo before sending it off. Her phone pinged not even a second later.</p><p>Wanda 6:45 p.m : I’ve seen your rings, why are you sending me a photo of your hand?Agatha looked back at the photo and noticed it was just a photo of her hand.</p><p>“Now that, is a good protection spell. But why am I able to see through it.” Agatha mused to herself.</p><p>Agatha 6:46 p.m : are you settled in for the night?</p><p>A minute later Wanda was walking through her front door. “What is going on?” Wanda asked. Agatha held the book up for Wanda to see.</p><p>“Can you see this book?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“What book….Oh. Oh. No, I can’t. What is it?”</p><p>“Her spell personal book.” Agatha answered. Wanda tried to use her magic to undo the spell but all she ended up with was a nose bleed.</p><p>“I don’t know why you can see it but I can’t.”</p><p>“Come sit. I want to test something.” Agatha said as she patted the couch next to her.</p><p>“What are you going to do? Read it to me?” Wanda joked.</p><p>“Actually yes. I want to know if you can even hear the words I speak.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Okay, I’m game.” Wanda said as she sat down. Agatha opened to the first page and started reading aloud. Two seconds later Wanda was zoned out looking at the wall not even paying attention to Agatha at all. She closed the book quickly and set it aside so she could snap her fingers at Wanda.</p><p>“Lost you.” Agatha said pulling her best friend back to reality.</p><p>“Dude, that was so peaceful though. Put me back.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked in a confused tone. As Wanda shook her head trying to clear the fog.</p><p>“That is a deep and powerful spell. I felt like I was enveloped in nature. Like I was where I’ve always meant to be.” Wanda said, calmer than Agatha has ever seen her.</p><p>“This woman has peaked my interest.” Agatha said as she looked over her best friend.</p><p>“I want that spell so I can sleep, fuck I feel so rested. How long were you reading for?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I read two sentences…”</p><p>“Okay now I’m actually terrified of this witch.” Wanda said with a wide eyes as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m not, I’m impressed. She had my interest, now she’s got my curiosity.” Agatha said as she used her magic to clear Wanda’s brain fog.</p><p>“Thank you. That’s better than any hang over cure I’ve ever had. I was gunna head to the club tonight with Jen and Alice if you wanted to come?”</p><p>“I’ve got far more interesting things to do, don’t you think?” Agatha asked while pointing to the invisible book next to her.</p><p>“For once… I actually agree. Alright. You have fun with your book.”</p><p>“Rio’s book. I’m just borrowing it.” Agatha corrected.</p><p>“Have fun with Rio’s book. I’ll text you when I get home from the club.” Wanda said honestly as she got up and headed for the door pausing once her hand was on the knob. “Hey, get some rest tonight. I know how you get when you want to unravel something.”</p><p>“I’ll try my best.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“That’s all I can ask.” Wanda said as she walked out the door and shut it softly. Agatha picked up her phone and typed the number in to her contacts on the front page along with the woman’s name. She contemplated what to do next.</p><p>Agatha set her phone down and took a moment to read the book some more. She skimped the pages and made mental notes on what she wanted to come back to before she stumbled upon a page with the theme of magical compatibility. Something struck her, the memory of her magic reacting to Rio’s earlier in the day giving her a wicked idea.</p><p>She decided she was going to take the reigns for once and flirt back with the stunning brunette. Agatha decided taking a photo with her two middle fingers caressing the crease while her pointer finger and index finger held the book open would be a good start.</p><p>Unknown number 7:02 p.m: Missing something?- A  Attachment image</p><p>Rio’s phone buzzed in her hand as she was looking through new books and future releases to order. Her brow furrowed as she didn’t recognize the number. She clicked on it and realized quickly that it was the attractive ebony haired woman who came into the store with the redhead earlier today.  She viewed the image and felt her heart jump into her throat.</p><p>“Oh so you’re a tease” Rio mused to herself.</p><p>Rio 7:03 p.m: I was wondering when you’d notice. I guess my book wanted to get to know you better.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and looked down at the book as she went back to the first page. She stroked along the gold leaf edges and mused to herself. “What’s so special about me.”</p><p>Agatha 7:05 p.m: Seems quite enchanted, so when was the last time something like this happened?</p><p>Rio sighed as she read the text message. She had a choice to make, be honest with this woman who had caught her attention or lie.</p><p>Rio 7:06 p.m: Never. Honestly I was shocked when you put it down in front of me but I figured it would be a great way to see you again.</p><p>Agatha read the text and felt herself flush. “Oh so I’m special. Tell me little thing, what did you want to show me?” Agatha asked as she set the book in her lap and willed it into opening, the pages flipped and landed on magical compatibility once again.</p><p>“Alright I’ll get back to you in a moment. Let me see what your owner has to say first.” Agatha said as she grabbed her phone and willed a book mark into her hand. She placed the bookmark in the book and then looked at her phone once more.</p><p>Agatha 7:08 p.m: I’m sure you’ll want it back sooner rather than later but you are closed for the next two days. Any suggestions on how to remedy this?</p><p>A soft chuckle left Rio as she looked at her phone. She read the message a few times before she composed herself.</p><p>Rio 7:10 p.m: Are you free tomorrow?</p><p>Agatha 7:11 p.m: I might be, but I wanted a little more time to unravel all the secrets this little tomb holds. I mean I could stay up all night reading, but then I’d be too tired to do much tomorrow.</p><p>Rio read the text and had to suppress the urge to flirt.</p><p>Rio 7:12 p.m: do you want the flirty text or do you want to borrow it for longer?</p><p>Agatha 7:12 p.m: I mean if you wanted to keep me up all night you should’ve just offered.</p><p>Agatha 7:12 p.m: But now I’m going to spend the night focusing on learning as much as I can from this book. Where would you like to meet up tomorrow so I can return it?</p><p>Rio sat shocked in her living room as she stared at her phone. This woman was bold. She felt a magical tug a moment later before her phone went off again.</p><p>Agatha 7:15 p.m: did you feel that?</p><p>Rio felt so out of her own depth in this moment, most of the time women were falling over their own feet to get her attention. Agatha was something new and refreshing, almost like she was there to challenge her. Another tug pulled on her, this time dragging a feeling of desire out of her.</p><p>Rio 7:17 p.m: what are you doing over there?</p><p>Rio asked as she felt herself being toyed with. She could feel their magic intertwining in a unique way.</p><p>Agatha 7:20 p.m: Learning. Now are you going to answer my question?</p><p>Rio 7:20 p.m: I felt something.</p><p>Agatha sat in her living room and read the page several times. It seemed that Rio had been learning about magical compatibility but hadn’t learned much about it. To Agatha it seemed like she never found someone her magic was compatible with.</p><p>Agatha 7:30 p.m: care to elaborate?</p><p>Rio 7:31 p.m: I can feel you tugging on my magic. Like you’re pulling me to you.</p><p>Agatha decided she wanted to try something, she tugged harder on the connection they made earlier. Rio felt her whole body flush and her belly fill with desire. She could feel their magical connection strengthening.</p><p>Rio 7:32 p.m: pull any harder and I’ll be in your lap.</p><p>Agatha 7:32 p.m: is that what you want? If not I can stop.</p><p>~<br/>Rio sat in her living room contemplating what to say next. Truthfully she wanted to be in Agatha’s lap, she wanted to know how the woman tasted when she kissed her. Rio decided instead of answering she would try and grasp the thread of magic that connected them and tug back.<br/>~<br/>Agatha felt herself flush, the warmth of Rio’s magic flooding her body. A lesser witch would’ve been overwhelmed almost instantly. Agatha sighed as she felt the magic surge in her body, she closed her eyes and imagined the green witch straddling her lap and weaving her fingers into long brown hair.<br/>~<br/>Rio was sitting on her couch when she felt warmth between her legs and soft touches curling at the nape of her neck. Then she felt goosebumps spread up her leg. Almost like someone slid their hand up her leg, before she felt warmth settle on her hip.<br/>~<br/>Agatha kept her eyes closed as she kept the vision of Rio in her mind. Her hand settled on Rio’s hip and the other woven in her hair. A gentle tug pulled Rio’s face closer so that their noses were touching. Agatha’s lips a breath away from Rio’s.<br/>~<br/>Rio felt a shiver run up her spine as she felt warmth, a soft delicate kiss grazed her lips. As if asking for permission. Rio surged forward to kiss Agatha but she wasn’t there. The connection faltered slightly. Rio calmed herself and waited.<br/>~<br/>Agatha felt Rio surge forward, and the connection wavered. Agatha kept her death grip on the thread of magic not letting Rio break it. She moved forward softly and pressed a kiss to Rio’s lips. Then Agatha faltered, relaxing into the soft kiss causing the thread to snap.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha said in a frustrated tone as she opened her eyes. She could feel the coil in her stomach, and the warmth from a woman who wasn’t there.</p><p>Rio 8:05 p.m: Noon. The book store. Tomorrow.</p><p>The text came through a moment later jostling Agatha slightly. She looked at her phone and felt another jolt of arousal corse through her. She was beyond ready for this woman. With all the magical energy coursing through her, she felt bold.</p><p>Agatha 8:05 p.m. It’s a date.</p>

<p>~Meanwhile at Rio’s~</p><p>Agatha  8:05 p.m. It’s a date.</p><p>Rio felt excitement well up in her chest. She needed a plan, and a damn good one at that if she was going to seduce this woman.</p><p>“If that kiss was just a figment of our imaginations… Would it be too bold to start with a kiss? No, I’d end up doing something much worse in the store. Can’t have that.” Rio said musing to herself. She wanted nothing more than to teleport to her book. She could feel exactly where it was. But she didn’t want to intrude on Agatha.</p><p>“Patience Vidal. Patience.” Rio said trying to stop herself from getting too far ahead.  Rio sat on the couch replaying the sensations in her mind. She tried to clear her head but it failed. Agatha Harkness has wormed her way in, and nothing was going to change that.</p><p>~</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and exhaled loudly as she got up and grabbed her own spell book and an ink pen. She paced the living room for a few moments before she slumped down on the couch. Opening to a blank page she started writing her findings furiously. She was frustrated physically and mentally.</p><p>“I’ve never experienced anything like that in my fucking life.” Agatha grumbled to herself as she wrote every detail she could remember about magical compatibility. Her phone pinged loudly from next to her as she wrote. She ignored it until she had finished writing what she had learned.</p><p>Wanda 8:30 p.m: learning anything fun?</p><p>Agatha 9:05 p.m: So much. Also I have a date tomorrow at noon at the bookshop with Rio.</p><p>Wanda 9:06 p.m: Whaaaaaat!?!?</p><p>Wanda 9:06 p.m: details now!</p><p>Wanda 9:06 p.m: whyyy did I have to come out with Jen and Alice tonight! I always miss the good shit!</p><p>Wanda 9:07 p.m: Agatha answer me!</p><p>Agatha 9:08 p.m: Chill. I texted her and we started flirting. I’m returning the book. Simple as that. Enjoy your night.</p><p>Agatha was really not in the mood to describe to Wanda what she just experienced. Based off the woman’s texts she had already started drinking.</p><p>Wanda 9:09 p.m: okay. Details. Tomorrow.</p><p>Agatha put her phone down for a moment and tried to relax. She picked Rio’s book back up and started reading from the very beginning. She absorbed as much knowledge as she could about the woman’s incantations, spells, and rituals. Near the back of Rio’s book she found the spell that masked her book from other witches and humans alike.</p><p>“Looks like I found how Wanda couldn’t see you. Let’s see if we can impress your owner tomorrow.” Agatha said as she read the spell.</p><p>“De facie evanescant, solum mereantur videre. De facie evanescant, solum mereantur videre. De facie evanescant, solem mereantur videre.” Agatha spoke out in Latin over her book setting her intention. Her book didn’t seem to change for her. Unfortunately for her, the only way to find out was to send a photo to Wanda.</p><p>Agatha 11:15 p.m: Testing Attachment Image</p><p>Agatha set her phone aside and started reading again while she waited for Wanda to text her back. Agatha got comfortable and continued reading. The book seemed to span forever even if Agatha knew it was impossible.</p><p>Wanda 11:25 p.m: Still can’t see it Aggs. In the cab on the wayyy hoome.</p><p>“Perfect, the spell worked.”Agatha said as she tucked her phone away. Agatha got up and took the book with her to bed as she shut the lights off and locked her front door. She headed into her bedroom and got undressed and comfortable. Agatha took a moment to plug her phone in and set an alarm before turning on her reading light and climbing into bed.</p><p>Agatha sat there and read the spell book until she couldn’t keep her eyes open any longer. Softly closing the book she placed it next to her on her night stand and shut off the light. Her dreams were filled with visions of a woman with long brown hair, sun kissed skin and brown eyes so enrapturing and intense she felt like she was stripped bare.</p><p>Agatha’s alarm jostled her awake. She sat up groggily and stretched before shutting her alarms off. A yawn left her as she stood up and made her way to the bathroom. She quickly got into the shower and washed the sleep away, Agatha took her time and pampered herself on this particular morning. After her shower wrapped herself in a fuzzy robe and applied moisturizer and a delecate sweet perfume.</p><p>Agatha had to decide what she wanted to wear today as she stood in her bedroom staring at her closet her phone rang. She walked over and grabbed her phone to see it was Wanda.</p><p>“What’s up?” Agatha said as she answered the phone.</p><p>“Getting ready for my date with Jacob. I’ll text you the address.” Wanda said, sounding far away. Obviously she had Agatha on speaker.</p><p>“If you need an emergency escape route, have Jen or Alice do it… I will probably be away from my phone most of the day.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Why… Wait! I thought I dreamed that! You actually have a date with the owner of the book store?!?” Wanda screeched into the phone.</p><p>“Yes. Which I am trying to get ready for.”</p><p>“Oh fuck! Shit! Should I cancel my date?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“No! Goddesses no! Please go enjoy yourself.” Agatha said in a rush as she put Wanda on speaker phone and started looking through her closet. “Dress or suit?”</p><p>“Dress for sure… if you’ve shaved.”</p><p>“I did this morning. What dress?”</p><p>“The lavender sundress with a cute belt, and the cream shawl you love. Light make-up, and flats. Just incase she’s crazy and you gotta run.” Wanda said, Agatha pulled the dress out along with the shawl. She grabbed a pair of flats and selected a pair of light green panties and matching bra.</p><p>“Thanks, need help picking an outfit out?” Agatha asked</p><p>“No. I’ve got one picked out already.” Wanda said into the phone as she settled on her own bed.</p><p>“Well I have to leave in 30 minutes so I really need to let you go. Love you, bye!” Agatha said before hanging up quickly not giving Wanda the chance to say anything.</p><p>Wanda 11:01 a.m: Rude.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at her best-friend and then headed into the bathroom to do her hair before she got dressed. A quick little braided crown hair style with the rest of her hair flowing wild and free was what Agatha landed on. Then she did a soft purple smokey eye and a deep plumb lipstick. She felt like that was more than enough effort and headed into her room to get dressed. She quickly got dressed and slipped on some flats before grabbing her purse, Rio’s spell book and her own and heading out the door.</p><p>“You look fucking fantastic.” Wanda said as Agatha shut her door.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be getting ready for a date?” Agatha scolded as she walked to her car.</p><p>“Mine’s not till one. I just wanted to see how you looked.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“Thanks. Now go away. I don’t want to be late.” Agatha said as she shooed Wanda away with a wave of her hand.</p><p>“You better call me after!” Wanda yelled as she walked back toward her home.</p><p>“I will!” Agatha yelled back before she climbed into her car and started it. She started the drive back to the book store to return Rio’s book.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Agatha pulled up outside the bookstore with ten minutes to spare. She took a moment to recheck her make up and then pulled her phone out to text Rio.</p><p>Agatha 11:52 a.m: I’m here.</p><p>Rio 11:52 a.m: Come on in! Just pulling the curtains shut so we have some privacy.</p><p>Agatha tucked her phone back into her purse and checked to make sure both spell books were in her purse before turning off the car and getting out. She walked up to the door and let herself in.</p><p>“Hello?” Agatha asked as she walked into the store and noticed that the lights were dimmed.</p><p>“Back here. Just setting something up for us real quick. “ Rio said as she peaked her head from behind one of the book shelves. Agatha rolled her eyes as she walked over to where Rio’s voice was coming from and found a blanket laid on the floor with two cushions on top of it. In the center of the blanket was a charcuterie board and two wine glasses. There was a bottle of white wine on ice.  Electric tea lights dotted the shelves and floor around the blanket. Soft music was playing over the stores speakers.</p><p>“Wow.” Agatha whispered, wishing she could pull her phone out and send a photo to Wanda.</p><p>“Take a seat, I have to grab one more thing from the back.” Rio said as she walked away. Agatha set her purse down on the floor next to the blanket. Then kneeled down on the pillow before tucking her legs to the side sitting as comfortably as she could in her dress.</p><p>Rio walked out of the back room carrying a bouquet of beautiful blooms. She handed the flowers to Agatha with a smile. “For you, flowers nearly as beautiful as the woman receiving them.”</p><p>Agatha blushed slightly as she looked at the blooms. Lilac, lavender, henbane, roses, and baby’s breath filled the arrangement. “Thank you.” Agatha whispered as she took the flowers and admired them.</p><p>Rio walked over to the other cushion and sat down next to Agatha giving the woman a chance to look at Rio’s outfit. She was wearing a deep green button up with the top three buttons undone, her sleeves were rolled up so Agatha could see tattoos covering her forearm. Solid green vines sprawled across Rio’s right arm. Agatha wondered how many tattoos were hidden under Rio’s clothes as she continued to check her out.</p><p>“Soo…”Rio trailed off as she grabbed the bottle of wine and the wine key and started opening it.</p><p>“Oh right.” Agatha said as she pulled Rio’s spell book out of her purse and set it between the two of them. “Thank you for letting me borrow this.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. I see you learned a few things from it.” Rio said looking at the book sticking out of Agatha’s purse as she nodded in its direction as she opened the wine. She poured both of them a glass then put the bottle back in the bucket.</p><p>“Oh, So you can see it.” Agatha said as she reached forward and grabbed her own spell book.</p><p>“Well, it is my spell.” Rio teased.</p><p>“I know I did it right. I think it just wants you to see it.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Trade?” Rio asked as she held a glass of wine out for Agatha, who took it and placed her heavy tomb in Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Stunning, it suits you. I love the black sprayed edges with the purple leather. It’s rare to find a spirit witch in this day and age.” Rio said as she placed the book in her lap.</p><p>“I think there are 6 of us in the United States last I checked.” Agatha said honestly as she took a sip of wine, she hummed softly at the sweetness of it.</p><p>“Do you mind?” Rio asked as she fingered the edge of the cover.</p><p>“It’s only fair. Though I doubt you’ll find anything of interest.”</p><p>“I find all of you interesting.” Rio said as she opened the book and skimmed through the pages. Agatha sat and waited patiently while Rio thumbed through her spell book.</p><p>“I could spend weeks reading this.” Rio said with rapt attention before she closed the book and handed it back to Agatha.</p><p>“I don’t think I can go weeks without it. But, I think I can allow twenty four hours. It only seems fair.”</p><p>“Absolutely not. I’m hoping we will get more time together. Plus you didn’t even get mine for a full twenty four hours.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“True, but what if I’m just looking for an excuse to see you tomorrow.” Agatha prodded.</p><p>“You never need an excuse to see me. Just give me a little tug and I’ll be right there.” Rio flirted back.</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha asked as she tugged softly on the connection between them. Rio felt a shiver run up her spine as Agatha smiled at her wickedly.</p><p>“I’m right here Agatha.” Rio said through gritted teeth, something about this connection lead to arousal.</p><p>“So? What if I don’t think you’re close enough?” Agatha teased. Rio had to look away from the violet witch in front of her so she could collect herself.</p><p>“If I get any closer, all this hard work will go to waste.” Rio said honestly after she calmed down. “And I really want to get to know you better before we jump into the physical aspect.”</p><p>“What would you like to know?” Agatha asked as she leaned forward and grabbed an olive to pop into her mouth.</p><p>“How long have you and The Scarlett Witch been friends?”</p><p>“Her name is Wanda, and since we were six. Childhood besties. She’s infuriating, bold, brash, and wild. But she’s been by my side through many things, and no, we’ve never dated.” Agatha answered honestly.</p><p>“Wasn’t going to ask that.”</p><p>“Oh really? Because you seemed to think we were dating when we came in yesterday.” Agatha jabbed.</p><p>“I mean… two attractive women coming into a lgbt+ book store dressed nicely. Gives the impression of a date.” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>“That is fair, now it’s my turn. How long have you wanted to own a book store?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It was always something that called to me. Surrounded by stories and knowledge, just seemed like the most natural thing to me.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Fascinating. A green witch who surrounds herself with dead trees.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Death is just a natural part of life. It’s a cycle. Everything comes back to the earth in someway or another. At least these trees are living on as a story to tell.” Rio answered. Agatha was spreading a cheese on a cracker for Rio as she spoke before curling a piece of salami onto it. She handed the cracker to Rio softly. “Thank you.”</p><p>“I can see it from that angle. I’ve always loved books. The smell, the feel of pages between my fingertips, the raw knowledge you can gain from them. I’m always seeking knowledge.” Agatha answered before taking a bite of her cracker.</p><p>“What does The Great Agatha Harkness do for a living?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m a partner at Stark Law Offices.” Agatha answers, waiting for Rio to respond like most of her dates do when they find out she works for Tony Stark.</p><p>“His wife is the real one in charge of the firm. He is more technology and green energy than anything else. I respect you picked a law office that stands behind keeping the environment clean.” Rio responded, shocking Agatha completely.</p><p>“Did you stalk me or is this something you were interested in because you are a green witch?” Agatha asked before she took another sip of her wine.</p><p>“I’ve been following Stark industry’s and their affiliate company’s for years because of their green initiatives.” Rio answered with a shrug.</p><p>“I’m fairly good at keeping my name out of the press. So I know you didn’t stalk me. Not like you’d find much.” Agatha said as she grabbed another olive. Rio leaned forward and took some Bree cheese and spread it on a cracker before adding some peach jam. She handed it to Agatha who took it politely.</p><p>“What’s it like working for Pepper Pots?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She is the single most interesting human being I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. Quite the hard ass upfront, but now that we are on an equal playing field for the most part she’s quite a sweetheart. One of the best bosses I’ve ever had.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Fascinating, would you go for her if she wasn’t married to Stark?”</p><p>“Goddess no. I don’t date humans. Their lifespans are too short.”</p><p>“So you are a clever witch.” Rio complimented.</p><p>“The law degree wasn’t enough of an indicator?” Agatha joked as she took a bite of the cracker Rio prepared for her. A soft moan left Agatha as she enjoyed the bite.</p><p>“Oh it was, I just find it baffling how many witches don’t think that far ahead.” Rio answers.</p><p>“Perfect example there is Wanda. She’s been on 4 dates this week with human men.”</p><p>“Goddess who has time for that?! It sounds exhausting.” Rio lamented as she took a sip of wine.</p><p>“That’s what I said! She is on her fourth date currently.” Agatha said as she rolled her eyes. “Okay, my turn. Favorite book you’ve read this year?”</p><p>“You can’t ask me that! In my book store, surrounded by my babies. What if one of them hears and their feelings get hurt?” Rio said in mock horror. Agatha felt a laugh bubble up at the woman’s theatrics.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll be more broad. If you’ll allow me to change my question?” Agatha asked politely.</p><p>“I’ll allow it.”</p><p>“Favorite genre?”</p><p>“Romance.” Rio answered without a second thought.</p><p>“Funny, I pinned you for a horror gal. Your turn.” Agatha said with a chuckle as she started assembling another cracker for Rio. This time she added sharp cheddar, onion jam and prosciutto. She handed Rio the cracker before making herself one and leaning back to look at Rio.</p><p>“Are you looking for a committed relationship or just something fun?” Rio asked shifting the tone of the conversation. Agatha looked her in the eyes, her steely blue gaze cutting Rio to the bone.</p><p>“I think our magical comparability answered that question already didn’t it? If I’m being honest until yesterday I was content being single. Now, I want to try with you. I’ve never met anyone like you before. You have changed everything.” Agatha said in a serious tone, leaving no room for Rio to question her desire.</p><p>“I’m hard to love.” Rio answered honestly.</p><p>“So am I. I’m a work-aholic. I’m never home. I spend weeks at a time in my office or at the office, and I’m terrible company when I lose a case.”</p><p>“How often do you lose a case?”</p><p>“The last one was 5 years ago.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“I think I can handle a grumpy Agatha once every 5 years.” Rio joked, which caused Agatha to actually laugh, a full belly laugh that made Rio’s soul sing.</p><p>“Do you want to actually try this?” Agatha asked before she took a bite of her food.</p><p>“Yes. More than anything.” Rio answered before she took a bite. Rio chewed humming happily as she did before she complimented.  “This is the best one yet.”</p><p>Agatha finished chewing and took another drink of her wine before she steeled her nerves. Willing them into submission as she prepared for her next question.</p><p>“Whose turn is it?” Agatha asked losing track of who was supposed to ask a question.</p><p>“Technically yours.” Rio answers.</p><p>“Oh good.” Agatha said as she shifted slightly so she could face Rio. She raised her hand connecting three fingers to Rio’s chin and turning her face toward her. “Can I kiss you?”</p><p>Rio felt herself flush as she swallowed dryly. “Yes.” She whispered out almost desperately. Agatha leaned forward and softly pressed her lips to Rio’s. Sparks of green and purple skitter across their lips and minds as both women sigh softly. The kiss felt like coming home, a warm welcome with a soft embrace and the comfort of a place for bones to settle. Rio almost dropped her wineglass that she was still holding when Agatha pulled away.</p><p>“Wait.” Rio whispered softly as her lips followed Agatha’s.</p><p>“You’re going to make a mess dear.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s glass and set it aside along with her own. Then Agatha scooted closer and connected their lips again. Agatha brought her hand up to Rio’s cheek and softly slid it to the nape of her neck twirling the baby hairs there softly as she kissed Rio. A soft whimper left Rio as Agatha tugged gently.</p><p>Rio pulled away this time, trying to catch her breath. Fingers still toying with the soft brown hair at the nape of her neck as she locked eyes with Agatha. Agatha bit her lip and looked down at Rio’s once more.</p><p>“If you keep looking at me like that… I won’t be able to focus at work ever again.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Oh? And why’s that?” Agatha prodded.</p><p>“Because all I’ll ever be able to think about is how I fucked you on the counter, or this floor, or the couch. Where ever we end up.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Who said I’d let that kind of thing happen on the first date?” Agatha said as she let Rio go and looked away. Rio could feel Agatha’s arousal if she focused hard enough. She found the thread and tugged hard.</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Agatha moaned out softly as she felt Rio pull on the coil in her gut. Rio felt her own arousal grow at the sound of Agatha moaning.</p><p>“No one, but I have a way of getting what I want.” Rio teased Agatha felt another shiver run down her spine.</p><p>“I should give you a taste of your own medicine.” Agatha said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Please don’t. I’ll behave.” Rio requested already feeling like she was playing a dangerous game with Agatha.</p><p>“What, you don’t want to fuck me on the counter anymore?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Is that what you want?” Rio asked leveling her stare at Agatha.</p><p>“Honestly? Could be fun. But I prefer a soft bed with lots of room.”</p><p>“Sounds acceptable.” Rio understood Agatha’s want for comfort.</p><p>“Plus, I can’t have you losing focus at work. Even if it would guarantee you’d never flirt with another customer.” Agatha said as she picked up her wine glass.</p><p>“You were the first one I ever flirted with.”  Rio told the woman across from her honestly.</p><p>“And hopefully the last.” Agatha said confidently before she leaned in again and kissed Rio softly. The sparks and tingles from their connection making their presence known.</p><p>“No one could hold a candle to you. Even if they tried.” Rio whispered against Agatha’s lips after the kiss broke.</p><p>“I think it’s your turn to ask a question.” Agatha said dreamily.</p><p>“None of the questions I want to ask right now are safe and appropriate.” Rio said honestly before she gave Agatha another soft kiss.</p><p>“I like a woman who isn’t afraid to ask the hard questions.” Agatha said as she leaned back placed her hand behind her so she could recline a little.</p><p>“I have one that isn’t super inappropriate I think.” Rio murmured as she watched Agatha finish her wine.</p><p>“Let’s hear it. Also this wine is amazing.”</p><p>“Ideal first date?”</p><p>“You nailed it. I’ve always dreamed of a first date like this. I almost took a photo while you were getting the flowers from the back.” Agatha said honestly as she leaned forward to grab the bottle of wine and pour herself a second glass.</p><p>“You could’ve I wouldn’t have minded. But I did take one for myself before you arrived. Also I have to surpass expectations for our next date?” Rio asked.</p><p>“What if I wanted to be the one to take you on a date?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“I would say yes in a heart beat.”</p><p>“Same question, ideal first date?” Agatha asked the woman.</p><p>“I’d say a trip to an arboretum or something of the like. I really enjoy being in nature. But really, the company is what matters the most.”</p><p>“Goddesses above you are a charmer.” Agatha scoffed as she took a sip of her wine and shook her head. Agatha’s phone started ringing loudly interrupting the comfortable moment between the women.</p><p>“That is probably work. One moment.” Agatha said as she reached into her purse.</p><p>Pepper Potts scrolled across Agatha’s screen causing the woman to sigh loudly as she hit answer and stood up.</p><p>“Hey Pepper, what’s up?” Agatha asked as she walked away from Rio toward the front of the store.</p><p>“I know it’s Sunday but is there any chance you can come into the office and help me with something?” Agatha looked back to where Rio was waiting. There was a long pause. Agatha swallowed loudly and decided to just be honest with Pepper.</p><p>“I’m currently on a date… and two glasses of wine deep.”</p><p>“Oh? Really?” Pepper said genuinely interested.</p><p>“Give me an hour. I’ll be in.” Agatha said as she swallowed the lump in her throat.</p><p>“No, I can call someone else in. Enjoy your date.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha asked hopefully, but she knew that it was important if Pepper was calling her personally.</p><p>“Honestly, no. But you never go on dates, I don’t think I’ve ever even heard of you having a relationship your entire time at the firm. I want you happy, and if that means settling for someone else instead of having you help out. I will. Is it going well?”</p><p>“Fantastic. Single best date I’ve ever been on.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Well then fuck me. Enjoy yourself. I’ll have someone send you what we get done today and we can review it tomorrow in the office.”</p><p>“Seriously, are you sure?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll ruin someone else’s Sunday. Be ready to tackle this case tomorrow. Bright eyed and bushy tailed.” Pepper said into the phone enthusiastically.</p><p>“Thank you, I won’t forget this Pepper.”</p><p>“You never forget anything.” Pepper joked back.</p><p>“Send me the cliff notes from the meeting and I’ll email you once I’ve read them.”</p><p>“Perfect. Enjoy yourself Agatha. You rarely do.”</p><p>“Gee thanks boss. See you tomorrow.” Agatha said sarcastically into the phone.</p><p>“Yes. Tomorrow. Don’t even think about coming into the office after your date. I’ll have you escorted out.” Pepper threatened.</p><p>“Yes Ma’am!” Agatha said as Pepper hung the phone up. She walked back over to Rio who was waiting patiently for her to return.</p><p>“Sorry about that.” Agatha said as she sat back down on the cushion.</p><p>“Do you need to leave?” Rio asked with a strange tone, she sounded almost sad.</p><p>“No, the second she heard me say I was on a date she decided to pull someone else in. I’ll be sent meeting notes and other essentials via email later. You’ve got me all to yourself today.” Agatha told Rio as she leaned forward and placed a soft kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“Do you want to pick up where we left off or is there something else you wanted to talk about?”</p><p>“Best date you’ve ever been on?” Rio asked</p><p>“I thought I was quiet enough.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“You were, unfortunately for you I have great hearing.” Rio said with a smile. Agatha slid closer to Rio and placed her hand on her thigh. Softly caressing the black fabric with her thumb.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio said slowly, trying to keep her head level.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha said in a light and breathy tone that caused Rio to groan.</p><p>“You are sending mixed signals.” Rio said with a groan as Agatha gripped her thigh.</p><p>“No I’m not, I’m showing my interest.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Is that interest intended to make my own resolve crumble?”</p><p>“Well maybe if someone hadn’t tugged so hard on our connection I wouldn’t be so aroused at the moment.” Agatha said honestly as she leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’ve never been delicate about things” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Maybe we should work on that together.” Agatha whispered softly before she kissed up Rio’s neck and pulled her earlobe into her mouth.</p><p>“I thought you weren’t the kind to have sex on a first date?” Rio asked, her voice wavering as she felt arousal pool in her stomach.</p><p>“I’m typically not, but I am a tease.” Agatha remarked honestly as she pulled away.</p><p>“I knew that last night.” Rio said as she closed her eyes and tried to collect herself.</p><p>“I think you missed an important part of my sentence.” Agatha said as she pulled herself into a kneel and straddled Rio’s lap. Rio’s eyes snapped open as she looked up at Agatha who was settling comfortably onto the cushion Rio was sitting on, her ass pressing into Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Typically?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Typically.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“What if I don’t want to fuck you in my book store?” Rio asked, knowing the whole sentence was a lie.</p><p>“Who said we had to have sex? What if I just wanted to make out with you?” Agatha asked as she placed her arms on Rio’s shoulders and wove one free hand into soft brown hair tugging softly.</p><p>“But…” Rio whimpered out as her hands hovered over Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>“I’m not glass Rio.” Agatha said as she settled into Rio’s lap her dress splaying across them and the floor.</p><p>“I know that Agatha… it’s just… You’re in a dress.”</p><p>“I guess you’ll have to learn some restraint then won’t you Rio?” Agatha said softly before she leaned in and captured Rio’s lips. The groan that came from Rio caused Agatha to smirk as she deepened the kiss. Her tongue skirting across Rio’s bottom lip.</p><p>Rio gladly accepted the request and deepened the kiss. Teeth and tongues clashing against each other as Rio placed her hands on Agatha’s hips. A satisfied moan left Agatha as she exhaled and pulled Rio closer. Rio’s hands slid down to Agatha’s ass and gripped it before pulling her closer. Rio could feel their magic intertwining as her arousal built, it was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss first, pulling back as she groaned loudly. Rio was determined to make Agatha regret climbing into her lap. She started kissing down the side of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“No marks.” Agatha whispered, a soft demand that would be respected.</p><p>“No visible marks.” Rio responded.</p><p>“I can agree to those terms.” Agatha said in a breathy tone.</p><p>“What ever am I going to do with you Agatha.” Rio said softly as she admired the woman in her lap.</p><p>“I can think of a few things.” Agatha responded as she played with Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Oh? Care to share with the class?” Rio sassed.</p><p>“Well for starters. We could take this over to the couch and get comfortable, or we could clean this up and move locations?” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“What location would that be?”</p><p>“That’s for me to know, and you to find out.” Agatha said softly as she leaned in and gave Rio another passionate kiss.</p>

<p>“Can I get details about this second location before I decide?” Rio asked as she let Agatha go. The woman sliding off her lap before standing up and stretching.</p><p>“Yes. But I’m only going to give yes or no answers.” Agatha said as she held a hand out for Rio to take.</p><p>“Okay, is this second location close?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha answered as she walked over to the couch in the corner and sat down, making herself comfortable.</p><p>“Will other people be there?”</p><p>“Yes, most likely.”</p><p>“Do we need to change our outfits?”</p><p>“No, and even if we did. I could easily handle that.” Agatha said with a flourish of her hand, purple magic sparking at her fingertips.</p><p>“I think I seen something in your spell book about clothing.” Rio mentioned as she walked over to the couch and settled next to Agatha so that she was facing her. Knee bent with her shin against Agatha’s thigh with her elbow propped on the back of the couch so she could lean on her hand.</p><p>“Illusion magic is one of my many specialties.” Agatha said confidently.</p><p>“What are your others?”</p><p>“I can bend a feeble mind to my will, or just to tell the truth. I am exemplary at casting most spells and incantations, and I’m a damn good cook when I want to be.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Rio said as she waved a hand and cleaned the room of the charcuterie board and wine leaving the tea lights, blanket and cushions.</p><p>“Which part interested you the most.” Agatha asked as she placed her hand on Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“Mostly the cooking but we can touch back on that at another point in time. Do you think I’ll enjoy this secondary location?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So I have to decide between getting to make out with you or this surprise?” Rio asked softly as she raised her free hand up to toy with the hem of Agatha’s dress softly tickling her thigh.</p><p>“Yep! Those are your choices” Agatha said with a glint of something mischievous in her eyes.</p><p>“I guess we can get out of this stuffy store for a while.” Rio lamented, knowing if she chose making out with Agatha on this couch she would be cementing her own torture.</p><p>“Good choice darling. Come with me.” Agatha said as she snapped her fingers. Purple magic collected the cushions off the floor and placed them in the chairs they came from. The blanket was folded and the tea lights were grouped together in a pile and shut off. The flowers seemed to vanish completely.</p><p>“Where did the flowers go?” Rio asked as she watched everything move around the room of its own accord.</p><p>“Those are at home in a vase.” Agatha said as she stood up.</p><p>“Okay. You going to tell me where we are going?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Nope, that’s a surprise. You’ll probably know when we are close though. Let’s go.” Agatha said as she crouched down grabbed her purse and spell book.  Agatha pulled her phone out real quick and googled to see if her plan was actually open while Rio got off the couch. Rio walked to the back to grab her keys and wallet before locking the back door and following Agatha to the front.</p><p>“Let me lock up and I’ll be right with you.” Rio said as she let Agatha out the door first. She armed the security system and then shut the door and locked it with her key. Agatha walked over to her car and held the passenger door open for Rio who walked over and got in with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio said as Agatha shut the door before she walked around and got in the driver seat.</p><p>“Ready?” Agatha asked as she buckled. Rio grabbed her seatbelt and buckled as well before turning to look at Agatha. Who started the car and pulled out of the parking spot in front of the store.</p><p>“As I can be.” Rio said nervously.</p><p>“I promise, you’ll love it.” Agatha reassured as she took Rio’s hand, magical energy coursing through them as Agatha squeezed it reassuringly.</p><p>“What do I get out of this if I hate it.” Rio asks as she brings Agatha’s hand up to her mouth and kisses the back of it.</p><p>“Time spent with me.” Agatha offers, as she starts heading toward their destination.</p><p>“What if I want something else?” Rio teased as she let her tongue flick out sliding between Agatha’s index and middle finger softly. Agatha felt a blush creep up onto her face as she pulled her hand from Rio’s grasp and clasped the steering wheel. Arousal flaring back to life as she thought Rio’s tongue in other places.</p><p>“You’ve lost hand holding privileges.”  Agatha said in a high pitched tone, which caused Rio to laugh softly, it was almost an exhale more than anything.</p><p>“Easily riled up I see?” Rio teased.</p><p>“No.” Agatha said steeling herself as she focused on driving. Refusing to even cast a sidelong glance at Rio.</p><p>“Oh then what is it? If you didn’t enjoy that, my apologies.” Rio said sincerely.</p><p>“If what you are implying is what I think you are. I’ve never had someone do that for me. So it’s a little difficult to imagine.”  Agatha answered.</p><p>“Are you a stone top?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, just my sexual experiences are far and few between, and have been mainly one night stands.”</p><p>“Have you eaten pussy before?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“But they couldn’t return the favor? Rude.”</p><p>“By the time we got that far… they were usually sleeping.”</p><p>“Now that’s a brag.” Rio said with a chuckle as she looked out the window.</p><p>“That or I’m just so boring they passed out.”</p><p>“I doubt that. If kissing you has told me anything, it’s not a skill issue. It’s a stamina issue on their part. Now if I promise to be good, can I have your hand back?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, because we are almost there and I need both hands to turn.” Agatha said as she turned the car.  A few more turns and they were pulling into a parking lot. Rio hadn’t been paying attention and had no clue where they were.</p><p>“Okay, I have no clue where we are.” Rio said looking around the parking lot. Agatha chuckled and parked the car and smiled at the woman.</p><p>“I guess I’m good at distracting you then come on.” Agatha said as she grabbed her purse and shut the car off.  They both got out and Agatha locked the vehicle before throwing her key’s into her purse. Agatha walked around to the passenger side and lead Rio to their destination. Thru the trees a giant green house appeared. A sign in front read “Stark Botanical Gardens and Research. Open to the public.”</p><p>“This place is so expensive to get into!” Rio scolded.</p><p>“Employees and Family get free admittance. Plus even if I didn’t, I could afford it.” Agatha said as she guided Rio to the door. Once inside Agatha pulled out her work badge and scanned it at the terminal.</p><p>“Welcome Ms. Harkness and guest. Enjoy your stay” the terminal said as the door slid open. They entered into a large lobby and were greeted by a few employees.  They started making their way toward the green house when a few moments later a man appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, an honor for you to visit us today. What brings you to our neck of the woods?” A man asked Agatha.</p><p>“Nothing legal, just on a date Jeffery. No need to be so concerned.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s hand and tucked the woman behind her.</p><p>“My apologies. I just remember the last time you graced us with your presence.” The man said as he backed away, still keeping a close eye on the women.</p><p>“Let’s not repeat that. Now if you don’t mind, I’d like to continue my date that you rudely interrupted.” Agatha said in an irritated tone, dismissing the man as she turned to guide Rio away toward the actual greenhouse.</p><p>“What did you do the last time you were here?” Rio asked once they were out of the man’s earshot.</p><p>“Dismantled their entire database looking for the researcher who leaked valuable and deadly knowledge to a competitor. Caused a mess of legal issues.” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“I assume you found what you were looking for.”  Rio asked.</p><p>“And more.” Agatha said as she pushed the door open and allowed Rio to walk into the balmy green house. The whole space was warm and moist, the perfect environment for growing any plant. Rio breathed in deeply as she excitedly looked around. Agatha smiled brightly at her date who was acting more like a kid in a candy store than an adult in a green house.</p><p>“This is amazing. I wish I had known. I would’ve brought my sketch book!” Rio said gleefully as she looked at the plants. Never losing contact with Agatha. She kept her hand firmly grasped in hers.</p><p>“I’m sure I can arrange for us to come back. This was quite spontaneous.” Agatha reassured as she let Rio guide her over to a sign. Rio let go of Agatha’s hand for a moment so she could turn to face the raven haired woman next to her.</p><p>“Best first date ever.” Rio said as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>“Just wait, there’s an entire carnivorous plants section that’s to die for.” Agatha joked as she pulled Rio close.</p><p>“I’m excited for all of it. Thank you. This is seriously amazing.” Rio said as she pulled away and gave Agatha a soft kiss on the lips before stepping back and taking Agatha’s hand again. They walked around the green house together, enjoying the greenery. Thankfully there weren’t many people at the gardens on this particular Sunday afternoon.</p><p>About an hour into walking around and Rio info dumping on her favorite plants to use during spell work. Her favorite blooms and how to harvest them and just the sheer admiration she had for botany. Agatha stopped them in the floral section of the green house. “Do you use botanicals with spell work often?”</p><p>“Daily. I prefer analog magic often because it helps me feel close to the earth.” Rio answered.</p><p>“If you need anything you can’t acquire, let me know. I have many strings I can pull for you.” Agatha reassured as she watched Rio absorb as much information as she could from each sign scattered through the gardens.</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind. But seeing as you didn’t even let me give you a discount yesterday. Good luck getting me to ask you for a few seeds.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Oh come on! This is completely different.” Agatha whined.</p><p>“How so?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I don’t know…” Agatha said as she looked away from Rio.</p><p>“It is the same thing. So maybe if you let me spoil you with books, I’ll consider asking for something.” Rio told her as she turned to face the woman.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll consider it. But, we have so much more to look at and this place closes in an hour.” Agatha said as she locked eyes with Rio.</p><p>“What a bummer. Alright let’s get the led out!” Rio said as she dragged Agatha to the next section of the greenhouse. Thankfully they had made it to the carnivorous plants section, which was one of Agatha’s favorites. She was relishing watching Rio gawk at everything.</p><p>“Sorry, if I had known you’d love it this much I would’ve made this a ‘let’s get up early and spend the whole day here’ kind of date.” Agatha said truthfully.</p><p>“Maybe we can do that next weekend.” Rio suggested as she paused to read a sign about pitcher plants.</p><p>“That entirely depends on what the case I’m dealing with tomorrow entails.” Agatha said as she watched Rio, who was completely absorbed in learning as much as she could about new plants she had never seen before.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ll get it sorted out quickly. You’re a cleaver woman.” Rio complimented.</p><p>“Things take time darling.” Agatha answered honestly.</p><p>“I know. I shouldn’t expect too much next weekend. I’m just being hopeful.” Rio said honestly as she turned to look at Agatha.</p><p>“I understand that. I don’t want to discourage you, but right now my job comes first. I’m hoping in the future that may change. But…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>“You don’t want to get burned.” Rio said reading Agatha like a book.</p><p>“The last serious relationship I had didn’t go well because I was working while doing law school.” Agatha answered honestly.</p><p>“I want to give us a shot. But I get that your job has to come first. Mine does too. My hours are going to be stupid for a long time until I’m in the black again and am able to hire employees. But if we just get Sunday’s to ourselves I’ll be happy.” Rio reassured Agatha.</p><p>“So will I.” Agatha said as she smiled at Rio.</p><p>“Attention Ladies and Gentle Men The Stark Botanical gardens will be closing in 15 minutes. Please make your way to the entrance now. Thank you for visiting us and we hope you have a wonderful day.” Someone said over the loudspeaker.</p><p>Rio’s face scrunched up in disappointment as she sighed and took Agatha’s hand. “I guess that’s our cue.” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“Sorry darling, I wish I could’ve given you more time here today.” Agatha said as she squeezed Rio’s hand.</p><p>“It’s okay, now that I know we can come here whenever we want, I’ll just beg you to bring me here on a day I know I get you to myself.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Good, are you hungry?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I could eat.” Rio said as she looked Agatha up and down.</p><p>“Real food. Are you hungry for real food?” Agatha asked as she opened the door back into the main lobby for them. Rio stepped through first before Agatha followed suit. Rio was stopped by a tall strawberry blonde standing in front of her.</p><p>“Pepper!” Agatha said in a shocked tone Pepper had a self satisfied smirk on her face.</p><p>“You always have a way of being in the right place at the right time Harkness.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“Oh no, what did I do now?” Agatha asked as she stepped around Rio.</p><p>“You distracted Jeffery.” Pepper answered.</p><p>“I’m going to need clarification immediately.”</p><p>“Someone almost got us into a whole mess of legal trouble. Now, he just got himself into trouble. When you scanned your badge it alerted Jeffery that someone from the firm was here. So he rushed out to make sure you weren’t here to catch him. Which gave our plant time to copy and decode the data from Jeffery’s laptop. He’s being fired and arrested as we speak.” Pepper answered vaguely. Knowing that Agatha’s date was standing next to them.</p><p>“So…. Today has been resolved?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Completely. Now I just have to find a new head of botanical research to replace him. I’m sick and tired of shitty employees who are just trying to make a quick million or two.” Pepper answered, before she realized that she was interrupting their date again.</p><p>“Where are my Manners! I’m sorry. Hello, my name is Pepper Potts, I’m Agatha’s boss. Sorry for interrupting your date twice.” Pepper said as she held her hand out for Rio to take. Rio took her hand and shook it firmly while smiling up at the woman.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“How about this… as an apology. I’ll give Agatha tomorrow off so you two can go on a proper date without me interrupting it. Does that sound agreeable?” Pepper asked Rio as she let her hand go.</p><p>“Absolutely.” Rio said with a smile on her face.</p><p>“Wait… don’t I get a say in this?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No.” Both woman answered in unison.</p><p>“Hey, wait a second don’t gang up on me.”</p><p>“Take the day off Agatha. You more than earned your salary today even if it was on accident.” Pepper said before she turned and walked away.</p><p>“Bye! Nice to see you too!” Agatha hollered to the woman.</p><p>“So…. Tomorrow?” Rio asked.</p><p>“How about we focus on tonight first.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s hand and lead her out the door.</p><p>“Do you want to go somewhere to eat… or I could take you back to the book store and you could follow me home.”</p><p>“Why would I follow you home?” Rio asked innocently, she didn’t want to get her hopes up.</p><p>“Well you were pretty interested in my cooking, I could make you dinner.” Agatha offered as she opened the passenger door for Rio once again. Agatha shut the door and walked around the car and got in.</p><p>“Depends, what’s on the menu?” Rio asked once Agatha was in the driver seat.</p><p>“Well we can have salad, spaghetti or chicken Alfredo with garlic bread and a nice wine.” Agatha offered as she thought about what was in her fridge and pantry. She knew she had a salad already made from Friday evening.</p><p>“Oh if I have to choose I think I’d pick spaghetti.”</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha said as she pulled out of the parking spot and headed back to the book store.</p><p>“So… Pepper is fucking tall.” Rio said casually.</p><p>“The heels also add a few inches. But yes she is.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Would you be okay with texting me your address? I have to actually stop at my place and water my plants… and possibly change.” Rio asked.</p><p>“Not at all. I’ll do it when we get to the book store.”</p><p>“Good, I have one peace lily that is an absolute drama queen. If I don’t water her today she will be sagging all week.”</p><p>“So is it true that green witches can ‘hear’ plants?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Most can’t. I on the other hand can. She whines a lot when I miss water day. A whole week of ‘Neglected.’ And ‘Forgotten’ was enough for me to set a reminder in my phone. Again, Dramatic.” Rio said as she put quotations with her fingers, really mocking the plants theatrics.</p><p>“Fascinating. We’ve arrived.” Agatha said as she pulled out front and parked the car.</p><p>“Thank you for taking me.” Rio said as she leaned across the center counsel and kissed Agatha on the cheek.</p><p>“You’re welcome. I’ll see you soon. Right?”</p><p>“I’m not passing up a home cooked meal. I’ll be fifteen minutes behind you. Twenty at most.” Rio reassured. Agatha pulled her phone out and sent her address to Rio’s phone.</p><p>“Don’t make me wait too long. Maybe bring your book and we can cuddle on the couch reading each others after dinner.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Sounds perfect.” Rio said as she unbuckled and rushed out the car. As soon as she was out of sight Agatha pulled onto the road and called Wanda. The phone rang twice.</p><p>“What’s up? That was a long date.” Wanda said into the phone.</p><p>“It’s not over yet.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“She’s coming over and I’m making her dinner.”</p><p>“Fuck yeah, Aggies getting laid!” Wanda said pridefully into the phone.</p><p>“No… I’m just… I…” Agatha said grasping for the right way to say what she wanted to say.</p><p>“You don’t want to get your hopes up or set expectations too high because you’re afraid you’ll be disappointed.”</p><p>“Yes that.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“That’s fine, tell me everything!” Wanda asked as she settled onto her couch holding the phone in her hand eagerly.</p><p>“The first part of the date was at the book store, I arrived and she had electric tea lights, the lights dimmed, a blanket spread on the floor with two cushions for us to sit on. A bottle of sweet white wine and a charcuterie board.”</p><p>“So like your perfect first date.” Wanda stated.</p><p>“Yes! Then she gave me this stunning bouquet and goddesses above she’s a charmer. I shit you not this woman looked me in the eye and said ‘Flowers, nearly as beautiful as the woman receiving them.’ To me.”</p><p>“How are your panties still on.” Wanda mused.</p><p>“I have resolve.” Agatha prodded.</p><p>“What happened next?”</p><p>“Oh, I gave her spell book back and we started talking about mine. Which I brought with me. By the way, I sent you a photo of my book last night. I found her spell and tested it out.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“We will come back to that particular revelation later. What else?”</p><p>“We basically played twenty questions while making each other snacks and drank wine. Then we ended up kissing for a few minutes before Pepper called me.”</p><p>“Not Pepper! Fuck! How did you get out of going in?” Wanda asked, knowing Pepper was almost as ruthless as Agatha when she wanted something.</p><p>“I told her I was on a date and had drank two glasses of wine. She’s not heartless. But it gets better.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“How does this get better?”</p><p>“Well after I got off the phone I offered to take Rio somewhere she’d enjoy. She’s a green witch. She’s deeply interested in botany and botanicals.”</p><p>“So you took her to Stark Botanical Gardens.” Wanda finished for her.</p><p>“Yes. I can’t legally tell you much about what happened when we arrived but let’s just say I threw a monkey wrench into someone’s plans. We arrived and the head of botanical research freaked out.”</p><p>“Are you in trouble? Do I need to get the emergency bail money ready?” Wanda asked which caused Agatha to laugh.</p><p>“No, someone was being naughty and trying to make a quick mil or two and when Rio and I arrived it gave someone else the opportunity to unravel said plan. Pepper actually met us at the entrance.”</p><p>“You have always had a knack for being in the right place at the right time.” Wanda said as she shook her head.</p><p>“Now you just sound like Pepper.” Agatha said as she pulled into her driveway. She turned her car off and grabbed everything before heading inside. She unlocked the door and walked in setting her purse in its place. ”I gotta start cooking. But I can talk a little longer.”</p><p>“So Pepper interrupted your date twice?” Wanda asked, Agatha walked into the kitchen and threw on an apron to protect her dress.</p><p>“Yes and as an apology she gave me tomorrow off.” Agatha answered as she pulled a pot out and filled it with water before setting it on the stove and turning it on. She grabbed the salt well and threw a hefty pinch in the water. Then threw a lid on so it would boil faster.</p><p>“Lucky Witch.” Wanda said with a grumble.</p><p>“I’ll send you a photo of the flowers later. I really gotta focus on cooking.”</p><p>“Fine, but I want some left overs.”</p><p>“You know you always get first dibs.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Okay, bye! Have fun, good luck.”</p><p>“Bye.” Agatha said right before the line went dead. Agatha grabbed a jar of home made tomato sauce she canned last summer when cases were minor and being handled by the lower ranked lawyers in the firm. Some burger from the fridge and a loaf of French bread she bought on Friday after work.</p><p>Agatha preheated the oven before she set to work browning the burger and seasoning it well. After the burger was cooked she drained the grease and poured the pasta sauce in. Agatha turned put a lid on the sauce to prevent it from splattering. She turned and grabbed a bread knife to slice the baguette in half when there was a knock on the front door.</p><p>“Coming!” Agatha yelled as she walked out of the kitchen to the front hall. She opened the front door to see Rio standing on her steps with a smile. “Come in. I’m halfway done with dinner.” Agatha said as she stepped aside. Rio walked in the door and stood there taking in the immaculate house as Agatha shut the door behind her.</p><p>“Beautiful place.” Rio mumbled as she kicked her shoes off by the door.</p><p>“Thanks. Come on, I gotta get the garlic bread made still and pasta in the water.” Agatha said as she turned toward the kitchen. Rio followed Agatha to the kitchen and took a seat at the island so she wasn’t in Agatha’s way.</p><p>“Smells amazing so far.” Rio said as she settled on the barstool.</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha said as she turned back to her cooking. She sliced the baguette in half. She set half aside and cut the other half down the middle then pulled garlic puree and Parmesan cheese from the fridge and butter from the dish on the counter and mixed them together. She spread the mixture on the cut baguette and placed it on a baking sheet before tossing it in the oven.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha pulled spaghetti noodles from the pantry and then dumped them into the boiling water. She reached up and set a timer on the microwave and started stirring things. With a flick of her wrist a cabinet opened and a colander floated into the sink. Rio was in awe of how fluid everything looked. Agatha was so at ease in her own home and kitchen it impressed Rio.</p><p>Soon the timer went off and the pasta was drained. Sauce and meat were added to the noodles and mixed together. The garlic bread was pulled from the oven and cut and the salad was removed from the fridge and placed on the counter.</p><p>Agatha served Rio a salad, some pasta and a slice of garlic bread before doing the same for herself. “Ranch, Italian, vinegar and oil?” Agatha asked Rio.</p><p>“Italian is fine, please and thank you.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ve got Pinot Noir or Merlot.” Agatha said as she crouched down and looked in her wine fridge.</p><p>“Merlot sounds nice.” Rio answered. Agatha pulled the bottle and magicked it open before pouring them each a glass. Agatha handed Rio her glass of wine and then a fork. She made her way around the island and sat down.</p><p>“Enjoy.” Agatha said with a smile. They ate in relative silence, not saying much to each other until Rio made it to the main course. Salads were always the same to her. But the spaghetti was phenomenal.</p><p>“Why is it so good?” Rio asked after her first bite which cause Agatha to chuckle.</p><p>“I made the sauce last summer and preserved. So it’s made from scratch.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Impressive.” Rio said appreciatively as she took a sip of wine.</p><p>“I know, but I try to not brag about it much.”</p><p>“Why? You’re a very talented woman.” Rio said as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“Set expectations low so you can breeze past them with ease.” Agatha half joked.</p><p>“There might be some truth to that.” Rio said before she took another bite of food. They both settled back into eating again, just enjoying the comfortable silence they had.</p><p>Once they were finished eating Agatha started taking care of the left overs and cleaning. Rio gladly stepped in and started to help by washing dishes for Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said once the kitchen was cleaned and they were headed toward the living room. Agatha plucked her spell book out of her purse on the way.</p><p>“No, thank you. Dinner was amazing.” Rio said as she followed Agatha.</p><p>“Do you mind if I go change?” Agatha asked as she looked over Rio, still dressed in her button up and slacks.</p><p>“Not at all. Go ahead.” Rio answered as she sat down on the couch.</p><p>“Thanks, I’ll be right back.” Agatha said before she slipped into her bedroom. Agatha took a deep breath and decided she was going to put on her dark purple silk pajama shorts and button up tee. She quickly got changed and headed back out into the living room.</p><p>“Wow…” Rio said looking up from her phone.</p><p>“Thanks. Would you like to cuddle while we read?” Agatha asked as she walked over to Rio and handed her, her spell book. Rio flicked her wrist and her book appeared in her hand.</p><p>“What kind of question is that?” Rio asked as she held her arms open for Agatha. Agatha handed Rio her book and then sat down. She settled on the couch next to Rio, leaning her back against Rio’s side and grabbed the woman’s arm and placed it over her shoulder and down her chest.</p><p>Rio dragged them over to the corner a little more so she could turn her body and rest comfortably as well. She then magicked her book into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Thank you!” Agatha said excitedly as she picked the book up and opened it.  Rio softly chuckled and kissed the top of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“No, thank you Agatha. Today has been amazing. Even with all the interruptions.” Rio said as she opened Agatha’s book and they both settled into a comfortable silence reading each other’s books.</p>

<p>Sooner than either woman realized the sun had gone down and light was needed for either of them to continue reading. Agatha sighed and used her powers to turn on the living room light.</p><p>“That should probably be my cue to go?” Rio asked, but Agatha could hear it in her voice. She didn’t want to leave, and frankly Agatha didn’t want her to either.</p><p>“Or…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>“Or… we could run a few experiments. And in the morning I’ll make French toast for you with the other half of the baguette.” Agatha enticed, dangling the carrot of her cooking in Rio’s face again.</p><p>“What kind of experiments?” Rio asked very intrigued by the idea.</p><p>“I want to do what we did last night, but in person. I want to be able to hear the sounds you make. I want to do this in a controlled environment where we can learn.” Agatha explains.</p><p>“Are you okay with it leading to sex?” Rio asked wanting to clear the air.</p><p>“My boss interrupted our date twice today, and you didn’t get angry or upset. You actually showed up for dinner. I don’t think you are just in this to get laid and run. I am more than okay with that.”</p><p>“I like you Agatha. You are a likable person. No boss is going to deter me. Not even one as notorious as Pepper Potts.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Good. I have a few ideas if you are willing to entertain them?”</p><p>“Hit me.”</p><p>“You gotta let me go. I want to sit on the opposite side of the couch and try something.” Agatha said as she tried to worm her way out of Rio’s grasp.</p><p>“Wait… I wanna hold you still.” Rio whined softly.</p><p>“I promise I’ll try my best to make it worth it, and if it sucks we can go back to cuddling.” Agatha reassured, with another grumble Rio let Agatha go. She watched as Agatha climbed to the other side of the couch and turned so that she was facing her, Agatha settled against the opposing arm and relaxed.</p><p>“How is this experiment going to go?” Rio asked as she checked Agatha out.</p><p>“We are going to close our eyes and focus on our magical connection. Then… we attempt to ‘touch’ each other.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio said as she took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She could see the purple thread that connected her magic to Agatha’s. She focused on it and a purple shape of a woman came to view in her mind.</p><p>“I can see your magical energy.” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Good. Now what do you want to do to me?” Agatha pressed, she could feel Rio’s presence on her, in her magic. She just let the woman’s magic settle on her own. Rio imagined Agatha lying down with her legs spread, she settled between them comfortably and leaned forward to softly kiss Agatha as their hips pressed together.</p><p>A soft moan left Agatha as she tried to focus on their magical energy. She felt like she was experiencing things on a different level. She could feel Rio’s hips press against hers lightly, and a soft kiss graze her lips. Agatha’s hands twitched as she closed her eyes and imagined bringing them up to Rio’s hair. She softly palmed the back of Rio’s head and gave it a tug.</p><p>“If you keep doing that. I’m going to crack.” Rio said honestly. She could feel her arousal spike.</p><p>“No you’re not. Focus.” Agatha encouraged as she sighed.</p><p>“You overestimate my willpower Agatha.” Rio said with a groan.</p><p>“Try for me baby.” Agatha husked out. Rio felt her determination steel at the pet name. She closed her eyes again and focused all her energy into their connection. Rio put herself right where she was a moment ago, between Agatha’s legs. She imagined sliding her hand under the woman’s shirt and feeling the soft skin under the silk.</p><p>Agatha imagined sliding her hand down Rio’s back, hand settling on her ass as she pulled Rio down into her hips. Rio groaned from her side of the couch as she felt the heat of Agatha’s body against hers in her mind.</p><p>“It feels so strange… like it’s intense but it’s not.” Rio mumbled softly, still trying to focus on touching Agatha in her mind. Agatha hummed in agreement.</p><p>“How about you try imagining something you really want to do?” Agatha asked as she opened her eyes to look at Rio.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yes, try.” Agatha said as she closed her eyes again. Letting Rio do what she wanted, taking a moment to just feel. Rio closed her eyes and focused. She imagined kissing down the side of Agatha’s neck, unbuttoning her shirt slowly as she kissed down her body, pausing to wrap her lips around her right nipple.</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha moaned out as she felt her own fingers twitch. She kept her eyes closed and focused on the sensation. She imagined weaving her fingers into Rio’s hair and softly massaging her scalp while the woman swirled her nipple. A soft moan left Rio as she released Agatha’s nipple and started kissing down her stomach. Agatha felt her hips twitch as Rio removed her shorts and underwear.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said as she squeezed her eyes shut tight trying to imagine Rio actually between her legs instead of feeling these phantom sensations.</p><p>Rio imagined placing her hands on Agatha’s thighs and leaning forward to drag her tongue between her folds.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha groaned softly. Rio felt a wave of disappointment rush through her as she couldn’t imagine the taste of Agatha on her tongue.  A disappointed sound came from Rio as she opened her eyes and looked over at Agatha.</p><p>“Why did you stop?” Agatha asked as she opened her eyes. She was breathing heavily and, her pupils were blown and Rio could see she had affected the woman.</p><p>“I couldn’t imagine how you tasted.” Rio said honestly, disappointment painting her tone.</p><p>“I see, now I know where the short comings are of this.” Agatha said as she sat up and scooted over to Rio and grabbed her book, she magicked a pen into her hand and wrote a little note before closing it.</p><p>“And what is that?” Rio asked, still frustrated.</p><p>“Hard to imagine an experience that you haven’t had yet. Like you know how it should feel but you can’t translate it into an actual sensation. Because again, never had someone do that for me as well.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“So….” Rio trailed off trying to guide Agatha.</p><p>“So?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“So we should have sex…” Rio offered as she pulled Agatha close and kissed the side of her neck.</p><p>“We should.” Agatha agreed as she melted into Rio who felt a flare of excitement rush through her.</p><p>“Really?” Rio asked excitedly.</p><p>“No.” Agatha joked, as she got up and climbed back into Rio’s lap like she had been earlier at the book store.</p><p>“You are the queen of mixed signals.” Rio said with an eye roll. Agatha used her magic to make sure her curtains were shut and then leaned down and grabbed Rio’s face so she could kiss her passionately. This time Rio didn’t hesitate. She deepened the kiss and moaned into it. Agatha rolled her hips and slid a hand down to pop a couple more buttons on Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss to take a breath, Agatha started kissing down the side of her neck and kept unbuttoning her shirt. Once she got to the bottom she unbuttoned Rio’s pants and untucked her shirt roughly pushing it to the side while she sucked on Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>“Hey, I thought…” Rio started to object but then Agatha palmed her breast softly. Agatha pulled her mouth away from the deep purple mark she left on Rio’s clavicle and looked her in the eye.</p><p>“You thought?” Agatha asked as she played with Rio’s bra straps.</p><p>“I’d get to taste you.” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Rio, my sweet. We have all night. Now, do you want to move to the bedroom or would you rather stay out here?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Bedroom.” Rio answered and then she was lying against soft sheets and pillows as Agatha stayed in her place on her hips. “Impressive.” Rio mumbled in awe.</p><p>“We haven’t gotten to impressive yet, but by the end of the night I hope we exceed that.” Agatha said as she leaned forward and kissed Rio again. Rio felt so out of her depth, she was usually the one that took charge.</p><p>“Is this what it feels like to be put in your place?” Rio wondered aloud. Which caused Agatha to chuckle at her as she grabbed the top of Rio’s pants and tugged them down, throwing the woman’s pants aside. A flash of ink and color catching Agatha’s eye.</p><p>“Did you have hopes things would go well Darling?” Agatha teased as she pointed out the matching black lace panties and bra. Trailing her fingers along Rio’s abdomen as she straddled one of Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“I… uh… yes?” Rio stumbled across her words before she found the question. She wasn’t sure how to answer.</p><p>“What were you thinking when you put these on this morning?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I was hoping you’d like them.” Rio answered honestly.</p><p>“I definitely do, they look quite nice. But I’m more interested in this.” Agatha said as she slid her panties down slightly and placed her hand over the tattoo on Rio’s hip.</p><p>“There’s a few more around here somewhere that will undoubtably get your attention.” Rio said as she let Agatha look at the tattoo. It was a skull with poppy flowers springing from the eye sockets, settled on monstera leaves.</p><p>“Death.” Agatha said as she looked over the tattoo.</p><p>“You’ll find that as a common theme.” Rio joked.</p><p>“You really are morbid aren’t you?” Agatha asked as she leaned forward and kissed Rio again. She started kissing down the side of her neck again so Rio could answer her.</p><p>“Very. But that’s beside’s the point.” Rio commented, she sat up and grabed Agatha by the waist and rolled the woman to the side so that Agatha was under her. Rio straddled Agatha’s thigh and tossed her shirt aside before she started unbuttoning Agathas.</p><p>“Hey, I was doing something.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Yes, you were but you are also severly over dressed in comparison.” Rio teased as she finished unbuttoning Agatha’s top. She pushed her shirt aside to admire the sage green bra Agatha had put on that morning.</p><p>“I see someone planned accordingly this morning as well.” Rio teased as she slid down and pulled Agatha’s shorts off, revealing the matching green panties.</p><p>“I’ll have you know that everything I own matches.” Agatha huffed as she sat up and took her shirt off. Then reached behind her back and undid her bra letting it fall down her arms. Agatha tossed the bra aside forcing Rio to pause momentarily as she took Agatha in before collecting herself.</p><p>“Oh really? Always well composed? Lets see if I can change that.” Rio said as she slid her hand between their legs and cupped Agatha through her underwear.</p><p>“I thought I was the one in control here.” Agatha complained as Rio applied more pressure.</p><p>“Maybe you should relax and let me take care of you.” Rio suggested as she started kissing down Agatha’s body. She captured a nipple between her lips as her other hand came up to toy with her other nipple. A soft sigh left Agatha as she brought her hand up to weave into Rio’s hair.</p><p>“You win this round Vidal.” Agatha lamented as she let Rio take control.</p><p>“Good, because I want to taste you.” Rio answered as she kissed down Agatha’s stomach and pulled the woman’s panties off tossing them away before she settled between her legs. Agatha spread her legs and allowed Rio to place her hands on her thighs. Rio planted open mouth kisses up Agatha’s thigh before she hovered over her core.</p><p>“Fuck you smell so good.” Rio mumbled before she dove in. Her tongue finding Agatha’s clit quickly.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Agatha groaned as she wove her fingers into Rio’s long brown hair and gripped at the base of her skull, pulling her closer. Rio moaned into her as she drank in every sensation of Agatha. One of Rio’s hands slid up her thigh and caressed her stomach as she gripped her breast before toying with her nipple.</p><p>“Rio..” Agatha sighed as Rio swirled her tongue around Agatha’s clit. She was already so close. She felt like a coil that was so wound tight she was about to snap. Rio could feel Agatha rolling her hips and the crescendo of moans escaping her lips was definitely an indicator that Agatha was close. Rio tried to back off and give Agatha a moment to breathe but she was halted instantly.</p><p>“Don’t you dare stop.” Agatha ground out through gritted teeth. Rio decided instead to pick up the pace. Doubling down on her speed, her tongue flicking faster across Agatha’s clit, caused the woman to moan even louder as her back arched off the bed. Agatha came faster than even she expected as she felt sparks flash across her vision. The magical connection between them seemed to deepen almost instantly. Rio felt a flash of heat spread across her body as she watched Agatha cum. Agatha let her hand relax and fall to the side so Rio could breathe.</p><p>“You taste even better than I imagined.” Rio  whispered as she licked her lips.</p><p>“Goddesses above.” Agatha said as she caught her breath. She had never experienced something like that and was slowly coming down from it.</p><p>“I don’t want to make you sensitive yet. So I’m going to switch tactics.” Rio said as she kissed up Agatha’s body. She decided to slide her leg between Agatha’s and wrapped her mouth around the nipple she neglected earlier and started rolling her tongue over it softly.</p><p>“I think it’s your turn to cum darling.” Agatha whispered after she gained her bearing’s.  She slid a hand between Rio’s thigh and moved her panties to the side as she dipped her fingers into her. Rio moaned softly as she pressed her head into the crook of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Wait a second. I was doing something.” Rio panted out, grappling for control.</p><p>“And now I’m doing something.” Agatha whispered as she kissed Rio’s neck, her free hand weaving back into Rio’s hair securing Rio against her as she magicked the black lace panties away. Two fingers toyed with Rio’s folds as she rolled both of them, throwing the woman onto the bed as she slammed two fingers into her.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha.” Rio moaned out as Agatha started thrusting onto her slowly, dragging her fingers out. Rio clenched down on Agatha’s fingers, as she bit her lip trying to suppress her moans.</p><p>“Let me hear you Rio.” Agatha demanded as she dragged her fingers along her walls, finding Rio’s g-spot.</p><p>“Fuck!” Rio moaned out as Agatha started thrusting into her a little faster, curling her fingers in the process hitting her g-spot perfectly. Moans spilling from Rio’s lips as she felt her orgasm approaching.</p><p>“Good girl.” Agatha praised as she felt Rio cum, causing Rio to blush. Agatha started kissing down Rio’s body. Stopping at her hip to press a soft kiss to each poppy flower coming out of the skull before she curled her fingers soft enough to anchor Rio in place.</p><p>“What are you…ohhhhh.” Rio started to ask but was answered much sooner than she expected when Agatha wrapped her mouth around her clit. Resting her chin in the palm of her hand as she moaned against Rio’s pussy.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue was agonizingly slow against her clit matching the slowed thrusts of her fingers. Rio reached down and tried to weave her fingers into Agatha’s hair but it was still done up in a braid so she settled her hand on her hip. Agatha moaned loudly at the taste of Rio on her tongue.</p><p>“Agatha…. I need… more.” Rio whined as she tried to catch her breath. Agatha took the hint and picked up the pace of her tongue on Rio’s clit, flicking and rolling the sensitive bud.</p><p>“Yes! Goddess Yes!” Rio moaned out as she held Agatha’s hand tightly. Agatha could feel Rio clenching down on her fingers as she continued to roll her tongue across her clit. Rio’s moans pitched up as Agatha wrapped her lips around Rio’s clit and sucked softly. Rio felt her orgasm flood over her quickly, her body curling around Agatha’s head as she did.</p><p>Rio collapsed against the bed a moment later as Agatha removed her mouth from her clit. Agatha kissed along Rio’s thighs before propping herself up on her free hand so she could look “I must say you taste quite divine as well.”</p><p>Rio’s breathing was labored as Agatha started to thrust into her again. Determined to get another orgasm out of Rio she picked up the pace and started kissing up her stomach until she was able to wrap her mouth around Rio’s nipple.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha!” Rio screamed as she dug her short nails into her shoulder. Agatha gently bit down on Rio’s nipple before soothing it with her tongue again. Agatha was thrusting into her at a rapid pace, she brought her thumb up to graze her clit.</p><p>“Cum for me, I can feel how close you are.” Agatha demanded. She felt Rio clench down and gush as she came undone. Arousal coating Agatha’s hand as she continued to thrust into Rio. Moans and whimpers spilled from Rio’s lips as she rolled her hips wildly. A self satisfied moan came from Agatha as she took Rio in.</p><p>“Once I catch my breath. Your ass is mine Harkness.” Rio said as she wormed away from Agatha.</p><p>“What if I’m feeling greedy?” Agatha asked as she pulled her fingers out of Rio. Rio watched as Agatha brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked them clean. Rio felt all restraint she had left evaporate as she grabbed Agatha and flipped them over.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn to be greedy.” Rio said as she pinned Agatha to the bed. She brought both of Agatha’s hands above her head and spoke an incantation. Agatha’s hands were locked above her head. Rio paused for a moment before she looked Agatha in the eyes. “This okay?”</p><p>“Yes, I can get out if I really want to.” Agatha said as she relaxed into the bed.</p><p>“Good. Now, back to what we were doing!” Rio said excitedly as she straddled Agatha’s hips. Agatha chuckled at the woman sitting in her lap.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Taking control of the situation.” Rio answered as she scooted down and straddled one leg.</p><p>“Don’t forget that I can still take control.” Agatha reminded, which caused Rio to laugh as she slid a hand between Agatha’s legs and thrust into her. Thumb coming up to tap softly against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“How’s that Darling?” Rio asked, as Agatha let out a moan. Agatha felt the connection between them and attempted to focus on Rio. She felt herself falter with every thrust into her but she tried to focus. Eventually she managed to grasp at the thread between them and tug hard. A loud moan spilled from Rio’s lips.</p><p>“You dirty little.” Rio hissed out as she doubled down, thrusting into Agatha as she curled her fingers, thumb sliding against her clit. She leaned forward and captured her lips in a passionate kiss. Tongues wrapping around each other as the two women moaned into the kiss. Rio relentlessly thrusting into Agatha, she could feel the woman clench down on her fingers and gush.</p><p>“Fuck yes! Rio!” Agatha screamed as she broke the kiss and slammed her head into the pillow. Rio took the opportunity to kiss down the side of Agatha’s neck and suck on her collar bone, leaving a deep purple bruise as she continued to fuck Agatha into the bed. Agatha tumbled over the edge, she felt herself clench down and her body shake as she orgasmed.</p><p>“Good girl.” Rio praised, as Agatha huffed, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>“Hey that’s my line.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Can you handle another orgasm or are you spent?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I can keep up.”</p><p>“Good, let’s find out if you actually can.” Rio said as she slid down Agatha’s body and settled between her legs. Rio slid her tongue between Agatha’s folds and found her clit again as she curled her fingers inside of Agatha.</p><p>“No… Fair…fuck. Using… oh goddesses. my tricks against me.” Agatha moaned out, sparks flying behind her eyes as Rio continued to thrust into her. Rio’s tongue softly swirled around Agatha’s clit. Agatha’s clit was sensitive and she was barrel rolling toward another orgasm. Agatha felt herself flush as heat tore through her before she felt herself come undone.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop her thrusts or tongues unrelenting pace. She continued to fuck Agatha through her orgasm, Agatha thrashed at the restraints as she tumbled over the edge again. All the air left Agatha’s lungs as her mouth fell open in a silent scream. Her magical restraints snapping as she arched off the bed. Hands soon found purchase at the back of Rio’s head and tugged lightly, trying to pull Rio’s mouth away from her clit weakly. Air finally returned to Agatha’s lungs after a long moment.</p><p>“Tapping out?” Rio asked as she pulled her mouth away and started kissing Agatha’s thighs. Rio kept her fingers buried deep inside Agatha.</p><p>“My clit is sensitive.” Agatha said as she played with Rio’s hair.</p><p>“That’s fair.” Rio answered as she slid up Agatha’s body. She kept her fingers inside her as she settled against her side. “If I don’t touch your clit do you think you could give me one more?”</p><p>“Damn you are greedy.” Agatha joked again as she felt Rio start to curl her fingers again.</p><p>“You have no idea.” Rio husked out as she started to thrust into Agatha again. Agatha turned her head and kissed the top of Rio’s as she played with her hair.</p><p>“I think I’m starting… to get one.” Agatha gasped out as she felt herself clench down on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>“One more, that’s all I want.” Rio requested. Which caused Agatha to huff slightly before Rio hit the perfect spot inside her. Agatha’s hips shot off the bed as Rio picked up the pace. Moans spilled from Agatha’s lips as she felt herself creeping toward orgasm. She could feel her whole body start to shake as Rio scooted down and captured her nipple in her mouth. Her tongue swirling around it softly as she sucked on the sensitive bud.</p><p>“Fuck! Rio!” Agatha screamed out as she came, her back arching off the bed. She felt herself gush and a flush covered her face as Rio let out a satisfied moan.</p><p>“Perfect. Exactly what I wanted from you.” Rio praised. Agatha felt like she was about to black out from the overwhelming sensations Rio was giving her. Rio withdrew her fingers and settled her hand on Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“I’m tapping out. You win.” Agatha whispered after she finally caught her breath. Rio softly laughed as she settled next to Agatha, nestled safely against her side. Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder and pressed a soft kiss to the side of the woman’s beast.</p><p>“One could argue that you’re the winner here Agatha.” Rio said with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“Are you still horny? If so come sit on my face. I don’t have the energy to move.”</p><p>“Maybe in a minute. I’m comfortable.” Rio mumbled sleepily. Agatha magicked the sheets clean and then a blanket over them before she cuddled closer to Rio and kissed the woman softly on the head.</p><p>“Goodnight Rio.” Agatha said as she Rand her fingers through Rio’s hair softly, playing with the long brown tresses.</p><p>“Te Veo Agatha.” Rio mumbled, already drifting off to sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up at her normal time and smiled softly at the woman in her arms. Rio was still there. Sleeping with her back pressed against her side and her arms wrapped around Agatha’s.  Agatha managed to wiggle her way out of Rio’s grasp. She quickly made her way to the bath room and used it before grabbing a baggy tee and threw it on.</p><p>She quietly made her way out into the kitchen and grabbed her phone off the countertop where she left it last night to check it. She had several emails that didn’t matter much and one text message.</p><p>Wanda 7:30 a.m: I see someone’s car is still parked in your driveway! 👀</p><p>Agatha 7:44 a.m: you are insufferable.</p><p>Agatha groaned, why did she have to live right next door to her best friend! The woman was absolutely insufferable sometimes. Agatha sighed and started cooking breakfast for her and Rio.</p><p>Wanda 7:50 a.m: Was it good? Did you have fun? I need all the details.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at Wanda’s antics and sighed loudly as she flipped the French toast that she was cooking.</p><p>Agatha 7:51 a.m: That’s it. I’m moving.</p><p>Wanda 7:52 a.m: wow, I didn’t think she’d be that good of a fuck that you’d want to U-Haul with her.</p><p>Agatha 7:52 a.m: I’m blocking you! Bye forever!</p><p>Agatha sighed as she set her phone down and started focusing on cooking. Her phone kept buzzing on the counter top and she ignored it. She finished cooking breakfast and plated it up along with two cups of coffee, syrup and silverware on a tray.</p><p>~</p><p>Rio woke up in bed alone. She could smell something sweet in the air as she sat up and looked around the room. She decided to venture out into the kitchen to see what Agatha was cooking. As she opened the bedroom door Agatha was standing there holding a tray of food.</p><p>“Good morning sleepy head. Thanks for getting the door for me.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“That smells amazing.” Rio said as she stepped aside and let Agatha into the bedroom.</p><p>“I was hoping to bring you breakfast in bed.” Agatha said as she walked over to the bed and set the tray down.</p><p>“Sorry. I spoiled the surprise.” Rio said as she followed the woman. “Point me in the direction of the bathroom?” Rio asked.</p><p>“That door over there, come join me when you’re done.” Agatha said as she climbed back into bed. Rio quickly ran into the bathroom and used it while Agatha settled into bed.</p><p>When Rio emerged from the bathroom a few moments later Agatha was sitting cross legged on the bed holding a cup of coffee in her hands, sipping it. Rio walked around the bed and climbed in next to Agatha.</p><p>“What did you make?” Rio asked as she checked out the platter of food.</p><p>“Scrambled eggs, French toast, bacon, and some fresh cut cantaloupe.” Agatha said as she slid the tray over to Rio.</p><p>“Looks and smells amazing. Thank you.” Rio said as she picked up the syrup and poured some on her French toast before picking up the knife and fork to cut it up. Agatha watched as Rio took a bite. Rio’s head snapped to look at Agatha with wide eyes as she chewed.</p><p>“Good isn’t it?” Agatha asked with a satisfied smirk. She pulled the tray closer and started eating her own food.</p><p>“That’s it. You’re stuck with me.” Rio said as she grabbed the other cup of coffee and took a drink.</p><p>“Oh? I am?” Agatha said mirthfully as she watched Rio.</p><p>“If that’s allowed?” Rio asked, even though both women knew they had sunk their claws in deep and neither was willing to let go.</p><p>“I think I’ll keep you around a little longer.” Agatha joked before she leaned over and gave Rio a soft kiss on the cheek. Agatha took a moment to look over Rio who was still naked. She wasn’t kidding when she told Agatha that she had a few more floating around. Rio had vines creeping up her right arm. She had deadly nightshade tattooed on her left shoulder as well.</p><p>“Not that I’m complaining but would you like something to wear?” Agatha asked as she raked her eyes over Rio’s body.</p><p>“Nah, I’m quite comfortable right here. Just like this” Rio said as she leaned back a little and presented her breasts to Agatha.</p><p>“Stop or I’ll pin you down and dress you myself.” Agatha scolded, she could feel the arousal from last night rear its head again.</p><p>“What if I want you to pin me down?” Rio flirted. Agatha shook her head and waved her hand. A large soft tee shirt suddenly appeared on Rio with a puff of purple smoke.</p><p>“Hey! Wait a second!” Rio complained.</p><p>“Eat your breakfast before I spend the rest of my morning eating you.” Agatha said with a smirk. Rio sat there shocked for a moment before she turned back to her breakfast and started eating.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Rio said after she finished another bite of food.</p><p>“Good. Do you have any plans for today?” Agatha asked her.</p><p>“I should check my phone and see if anything’s being delivered to the store today but other than that, no.” Rio said as she waved her hand and her phone appeared in it. She pressed a few buttons while picking up a piece of bacon and eating it.</p><p>“Wanda is already being insufferable today. So I should check my phone again.” Agatha said with a sigh as she finished eating her French toast.</p><p>“How so?” Rio asked as she took another bite of her food.</p><p>“Oh just making observations obnoxiously.” Agatha said as she made her phone appear and checked it once more.</p><p>Wanda 7:53 a.m: Noooooooo don’t ignore me!</p><p>Wanda 7:53 a.m: Come on Agatha! I want details! Pleaseeeee!</p><p>Wanda 7:54 a.m: I’m clocking in, if you don’t answer me by tonight I’m barging into your house and demanding you tell me everything.</p><p>“Here, read what she had to say.” Agatha said as she handed Rio her phone to read the messages from this morning. Rio read the messages and shook her head at Agatha’s best friend.</p><p>“Can I answer her?” Rio asked.</p><p>“If you want. I don’t care.” Agatha said passively.</p><p>Agatha 8:35 a.m: Agatha handed me her phone so I’m gunna answer you for her. Agatha was the best fuck I’ve ever had in my life.- Rio</p><p>“You can decide if you want to send it, but it’s the truth.” Rio said as she handed Agatha her phone back. Agatha didn’t even look at her phone before she hit send and set it aside.</p><p>“I don’t need to read it. Let’s finish breakfast.” Agatha said as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>“I think you should, but I agree let’s finish breakfast.” Rio said as she dug into her food, finishing it before it got too cold. Agatha had eaten most of her food and set it aside while she drank her coffee. She grabbed her phone and took a look at the text.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha asked in shock.</p><p>“What I said it wasn’t a lie.” Rio said with a shrug, before taking a drink.</p><p>“Just wait until I use a strap on you.” Agatha said right after she took a sip. Rio almost spit her drink out but to her merit she held it together well.</p><p>“You can’t just say things like that while someone’s drinking Agatha!” Rio scolded.</p><p>“Oh? Why’s that Rio?” Agatha teased softly as she leaned forward and ran her hand up Rio’s back before she spread her hand and slid it into her hair softly scratching the back of Rio’s head. Rio hummed softly as she leaned into Agatha’s touch.</p><p>“You’ve found my weakness, stop exploiting it.” Rio whined out.</p><p>“Never.” Agatha whispered softly as she tugged on Rio’s hair, making the woman moan softly.</p><p>“We aren’t going anywhere today if you keep that up.” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“Oh? Did you have something planned?” Agatha asked as she let Rio’s hair fall from her fingers.</p><p>“No… ” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“How about a nice hot shower first? Then we can decide what we want to do.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“You are going to be the death of me.” Rio groaned as she set her coffee cup down.</p><p>“I doubt it.” Agatha reassured before she got up and collected her clothing that had been strewn about the night before, bending over to give Rio a show. She didn’t bother with panties this morning when she got up.</p><p>Rio felt drool pool in her mouth at the sight of Agatha’s ass presented to her. She could see a peak of pink folds as well. She swallowed audibly as she watched the woman in front of her.  Agatha walked over to the hamper and put her clothing in it before walking into the bathroom and starting the shower.</p><p>“You coming?” Agatha asked as she peaked out the door.</p><p>“I… uh… Yes.” Rio said as she scrambled out of bed and rushed into the bathroom. Throwing the shirt Agatha put on her off in her haste. Agatha was climbing into the shower when Rio rushed in.</p><p>“It’s just a shower Rio.” Agatha said with a smirk as she climbed in. Rio quickly followed suit. Agatha was already under the water with her eyes closed and her head tilted back, soaking her long hair.</p><p>“Stunning.” Rio whispered to herself.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked as she opened her eyes and looked at Rio.</p><p>“Nothing, just admiring the view.” Rio flirted.</p><p>“You are ridiculous.” Agatha said as she stepped out from under the stream and allowed Rio to step under it.</p><p>“That maybe true but I’ve never seen anything more beautiful than you.” Rio answered as she slid under the water and started wetting her hair. Agatha sighed and rolled her eyes as she grabbed a bottle of shampoo and poured some into her hand before she started lathering her hair, scrubbing her scalp.</p><p>“Charm has already gotten you into my bed, no need to keep laying it on so thick.” Agatha said as she leaned forward and kissed Rio softly on the lips. They switched positions and Agatha started rinsing her hair out as Rio washed hers.</p><p>“I think I should be laying it on thicker. Now that I’ve got you, I don’t want to let you go. I’m addicted.” Rio told Agatha, who just smiled softly and rolled her eyes at the woman.</p><p>“Goddesses Above what have I gotten myself into?” Agatha asked as she stepped aside so Rio could rinse her own hair.</p><p>“Hopefully the best thing that’s ever happened to us.” Rio said with a smile as she started to rinse her hair out. Agatha almost melted at that, the thought of Rio being her forever almost was too much for her heart.</p><p>“I have a feeling you could be the end of me.” Agatha said as she stepped closer to Rio and kissed her softly.</p><p>“I’ll make sure that never happens.” Rio reassured as she kissed her back.</p><p>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep Rio.” Agatha said honestly before she stepped back and grabbed her conditioner and poured a generous amount into her hand and worked it into her hair. She let it sit while she magicked a couple wash cloths into the shower and wet one down so she could wash her face.</p><p>“I always keep my promises Agatha.” Rio said with a tone that left no room for argument. Agatha rolled her eyes again and started washing her face, Rio stepped aside so Agatha could rinse her face and hair. Rio conditioned her hair and took the washcloth from Agatha so she could wash her face as well.</p><p>“What do you want to do today?” Agatha asked as she grabbed another wash cloth and wet it before she grabbed some soap and worked it into a lather so she could wash herself. They switched positions so Rio could rinse the conditioner out and wash her face off. Rio paused for a long moment.</p><p>“Honestly, anything. I just want to spend as much time with you as I can. I feel like I won’t see you until Sunday if I’m lucky.” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“I could hang out at the book store on Saturdays if I’m not working.” Agatha offered as she scrubbed her body. Rio switched with Agatha again and allowed her to rinse off so she could wash herself.</p><p>“No, you need time to get things done.” Rio said trying to give Agatha the space she’d need.</p><p>“What if I want to?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I won’t stop you. You are welcome there whenever you want. Turn around let me wash your back.” Rio said as she took the rag from Agatha who turned around and Rio washed her back softly before she slid her other hand down and grabbed her ass.</p><p>“Hey, behave. We are trying to get clean, not end up all sweaty and gross again.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Couldn’t help myself.” Rio said as she removed her hands from Agatha and started washing herself. Agatha shook her head and rinsed off the rest of the way before she slipped out of the shower.</p><p>She grabbed a towel and wrapped it around herself before she wrapped her hair up in a second one. She made her way out into the bedroom and grabbed two pairs of sweatpants and a couple baggy tee shirts along with a bra and panties and got dressed before Rio emerged from the bathroom.</p><p>“I was too slow.” Rio said with a pout.</p><p>“You’ll be fine. Here you can borrow these if you want.” Agatha said as she offered Rio some of her favorite lounge clothing.</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio said as she bent over and grabbed her panties off the floor she wore last night and inspected them. With a flourish of purple magic they were clean. “And thank you. I really need to read more of your spell book so I can learn these things.” Rio said as she slipped on the panties.</p><p>“Might be a little difficult to translate to earth magic, but you are more than welcome to give it a shot.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’d argue that spirit witches have it the easiest but I know how exiled you all are.” Rio said honestly as she started to get dressed.</p><p>“Let’s not get too deep into familial drama and exile today.” Agatha told her trying to keep her voice from getting that cold bite it always did when it came to how her mother treated her when she found out she was a spirit witch.</p><p>“Didn’t mean to touch a nerve.” Rio said softly, as she walked over to Agatha and took her in her arms. Agatha looked away from Rio so used one finger to force Agatha to look at her. “I know you’re not a monster.”</p><p>“Tell that to the rest of the world.” Agatha said brokenly.</p><p>“We all know that it’s not something that can be stopped. Siphoning that is.”</p><p>“It can be, but it takes an outside force.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Curiosity getting the better of Rio.</p><p>“This is about to get deep, I don’t want to scare you away.” Agatha said as tears filled her eyes.</p><p>“Just tell me. You won’t scare me off.” Rio reassured as she pulled Agatha closer.</p><p>“When I was 16 I discovered I was a spirit witch… My mother didn’t take it well. She planned to execute me. The whole coven banned together to overwhelm me with their magic and basically fry me. The only reason I am still standing is because Wanda and her twin brother Pietro interfered with their plans. He quickly knocked them out as Wanda undid my bounds and helped me escape. If they hadn’t arrived when they did I would’ve killed my entire coven. I could feel their lives slipping away as I took every ounce of magic they had. I haven’t spoken to my mother in almost 20 years because of it.” Agatha said as tears spilled from her eyes.</p><p>“If they had died, it would have been their own fault, listen to me when I say this. It’s a survival mechanism. You are a very powerful witch with a special gift. Never let someone’s stupidity and ignorance hinder your mental health. Your magic only siphons when you are attacked. That means you cannot be held accountable. It’s their fault if they didn’t know the risks before they did something so stupid.” Rio reassured as she rubbed Agatha’s arms reassuringly.</p><p>“You are far more educated about spirit witches than most.” Agatha said in a watery tone.</p><p>“I like learning about misunderstood things.” Rio said as she kissed Agatha, who melted into the kiss.</p><p>“Careful, if you keep being so understanding and sweet I’ll fall in love with you.” Agatha said with a choked sob. She felt her walls cracking.</p><p>“That would be ideal.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Okay enough trauma dumping! Let’s not think about how fucked up my life is.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“So Wanda’s got a twin brother?” Rio asked</p><p>“Yeah, he’s a speedster, literally. Their father is a mutant, their mother is a witch. So he’s got super speed, and Wanda is well… chaos incarnate.” Agatha said as she stepped out of Rio’s grasp.</p><p>“Most scarlet witches are, she’s found balance with you.” Rio reassured, she knew how magic had checks and balances.  Agatha laughed a weak laugh.</p><p>“Now that is funny. That we balance each other out.”</p><p>“I think I should send her flowers as a thank you for taking care of you until I arrived.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Don’t, she’ll get an even bigger ego.” Agatha said in a serious tone, before softening. “Plus, you might make me jealous.”</p><p>“Oh we can’t have that.” Rio said softly as she kissed Agatha once more. “Now come on, I wanna take you somewhere.”</p><p>“Oh? Where’s that?” Agatha asked as Rio broke away and grabbed her hand as she dragged her toward the bedroom door. .</p><p>“It’s a surprise.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Let me grab some socks…” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“No need. We don’t need shoes where we are going.” Rio said as she opened a portal at the door.</p><p>“Now I’m impressed.” Agatha said as she inspected the swirling green portal.</p><p>“Hey, you can’t be the only impressive one in this relationship.” Rio said with a smile, her nose crinkling cutely as she did. She stepped through the portal and guided Agatha through it.</p><p>They stepped into a lush green forest. The world was quiet except for the sounds of birds and nature. In the distance Agatha could see a trail of smoke.</p><p>“Where are we?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“My favorite place.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Specifically where is that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“A forest in Washington. The cabin is a family cabin. Don’t worry. We are alone.” Rio said as she guided Agatha toward the cabin.</p><p>“The whole forest is alive with magic.” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“That is what happens when your family puts their roots in deep. We’ve been a part of this forest since magic was born.”</p><p>“I guess I should ask the hard question… how old are you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Will my age be a deal breaker?” Rio asked as she guided Agatha up wooden steps.</p><p>“No, I just wanna know what I’m getting into.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’m 35. Still a witchlett like you, in terms of age at least.” Rio answered.</p><p>“So… you are…”</p><p>“A child of the original green witch bloodline. A direct descendant.” Rio explained as she pressed her hand on the door frame, the sigils flashing a bright green. “Come here, touch this sigil for me” Rio asked as she pointed at the sigil she just touched.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and placed her hand on the sigil, she felt a rush of magic that felt very similar to Rio’s rush over her. It felt ancient and ever spanning, then something shifted inside Agatha and she felt something warm settle in her chest.</p><p>“Good, you didn’t die.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“That was a possibility?” Agatha asked in shock.</p><p>“For you? No. But it has happened.” Rio said with a shrug as she opened the door.</p><p>“I need an explanation.” Agatha said as she followed Rio into the cabin.</p><p>“If you aren’t magically compatible with your partner the sigil protecting the house will disperse you and take your magic.”</p><p>“Oh? Is the house a spirit witch?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“No, but the original one carved these sigils into the door frame.”</p><p>“You’re joking.”</p><p>“My great grandmother would be offended. Every family has to have a black sheep. For us it was a spirit witch. A blip of purple in a sea of green.” Rio said as she guided Agatha over to the couch. She sat down before pulling her down onto the soft cushions.</p><p>“Is she still alive?” Agatha asked as she settled next to Rio. She’s never met any of the other five spirit witches in the United States, and would like to meet at least one. But most Spirit witches had a tendency to be recluses.</p><p>“She isn’t. But her spell book is around here somewhere. I’ll ask my mother next time I see her where it is.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I’d love to see it but, only if your mother is comfortable sharing that with me.” Agatha answered before looking around the cabin. The lush green of outside had worked its way into the large open room. Plants creeped up the walls and dotted themselves everywhere. It felt so soft, to be sitting in a room that Rio was grown in.</p><p>“I’m sure she will be. I think she’ll be excited to meet you one day.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Yeah, most mothers aren’t excited to hear their child is dating a spirit witch.” Agatha said with an eye roll.</p><p>“My mother won’t care that you are a spirit witch, or a woman, about anything people would consider you “horrible” for. Trust me. When you meet her you’ll understand.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I don’t know what any of that means.”</p><p>“It means, that my mother loves with her whole being. She’s literally incapable of hating anyone I swear.” Rio said as she shoved her shoulder against Agatha’s.</p><p>“There’s a first time for everything.” Agatha said pessimistically.</p><p>“You know she knows you exist right? Like she’s aware that you are here with me. That the cabin accepted you. She hasn’t flown in the door in a mad rage and she won’t.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Thanks. Sorry, I get like this when my mother is brought up. It’s floating around still, all that fear and anxiety.” Agatha said honestly as she wrung her fingers, suddenly missing her rings.</p><p>“I don’t claim to know how that felt, and I never will. But I’ll be here for you on your bad days and good days. Besides, look at what all that rain and thunder did. You blossomed into one of the most amazing witches I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting.” Rio reassured as she brought a hand up to tuck a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“Stop being romantic, I’m gunna cry.” Agatha said as tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>“Okay, okay. I’ll take a chill pill on the sappy shit. But seriously. You are amazing.” Rio said before kissing Agatha softly.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you bring all your dates here.” Agatha joked trying to dissolve the tension.</p><p>“Only hot raven haired goddesses with stunning blue eyes, that fuck like their life depends on it.”</p><p>“Hard to believe you’ve met multiple women like that.” Agatha jabbed.</p><p>“No, just one.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“What did I say about being sappy!” Agatha scolded as she turned her head.</p><p>“Sorry. I can’t help but compliment you.” Rio whispered as she kissed Agatha on the cheek.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say to that so I’m just gunna change the subject.” Agatha said before she turned to kiss Rio passionately. Rio gladly accepted the kiss and returned it  with as much care and passion as she could muster. They broke apart a moment later with their foreheads pressed together.</p><p>“Why did you bring me here Rio?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“You shared a part of you with me, I figured I could return the favor.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“This is much nicer than my trauma dump earlier.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Yes, that is true. But I want to know every part of your life, the good and bad. No one is perfect…. And I’m being sappy again. Sorry. I just want to get to know you.” Rio said as she trailed off.</p><p>“I want to know the good and bad about you too. Now tell me something bad.” Agatha said as she steeled her gaze at the woman.</p><p>“Like my deepest darkest secret? Or like something no one ever wants to hear?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Either one.” Agatha said. Rio sighed loudly and turned away from Agatha, as she looked at the fireplace. The wood crackling loudly as Rio debated with herself.</p><p>“I’m next in line to take my family’s mantel. Which means, when the current standing entity of death is ready to retire I will take their place. It could be tomorrow, or it could be a thousand years from now.” Rio said honestly, she couldn’t look at Agatha for this even if she wanted to. She took a deep breath and sighed loudly before continuing “If that’s a deal breaker I get it.”</p><p>“Why would something that could never happen bother me?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It could happen at any point.” Rio said solemnly.</p><p>“So? When you take your place, you don’t die. You live on as death. I assume you’d have to handle business but if I’m still alive you can visit me can’t you?”</p><p>“I don’t have any answers.”</p><p>“I have faith that we will figure it out if it ever comes to that point.”  Agatha said as she leaned forward and rubbed Rio’s back reassuringly.</p><p>“You are being sappy now.”  Rio said as she shook her head.</p><p>“Just giving you a taste of your own medicine.” Agatha said as she tugged on Rio’s arm, encouraging her to come back into Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“You’re not freaked out by this?” Rio asked as she settled into Agatha’s embrace.</p><p>“Nothing more ironic than a spirit witch dating the embodiment of death. Even if they are in their gestation period.” Agatha reassured softly.</p><p>“The universe has a sense of humor. That’s for sure.” Rio said with a chuckle as she kissed Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“What do you want to do for the rest of the day?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I should probably take you home, then head home myself.” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“Yeah we aren’t doing that.” Agatha said as she pulled Rio in closer.</p><p>“But.”</p><p>“No, no buts. We are gunna stay right here for a little while, then we will head back to my place and I’ll make us lunch, then if you want to go home you can. But right now. In this moment. I’m going to hold you, and we are going to be just fine.” Agatha said cutting Rio off before she had a chance to complain. Then she placed a soft kiss on Rio’s head as they sat together, simply just enjoying this moment together.</p>

<p>A few hours later they were back at Agatha’s place relaxing in the living room after eating a late lunch.</p><p>“Why didn’t you run?” Rio asked.</p><p>“What’s there to run from? Death? She comes for us all.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“You fascinate me Agatha Harkness.” Rio said as she looked at the woman in awe.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Most people would run the second they knew what I told you.”</p><p>“I’m not most people. If anything I know how it feels to be an outcast for something you have no control over. Why would I shy away from you for something that has been decided long before we ever met? You didn’t shy away from me when you found out I was a spirit witch.”</p><p>“I don’t know… I just expected you to run.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“It’s gunna take a lot more than that to scare me off.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I don’t think I could if I tried.” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“Probably not.” Agatha answered. They sat comfortably on the couch together for a few moments longer when Agatha’s front door opened.</p><p>“Bitch! How fucking dare you ignore me!” Wanda yelled into the house as she walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge. She pulled the spaghetti out of the fridge. She took the lid off the container and tossed it in the microwave to warm it up.</p><p>“Hi Wanda, how was work? Did you have a good day?” Agatha yelled from the couch.</p><p>“Great! Except the last text I got was from my best friends girlfriend!” There was a small pause as Wanda noticed the flowers in the countertop. “Oh! Hey these are fucking stunning, I would’ve loved to have gotten a photo of them yesterday!” Wanda said sassily.</p><p>“I’m your girlfriend?” Rio whispered quietly Agatha shrugged at Rio and made a face that said ‘fuck if I know!’</p><p>“My girlfriend?” Agatha yelled back at Wanda who was standing in front of the microwave. The microwave beeped and Wanda took the container out and grabbed a fork before heading toward the living room.</p><p>“Yeah, the cute bookstore owner. The one that said you were the best fuck of her life.” Wanda said as she walked into the living room with the food. Shoving a bite into her mouth as she looked up to see Agatha sitting on the couch with a smile on her face and Rio cuddled into her side.</p><p>“Oh… you’re still here…” Wanda said though a mouthful of food. She quickly chewed her food before swallowing and glaring at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh? So you can notice my car sitting in the driveway this morning but not when you barge in to get yourself food?” Rio jabbed back.</p><p>“I was starving! Tunnel vision is a real thing, plus no one said I was observant.” Wanda said as she walked over to the two women, and plopped down in the armchair next to the couch.</p><p>“That’s for sure.” Agatha goaded.</p><p>“Don’t you start with me! I’m still pissed at you.” Wanda said as she pointed a fork at Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t be. She let me send that text, then I distracted her with a little trip somewhere. Blame me.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Nah, I’m still gunna blame her.” Wanda said with a wink toward Rio.</p><p>“Look, I’m sorry I’ve been distracted. I’ll type up a book for you describing in detail everything but the sex tonight. I promise.”</p><p>“Good, because you are fucking killing me! How dare you! I tell you about all my horrible dates and you go on one perfect date and all of a sudden I’m chopped liver?” Wanda asked in an annoyed tone as she shoved another bite of food into her mouth.</p><p>“You do realize that you are technically interrupting that date right?” Agatha asked with a chuckrle.</p><p>“That’s another thing! How gay do you have to be to make a date longer than eight hours? I’ve never even been on a date that lasted more than four!” Wanda complained.</p><p>“About that… women just like spending quality time together. You should give it a shot, you’d be surprised how long a lesbian date lasts.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Find me a girl and I’ll gladly give it a shot.” Wanda said sarcastically.</p><p>“Challenge accepted.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“She can’t be serious can she?” Wanda asked Agatha.</p><p>“I’m afraid to say you’ve sealed your own fate. She’s pretty stubborn and very determined when she wants to be” Agatha told Wanda, who was shoveling another bite of spaghetti into her mouth. Wanda just rolled her eyes.</p><p>“How could you possibly know that?” Wanda asked after she swallowed her food.</p><p>“Because I am. Because I get what I want.” Rio said in a tone that left no room for argument.</p><p>“And she’s confident too! You are fucked Harkness.” Wanda said before she stuffed her face with the last bite of spaghetti and got up to take the container back to the kitchen.</p><p>“Thanks for dinner!” Wanda said as she walked away.  She tossed the container, its lid and the fork she was using in the sink before she walked back out the door. Shutting it loudly on her way out.</p><p>“Chaos Witch is an understatement.” Rio said as she watched the front door shut.</p><p>“Yeah, but I wouldn’t trade her for the world.” Agatha said as she watched her best friend walk by her front window toward her own home.</p><p>“I should probably head home as well, even though I really don’t want to.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“We can text, and you can call me. I should probably tackle work emails and clean…” Agatha said as she stood up and helped Rio up as well.</p><p>“I will return these on Sunday.” Rio said referring to the clothing she was wearing.</p><p>“Your stuff is sitting on the bed folded. It’s not clean but at least it’s folded.” Agatha said as she walked over to her bedroom door and opened it.</p><p>“I’m not going in there.” Rio said as she stood firmly in place.</p><p>“Afraid you’re going to get distracted again?” Agatha asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Afraid? No. Worried that my self control is paper thin and I’ll end up staying the night again…” Rio said as she watched Agatha grab her clothing off the bed and stood there stubbornly.</p><p>“Would that be so bad?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, not at all! But…” Rio fumbled looking for the right words.</p><p>“I get it. Sorry.” Agatha said as she walked out to the living room and handed Rio her clothing.</p><p>“No, I don’t think you do… but that’s okay.” Rio said as she took the clothing with one arm and then rubbed her eyes trying to find the right words.</p><p>“It’s just that I’m so attracted to you, and this is so easy. I’m afraid of how much tomorrow and the rest of this week will suck if I don’t leave now.” Rio said softly as she magicked her book and keys into her hands.</p><p>“I feel like it’s going to suck no matter what.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’m going to kiss you one more time and then I’m going back to my apartment with all my plants.” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“You better make it two.” Agatha joked as she kissed the woman softly, Rio chuckled as she kissed Agatha back. Agatha brought her hand up to weave into Rio’s hair as she smiled into the kiss before deepening it. A soft moan left Rio as she kissed her passionately.</p><p>“Stop playing dirty.” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Never.” Agatha husked out as she tugged softly on Rio’s hair. Another moan slipped out of Rio as Agatha captured her lips again in a passionate kiss. Rio felt her resolve start to crumble slowly.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio groaned out as she broke the kiss.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha trailed off as she started to kiss down the side of her neck.</p><p>“I should just teleport home…” Rio said trying to focus.</p><p>“Oh? That’s an option?” Agatha teased, knowing it always was but she likes frustrating Rio.</p><p>“Right now it is! Goddesses woman!” Rio said in a frustrated tone.</p><p>“The only goddess I care about right now is you.” Agatha praised as she pulled Rio closer.</p><p>“Seriously.  Agatha… I’m too weak for this.” Rio whined.</p><p>“I just wanted to get you riled up before I send you home so you wouldn’t forget about me.” Agatha said honestly before stepping back.</p><p>“Evil! Pure evil!” Rio complained with a playful glare.</p><p>“I thought you knew that.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“You are so mean.” Rio whined as she huffed and made her way to the front door.</p><p>“I know. Be safe. Please let me know when you get home.”</p><p>“I will. I promise. Te Veo Agatha.” Rio said as she turned around and gave Agatha another kiss on the lips before she slipped out the door.</p><p>Agatha watched from the door as Rio got in her car and pulled out the driveway. Agatha sighed sadly as she brought her phone into her hand and walked over to the couch and sat down to check her emails.</p><p>“Junk, junk, junk and more junk. Wow Pepper, not a single email?” Agatha asked as she looked at her phone.  Agatha sighed and got up to grab a book from the pile she bought the other day.</p><p>“Might as well read something to keep myself busy.” Agatha said as she grabbed one of the books before going back to the couch. She plopped down on the couch and opened the book so she could start reading. The front door slammed back open a moment later and Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“And another thing!” Wanda yelled as she walked back into the living room.</p><p>“Shut the fucking door Wanda!” Agatha scolded. Wanda paused and turned back around to shut the door. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Tell me everything, right now.” Wanda demanded.</p><p>“You couldn’t even wait 10 minutes after she left?” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“You literally were on a date for over twenty four hours… how did you two not run out of things to talk about?”</p><p>“Because we talked about everything… She knows… about my mother…”</p><p>“Oh fuck, and she stuck around?” Wanda asked softly, her demeanor changing instantly. She got up from the chair and moved over to the couch to hug Agatha.</p><p>“She isn’t afraid of me. She actually knows how this works, and understands how misunderstood spirit witches are.” Agatha explained as she let Wanda wrap her arms around her and hold her close.</p><p>“That’s surprising.” Wanda said before she continued. “Mental health check though. You good?”</p><p>“I’m great.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“So where did she take you this morning?” Wanda asked as she let Agatha go and settled next to her.</p><p>“Her family’s cabin.” Agatha said vaguely.</p><p>“There’s something you aren’t telling me.” Wanda pried.</p><p>“It’s not for me to tell. Please respect that. If Rio wants you to know she will tell you.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I can accept that. So tell me. How good was it?” Wanda begged.</p><p>“She ate me out. A few times.” Agatha said happily. Wanda sat there quietly for a long moment. Her mouth opening and closing as she tried to collect her thoughts.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Wanda said in shock, her brain seeming to malfunction completely.</p><p>“Is that not what you were asking about?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“I mean we have a few things to cover before we get to the activities last night.. like for example. How did you make your spell book invisible to me?”</p><p>“Rio has an incantation in her book I found and tested. It works. Sorry I used you as the confirmation bias.” Agatha said.</p><p>“Honestly, I would’ve done the same.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“What do you want to know?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I don’t want to know anything specifically. But! I do want to hear you say. ‘Wanda you were right, she is my type.’ That would be music to my ears.”</p><p>“Wanda you were right, she is my type. Also severely helps that we have magical compatibility.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“What the fuck is that?” Wanda asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Magical compatibility is when your magic reacts with another persons. Intertwining and creating a deep connection. Well from what I’ve learned…”Agatha explained.</p><p>“What does it do?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Well.. we’ve been playing with it a little. Right now the best way I can explain it is.. I can feel this tether to her. I can grab it and pull on it, but if I focus I can see the shape of her in my mind. I can reach out and touch her and she can feel it and vise versa.”</p><p>“So…” Wanda drawled out thinking about what Agatha said. “You tested it in a dirty way didn’t you?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I mean there’s something about the connection that does lead to arousal.” Agatha explained, then her phone pinged next to her. She grabbed the phone and looked at it.</p><p>5:30 p.m: I made it home. Here’s the photo I took before you arrived at the book store yesterday. Attachment Image.</p><p>5:31 p.m: thank you, you’ll never guess who’s back here already… I’ll text you soon.</p><p>“Here, Rio was kind enough to send me the photo she took of our date before I arrived.” Agatha said handing Wanda the phone. Wanda’s jaw dropped as she looked at the photo.</p><p>“This is literally like a scene from a movie. Fuck, she’s romantic.” Wanda lamented.</p><p>“You have no idea.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“So in the span of a weekend, you’ve met what is essentially your magical soulmate, had an amazing first date, got laid, learned a new spell, and got flowers? Fuck you Harkness.” Wanda said as she handed Agatha her phone back.</p><p>“Honestly before this past weekend I’d never heard of it before myself.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“I didn’t even think it was possible!” Wanda complained.</p><p>“I do wonder what else our connection can do but that’s something we need to work on.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“My brain hurts.” Wanda whined as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“Literally or metaphorically?”  Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Both.” Wanda stated, with a wave of her hand Agatha eliminated her headache.</p><p>“Thank you. Now… We can talk about how good the sex was.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“Phenomenal.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I can’t believe you let her eat you out.” Wanda said in a baffled tone.</p><p>“Hey…. It’s not that I’ve never allowed women to do it… It’s more that I’ve exhausted them before they got the chance.” Agatha said with a blush.</p><p>“I just think it was you were afraid of that deep intimate connection.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“Oh fuck you, no it’s not that. I wasn’t kidding about it when I said I’d fuck them to sleep.” Agatha said with an eye roll.</p><p>“I’m inclined to believe you based off the text Rio sent me this morning.” Wanda said softly.</p><p>“Anything else you must know?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nah. Wanna hear about my date with Jacob?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Anything note worthy?”</p><p>“Not really, I haven’t dated a woman since college. Maybe I should give it another shot…” Wanda said thoughtfully.</p><p>“I mean I know you are attracted to women. You could always give it a shot. Jen and Alice seem pretty happy together. I have Rio… tentatively. So maybe you should come join the rainbow brigade again.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“If your girlfriend finds me a date I’ll humor it.” Wanda said with a nudge to her shoulder.</p><p>“She’s not my girlfriend…” Agatha said simply because they hadn’t put a label on their relationship yet.</p><p>“Yeah, and I didn’t save your life 20 years ago.” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“Pietro helped.” Agatha reminded.</p><p>“He did, and he loves you just as much as I do. You’re the sister we always needed. Never forget how loved and wanted you are by us.” Wanda reassured as she patted Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Why is everyone determined to make me cry today?” Agatha asked as she felt the tears start to well up in her eyes.</p><p>“Because we want you to know how loved you are. Fuck Evanora Harkness. She’s a cunt. I would’ve let you drain her and the whole coven if I had known you wouldn’t have caught jail time.” Wanda said as she wrapped her arms around Agatha again in a reassuring hug.</p><p>“I didn’t want any of them to die…” Agatha said brokenly, remembering how they all looked as she drained them. She’s thankful that Wanda and Pietro saved her and them.</p><p>“And that makes you a far better person than that monster who created you will ever be.” Wanda reassured.</p><p>“Thanks. Now can I read my book in peace?” Agatha asked softly. She was feeling emotional and didn’t want to cry. She knew Wanda would make her cry today if she stuck around any longer.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess I can go home. I gotta take care of a few things.” Wanda said her tone indicating that she wanted to linger a little longer.</p><p>“I’ll be fine. I promise. You know I’ll text you if I break.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Promise?” Wanda asked as she got up.</p><p>“Promise.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Have a good night. I’ll see you in the morning.” Wanda said as she walked to the door.</p><p>“See you in the morning. Have a great night.” Agatha said as she watched Wanda leave. She sighed and picked her phone back up to text Rio.</p><p>Agatha 6:05 p.m: Sorry about that. She’s not used to sharing…</p><p>Rio 6:05 p.m: She gone?</p><p>Agatha 6:06 p.m: Yes.</p><p>A moment later her phone rang, Rio was calling. Agatha smiled as she answered the call. “Miss me already?”</p><p>“Yes. But that’s not why I’m calling. I called my mother, and talked to her about today.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha asked as she got comfortable.</p><p>“Yeah. She wants to meet you.” Rio said with a chuckle. “But, that can wait. I also called her to ask about great grandma’s book.” Rio said as she settled on her own couch.</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked hopefully.</p><p>“She said she will let you borrow it for as long as you want… after she meets you.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“I can agree to those terms.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Isn’t it too soon to meet my mother?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I mean I can meet her for the holidays in a few months. I’m not impatient Rio. The spell book isn’t going anywhere.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“True but she wanted to meet you next weekend.”</p><p>“What did the cabin tell her?” Agatha asked, knowing magical artifacts had away of communicating.</p><p>“Lots of things. But mainly, you are it. Great grandma’s magic has made it very known that you are wanted and welcome there.” Rio answered her.</p><p>“Good to know. What was the rest?” Agatha pried.</p><p>“I may or may not have told her about how your mother reacted to finding out you were a spirit witch.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“She seems to think she’s got 20 years of loving you to catch up on immediately.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Fascinating.” Agatha said before continuing. “I don’t know if I can handle being loved by two Vidal women at once. You’ve almost made my heart explode a few times in the last two days.”</p><p>“I think you’ll be just fine Agatha.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“You don’t know that! I could die from being loved too much!” Agatha whined dramatically.</p><p>“I doubt it.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Okay, whatever you say darling.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I wish I had stayed.” Rio said quietly, as if she was afraid Agatha would hear how vulnerable she felt.</p><p>“I wish you had stayed as well. Unfortunately we both have day jobs so that means… We will make it through this week, I promise.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“So I missed family dinner on Saturday… would you want to come with me next week?” Rio asked, changing the subject.</p><p>“Tentatively yes. But I have no clue what my work week holds.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’ll accept that. Do you want to stay on the phone or do you want me to text you?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I thought you had things you needed to get done.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“I mean…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“You already did everything you needed to and miss me now?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes! Okay! I feel like a junky. I’ve never met anyone like you.” Rio lamented.</p><p>“I miss you too.” Agatha said honestly, and it made Rio’s heart jump into her throat. Agatha was smiling like a teenager. Her heart felt like it was soaring.</p><p>“We are so fucked.” Rio said with a smile, Agatha could hear the joy in her tone.</p><p>“We are. I’m gunna go get ready for bed and take you with me. We will talk until I get tired.” Agatha said as she got up and started taking care of things around the house before making her way into her bedroom.</p><p>“Did you eat dinner?” Rio asked causing Agatha to pause and sigh.</p><p>“Did you?” Agatha asked as she turned around and made her way into the kitchen to find something small to eat.</p><p>“I had a burger from the diner around the corner from my place.” Rio said as she started moving around her apartment.</p><p>“I don’t want to cook.” Agatha said as she opened the fridge and looked for something to eat.</p><p>“I’d suggest the left over spaghetti, but someone ate that.” Rio joked.</p><p>“I’ll have a salad.” Agatha said as she pulled the bowl out and placed some on a plate before putting it away. She grabbed some dressing, some cold grilled chicken and shredded cheese and added them to the salad before putting everything away.</p><p>“Somethings better than nothing.”</p><p>“I hate cooking for one, it’s boring so it will have to do.” Agatha said as she sat down at the island and magicked a fork into her hand.</p><p>“I can understand that. But you are a fantastic cook.”</p><p>“I know, but if you were here I would’ve actually cooked a real meal.” Agatha said as she stabbed at the salad before taking a bite.</p><p>“Good to know I’m worth cooking for… Can I ask a personal question?” Rio asked tentatively, like she sounded nervous.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What’s your mother’s name?”</p><p>“Evanora Harkness.” Agatha said as she grabbed a bite of food.</p><p>“I expected more of a fight.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Wanda literally called her a cunt to my face today. I’m desensitized. Why did you want it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Just trying to figure out something.” Rio said as she flipped through something, Agatha could hear papers shuffling.</p><p>“Please don’t go hunt my mother down. I will literally never speak to you again. I cannot handle that woman in my life.” Agatha said in a steely tone.</p><p>“I wasn’t hunting her down. I would never disrespect you like that. I’m just trying to figure out what you “should” have been.” Rio asked.</p><p>“She’s an illusionist witch. Major manipulator, honestly one of the most impressive ones I’ve met. Which is why I have the ability to control a feeble mind.” Agatha with a shrug that Rio couldn’t see before she took another bite.</p><p>“That explains many things.” Rio said as she shoved paperwork aside.</p><p>“How so?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’ve met a few illusionists witches…. They always leave a bad taste in my mouth. I see through their glamor.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Is that why you say Te Veo?” Agatha asked before she finished eating her salad.</p><p>“I see through most, you were a little more difficult to pin down. So in your case it’s less ‘I see you’ and more ‘I desire to see you’ than anything.”  Rio explained.</p><p>“You’ve stripped me bare, you’ve seen more of me than anyone ever has.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Except Wanda.” Rio amends.</p><p>“You’re getting there. Trust me. Now that I’ve eaten, can I get ready for bed?” Agatha questioned, more of a joke than anything.</p><p>“I suppose I can let you rest. Te Veo Agatha.” Rio said into the phone as Agatha got up and put her plate in the sink and rinsed the dishes off.</p><p>“Good night Rio.” Agatha said before she pulled her phone away and hung up. She washed the dishes that were in her sink and then headed toward her bedroom. She settled into bed and magicked her book into her hand and started reading.</p><p>An hour later she plugged her phone in, set her alarms, put her book on the nightstand and laid down to rest. Hoping sleep would take her soon.</p>

<p>Rio sat in her living room holding her phone. She wanted to call her mom back and talk to her some more but it was getting late.</p><p>“Fuck it!” Rio said as she pressed her mom’s contact and hit dial.</p><p>“Witchlett it’s late, what is wrong?” A concerned voice asked over the phone.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness.” Rio said into her phone, unsure of what her mother would do with the information but she had to tell her mom.</p><p>“Oh.” There was a long pause that felt like it stretched on for eons. “The illusionist witch…”</p><p>“You know of her?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She’s a vain individual, appearances are everything to her. Which explains much of what you told me earlier. I’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of meeting her.”</p><p>“Momma, don’t hex her. Agatha wants no connection to her.”</p><p>“Oh, Witchlett. The woman is not of my concern, karma comes for us all in the end.”</p><p>“Thank you. But seriously. No hexing.” Rio said seriously.</p><p>“I promise, I will not hex the woman.” Her mother promised.</p><p>“Why did you want to know it so badly in the first place?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I needed to know who hurt my future daughter in law. So I can protect her if needed.”</p><p>“Momma… we aren’t even officially dating.” Rio whined.</p><p>“Rio, mi corazón. She is it. Your magic is intertwined. Nothing is pulling you two apart. I’ve never felt a bond so strong.” Her mother reassured.</p><p>“Do you know how insane this sounds?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Death always needs a bride. You’ve found yours.”</p><p>“About that…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“You told her already?” Her mother asked softly.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Everything?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And she didn’t run. More proof I’m right.” Her mother said proudly.</p><p>“You are going to be insufferable until you meet her aren’t you?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Of course I am. This witchlett has her claws in deep and I cannot wait to see what kind of witch she is.”</p><p>“An impressive one, if I’m being honest.” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“That I believe. Now, my darling girl. You have a book store to run. I have a job to work in the morning, and we have rest to get. Relax, life will work itself out. Goodnight baby.” Her mother reassured softly.</p><p>“Goodnight Momma.” Rio said as she hung the phone up.</p><p>“She’s totally going to hex her.” Rio said as she shook her head and got up from the couch and headed toward her own bed.</p><p>~meanwhile~</p><p>Wanda sat in her living room contemplating what she should do. It had been a while since she had hexed Evanora Harkness.<br/>She pulled her phone out and checked the time. It was almost 10 p.m. instead of a hex she decided to do the next best thing and that was to call her brother. It rang once before he picked up.</p><p>“Hey sis, what’s up?” Pietro said into the phone.</p><p>“I have a request…” Wanda asked into the phone.</p><p>“Unfortunately the wicked witch is still alive.” He said into the phone.</p><p>“I know. I just want you to check and see if the hex’s I have in place are still active.”</p><p>“I can do that, how’s Aggie doing?” He asked referring to Agatha.</p><p>“She’s actually great. It’s a bit complicated but she met someone this past weekend.” Wanda answered. There was a long pause on the other end, like his brain was trying to process.</p><p>“You actually made me stop moving because I swear you just said Agatha met someone…” Pietro said in a confused tone.</p><p>“I mean.. she did.” Wanda said into the phone.</p><p>“One second, let me check for you real quick. Leaving my phone here.” Pietro said as he set his phone down. A few moments Wanda heard the phone pick back up.“Everything is in place still.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“Are you thinking about casting a new one? She seems pretty miserable already, not that she doesn’t deserve it.”</p><p>“Not yet. But if she tries to contact Agatha around Halloween I’ll do something then.” Wanda said, knowing this woman always had a tendency to try and contact Agatha around witchy holidays.</p><p>“I can check in on her a couple times a week and see where her mental state is? She seems pretty angry about most of her magic being gone still.”</p><p>“Yeah… Agatha doesn’t know about that still.”</p><p>“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.” Pietro said with a shrug that Wanda couldn’t see.</p><p>“Thanks for checking for me.”</p><p>“So… is Aggies new boo cute?” Pietro asked.</p><p>“Stunning honestly. She’s very much Agatha’s type. Plus she owns a book store.”</p><p>“Oh Jeeze. So she’s perfect. Book store name?” He asked.</p><p>“Vidal Books. Don’t go zipping around right now to check it out.” Wanda said causing her brother to stop.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll go tomorrow like a normal human.” He said sadly.</p><p>“Thanks. Now, I should get to bed. You probably should too, you’ve got classes to teach tomorrow.” Wanda told her brother.</p><p>“I’ll check it out on my lunch break or after work. You know the offer is still on the table for a job right?” He told his sister.</p><p>“I’m happy with being a therapist for normal people at the moment. Plus, if I moved over there Agatha would be alone.”</p><p>“I know. Alright. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Night!” Wanda said as she hung the phone up. She sighed and made her way to bed.</p><p>—————————</p><p>The next morning Agatha woke up feeling refreshed and ready for her work day. She got up, showered, put on her favorite black suit and accessorized with a dark purple tie, her rings, and a pocket chain. She put her hair up in a neat bun and then headed into the kitchen to make breakfast for her and Wanda. Who rushed in the door a few moments after Agatha placed a plate of eggs, bacon and toast on the island for her best-friend.</p><p>“Do you ever feel like we are too co-dependent?” Wanda asked as she sat down at the island and started eating.</p><p>“You’re co-dependent. I’m just humoring you.” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“And I’m just here for breakfast.” Wanda said sarcastically as she sopped up some runny egg yolk with her toast. Agatha took a bite of her bacon as she watched her best friend eat.</p><p>“What did you do?” Agatha asked she could see Wanda was being bothered by something.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Wanda asked incredulity.</p><p>“You didn’t get a lot of sleep, you aren’t being quite as obnoxious as you usually are, and actually opened my front door like a normal human being for once.” Agatha listed off reasons.</p><p>“Why are you so fucking observant?!?” Wanda complained.</p><p>“It’s my job, now spill.” Agatha said honing in on Wanda.</p><p>“I called Pietro last night…”</p><p>“Oh? And how is our brother?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“He’s fine, still on my case about working for Charles Xavier.” Wanda answered with a shrug, trying to act like that was what was bugging her.</p><p>“That’s not it, he always bugs you about that. Tell me, don’t make me call Jen for a truth serum.” Agatha said with a glare.</p><p>“I had him check to see if my hex’s on your mother were still in place…” Wanda said as she braced herself ready to deal with a pissed off Agatha.</p><p>“And?” Agatha asked as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>“You’re not angry I hexed your mother?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You are a chaos witch, but you are also my best friend, so that makes you predictable to me. I knew you had hex’s on her, I’d be more surprised if you told me you didn’t. Now eat breakfast. I don’t want to be late to work.” Agatha said as she finished her coffee and put the cup in the sink. She was still eating her breakfast.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Wanda said before she finished eating her last few bites of food.</p><p>“I’ll see you later. Don’t cause too much chaos today.” Agatha said as Wanda got up and rinsed her plate off.</p><p>“Thank you for breakfast and always being such a good friend.” Wanda said as she side hugged Agatha before she rushed out the door.</p><p>“You’re welcome!” Agatha yelled as the front door shuts. She shook her head as she cleaned her own plate off and headed to the back to the entryway and grabbed her brief case, wallet, phone and keys. She looked around the house and then turned lights off with her magic before walking out the door and locking it.</p><p>“Let’s tackle this day.” Agatha said with a smile as she climbed into her car and started it.</p><p>Agatha was a creature of habit, she arrived at work before most, got things in order and made sure things went smoothly. She had a whole team to organize and keep on track on top of her own high profile cases.</p><p>“You have court this afternoon Ms. Harkness.” Her secretary said to her as she walked into the office.</p><p>“Thank you Tricia, has Mrs. Potts left any messages for me?” Agatha asked the young woman.</p><p>“Yes, several. They are all in a sealed envelope on your desk. And before you ask me what they say I was given explicit instructions to not read them. She hand delivered them yesterday afternoon.” Tricia answered her boss.</p><p>“Perfect, not looking forward to that. Can you give me 20 minutes to review everything and then I will see what we need to address?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course. If you need anything else let me know.” Tricia offered.</p><p>“Let me review this stuff from Mrs. Potts.” Agatha said as she walked over to her door and held it open for Tricia who took the hint and went over to her own desk. Agatha shut the door and walked over to her desk and sat down.</p><p>Before she did anything Agatha pulled open a tab on her computer and ordered some flowers to be delivered to Vidal Books with a note that said ‘A little something to let My Green Witch know she’s on my mind.’</p><p>“Now let’s see the mess we are in.” Agatha said as she pulled the paperwork out. On the top of the page there was a header that read ‘Stark Industries vs Jeffery Davis and Fellowship industries.’</p><p>“Not Fellowship! Ugh I fucking hate them so much. Damn it Jeffery.” Agatha grumbled as she read the rest of the document. She noticed a few errors and issues so she started retyping the document, focusing deeply on making sure everything was right before it was sent to the judge.</p><p>A knock on her door pulled her from her focus but not enough to look up from her computer. “Come in.” Agatha said as she continued to focus on her work.</p><p>“I see you found the lawsuit.” Pepper said as she walked into the office and shut the door behind her.</p><p>“Who wrote this?” Agatha said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Travis. He was the only one available.” Pepper said with a slightly irritated tone.</p><p>“I could’ve come in yesterday and this would have been immaculate and perfect.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“About that… how did the date go?”</p><p>“You want the watered down human version or do you want the witch version?” Agatha asked as she continued to type.</p><p>“There’s a difference?” Pepper asked with a chuckle.</p><p>“A large one.” Agatha said as she looked up from her computer, actually pausing her work.</p><p>“Watered down for now. We can gossip after you win your case this afternoon.” Pepper told her.</p><p>“Fantastic. We are super compatible, she’s a green witch, and she’s intelligent, attractive, compassionate and romantic.” Agatha said before she went back to her work.</p><p>“Awesome. Think you’ll have that done by noon?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I’ll have it done in an hour and email it to you.”</p><p>“And that’s why I fucking love having you around.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“And I thought it was because I’m cute.” Agatha joked before she went back to getting work done. Pepper rolled her eyes at Agatha who just chuckled as she continued to write.</p><p>“Give ‘em Hell Harkness.” Pepper said as she opened the door and walked out.</p><p>An hour later the lawsuit was written up and emailed to Pepper. Agatha took a moment to look through the rest of the paperwork that Pepper put in the folder. At the very bottom of the pile under everything was two life time passes to Stark Botanical Gardens with a sticky note on them that said ‘Just in case you ever leave us.’ In Peppers beautiful script.</p><p>“That woman.” Agatha said with an eye roll. She grabbed her phone to check and see if she had any messages.</p><p>Rio 9:45 a.m: Good Morning Gorgeous.</p><p>Agatha smiled at the text and quickly sent one back.</p><p>Agatha 10:05 a.m: Good Morning, how’s my favorite Green Witch?</p><p>Agatha then went back to work. She made sure she had everything for court later in the day and made sure that her team was handling things well before she went to visit Pepper in her office.</p><p>“Tricia, I have to go see Pepper personally. Then after that I’ll probably head to court. If you need to take the rest of the day off after you can, otherwise I trust you can hold the fort down?” Agatha asked her secretary as she stopped at her desk.</p><p>“I’ll hold down the fort. Expect emails.” Tricia said as the phone rang. “Stark Law, you’ve reached the Secretary of Agatha Harkness. How may I assist you?” There was a long pause. “Yes Ma’am she is on her way to your office now.” Tricia said as she waved Agatha off.</p><p>Agatha took the stairs up one floor and made her way to Peppers office. Her secretary stood as Agatha walked past his desk and into the office without knocking.</p><p>“You rang?” Agatha asked as she sat down in one of Peppers comfy chairs.</p><p>“Yes, the lawsuit has been reviewed by a judge and given the green light. We can wrap them up in so much red tape they’ll never see the light of day. Did you find the rest of the paperwork?”  Pepper asked.</p><p>“By paperwork you mean two lifetime passes to Stark Botanical Gardens?” Agatha asked as she folded her arms and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Tony noticed how much Rio loved the place. He insisted.” Pepper said with a shrug.</p><p>“Pepper…” Agatha drew her name out as a warning.</p><p>“Okay, I felt bad for interrupting your date twice. So when I got home and talked to Tony about it he suggested it after checking the gardens cameras.” Pepper relented, telling the truth.</p><p>“I appreciate it, Rio will love it. Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, gotta take care of you so I don’t lose you. Now go win that case and head home.” Pepper said with a smile.</p><p>“Can do.” Agatha said as she stood up and walked out the door. She waved her hand on the way out and her briefcase appeared out of nowhere. She made her way to the elevator and headed down to the lobby before making her way to her car and heading toward the courthouse.</p><p>Once she arrived she saw a flash of green walk out the door. Reporters were surrounding one of her colleagues again. High profile superhero cases were always Jennifer Walter’s to handle first. Agatha made her way up the stairs and into the courthouse feeling sympathy for her co-worker.</p><p>“I don’t have time for a press statement today, sorry everyone. I must speak to someone.” Jennifer said as she shoved through the group and made her way back into the courthouse.</p><p>“Harkness!” Jenifer yelled after she got back into the building. Agatha turned around and walked over to Jennifer.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha said looking up at the giant green woman.</p><p>“I was wondering, are you busy this weekend? I’d like to take you on a date.” Jennifer asked hopefully.</p><p>“Uh… I… I’m sorry, I’m actually seeing someone currently.” Agatha said as she looked up at the giantess, she was shocked to say the least.</p><p>“I thought you were single.” Jennifer pried.</p><p>“I was on Friday last week.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Oh. I’m sorry. I hope this doesn’t affect our work relationship. If you two don’t work out, let me know.” Jennifer said to Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it at all, and I’ll keep that in mind. Now I have a case to win, have a lovely day.” Agatha said as she walked away from Jennifer. She cleared her mind and walked into the courtroom and met with her client before sitting down.</p><p>Agatha did what she did best and a few hours later the jury came out and announced her client was the winner of the lawsuit. With a satisfied smile she collected her paperwork and stuck it in her briefcase. She grabbed her phone and send a text to Pepper letting her know they had won. Then she seen the text from Rio.</p><p>3:45 p.m: I’m yours now? Attachment Image.</p><p>The photo was of the flowers and note. Agatha smiled brightly and quickly sent a text off to Rio.</p><p>4:00 p.m: Only if you want to be. Just won a case! Hopefully you are having an amazing day.</p><p>“Thank you Ms. Harkness.” Her client said to Agatha as she tucked her phone into her breast pocket.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Stay out of trouble.” Agatha said as she patted the man on the shoulder and walked out of the courtroom.</p><p>“Impressive. I love watching you work.” Jennifer complimented.</p><p>“Jennifer.” Agatha said in a neutral tone as she started heading toward the exit.</p><p>“So you said you just started dating…” Jenifer said as she followed Agatha.</p><p>“If you are going to try and convince me to give you a shot. I’m gunna have to turn into Hardass Harkness.” Agatha said with a sigh she could feel a headache coming on.</p><p>“I was just going to ask for the courtesy of one date. See how compatible we are.” Jennifer suggested.</p><p>“Jennifer, look I’m sure you are fantastic. But I don’t date individuals with human lifespans. So unless you plan on living upwards of a thousand years, we aren’t compatible.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Is that really a deal breaker for witches?” Jennifer asked as she followed Agatha down the steps.</p><p>“All witches? I can’t speak for them as a whole. For me personally? Yes. Why would I want to spend a tenth of my life time with someone and watch them age and die while I’m still young? It just sounds like heartache.” Agatha answered the green giantess.</p><p>“I didn’t think about it like that.” Jennifer said as she relented.</p><p>“I do appreciate the drive you have. Don’t get me wrong. But I really like this woman, I don’t want to fuck it up. So thank you for the offer, but no thanks.” Agatha said as she approached her car.</p><p>“Thank you for the honesty. Congratulations on your win.” Jennifer said before walking away. Agatha got in her car started it and called Pepper instantly. The phone rang twice before Pepper picked up.</p><p>“Congratulations on another win Agatha.”</p><p>“Thanks, we might have a problem.” Agatha said into the phone as she pulled out of her parking spot and headed toward the office.</p><p>“Oh? What would that be?” Pepper asked, it sounded like she was packing things up for the evening.</p><p>“Want to guess who I ran into at the courthouse?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Honestly, I have no clue.” Pepper said after a long pause.</p><p>“Jennifer Walter’s.”</p><p>“How could that be a problem?” Pepper asked as she continued to pack her things up.</p><p>“Because she asked me out on a date. I rejected her. She watched me win the case and then asked again.” Agatha said as she turned the corner.</p><p>“Fuck… Do I need to write her up for harassment?” Pepper asked as she sat down, ready to fill out paper work.</p><p>“Not yet. I think I got through to her the second time when I told her I don’t date individuals with Human lifespans.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“If it happens again tell me immediately.” Pepper requested.</p><p>“I will, the only good news here is that she doesn’t actually work in the same office.” Agatha reminded Pepper.</p><p>“Are you coming back here? Why don’t you head home? Not much you can do here. I’ve CC’ed you in everything important.” Pepper told her.</p><p>“I think I’ll go visit my new favorite book store.” Agatha said as she turned, changing her route.</p><p>“Tony did a background check on Rio also… Vidal Books?” Pepper said.</p><p>“You are just as nosey as Wanda!” Agatha said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Hey, just because I’m your boss doesn’t mean I’m not your friend!” Pepper hollered into the phone.</p><p>“Careful Pepper, Tony is rubbing off on you.” Agatha jabbed.</p><p>“Unfortunately for all of us, it’s too late for that. Now have a good night, I have a husband to get home to.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“You as well!” Agatha said as she hit the end call button on her center counsel.</p><p>Ten minutes later Agatha was pulling up to the bookstore with a bright smile on her face. She could see that there were a few customers mulling about the store. So she shut the car off and made her way inside. Rio was helping a little girl pick out a book over in the kids corner.</p><p>“Do you like dinosaurs or unicorns?” Rio asked the little girl who seemed to be around the age of 8.</p><p>“Unicorns!” The little girl said excitedly.</p><p>“I think I have the perfect book for you, How to Catch a Unicorn. Why don’t you go sit in that beanbag and read it while I help my other customers.” Rio offered to the little girl as she pulled the book off the shelf and handed it to her.</p><p>“Thank you!” The little girl said as she ran over to the beanbag and plopped down.  Agatha felt her heart melt at the sight.<br/>Rio stood up and turned around to see Agatha standing next to the counter with a soft smile on her face.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio said excitedly as she rushed over to the woman.</p><p>“Hello darling.” Agatha said as she took Rio into her arms and hugged her softly.</p><p>“Not that I’m complaining but why are you here?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I won my case and got the rest of the day off. So I figured I’d come hang out with you and we could go to dinner to celebrate.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Sounds delightful. Did you read my last text?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, I had something I had to handle after my case. Which I will tell you about at dinner or after your done working, but I’ll check it now.” Agatha said as she reached for her phone in her jackets internal breast pocket.</p><p>“I gotta help customers, but please let me know.” Rio said as she let Agatha go and went back to work.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly at Rio before she turned and started looking at books. She made her way back to the spell book section and grabbed Rio’s spell book off the shelf and placed it in her lap as she sat down. She pulled her phone out of her pocket and read the text.</p><p>Rio 4:02 p.m: Agatha Harkness, I am yours.</p><p>Before Agatha even had a chance to react she felt something shift in the book store a moment later and then she seen a flash of gray. “Pietro.” Agatha whispered causing the man to stop in his tracks.</p><p>“How the fuck did you know I was here?” Pietro asked.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Agatha asked the man.</p><p>“Wanda told me about your new boo… I had to see what she looked like.” He said honestly.</p><p>“So you traveled across 6 states just to check out my ‘new boo.’?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Yes.” Pietro answered, zero hesitation. He knew not to pussyfoot around with Agatha.</p><p>“You must be Wanda’s twin brother.” Rio said as she walked over to them.</p><p>“How does she know that?” Pietro asked Agatha as he pointed at Rio.</p><p>“She has immaculate hearing. I assume she heard me say your name.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“That and my wards told me someone zipped in here faster than humanly possible.” Rio explained.</p><p>“I assume Aggie told you I’m a mutant?” He asked.</p><p>“Agatha told me yes. Pietro right? Rio Vidal, pleasure to meet you.” Rio said as she held her hand out for him to take.</p><p>“The pleasure is all mine, glad to meet the person who finally convinced Aggie that being forever alone is boring.” Pietro said as he took Rio’s hand and shook it. A quick blur and a tug on Agatha’s hand told her he took a ring off her.</p><p>“Put it back.” Agatha said to Pietro.</p><p>“Come on!” Pietro said as he took the ring back off Rio’s hand and gave it back to Agatha with a huff.</p><p>“Stop acting like a little brother.” Agatha scolded as she slipped her ring back on.</p><p>“Fine, you are no fun! I’ll go harass Wanda.” Pietro said before he disappeared.</p><p>“Sorry about that. He’s always been a little pickpocket. But he knows better than to take anything off you.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s smart of him to try and  put things onto me.” Rio said with an eye roll.</p><p>“No one ever said he had self preservation. Plus he’s not aware of how powerful you are.” Agatha said to Rio.</p><p>“Many aren’t.” Rio said before she turned back around and headed toward the front of the store.  Agatha sighed and pulled her phone out to text Wanda.</p><p>Agatha 5:02 p.m: Pietro is here.</p><p>Wanda 5:03 p.m: Figured that out.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and put her phone away before she started reading Rio’s spell book to occupy her time. Agatha was enjoying a moment to herself when she felt a soft tug on their connection. She closed her eyes and tugged back then waited, she heard the bell ring out front and then decided to go back to reading.</p><p>An hour later the door was locked and Rio was walking to the back of the store to find Agatha right where she had left her. “Did you read my message?”</p><p>“I’m yours Rio Vidal.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s hand and pulled her down onto the couch.</p><p>“Good.” Rio said as she leaned forward and gave Agatha a kiss.</p><p>“Something interesting happened today though.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“And what would that be?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Are you aware of who ‘She-Hulk’ is?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“She’s basically the superhero’s lawyer.”</p><p>“In short yes. She’s also technically a co-worker.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Okay, why are you telling me about her?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She was leaving the courthouse today and noticed me going in. So she followed me inside and asked me out on a date.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“And?” Rio asked in a strange tone.</p><p>“I rejected her and told her I was seeing someone. Went and won my case, she had decided to stay and watch. Then complimented me and asked again. Under the ruse that she wanted to see if we were compatible.” Agatha explained, Rio audibly huffed. Agatha placed a hand on Rio’s to reassure the woman.</p><p>“I had to basically tell her that I don’t date individuals with normal human lifespans for her to get the hint.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Good, I’m glad she got the hint. If she asks again she’s losing her tongue.” Rio said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re jealous of a giant green woman.” Agatha chided as she reached up and turned Rio’s face toward her.</p><p>“I have no right to be, but yes I am.” Rio said honestly, brown eyes full of emotion. Sky blue eyes softened as she looked at Rio.</p><p>“I’m yours. I promise. This.” Agatha said as she motioned between the two of them before she tugged softly again. “This isn’t something I’d ever let go of. This is real.”</p><p>“Stop, you are going to make me cry.” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“I’m serious. Rio, will you be my girlfriend?” Agatha asked, Rio didn’t answer. Instead she launched herself into Agatha’s arms and kissed her passionately while shaking her head yes. They kissed a few more times before breaking apart for air.</p><p>“Yes! A million times yes.” Rio said excitedly.</p><p>“Good, I was getting worried.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Shut up and kiss me.” Rio said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Your wish is my command.” Agatha murmured against Rio’s lips before she kissed the woman.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rita Vidal was a woman of her word. She personally would not hex Evanora Harkness. Now… that didn’t mean she couldn’t pay someone to.</p><p>The whole workday she contemplated with herself on what kind of hex a woman like Evanora deserved. It truly was a conundrum for her. She had plenty of ideas but couldn’t really land on one she loved. Maybe she would have a talk with Lilia, see what the divination witch had to suggest.</p><p>Once she got done working she pulled her phone out and called the older witch.</p><p>“Rita! I was expecting your call.” Lilia said into the phone.</p><p>“Hello Lilia.”</p><p>“There are enough hex’s on that witch to kill a horse. But if you want to add insult to injury just a simple glamor malfunction hex will do just fine.” Lilia said into the phone.</p><p>“Is she deserving of it?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Give me a moment. Let me look back.” Lilia said as she set her phone down and placed it on speaker.</p><p>~</p><p>“You wretched child! I should’ve killed you the second you were born! All you’ve ever been is a burden, a thorn in my side and now this! You are undeserving of drawing breath! How dare you!” Evanora scolded as she slapped Agatha across the face.</p><p>“Mother please! I love her!” A young Agatha begged.</p><p>“First you go running around with those abominable twins! Now this! You have been an utter disappointment since day one! How dare you. I put my blood, sweat, and bone into raising you. Just for you to shame me like this!” Evanora yelled as she slapped her daughter again. Purple magic flared from Agatha in that moment, haulting Evanora’s movements.</p><p>“Mother Stop!” Agatha pleaded, fear painting Agatha’s tone.</p><p>“You… you’re a…” Evanora started to say but stopped, her anger growing even deeper. Her face twisting into a look of disgust that even Agatha had never seen before.  She reached forward and grabbed Agatha by her hair and dragged her out of the house.</p><p>“Mother please! Stop!” Agatha pleaded, begging for her mother to let her go. Evanora shot a beacon of blue magic into the air and continued to drag Agatha through the woods.</p><p>Suddenly the rest of the coven was there pulling Agatha up by her arms and helping Evanora bind Agatha to a dead rotting tree. They left her there while they discussed her fate.</p><p>“She’s a fucking spirit witch.” Evanora spat loudly.</p><p>“To protect the coven we must kill her.” One of the other witches said. Fear ran through Agatha, at the realization that her mother truly never loved her.</p><p>“She’s young and weak, we can fry her and end this now.” Evanora said to the coven before they walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“Mother please! I can be good.” Agatha begged struggling at her restraints tears spilling down her cheeks.</p><p>“No you cannot. You are incapable of it. It must be done my child. You cannot live. You are undeserving of life.” Evanora said to her daughter before continuing. “You have been nothing but a problem since the day you were born, today I eliminate that problem.” Evanora said as she blasted Agatha with her magic, the rest of the coven joined in.  An agonized scream left Agatha before something shifted. All the magic turned purple and they couldn’t stop it.</p><p>“No! No no no no no. Please no!” Agatha begged. She didn’t want to harm anyone. She had no control. Tears were spilling from her eyes as she begged them to stop, her voice raw from screaming. Then she seen a blur of silver and red. Witches were thrown aside as Wanda landed next to Agatha and started untying her bounds.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Wanda asked checking Agatha over before Pietro skidded to a stop next to them.</p><p>“Are they?” Agatha asked in a scared tone as she looked at the women laying on the forest floor.</p><p>“They’re still alive if that’s what you are asking.” Pietro answered, before he crouched down next to Agatha and Wanda. “Are you okay?” He asked.</p><p>“No.” Agatha said brokenly, tears running down her face as she shook.</p><p>“Let’s get you out of here. Cleaned up and maybe checked out at a hospital.” Wanda said as she helped Agatha stand. Agatha collapsed again, and Pietro sighed softly as he scooped Agatha up into his arms.</p><p>“Get her to our place, fast.” Wanda said to her brother.</p><p>“Don’t kill anyone. She needs both of us.” Pietro reminded Wanda before he dashed off with a shell shocked Agatha in his arms.</p><p>~</p><p>Lilia picked up the phone and grumbled. “Whatever horrible thing you come up with, it’s not enough...”</p><p>“What?” Rita asked.</p><p>“That poor child, was undeserving of the hand she had been dealt.” Lilia said trying to collect her thoughts.</p><p>“Lilia focus. Come back to the present.” Rita requested softly.</p><p>“Sorry, I am experiencing the rage of a thousand men right now.” Lilia answered.</p><p>“What did you see?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Something no child should ever experience. She was just a baby. Couldn’t have been more than sixteen and her mother…”</p><p>“I know, Rio summarized but I doubt she told me the full story.”</p><p>“I doubt she has the full story. Based off what I seen, that’s something someone doesn’t want to talk about or remember.” Lilia said honestly as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“Care to share?” Rita asked.</p><p>“No. Just know that every hex she has on her will never be enough. Whatever you come up with won’t undo the damage this woman has done.” Lilia explained, still feeling the fear Agatha felt.</p><p>“Is she even worth hexing?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Most of her power is gone, due to the siphoning. Her coven is weak but alive, she is too weak to even counter the hex’s the chaos witch has placed on her. I’d argue that she isn’t even worth the energy to hex in the first place.”</p><p>“Can you tell me how many hex’s she has on her?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Twenty give or take.” Lilia said with a chuckle.</p><p>“All running at once?” Rita asked.</p><p>“From what I could see yesterday? Yes.”</p><p>“At least my future daughter in law made friends with good people.” Rita commented.</p><p>“Great people. Now… do we want to know about that for sure?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“No, they are intertwined. I know they will end up together.” Rita said firmly.</p><p>“You’ve always been intuitive.” Lilia said as she threw a cloth over her crystal ball.</p><p>“That’s all the confirmation I’ll ever need.” Rita answered.</p><p>“How’s Rio?” Lilia asked changing the subject.</p><p>“She’s great! Just opened her book store, got herself a girlfriend, and is thriving.”</p><p>“All great things to hear.” Lilia said as she got up and headed over to her fridge to grab a drink. “Now, relax. Everything is exactly how it’s supposed to be.” Lilia reassured.</p><p>“Thanks Lilia. Have a great day.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“You as well.” Lilia responded and then the line went dead.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll hex the woman…” Lilia mused to herself as she walked over to her spell book.</p><p>~Meanwhile at Vidal Books~</p><p>Agatha and Rio were still making out on the couch. Drinking each other in like they were the last drop of water on the planet. Rio broke the kiss to catch her breath and kiss down the side of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I haven’t eaten since breakfast.” Agatha said with a huff as Rio continued kissing down her neck. She was straddling Agatha’s lap and enjoying every second of it.</p><p>“I have something you can eat.” Rio offered in a deep husky tone. Agatha groaned at the thought of tasting Rio again. Her hands on Rio’s hips gripped tighter.</p><p>“How close is your place?” Agatha asked, already wanting her mouth on Rio.</p><p>“Ten minutes away.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Fuck the fancy dinner, let’s go back to your place, order pizza and have sex.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“You don’t have to convince me. That sounds amazing.” Rio said with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“That unfortunately means you have to get off me.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Let me get a few more kisses first.” Rio said as she leaned down and kissed Agatha again. Agatha’s hands slid under Rio’s shirt and tickled the sensitive skin of her stomach before she started to slide up toward her breasts. Rio groaned as she bit Agatha’s bottom lip before pulling away.</p><p>“Behave.” Rio groaned out as Agatha reached behind her back and toyed with the clasp of her bra.</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” Agatha wondered aloud with a grin. Rio sighed and climbed off Agatha’s lap and stood up.</p><p>“Let’s go, I can’t have sex with you here. I’ll never get anything done again.” Rio said as she offered Agatha her hand. Agatha took it and stood up.</p><p>“Let me out and I’ll follow you home.” Agatha said as she walked over and placed Rio’s spell book back on the shelf.</p><p>“Follow me out the back door.” Rio said as she walked toward the back room. They both made their way out the door and Agatha walked around the building and started her car to pull around back where Rio was waiting next to her car. Rio got in and they both headed off to Rio’s place.</p><p>Ten minutes later they pulled up to an apartment and Rio parked, Agatha parked next to her car and collected her things and got out before locking her car.</p><p>“Sorry it’s not a nice big house like yours.” Rio said as she got out and walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“My first place was a shitty apartment with Wanda and Pietro. Wanda and I got the only bedroom and Pietro slept on the couch. I’m not here to judge.” Agatha said with a smile as she took Rio’s hand. “Now show me your place.”</p><p>Rio guided them up the stairs to the top floor before she unlocked the door.</p><p>“Apartment 13. That seems fitting.” Agatha observed as Rio opened the door and let Agatha in. The whole apartment was so welcoming. Plants seemed to cover every surface. The whole apartment felt like a lush forest more than a suburban wasteland.</p><p>“Wow. I feel like I just stepped into a studio ghibli movie.” Agatha said as she looked around the apartment. There were jars and books scattering the shelves of the small apartment. Plants seeming to creep out of every free crevice. It felt like Rio, and more importantly it felt like home.</p><p>“Was that a compliment?” Rio asked with a smile.</p><p>“The biggest. I’m a big sucker for Howls Moving Castle.” Agatha said as she took the space in.</p><p>“Thanks. But I didn’t bring you here so you could gawk at my plants.” Rio joked.</p><p>“What a nice thing to say to your girlfriend.” Agatha jabbed back as she continued to look around the apartment. She slipped off her heels and made her way in. Rio scoffed at Agatha who seemed to almost be in a trance as she walked around the room.</p><p>Stepping past the kitchen into the small living room Agatha noticed the bookshelves that covered every wall. She was in awe of the books and all the unique titles that she had only heard of in passing. Spell books, botany books, every genre of literature under the sun covered these shelves. Rio walked over to Agatha and took her hand gently.</p><p>“Darling. I thought you were hungry?” Rio asked, she was watching Agatha take everything in.</p><p>“I am, but right now I’m learning.” Agatha said with a tone that was unfamiliar to Rio. It almost sounded like she was trying to unravel the mystery that was Rio.</p><p>“Hey, you’ll have all the time in the world to learn later, focus on me.” Rio said as she turned Agatha’s face toward her.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry. It’s just that… this place feels like you.” Agatha said as she focused on Rio.</p><p>“I would hope so. It is my apartment.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“No Rio, it feels like home.” Agatha said softly, almost a whisper. Like she was afraid she’d scare Rio off but she swallowed her fear and continued. “It feels like something I’ve never experienced. It feels safe. You feel like home. I just didn’t realize it until now.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s face in her hands and looked into her eyes.</p><p>Blue eyes full of tears as she looked at Rio, brown eyes softened as she took Agatha in. She didn’t see a broken woman, she saw someone who had spent so much time trying to claw her way out of all the pain she experienced. She saw a witch who never gave up the fight, but was always fighting. She never had a place where she could settle until now.</p><p>“You are home. I’m right here.” Rio reassured as she brushed a tear away. Agatha hadn’t realized she was crying until Rio had done so. Rio dragged Agatha over to the couch and pulled her down onto the plush green cushions. Agatha curled into her arms as she fell apart in Rio’s arms.  Tears spilling from her eyes as jagged whimpers left her. She felt herself hiccup as she tried to pull away.</p><p>“No, no running from me. You are safe. You are right where you should be.” Rio reassured as she kissed Agatha on the forehead softly.</p><p>“I don’t deserve you.” Agatha whimpered out as she pressed her face into Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I guess it’s a good thing that isn’t for you to decide.” Rio said softly as she pulled Agatha’s hair from her bun and started scratching at the back of her head softly.</p><p>“Who gets to decide that then.” Agatha questioned more herself than Rio.</p><p>“The universe. It’s already decided that you are mine, and I am yours. Just accept the gifts you have been given after so much heartache.” Rio reassured as she kissed Agatha several times on the side of her face and down her cheek, anywhere her lips could reach.</p><p>“I’m so broken.” Agatha said with a watery laugh.</p><p>“You aren’t broken. You are stunning and complex, like a stained glass sculpture. You pieced yourself together with determination and an iron whit. That makes you one of the most stunning and complex individuals I’ve ever had the privilege of meeting. And more than anything I’m glad I get to bask in your colors as the light shines through.” Rio complimented.</p><p>“No matter how nice you paint it, I didn’t do it alone. And it doesn’t make me any less broken.” Agatha said with a sigh, knowing that if it weren’t for Wanda and Pietro, she wouldn’t be who she is.</p><p>“Yeah, well I’m not here to give that chaos witch you call a best friend a big head or her zippy brother any more praise than he deserves... I’m here to fall in love with you, and more importantly, help you fall in love with yourself.”</p><p>“Man you’ve got your work cut out for you.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“We can start with pizza and cuddles. That seems as good a place as any.” Rio offered as she magicked her phone into her hand. “What would you like?”</p><p>“Pepperoni is fine.” Agatha said not wanting to be complicated.</p><p>“No, that’s not what I asked. Now let’s try that again. What would you like?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Ham and pineapple.” Agatha whispered softly.</p><p>“Perfect.” Rio said as she opened an app and ordered them food, paid for it and then set her phone back down.</p><p>“It will be here in forty minutes. Now. We need to have a serious conversation.” Rio said as she helped Agatha adjust so she could look her in the eyes.</p><p>“All we have is serious conversations.” Agatha said with tears still in her eyes.</p><p>“Yes but I need to say this. So listen. You are deserving of love, you are deserving of me, you are wanted by me, you are the only thing I want in this entire universe. Don’t deprive me of the only thing that has ever made me feel human. My whole life I was told that death will come for me, that I will take her place one day. You make me want to actually live. Don’t run from me.” Rio said in a serious tone.</p><p>“I could never run from you, even if I wanted to. For once in my life I feel like it’s okay to be selfish. It’s okay to be happy and want this. I’ve always felt this guilt looming around any joy I feel. I don’t feel that when I’m with you.” Agatha told Rio honestly.</p><p>“Good, because your ass is stuck with me Harkness. Whether you like it or not.” Rio said softly as she pulled Agatha’s face to hers and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“Sorry I ruined the mood.” Agatha said in a strangled tone.</p><p>“You didn’t ruin anything.” Rio reassured. “Now, tell me about this case you won today.” Rio asked</p><p>“Not much to tell. I find people have a hard time lying to me the second I start cross examining them.” Agatha explained, settling comfortably into Rio’s arms.</p><p>“Maybe I should come see you work if you have court on a random Monday.” Rio suggested.</p><p>“If you want, though you’ll probably find it extremely boring.” Agatha said honestly, she knew how most people felt about legal jargon.</p><p>“Anything involving you has my undivided attention.”</p><p>“Five bucks says you fall asleep in the back of the courtroom from pure boredom.” Agatha jokes.</p><p>“I’ll take that bet. Sounds like easy money. I get to stare at my girlfriend while she works? Piece of cake.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“That sounds nice coming out of your mouth.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked.</p><p>“That I’m your girlfriend.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Well you are, and I have no idea how I got so lucky.” Rio said with a smile as she kissed Agatha again.</p><p>“I think you’ve got it backwards, I’m the lucky one here.” Agatha said against Rio’s lips.</p><p>“This will be the argument that never ends.” Agatha said with an eye roll.</p><p>“Probably but if it’s the only argument we have, I think we will be blessed.” Rio said as she pulled Agatha into a deep kiss, letting her know that she wasn’t letting her go no matter what.</p><p>Then there was a knock on the door. Both women groaned loudly as Agatha pulled away and let Rio go grab the door. A few moments later Rio walked into the living room with four small boxes and two glass bottles of water.</p><p>“That better be still water or I’ll vomit.” Agatha said with a blanch.</p><p>“Who likes the flavor of tv static?” Rio asked as she set the pizza boxes on the coffee table.</p><p>“Wanda.” Agatha said with a sneer.</p><p>“She would.” Rio said as she handed Agatha a bottle and then settled on the couch next to her. She set the top box aside and then opened the second one to confirm it was breadsticks. She set that one aside as well and opened the other two. She handed Agatha her small pizza before grabbing her own.</p><p>“Breadstick?” Rio asked as she pulled a couple off for herself.</p><p>“Yes please.” Agatha said as she held her box out to make Rio’s life easier. Rio set a couple into Agatha’s box and then leaned back and got comfortable. Agatha was eyeing the box that Rio set aside.</p><p>“Stop, eat your food. But leave room for dessert.” Rio suggested.</p><p>“Are you dessert or is it the random box you didn’t open.” Agatha said as she picked up a breadstick. She side eyed Rio waiting for a response before taking a bite.</p><p>“Depends on how much you eat I guess.” Rio said with a shrug before she dug into her own pizza.</p><p>“I’ll always have room for dessert if you are on the menu.” Agatha flirted. Rio paused temporarily, trying to gather her thoughts before she took another bite to give herself more time to think.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say to that.” Rio said honestly after she swallowed her bite of food.</p><p>“What is there to say? But seriously what is it? What if it’s something I hate?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“How could anyone hate a triple chocolate brownie?” Rio asked before she realized she had spilled what it was. “Hey wait a second! It was supposed to be a surprise!”</p><p>Agatha burst out laughing, the joyful sound echoing around the apartment making it feel so much more full and warm than it was a moment ago. Rio felt her heart swell in her chest as she watched Agatha smile and laugh more brightly than anyone she had ever met.</p><p>“You are so beautiful when you laugh.” Rio said honestly after Agatha stopped laughing at her. Agatha shook her head at Rio before she picked up a small slice of pizza and started eating.</p><p>“I think you’re a bit bias. Now you see how I win so many cases don’t you?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Because you can pull the truth out of someone with out even trying?” Rio asked as she grabbed a slice of her own pizza and took a bite.</p><p>“Because I’m hard to lie to, or at least I like to think so.” Agatha states.</p><p>“And why do you think that is?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No clue, the truth always seems to bubble up when I’m around.” Agatha said with a shrug before she went back to eating. Rio sat and looked at Agatha for a long moment, observing this gorgeous woman in a black suit looking completely out of place in her apartment. Then she noticed the most important thing, even though she looked out of place she also looked like she was meant to be there all at once.</p><p>“I think it’s because you aren’t afraid to hear the truth. No matter how terrible it is, you make people feel comfortable in your presence. Like no matter how bad it is, you aren’t going to judge them.” Rio said honestly. She could see Agatha thinking, the woman’s brow furrowed as she thought about it.</p><p>“That’s possible.” Agatha said before taking another bite, she chewed as she thought about it a little longer. “That or I just have an affinity for seeing through people’s bullshit.”</p><p>“I still think it’s because you make people feel safe and comfortable.”</p><p>“A spirit witch that makes people feel safe and comfortable is laughable.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Hey, I didn’t say the universe didn’t have a sense of humor.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Maybe in some other universe you’re already Death and I use my powers to siphon witches powers and kill them as a way of seducing you.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Anything’s possible.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah right. It’s laughable to think about really.” Agatha said with an eye roll.</p><p>“I’d be flattered. One of the most powerful witches I’d ever met stealing other witches power just to send me corpses as a love letter.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Demented.” Agatha said as she finished eating her first slice of pizza.</p><p>“Yeah, but I am a little demented.” Rio said with a chuckle as she picked up a breadstick. Agatha smiled at her brightly, as she took a bite of her pizza. Rio just smiled back and started eating. They settled into a comfortable silence as they finished their food.</p><p>A few minutes later Agatha reached for the box that contained the triple chocolate brownie. “Let me get you a fork, these brownies are messy.” Rio said as she got up from the couch and headed to the kitchen. She quickly grabbed a fork and walked back into the living room to see Agatha licking her fingers, reminding Rio of the other night.</p><p>“Got some sauce on my finger.” Agatha said sheepishly, but the grin on her face told Rio that the action was one hundred percent intentional.</p><p>“Here, let’s try to keep your fingers as clean as possible.” Rio said as she handed Agatha the fork.</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that” Agatha flirted before she used the fork to dig out a small bite of the brownie. Rio watched as Agatha brought the fork to her lips, a soft moan left Agatha as she tasted the chocolate.</p><p>“Goddesses above.” Rio groaned out.</p><p>“What? It’s delicious.” Agatha asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Oh? So this isn’t a show to frustrate me?” Rio asked already knowing it was a show.</p><p>“I’d say it’s twenty percent show, eighty percent actually enjoying it.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“I’d rather have you moaning like that under me.” Rio flirted.</p><p>“Let me enjoy this brownie first. Then you can do whatever you want to me.” Agatha said as she started cutting another bite out of the brownie.</p><p>“I think I can agree to those terms.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Want a bite?” Agatha asked as she held out a bite for Rio to take. She leaned forward and wrapped her lips around the fork moaning lowly as the chocolate hit her tongue as she winked at Agatha. A blush crept onto Agatha’s face as she took the fork back and focused on making herself another bite.</p><p>“You’re right it is delicious, but I still think you taste better.” Rio flirted again. Agatha took the bite of brownie before closing the box.</p><p>“You win, help me take care of this and take me to bed.” Agatha said as she started closing the other boxes.</p><p>“Your wish is my command.” Rio teased as she picked the boxes up and took them along with the fork to the kitchen to put them away. Agatha grabbed a bottle of water and opened it. She took a long drink while she waited for Rio to come back. Once Agatha was finished she set her bottle back down and stood up as Rio walked back into the room.  Rio held her hand out and Agatha took it as she guided her to her bedroom.</p>

<p>As soon as they were in Rio’s bedroom Agatha turned to look at the gorgeous woman next to her. “I know we’ve had a few heavy conversations tonight but I really want to do a few things to you that require a conversation.”</p><p>“How about we have the conversation with you out of the suit and tie.” Rio suggested as she fingered the Windsor knot at Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“I suppose…” Agatha said as she felt Rio wrap her hand around the knot and dip her finger into the crevice between it and the shirt so she could pull it down gently.</p><p>“What did you want to talk about?” Rio husked out as she loosened the tie.</p><p>“Hard No’s?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Hard No’s would be Degradation. Sadism. Ageplay that just grosses me out every time I see a romance title at work with that as one of the tags. Soft maybe’s would be Bondage. Sensory play. Impact play. Fuck Yes’s would be Praise. Hair pulling. Marking. Magical connection play. Strap Ons.” Rio said as she pulled Agatha’s tie apart and tossed it aside. She then reached up to unbutton the top three buttons of her dress shirt.</p><p>“I agree with most of them. But please, don’t ever pull my hair, you can play with it. But don’t pull hard. I will have a panic attack.” Agatha said as Rio continued to unbutton her shirt.</p><p>“I’ll remember that. Any other yes’s I should know about?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’ll give you the full list. Hard no’s. Degradation. Humiliation. Spitting. Hair pulling. Sadism. Blood play. Soft maybe’s Orgasm denial. Overstimulation. Light BDSM, only because I trust you and I didn’t have a panic attack the other night because I knew I could escape. Fuck Yes’s would be Praise. Love bites. Marking as long as I can cover it up. Strap Ons. Magical connection play.”</p><p>“You just unintentionally added to my Hard No’s I didn’t even think about a couple of those.” Rio said with a shudder before continuing. “Is that it or did you have something else?”</p><p>“Probably should set up a safe word so we don’t have to pause like we did the other night.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“Traffic light for now?” Rio asked feeling in a rush to get Agatha into bed.</p><p>“That works. Sorry, I just wanted to get that out of the way.” Agatha apologized.</p><p>“I want us to have a safe and healthy sex life, open and honest communication is the key to that. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way. I’m going to devour you.” Rio stated before her voice dipped down into a sensual husk of breath. A chill ran down Agatha’s spine as Rio continued to unbutton her shirt. She reached the one button on the suit jacket and quickly undid it. Hands paused for a moment before sliding up and shoving the jacket to the floor.</p><p>“I’m not patient enough for this tonight, sorry.” Agatha said as she waved her hand and then they were both naked. Agatha’s suit completely gone from the room as Rio’s clothes landed in the hamper. Agatha’s rings seeming to vanish as well.</p><p>“You could’ve done that the whole time?”<br/>Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“I could’ve but it’s normally more fun undressing someone. Now get on the bed.” Agatha said as she pushed Rio toward the bed softly.</p><p>“Yes ma’am!” Rio said excitedly as she backed up then collapsed on the bed Agatha decided to drop to her knees on the floor and spread Rio’s legs before diving right in. Her tongue finding Rio’s clit quickly.</p><p>Moans spilled from Rio’s lips as Agatha took control. Rio’s legs came up to rest on Agatha’s shoulders as the woman wrapped her arms around Rio’s hips to anchor her in place. Agatha crossed her ankles and settled on them comfortably, so she could focus wholly on Rio.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha!” Rio moaned out as Agatha swirled her tongue around Rio’s clit. The sensitive bud was soft and warm against Agatha’s tongue. A self satisfied moan came from between Rio’s legs as Agatha continued to eat her out.  Hands trepidatiously reached for hair but then landed on Agatha’s hands instead, fingers weaving together as she gripped them. Tears threatened to spring from Agatha’s eyes at the realization and care.</p><p>Doubling down her efforts Agatha sped up her tongues movements. Twisting and curling her tongue around the sensitive bud as she watched Rio’s chest rise and fall, breaths coming at a rapid rate and she moaned. With a flick of her tongue around Rio’s clit in a circular motion Rio gripped her hands harder.</p><p>“Yes! Right there!” Rio moaned out as she rolled her hips. Agatha listened and continued the motion over and over again slowly building up speed before Rio tumbled over the edge. “Fuck yes!” Rio screamed as she came.  Agatha pulled away and smiled up at Rio who looked like she was trying to breathe.</p><p>“I could do this all night, I love the sounds you make.” Agatha said as she turned her head and kissed Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“Heh, I thought I was supposed to be devouring you. Not the other way around.” Rio huffed out.</p><p>“I think the problem is two very dominant personalities are fighting for the top here. So we are both going to have to learn to take turns.” Agatha said before she softly bit the inside of Rio’s thigh before she soothed it with her tongue.</p><p>“That tongue of yours makes it easy to be submissive.” Rio moans out as Agatha sucks softly on the spot before removing her mouth and gently nudging Rio’s thighs off her shoulders.</p><p>“Good. Now. Describe your perfect dildo to me.” Agatha said as she kissed up Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“Uh why?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Humor me.” Agatha stated between kisses, she stopped to kiss each poppy flower on Rio’s hip once more before continuing up her body.</p><p>“Nothing over the top, five to six inches in length is perfect. Maybe something a little thicker but not hard to take. Why does it matter?” Rio asked as Agatha continued to kiss up her torso.</p><p>“Because you aren’t the only one with magic here darling.” Agatha said she continued to kiss up Rio’s body. Rio felt cold leather against her knees that were settled on Agatha’s hips. Rio looked down to see a deep purple harness and toy settled between Agatha’s legs.</p><p>“Is this okay?” Agatha asked softly as she slid her hands up Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Green light.” Rio whispered as she tried to pull Agatha closer to her.</p><p>“Wait, I need lube or a few more orgasm’s from you before we do this.” Agatha said trying to pause the moment.</p><p>“I’m wet enough. I promise. Is it enchanted?” Rio asked, still trying to pull Agatha closer.</p><p>“No, that takes a long form spell. I wanted to make sure it was comfortable for you before I put that kind of energy into it. Also, I’ll be the judge of that.” Agatha said as she brought her fingers up to Rio’s pussy and thrust into her. Curling her fingers and moaning at the feeling of Rio’s slick heat wrapping around her fingers.</p><p>“What if I want you to cum with me?” Rio whined out as Agatha curled her fingers and dragged them out.</p><p>“What if I want to make you cum so many times you forget your own name?” Agatha asked as she roughly fucked Rio who was barrel rolling toward the edge of oblivion again.</p><p>“Fuck! Agatha!” Rio screamed out as she clenched down on Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“Good girl, you’re so pretty when you cum for me.” Agatha praised before she removed her fingers and magicked a bottle of lube into her clean hand and opened it. She squeezed a generous amount onto the toy between her legs and then used her wet hand to rub it on the toy. “Are you ready?” Agatha asked softly as she glided the toy through Rio’s folds, hips twitching in response.</p><p>“Yes. Please. Goddesses above, I need to feel you against me.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Slide up the bed so I can do this properly.” Agatha said as she tapped Rio on the thigh. Rio slid up and settled onto the pillows comfortably, Agatha magicked a pillow under Rio’s hips and pulled her close before she slid the toy into Rio. Then she used her magic to clean her hand before she leaned forward and sunk fully into Rio.</p><p>“Goddesses, fuck that feels perfect.” Rio moaned out as Agatha kissed along her neck and torso.</p><p>“You are so beautiful. I love seeing you like this, under me, taking me fully.” Agatha praised again before she slowly started thrusting into Rio. Hands touching and sliding across Rio’s body sensually. Each graze and touch had Rio arching into her hands.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio moaned out as she reached for the woman above her. Agatha kept her pace as she leaned forward and captured Rio’s lips with her own. Kissing her deeply as she thrust into her at this new angle. Rio’s hands slid up Agatha’s back and tried to pull her close. Rio wrapped her legs around Agatha’s waist as she moaned into the kiss.</p><p>A moment later Agatha broke the kiss and kissed her way down to Rio’s collarbone where she had left a mark earlier this week. Agatha decided she was going to ruin Rio in every way possible. She started thrusting faster as she sucked on her collarbone, she left a mark and then moved onto the next leaving a trail of hickies on Rio.</p><p>“Ca… can I touch your…fuck! Hair?” Rio said between gasps and moans as she slid her hands up Agatha’s back slowly.</p><p>“Yes. Carefully.” Agatha said between panted breaths as she pulled her mouth away. Rio softly wove her fingers into Agatha’s hair and gently curled her fingers around the base of Agatha’s skull.  Soft twitches and finger swirls made Agatha softly moan as she kissed the hollow of Rio’s throat. “Perfect.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Go… good.” Rio moaned, she could feel herself inching closer to the edge. Agatha continued her assault along Rio’s collarbones, licking, kissing, sucking and bruising a trail of marks along it. Her hips unrelenting as she continued to thrust into Rio.  She started to pull away so she could adjust herself and Rio willingly let her hands fall from Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Perfect. Look at you darling.” Agatha praised as she reached and tweaked a nipple. Agatha’s other hand sliding between them to thumb softly at Rio’s clit.</p><p>“Agatha! Goddesses yes!” Rio screamed as she felt herself tumble over the edge. Sparks of green and purple flashing behind her eyes as she clenched down hard on the toy and came. Her back arched off the bed as her legs shook from the force of her orgasm, she could feel her heartbeat throb between her legs. Agatha sunk her hips as deep as she could go and stilled, waiting for Rio to catch her breath.</p><p>“How are you doing?” Agatha asked slightly out of breath but with a self satisfied smile on her face.  Rio was breathing heavily with her hand splayed across her chest. Eyes closed and looking flushed Agatha could see the string of hickies across Rio’s neck looking like a horribly fashioned necklace. Agatha’s grin grew wider with pride at the sight of Rio looking so mussed.</p><p>“Great! Fantastic even. But I need a moment!” Rio finally gasped out as Agatha rolled her clit with her thumb.</p><p>“My apologies.” Agatha said with a smirk as she removed her thumb but didn’t bother moving away from Rio.</p><p>“I’m enchanting this thing as soon as possible.” Rio said as she finally started to gain her focus.</p><p>“I could now, but then I fear I’ll be the mess in this situation.” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“Do it. Now. I want you to feel how you affect me.” Rio requested, it was almost a plea. Almost.</p><p>Agatha leaned back on her knees slightly and started the quiet enchantment, her fingers curled and swirling like she was stirring the air. A few moments later Rio and Agatha both felt another shift in the room, it was thrumming with magic. Then Agatha felt it, the pure molten heat that was Rio’s pussy.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha groaned as she felt Rio clench around the toy.</p><p>“It feels warmer all of a sudden.” Rio said as she squirmed a little, clenching down on the toy a few times before rolling her hips.</p><p>“That’s.. fuck. Because… it’s connected to my magic now… stop for a second so I can focus. Please.”</p><p>“Connected to your magic?” Rio asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“Yes, why did you ask like that?” Agatha asked as she felt a deep long tug on their connection that felt like Rio was trying to reel her in, and sink her deep inside the woman more so than she already was. “Fuck. Rio. Unfair.” Agatha said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“I think it’s plenty fair Agatha. Now, that you can feel me. Let’s see if you are still as composed about fucking me.” Rio said as she rolled her hips again.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t have used the word composed to explain how she was feeling in this moment. With Rio clenching down on the toy making her feel like she was enveloped in the woman’s heat. Hands slid up Rio’s body and softly grasped both breasts as she tweaked her nipples.</p><p>“Remember in the morning, you wanted this Rio.” Agatha said as she started thrusting into Rio at a rapid pace. Agatha felt almost feral in this moment, she wanted nothing more than to feel all of Rio. Hands grasped greedily at Rio’s flesh as Agatha continued to thrust into her. Moans spilled from Rio’s lips as Agatha felt the woman below her grip the toy between them tightly.</p><p>Agatha wanted more, she needed more. Greedy would be an understatement in this moment. Rio was grasping at Agatha’s forearms trying to anchor herself as moans and profanities came spilling from her lips.</p><p>“Fuck! Fuck! Oh my goddess! Fuck! Agatha!” Rio screamed out before Agatha leaned forward and captured her lips in a passionate kiss of clashing teeth and tongues. Rio felt herself cum again, sparks flying across her vision once more as Agatha continued to thrust into her. A loud moan emanating from her chest, before its muffled by Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Rio had to break away for air because her breathing was already so labored and ragged. Each thrust dragged something up from the depths, a sensation neither woman had felt before. They both felt something warm bloom in their chests as they tumbled over the edge together. Rio was clenching down hard on the toy as nails dug into Agatha’s forearms. Agatha felt like she was coming apart at the seams.</p><p>With in moments something changed, magical energy seemed to crackle inside of them, as it spread across their skin. A flash of purple and green sparked through the room before it settled in the middle of their chests. A long sigil of deep green trailed down between Agatha’s breasts, she could feel a warmth settle in her chest as she watched a deep purple sigil trail down Rio’s chest. The intricate runes settling on her skin like a tattoo. Both woman were panting fighting for breath as they stared at each others chests.</p><p>A soft and delicate hand slid from Rio’s bellybutton up the runes, making them spark and shimmer purple as they reacted to Agatha’s touch. “Is this a magical connection thing or a death thing?” Agatha asked softly as she felt the runes react to her.</p><p>“I have no clue…” Rio said as she followed the same path on Agatha’s body with her own hand.</p><p>“Let’s hope more of these don’t show up every time we cum together.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Do you know what these say?” Rio asked already knowing what the runes ment.</p><p>“It’s a love binding spell.” Agatha said as she pulled the toy out of Rio and magicked it away.</p><p>“Wait! I wanted to use that on you!” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“In a moment, I’m curious about this.” Agatha said as she leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to the middle of the purple script on Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio dragged her name out with a groan. Agatha continued kissing up the sigil until she reached the top.</p><p>“Also, that strap is enchanted for me to feel things not you. I’d have to make you your own.” Agatha explained as she settled next to Rio, tucking herself into her side.</p><p>“Ugh, unfair.” Rio whined.</p><p>“I’ll make you the perfect one in a moment. Just give me a second. I’m still thinking about this.” Agatha said as she ran her finger down the sigil. She could feel her own magic reach out and caress her finger.</p><p>“Goddresses above that is a sensitive area now.” Rio said with a gasp.</p><p>“Sensitive good? Or sensitive bad?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Good, definitely good. It feels like our connection but deeper. Almost like I can feel what you’re feeling when you touch it.” Rio explained.</p><p>“What am I feeling then?” Agatha asked softly as she pressed her hand to the sigil.</p><p>“Curiosity, desire, love, arousal, but mostly curiosity.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Fascinating. Sorry, let me remedy that.” Agatha said as she waved a hand over Rio’s hips, a deep green leather harness and toy settled on her hips. The toy was the same length and width as Rio’s but its head curved upwards a little more.</p><p>“Do you want me to enchant it first or do you want to experience it by itself?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Enchant it, it will give us a chance to see if more sigils will pop up, and I’ll get to feel you cum around me.” Rio said honestly. Agatha started the enchantment as she sat up. Moving her hand in the same way she did for her own device. Rio felt the spell lock into place and she could feel the connection.</p><p>“Wow. How did you figure this out?” Rio asked as she looked down at the toy.</p><p>“Do you really want to ruin the mood like that right now?” Agatha asked in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“I’ve got you now, whatever you learned for an ex is now mine. I don’t care if you’ve ever used an enchanted toy on another woman, this right here.” Rio said as she pointed at her chest. “Means you’re mine forever.”</p><p>“That college girlfriend I told you about that broke up with me because I had no time for her? I created this spell for her as an anniversary gift. Never got to use it though. She dumped me the day before. Never bothered using it on one night stands either. Seemed empty, and stupid.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“So you made this spell just for me?” Rio teased.</p><p>“In a sense, yes. You could look at it that way.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“I’m going to, obviously she fumbled you so I could have you. The universe sent me you, and I am more than grateful for that gift.” Rio told Agatha before turning her head to press a soft kiss to her forehead. “Now, get comfortable. I’m about to return the favor.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at Rio as she laid on her side and Rio slid over so Agatha could get on the pillow she was just on. Agatha settled her hips on the pillow and then rested her head on the pillows that smelled so much like Rio it was almost too comforting.</p><p>“Fuck. Did you feel this way when you laid down in my bed for the first time?” Agatha asked feeling enveloped in Rio’s scent.</p><p>“Like I was surrounded by your scent? Like I couldn’t escape the essence of you?” Rio questioned as she made the bottle of lube reappear in her hand. She put some on the toy and stroked it letting out a small moan in the process at the sensation.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha answered as she brought her hands up to caress the pillows and burry her face in them to take in the smell that was distinctly Rio. While Agatha was distracted Rio slid between her legs and brought her lubed fingers up to her pussy and thrust into her slowly. A moan left both women at the same time.</p><p>“Goddesses above you are so wet.”</p><p>“That happens when you… fuck… can feel your… damn ah! Partner cum! Rio!” Agatha struggled to get out. Each thrust was drawing Agatha closer to the edge. “Please! I want you!” Agatha begged.</p><p>“You have me. I promise.” Rio said as she pulled her fingers out and lined the toy up with her entrance before slamming her hips into Agatha. A low guttural moan came from Rio as she sunk into Agatha.</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha said excitedly as she felt Rio fill her.</p><p>“Goddesses, you feel so hot.” Rio said as she started to thrust into Agatha. Agatha was moaning and whimpering into the pillows she was clutching.</p><p>“Fuck, oh fuck!” Agatha moaned out as she felt herself already so close to the edge.</p><p>“How did you… shit! last so long?” Rio asked as she felt herself climbing to the peak of an orgasm so quickly. She could feel Agatha clenching down on her with every thrust.</p><p>“Almost feral desire.” Agatha said as clearly as she could between the moans and thrusts. Rio brought her hand between them and found Agatha’s clit with her thumb. Moans and whimpers fell from Agatha’s lips as she felt herself get closer to the edge.</p><p>“Come on baby. Give me what I want. I’m so close.” Rio begged, she could feel her own orgasm approaching.</p><p>“Fuck! Yes Rio!” Agatha screamed as she felt herself cum, her walls clamping down on the toy, forcing Rio to sink her hips in deep as she fell apart as well.</p><p>“Fuck, that spell is powerful.” Rio groaned out after a long moment.</p><p>“Why thank you.” Agatha said with a giggle as the fuzziness started to fade from her vision.</p><p>“I don’t see any new runes. So I guess that means I need to try harder.” Rio said attempting to focus as she started to thrust into Agatha again. Long, slow thrusts that felt almost agonizingly slow.</p><p>“Now your just being a tease.” Agatha groaned out as she reached for Rio’s waist.  Rio slapped her hands away softly before she leaned down and kissed along the sigils on Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Oh! Shit! What the fuck?” Agatha questioned as she felt an overwhelming tenderness. Rio smiled softly as she continued to slowly thrust into Agatha as she kissed each sigil from the bottom of the green sigil to the top, each mark getting even more tenderness than the last.</p><p>“Let me appreciate you Agatha.” Rio whispered between the kisses. “Let me show you what it means to be loved.” Rio said tenderly. Agatha felt tears well up in her eyes as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Utterly unfair.” Agatha gasped out as Rio picked up her pace slightly. Just enough to make Agatha moan softly as Rio thrust into her.</p><p>“You have been so strong for so long, let me care for you.” Rio said as she continued to kiss each sigil over and over again. Hands roaming over Agatha’s body sensually and slowly.</p><p>“I need more.” Agatha begged.</p><p>“Let me enjoy this for a moment, I want to remember this moment forever.” Rio said as she looked down at the gorgeous woman in her bed. Hair messed up, hands fisting the pillows, tears in her eyes from the tenderness of it all, and a smile plastered on her face. Blue eyes looking at her with a reverence that she had never experienced. Like she was the only thing on the planet that mattered in this moment.</p><p>“Please, Rio. I need you.” Agatha begged again.</p><p>“You have me.” Rio said softly before she started thrusting into Agatha faster, slowly picking up the pace as she thrust into her.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha moaned out as she reached for Rio again. This time Rio took her hands in her own and brought them back to above Agatha’s head. Pinning her to the bed, Rio started to thrust faster into Agatha. Both of them moaning at the feeling of being so close. Agatha was overwhelmed with emotions as she felt herself creeping closer to the edge with each thrust.  Both women were starting to lose their composure the closer they got.</p><p>“Fuck! Agatha, you feel so good.” Rio moaned into Agatha’s neck as she kissed it.</p><p>“Rio, Rio please! Please!” Agatha begged, Rio released Agatha’s hands and pulled herself up so she could thrust faster into Agatha. Her pace now rapidly dragging Agatha to her release. She felt herself clench down hard on Rio, her back arching off the bed as she came. She felt herself gush, drenching herself and Rio in the process.</p><p>“Fuck. Did you just.” Rio asked in a deep and heady tone.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said absolutely winded, her breath had been stolen.</p><p>“Again.” Rio said as she started thrusting into Agatha.</p><p>“Wha…oh goddess!” Agatha moaned out, her body arching into Rio’s thrusts. The pace was absolutely unrelenting. Rio had found that feral desire Agatha was talking about earlier. She slid a thumb between them and found Agatha’s clit easily, she pressed and rolled the bud quickly. Agatha felt a head rush, like her whole world was spinning.</p><p>“Be a good girl and cum Agatha.” Rio demanded, adding to Agatha’s arousal and desire. She felt herself clamp down hard on Rio’s toy as she arched off the bed again. She felt her legs shake and jaw clench as she came, moaning loudly into Rio’s pillow. The smell of Rio hitting her like a ton of bricks as she felt herself coming down. Her head was still spinning as she realized she needed to breath. A deep gasp tore from Agatha’s throat as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>“Good girl. My perfect Spirit Witch. My match.” Rio praised. Agatha felt so overwhelmed by emotions. Her heart really did feel like it was about to explode. She reached for Rio who came closer. Agatha pressed her whole hand against Rio’s sigil and just sighed. She was so happy she could share this raw emotion with Rio.</p><p>Tears sprung to Rio’s eyes as she placed her hand over Agatha’s. Her heart felt like it was too full, like every emotion was spilling out of an overflowing cup. Rio didn’t know what to do or say so she just leaned forward and placed soft kisses on every surface of Agatha she could reach before she finally landed on her lips. The passion they had blended with something new and raw, Agatha felt so overjoyed that she felt a giggle bubble up mid kiss.</p><p>“My heart hurts.” Rio said as she pulled her mouth away from Agatha. To look into blue eyes that seemed as endless as the sky.</p><p>“So does mine, this is what you do to me.” Agatha explained before laughing softly, finally feeling understood.</p><p>“I’m not sorry about it.” Rio said before she leaned down and gave Agatha a soft kiss.</p><p>“Let’s get rid of this, before we get too comfy.” Agatha said as she waved her hand. The toy disappearing somewhere out of sight. Rio collapsed between Agatha’s legs as she settled comfortably on the woman.</p><p>“What if I wasn’t done?” Rio asked as she kissed the side of Agatha’s neck</p><p>“You can use your fingers or tongue.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“If I’m allowed to use a spell on your body personally I’d gladly eat you out.” Rio said as she sat up.</p><p>“What is the spell?” Agatha asked extra curious now.</p><p>“It’s essentially a flush. Just to get rid of the lube so I can taste you purely.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Yes you can.” Agatha said as she relaxed into the bed. Ran her hand over Agatha’s core and landed on her pubic bone a small surge of warmth later Agatha felt a little wetter.</p><p>“Why didn’t we use this as lubrication earlier?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It’s hit or miss, you could’ve felt very dry after.” Rio explained.</p><p>“I’ll look over the incantation if there is one later and we’ll make it work.” Agatha explained her mind going into overdrive on how to get this spell to be one hundred percent accurate.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and allowed Agatha to spiral so she could get herself in position. She settled between Agatha’s thighs and laid down on her stomach as she kissed along Agatha’s thighs. She encouraged Agatha to spread her legs and dove in.</p><p>Rio took Agatha’s clit into her mouth and swirled her tongue around it. Agatha’s hands found the back of Rio’s head quickly as she moaned softly. Rio felt a deep desire to consume Agatha. She wanted all of this woman. She dipped her tongue down to collect a taste of Agatha from her core before she moved back up to her clit.</p><p>“Oh, Rio.”  Agatha moaned softly, as she pulled Rio closer. Softly pulling Rio’s hair as she rolled her hips. Rio wanted to savor Agatha in this moment. She didn’t want this moment to end. Slow languid swirls and flicks made Agatha’s hips twitch.</p><p>“I’m going to get …over sensitized…  if you don’t make me cum.” Agatha told Rio, her hips twitching softly as her breath caught in her throat. Rio moaned softly and then picked up the pace knowing that this was probably the last orgasm she was getting from Agatha tonight.</p><p>“Ah! Yes!” Agatha screamed out as she felt Rio start to flick her tongue faster. Rio kept the pace and soon Agatha was tumbling over the edge. Agatha laid there for a moment and collected her breath. Rio tilted her head to the side and looked up at Agatha while resting her head on her thigh.</p><p>“It’s really unfair, that we keep ending our nights like this.” Agatha said, sounding tired.</p><p>“Oh? How is that?” Rio asked as she kissed up Agatha’s body.</p><p>“With me exhausted.” Agatha said with a sigh. Rio burst out laughing, something warm and bright that made Agatha’s heart feel like it was overflowing with emotions again.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, how dare you relax.” Rio joked before she kissed Agatha passionately. A smile painting their lips after they broke apart, foreheads and noses still touching as they looked deeply into each other’s eyes.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said with a smile,</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“Showing me I deserve love.”  Agatha said before she kissed Rio again. This time touching the sigil on her chest softly.  They laid together like that for a long time before they started to get tired. Agatha magicked her phone next to her and turned an alarm on for the morning then kissed Rio one more time before she cuddled into her side and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Rio was woken up by Agatha’s alarm. The woman seemed to get up at an ungodly hour compared to her. She groaned and snuggled into Agatha.</p><p>“Nooooo tooo early.” Rio groaned.</p><p>“I have to go home and shower and get ready for the day.” Agatha said with a sigh as she rubbed her eyes.</p><p>“Or you could lay here with me a little longer, we shower together, and you use your magic to bring an outfit to you.” Rio offered.</p><p>“That sounds better.” Agatha said with a sigh. She changed her alarm and cuddled back onto Rio. Forty five minutes later Agatha’s phone started pinging loudly.</p><p>Wanda 7:30 a.m: Witch! Where the fuck are you!?</p><p>Wanda 7:31 a.m: Seriously? What am I supposed to eat for breakfast?</p><p>Wanda 7:31 a.m: are you alive?</p><p>After the third message in a row Agatha rolled over and grabbed her phone to read the messages.</p><p>Agatha 7:32 a.m: Rio’s… fend for your self. Love you.</p><p>Wanda 7:32 a.m: Excuse me?!</p><p>Agatha sighed and set her phone down. She nudged Rio softly. “Darling. I have to get ready now or I’ll be late for work.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll get up.” Rio groaned again as she sat up. She threw the blankets off them and made her way toward the bathroom. Agatha chuckled and got up to follow her sleepy partner.</p><p>-Meanwhile at Wanda’s-</p><p>“The nerve of this woman. I’m so proud of her!” Wanda said as she sipped her cup of coffee while standing in her living room looking at the empty driveway next door. She then turned around and went to grab the pop tarts she was making out of the roster so she could eat her sugar filled breakfast without being lectured.</p><p>“I’m glad she finally found someone, happiness has always looked good on her.” Wanda said with a smile as she thought about all the bullshit her bestfriend went through and how, maybe, just maybe it was all worth it.</p><p>-Rio’s Apartment-</p><p>Agatha and Rio were out of the shower and drying off in Rio’s bedroom, Agatha had a smirk on her face as she realized during the shower she had left several marks on Rio.</p><p>“Stop being so smug, we both have to work today. Otherwise I’d offer to repay you.” Rio said sternly.</p><p>“I’d love that but I have a hearing today at 10, then several meetings. But if you want to come over tonight I’m sure we can work something out.” Agatha flirted as she walked over to Rio and dragged her index finger down the sigil on Rio’s chest. Rio felt a flush of desire as Agatha touched her.</p><p>“Depends on how your day goes darling. Keep me informed. Now get dressed please. I cannot focus with you naked.” Rio requested.</p><p>“Yes Dear.” Agatha said before stepping back. With a wave of her hand instantly she was dressed in deep blue suit with a white button up. Her rings were back in place, long hair done up in a perfect bun and a deep green tie with gold monstera leaf stitching nestled at her throat. Black shoes pulled the outfit together.  Agatha’s brest pocket also had a kerchief that matched the tie peaking out.</p><p>“I… uh… wow.” Rio said as Agatha straightened her jacket and checked her rings.</p><p>“You okay babe?” Agatha asked as she looked over at Rio who seemed to be malfunctioning. Rio blinked a couple times before she regained cognitive thought.</p><p>“You. How. Fuck. Sorry… You look fantastic.”</p><p>“Thank you. Should I help you get dressed before I have to run out the door?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“No give me a second.” Rio said as she turned and opened a drawer. She grabbed a bra and panties before moving on to the closet to grab a shirt and pants. Rio quickly got dressed and walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“Have a good day at work.” Rio said as she gave Agatha a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“You too. Thank you so much for everything last night.” Agatha said pulling Rio close into a soft embrace.</p><p>“You never need to thank me for taking care of you. It’s nice but not needed.” Rio said as she leaned her head against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Well I can’t appreciate you in the way I want to right now so. A thank you is going to have to suffice.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I don’t want to be the reason you are late for the first time ever. Go. Please. Before I get you in trouble.” Rio begged knowing she didn’t want to let Agatha go.</p><p>“I’m going. I’m going.” Agatha said softly as she let Rio go, she gave her a soft peck on the cheek before she pulled away.</p><p>“Be safe, text me.” Rio said as she grabbed Agatha softly by the face so she could kiss her one last time. Agatha kissed her back quickly before pulling away.</p><p>“I will, I promise. It will be tonight before you know it.” Agatha reassured as she squeezed Rio’s hand softly. Before she headed out into the living room. Rio following her like a lost puppy in the process. Agatha magicked her keys and phone into her hand and grabbed the door knob.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you soon.” Agatha said as she gave Rio one last kiss on the cheek before she disappeared out the door.</p><p>“That woman is going to be the death of me.” Rio whispered as placed her hand over her chest and just breathed a deep breath.</p><p>Agatha got in her car and sighed sadly. If she didn’t have a hearing today she would’ve called off for the first time in history. She took a deep breath and headed into work. She arrived earlier than normal because Rio’s place was actually closer than her own.</p><p>“Convenient.” Agatha whispered as she parked. Today seemed like a good day to stop at the café on the first floor and get herself some coffee and breakfast. She walked up to the counter and smiled brightly at the barista working there.</p><p>“Good morning, what can I get started for you today?” The barista asked in a cheerful tone.</p><p>“Can I get a strawberry frutti refresher with extra caffeine? And a breakfast sandwich please.”</p><p>“Of course, your total is $14 with your discount.” The woman told Agatha. She paid and left a generous tip then went to the other end of the counter to wait for her drink and food. Once everything was done Agatha grabbed it and thanked the woman before making her way to the elevators.</p><p>It wasn’t unusual to see Agatha in the office so early, that was commonplace. What was unusual to see was Agatha in the office so early, carrying a drink and food from the café with a smile on her face. It was even more unusual to see Agatha dressed to the nines without a single speck of purple in sight.</p><p>Tricia sat at her desk in utter shock at the sight in front of her. She had never seen her boss smile so brightly.</p><p>“Good morning Tricia, thank you for holding down the fort yesterday.” Agatha said as she walked past her secretary’s desk and breezed into her office before shutting the door.</p><p>“What the fuck.” Tricia said quietly, before she went back to work.</p><p>Agatha sat down at her desk and started getting everything she would need for the hearing today ready. She ate her sandwich quickly and slowly sipped her drink. Once everything was collected and ready to go she tucked everything in her briefcase and logged out of her computer. She stood up and headed out her office door.</p><p>“I’ll be back for my 12:30 meeting. Can you make sure lunch is here when I get back?” Agatha asked politely.</p><p>“Of course. Any requests?” Tricia asked side eyeing her boss as she typed.</p><p>“Something light. A grilled chicken salad or a wrap. Please and thank you. Make sure you order yourself food as well.” Agatha said as she stood next to her secretary’s desk.</p><p>“Can do. Good luck.” Tricia said as she looked over at Agatha who seemed to have a soft smile on her face still.</p><p>“Thanks. See you soon.” Agatha said as she started walking toward the elevator. Once inside she pulled her phone out and checked her messages.</p><p>Rio 8:54 a.m: 9. You left 9 hickies on me…</p><p>Agatha felt another smile spread across her face at the memory of leaving those marks.</p><p>Agatha 9:20 a.m: sorry, not sorry. I get possessive of what’s mine and you are MINE. On my way to court.</p><p>Rio 9:21 a.m: I hate that you are at work.</p><p>Agatha 9:22 a.m: I hate it as well. But the thought of you still has me smiling. I gotta drive. I’ll text you soon.</p><p>Agatha sent the last text and tucked her phone away so she could make her way to her car. She unlocked it, climbed in and started it. As she was pulling onto the road she got a phone call. Pepper always called before hearings this one was high profile so she answered.</p><p>“Good morning Pepper!” Agatha said cheerfully into the phone.</p><p>“I’ve canceled your 12:30 meeting. You and I are meeting for lunch.” Pepper said into the phone as she sat down at her desk.</p><p>“Oh? Why’s that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Because you’ve got half the office in a tizzy and I want to hear all the good shit from the source.” Pepper answered.</p><p>“How do I have half the office in a tizzy?” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“From what I’ve gathered, you came in on time, but you were carrying your breakfast with you and some fruity drink? You were smiling like a real genuine smile, and here’s the kicker and the one I believe the least. You aren’t wearing any purple today.” Pepper said with a scoff. The idea of Agatha not wearing any purple was laughable.</p><p>“No, all of that is accurate.” Agatha told Pepper as she turned into the courthouse parking lot. The phone almost seemed like it went dead. Agatha could tell they were still connected though. “Earth to Pepper, hello.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“If I could reschedule a hearing…” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“Funny, very funny. I’ll fill you in later. I promise. But also I think I look damn good today.” Agatha said as she disconnected her phone from her car and got out. She placed it against her ear and locked her car before heading inside.</p><p>“Go get this hearing sorted out and get back here ASAP. Bye.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“Yes Ma’am. See you soon.” Agatha said before hanging up.</p><p>Agatha made it into the court house and room with no event. She was thankful for meeting up with her client last week so that this would go smoothly. She checked her phone one last time before she tucked it away.</p><p>The judge arrived a few moments later and they started the hearing. Agatha presented her evidence as to why the need for a trial was unnecessary as cleanly as possible. Her opponent seemed to be struggling with the clean part, but she let him dig his own grave.</p><p>The judge didn’t even bother going to her chambers to debate on a thing or process the information.</p><p>“I see no reason to take this case to trial, it is dismissed. No further action is to be taken.” The judge said before pounding their gavel.</p><p>“Thank you Ms. Harkness, I appreciate all your efforts.” Her client said to her.</p><p>“No problem, this was easy. They didn’t have a leg to stand on. Just stay away from people like him in the future.” Agatha said jabbing her thumb in the direction of the other side of the court room.</p><p>“Oh trust me I learned my lesson. Have a wonderful day.” The young woman said as Agatha packed her things up. After Agatha had collected everything she made her way back to her car. She had a lunch meeting to attend.</p><p>Back at the office everyone was working quietly and efficiently. Agatha’s full staff was there by the time she made her way back in after the hearing. As soon as she stepped off the elevator everyone looked up to see her. She shook her head and rolled her eyes as she walked over to Tricia’s desk.</p><p>“I assume you’ve been informed about my meeting and lunch plans?” Agatha asked softly as she stood next to Tricia’s desk and looked down at her assistant.</p><p>“Yes ma’am. She is already waiting for you in her office.”</p><p>“I guess I’ll go now. Have a good lunch break if you haven’t taken one.” Agatha said as she patted Tricia’s desk and walked back toward the elevator. She got in and pressed the button to head to Peppers office.</p><p>The ride upstairs was much shorter than the ride up from the lobby. Agatha stepped off the elevator and walked straight past the empty secretary’s desk into Peppers office.</p><p>“Lunch will be here soon.” Pepper said without looking up from her computer walked over to Pepper’s desk and sat down in the chair across from Pepper.</p><p>Once Pepper was finished writing she looked up at Agatha. Her eyebrows raised almost instantly, as she took Agatha’s outfit in.</p><p>“I’ve seen that suit hundreds of times. The tie on the other hand is new.” Pepper observed.</p><p>“Sorry?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I was just having a hard time believing you actually walked into work this morning not wearing any purple. It’s your signature color.”</p><p>“Well… I was distracted this morning while getting my outfit together…” Agatha trailed off, thinking about Rio this morning.</p><p>“Tell me all about this distraction. I want the long witchy version.” Pepper said curiously.</p><p>“Goddesses above we don’t have that much time.” Agatha said as she smiled brightly.</p><p>“I’ll make time.” Pepper said as she leaned forward and looked at Agatha seriously.</p><p>“Fine. This past Saturday I found her bookstore on Instagram. Wanda and I went and checked it out. I was browsing the spell book section and I picked up this gorgeous green and gold spell book that caught my eye. Tucked it into my arms, then found a couple more books. She flirted with me a as I was browsing. Then Wanda scolded me for not flirting back so I sent her to the coffee shop down the street. Once I was finished looking around I went to buy the books. She tried to give me a discount.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“How much of a discount?” Pepper asked. Fully focused on the story.</p><p>“Thirty five dollars. To which I told her if she charge me full price I would come back alone the next time I visited. She asked for my name and we shook hands. Then the strangest thing happened. Our magic almost seemed to reach out and connect.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I assume that’s not normal?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Unheard of honestly, that’s besides the point. I left and found Wanda and headed home. Wanda checked her books I bought her for a book mark with her number and found nothing. I sent Wanda home and grabbed the spell book to check it out. I opened to the first page and realized she had let me take her personal spell book.”</p><p>“No way! Why was it just sitting on the shelf?” Pepper asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Because it had a spell on it so no one could see it, which I found out because I sent a photo to Wanda and she was like ‘I’ve seen your rings, why are you sending me a photo of your hand?’ Which led Wanda being Wanda and barging back into my house and asking a million questions. We found out the spell was so strong she couldn’t even listen to me read it to her.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“So what makes you so special?” Pepper asked as the door opened and Peppers secretary walked in with their lunches.</p><p>“Thank you Timothy. Much appreciated. Go enjoy your lunch break.” Pepper said after he set the food down. They both waited for the young man to leave.</p><p>“I was wondering the same thing so I willed the book to open and show me what it wanted me to see. It opened to a page about magical compatibility.” Agatha explained as she opened her container, apparently Tricia communicated with Timothy about what she wanted for lunch.</p><p>“What is magical compatibility?” Pepper asked as she opened her own container and took grabbed her plastic fork from the bag so she could eat.</p><p>“Still learning about that. But so far it’s our magic intertwining together. We feel this deep connection, I can feel this thread of a connection that if I pull on it she can feel me. Almost like I’m calling her to me.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Is that all?” Pepper asked wanting to know more. She was just as curious about this as Agatha at this point.</p><p>“No, it is more than that. It’s deeply connected to intimacy. But you don’t need to know about all that.” Agatha said with a wave of her hand as she grabbed a fork with her free hand.  She opened it and took a bite of her salad.</p><p>“Okay so… I mean I might…” Pepper said curiously.</p><p>“I’m curious if other people besides Rio and I can see the sigil that appeared last night… but… you are my boss.” Agatha said as she took another bite of her Salad.</p><p>“Just show me Harkness.” Pepper said in an almost demanding tone.</p><p>“Frost the glass, I have to undress slightly to show you.” Agatha requested. A moment later a button was pressed and Agatha loosened her tie so she could unbutton a her shirt. She popped the top 5 buttons and showed Pepper the sigil on her chest.</p><p>“A green tattoo is the last color I expected to see.” Pepper said as she looked at the sigil creeping up from  Agatha’s cleavage.</p><p>“It’s not a tattoo. It’s a love binding spell that appeared last night while we were having sex. It’s her magic, she has the same one but in deep purple that is the same color as my magic… When she touches it I can feel what she’s feeling.” Agatha explained as she buttoned her shirt, and fixed her tie.</p><p>“So you are figuratively married?” Pepper asked, trying to connect the dots.</p><p>“No? I mean our connection is very deep and intimate at this moment in time. I feel like we are bound together by our magic. So eventually yes I’d like to marry her.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Okay. So you’ve met your magical soul mate. Are happy, confusing the fuck out of your staff, and green is your girlfriend’s favorite color so you wore it today, correct?” Pepper asked hoping she covered all the bases.</p><p>“Essentially. Also green is starting to grow on me.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“I’d hope so, I’m pretty sure that you are stuck with it for the rest of your life now.” Pepper said pointing at Agatha’s now covered chest. She then pressed the button to unfrost the glass.</p><p>“Any other questions?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Not at this moment in time. Let me know if you need time off so you and Rio can spend time together.” Pepper said as she continued to eat her salad.</p><p>“Thanks. I appreciate that.” Agatha said before she took another bite.</p><p>“So how did the hearing go?” Pepper asked changing the subject.</p><p>“Just fine, the judge didn’t even think there was enough for a trail so it was dismissed. I have a few more meetings with clients today and then I need to head home and deal with Wanda.” Agatha said thinking about her best friend.</p><p>“I do quite like her. She’s a good therapist for the company.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“She’s a great friend as well but I’d never say that to her face” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“Why not?” Pepper questioned.</p><p>“Her ego is the size of Texas let’s not make it any bigger.” Agatha said honestly before continuing “She knows I love her, and care deeply about her. But I gotta keep her in her place ya know.” Agatha explained before she finished eating her salad.</p><p>“Just like I don’t tell Tony he’s a genius often. He’d be unbearable!” Pepper agreed.</p><p>“Thanks for lunch Pepper, I have meetings I have to attend unfortunately.” Agatha explained as she closed her container and stood up. She turned walked over to the door and grasped the handle.</p><p>“Wait, one more question before you go.” Pepper said as she stood up.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha paused to turn and look at Pepper.</p><p>“Are you actually happy?” Pepper asked genuinely.</p><p>“Happier than I have ever been.” Agatha said as she turned the nob and walked out of the office.</p><p>The rest of Agatha’s day was with out much event. She’d check her phone between meetings to see if Rio had texted.</p><p>Rio 2:30 p.m: How did the hearing go?</p><p>Agatha 2:31 p.m: Fantastic. Sorry I ment to text you earlier but Pepper had to have a lunch meeting with me after the hearing.</p><p>Rio 2:31 p.m: Hopefully you didn’t get in trouble because of me.</p><p>Agatha 2:32 p.m: No, never. But the gossip has started in the office because I didn’t wear purple today. People are losing their marbles. I have another meeting though. I’ll text you once it’s done.</p><p>Agatha sent the message off and then there was a knock on her door.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness your 2:45 is here early.” Tricia said.</p><p>“Let them in.” Agatha said with a smile as she stood up. Tricia opened the door and then a sight Agatha never wanted to see again was presented in front of her.</p><p>“Tricia call security.” Agatha said with an angry venom filled tone.</p><p>“Now is that any way to speak to your mother dear?” Evanora Harkness asked her daughter. She tried to step into the office but was blocked by a spell protecting the room.</p><p>“I’m surprised your glamor lasted long enough to make it up the stairs and past security. Who were you pretending to be?” Agatha asked, a tone filled with venom and anger.</p><p>“That’s of no importance.” Evanora said with a wave of her hand.</p><p>“Jeremy Elgolf, Ma’am. Security has been contacted and the floor evacuated.” Tricia said as she walked through the door way and got behind Agatha.</p><p>“Unnecessary measures.” Evanora said with a sneer.</p><p>“What do you want Evanora?” Agatha asked her tone full of venom.</p><p>“Call off the Scarlet Witch. Your girlfriend has done more than enough damage.” Evanora sneered. Agatha started laughing almost hysterically.</p><p>“You think that I’m dating Wanda? That’s the funniest thing you’ve ever said to me!” Agatha said after she caught her breath.</p><p>“I know she’s the one hexing me! Tell her to stop!” Evanora spat at her daughter, her anger flaring up. Agatha sighed and pressed three fingers to her own chest rubbing them along the sigil there as an attempt to sooth herself.</p><p>“Stop with that behavior right this second!” Evanora yelled as she tried to march into the office but hit a purple wall.</p><p>“You don’t get to talk to me like that anymore Evanora!” Agatha yelled back at her mother.</p><p>“Like hell I don’t! You insolent brat! I demand you fix this!” Evanora yelled at her daughter. Fear surged through Agatha at the sight of her mother so angry. Then a moment later. Agatha felt a surge of magic and then suddenly Rio was standing in her office.</p><p>“What’s wrong! Babe are you okay?” Rio asked in a panicked tone.</p><p>“Rio! What are you doing here?! Who’s watching the store?” Agatha asked in a panicked tone, focusing on Rio.</p><p>“I locked up and put a sign on the door. Are you okay? What is happening?” Rio said as she took Agatha’s hand and soothed her thumb over the back of it.</p><p>“Who the fuck is this!” Evanora screamed at the two of them. Tricia was just standing there shocked at the events that were happening.</p><p>“I am Agatha’s girlfriend, Rio Vidal, of the Vidal Family. The Green Witch, and it will do you wise to watch your next words.” Rio said as she marched toward the woman and stepped through the doorway. Her power imposing deeply as she glared down at the woman.</p><p>“Why would I care who you are child! You are meaningless to me and this conversation.” Evanora waved Rio off but fear was painting her tone.</p><p>“Silence! You have caused more grief and pain than you are worth!” Rio yelled at the woman.</p><p>“You don’t get to speak to me this way.” Evanora yelled back gaining some confidence.</p><p>“You don’t get to speak at all!” Rio said as she made a silencing motion with her hand stealing Evanora’s voice.</p><p>“Once you leave this floor your voice will return. I won’t render you mute. Yet. But maybe you should educate yourself on my name before you think about bothering MY girlfriend ever again.” Rio said as she stabbed a finger into Evanora’s chest.</p><p>Security finally showed up and grabbed Evanora by the arms and escorted her out. They dragged the woman to the elevator and as soon as it shut Agatha collapsed onto the floor of her office. She was shaking uncontrollably, fear overwhelming her. Rio rushed over to  her Agatha and collected her in her arms.</p><p>“I’m here. It’s okay. I’m here.” Rio reassured as she pulled Agatha closer.</p><p>“How did she… why! Why can’t she just leave me alone!” Agatha asked in a frustrated and broken tone.</p><p>“I don’t know. But I’m going to handle it.” Rio said in an annoyed tone.</p><p>“Don’t… I can’t live without you. You don’t need jail time.” Agatha whispered as she hid her head in Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’m staying right here until you are okay. You called, I came.” Rio soothed as she rubbed Agatha’s back.</p><p>~down in the security office~</p><p>“Where is she!?” Pepper screamed as she ripped the door open. She was enraged beyond all reason.</p><p>“She’s in the holding room ma’am.” An officer said pointing in the direction of the room.</p><p>“Once I am done with her, we need to have a long conversation about response times.” Pepper said with a glare as she walked over to the door and opened it.</p><p>“Listen here you monstrous bitch! Do you have any idea how many laws and personal protection orders you just violated? I’m about to make your life an even bigger living hell than Wanda ever did!” Pepper said as she opened the door and glared at the woman sitting in a chair  with her hands clasped in magic suppressing gauntlets.</p><p>“I just want my suffering to end! Why do I have to suffer! She’s the fucking problem! That vile child stole everything from me! My youth, my power, my life! All she’s ever been is a burden!”</p><p>“You are the worst! You have no clue how horrible you really are, always playing the victim just because things don’t go your way! I know you tried to execute her! I know all of the horrible and vile things you did to her! I’ve seen the scars. You have reaped what you’ve sown! You aren’t a victim!” Pepper screamed. She had never wanted to harm someone so badly in her life.</p><p>“You know nothing! She’s a vile creature! She’s a spirit witch! All she does is take, take, take!”</p><p>“God you are literally the dumbest bitch I have ever met! She cannot steal someone’s powers until she is attacked! You did this to yourself you fucking moron! It’s a self defense mechanism. I’m a fucking human and I know that!” Pepper scolded. She desperately wanted to slap the living hell out of this woman.</p><p>“That’s not true! She’s evil!” Evanora screamed back at the woman. Something snapped inside Pepper.</p><p>“That’s it. I’m done. I’m having you arrested and booked. Then I’m suing you for emotional damage. You have no sense, and I’m done using my rage in the wrong way.” Pepper said as she walked over to the door and opened it. She quickly slammed the door shut leaving Evanora Harkness in her own idiocy.</p><p>Pepper walked over to the phone and dialed 911.</p><p>“911 what’s your emergency?”</p><p>“Hello, I’m Pepper Potts down at Stark Law. I need two officers trained to transport witches to come and arrest a woman who has trespassed and violated a PPO Against Agatha Harkness.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“We will send two officers down as soon as possible.” The woman said into the phone.</p><p>“Good. I’ll be waiting. Thank you.” Pepper said into the phone before the operator hung up. Pepper set the phone down on the receiver and turned to look at the man at the desk.</p><p>“Once I’m finished with this, your team and I are going to have a very long conversation.” Pepper said as she walked out of the office. Timothy was standing next to the door waiting.</p><p>“Timothy, can you please wait for the police for me? I really need to go check on Agatha.” Pepper asked softly.</p><p>“I’ll be right here Mrs. Potts. Keep your phone near by I’ll call you when they arrive.”</p><p>“Thank you. Tell her staff to go home as well please?” Pepper asked the young man.</p><p>“Of course.” Timothy said as Pepper made her way to the elevator.</p>

<p>Pepper stepped off the elevator and headed straight for Agatha’s office. Tricia was sitting in her chair looking absolutely horrified.</p><p>“Tricia. Go home, or down to the therapist’s office to talk about it.” Pepper instructed.</p><p>“Thank you ma’am” Tricia said hollowly as she got up and made her way towards the exit.</p><p>“I’m here. It’s okay. You are safe.” was what Pepper heard as she opened Agatha’s office door. Rio’s soothing voice calming Agatha on the floor.  Pepper slowly walked around the desk to see Agatha curled against Rio, her head nestled into the crux of Rio’s neck. A soothing hand running up and down Agatha’s back as she shook.</p><p>“Hey, it’s Pepper.” Pepper said softly as she crouched down. She looked over Agatha before she reached out and placed a gentle hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“So… Sorry Pepp..” Agatha started to say brokenly.</p><p>“No. No apologizing. It’s okay. You’re okay. We are okay. Just breathe. Four counts in, hold for five, exhale for six.” Pepper instructed. Rio was still running her hand along Agatha’s back as the other held one of Agatha’s hands. Agatha listened and started doing the breathing exercise.</p><p>“Good, tell me 5 things you can see.” Pepper instructed after Agatha calmed down a little.</p><p>“Carpet. Window, You, Rio, shoes.” Agatha answered shakily.</p><p>“Good. Four things you can feel or touch.” Pepper guided.</p><p>“Rio’s hands, your hand, my rings, my tie.” Agatha responded a little calmer.</p><p>“Awesome. Three things you can hear?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Your voice. Rio’s heartbeat, my stupid ass clock!”  Agatha said as she was finally starting to calm down. Overwhelming fear had been replaced with irritation.</p><p>“And two things you can smell?” Pepper requested.</p><p>“Rio’s perfume, Rio’s shampoo.” Agatha answered, feeling more at ease.</p><p>“One thing you can taste?” Pepper questioned.</p><p>“Bile.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Gross Agatha.” Pepper scolded softly before continuing. “Welcome back.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said weakly. Pepper could feel Rio’s eyes on her. She looked up and locked eyes with the woman holding her friend. Clearly questioning her as to where she got this information.</p><p>“When you’re married to Tony Stark, you learn how to handle panic attacks.” Pepper answered.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“I still have meetings to attend to.” Agatha said trying to recompose herself, attempting to focus on anything but what just happened.</p><p>“No, those are canceled. I’m sending your whole staff home. You just sit right here until you’re ready to get up. Then Rio is gunna take you home and we will figure this all out in the morning. Okay?” Pepper asked softly.</p><p>“Yes Pepper.” Agatha said with tears in her eyes, still feeling overwhelmed and broken. Then Peppers phone started ringing. She pulled it out and answered it.</p><p>“The police are here.” Is all Pepper needed to hear.</p><p>“Thank you, I’ll be right down.” Pepper said into the phone before hanging up. She then turned to look at Rio. “I have to go handle this. You’ve got her, right?”</p><p>“I’ve got her, thanks for your help.” Rio said honestly as she held Agatha.</p><p>“Any time. I’ll be back up as soon as I can.” Pepper said as she stood back up and left the office. Once the door was shut Agatha turned and pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’ve got you, I promise.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I know.” Agatha said with a sigh. She was still full of fear, but she knew she was safe in Rio’s arms.</p><p>“Give me your hand, I want to try something.” Rio requested. Agatha lifted her hand up and gave it to Rio. Rio took a deep calming breath and then thought about her family’s cabin, the woods that feel so ancient and youthful all at once. Things that used to calm her the most as a child, then she slid Agatha’s hand under her shirt and pressed it against the sigil. A wave of calm and joy flooded through Agatha.</p><p>“Woah!” Agatha said before a giggle erupted from her chest. She felt so much calmer.</p><p>“Good. Keep your hand there.” Rio told Agatha as she closed her eyes and thought about the first time she seen Agatha. How instantly smitten she was with the woman. Then she moved onto the feelings that have been growing over the last few days. Every moment that made her heart soar when she was with Agatha.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” Agatha asked quietly, her stomach was in knots and her heart felt like it was going to explode because it was so full of love.</p><p>“You.” Rio said honestly before she placed a soft kiss to Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>“Horrible.” Agatha joked trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>“I know right? How could someone so amazing make me feel like this? I’ll never know.” Rio said truthfully.</p><p>“Stop, I’ll cry again.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“I don’t want that. I just want you to know how you make me feel.” Rio said as she kissed Agatha’s forehead again.</p><p>“How did you get to me you’ve never been here before.” Agatha asked, trying to connect the dots.</p><p>“I don’t know what you did on your end, but one moment I’m standing in my empty book store waiting for a text back from you. The next I’m feeling every ounce of dread and anxiety there is on the planet. You must’ve touched your sigil because I could feel you tugging so hard on it, it was like you were yanking on a lifeline for someone to pull you out of some hole. After the second tug I magicked the bookstore closed and just let you pull me to you. Your magic brought me here.” Rio explained to Agatha as she continued to sooth her hand over Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Sorry.” Agatha apologized.</p><p>“You called. I came. I will always come to you when you call for me.” Rio explained softly.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha whispered as she removed her hand from under Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“You never have to fear that woman ever again. I’m here, Pepper is digging her heels in deep, and I don’t even want to think about what Wanda is going to do.” Rio said with a shudder. Agatha’s eyes went wide at the realization that her best friend had no clue what was happening.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha whispered in a tone Rio had never heard before.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“She’s in the building today…. I think… is it Wednesday?” Agatha asked trying to collect her thoughts.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Shit. Shit. shit. shit. I need my phone.” Agatha said in a slightly panicked voice. Rio reached up and grabbed it off the desk and handed it to her. Shaky hands tried their best to unlock the phone. Agatha finally got it open on the third attempt. She had several missed calls from Wanda; She hit the missed call and it started ringing.</p><p>“Can I please kill her now?” Wanda asked into the phone, Agatha could hear the rage in her best friend’s voice.</p><p>“As your lawyer I don’t advise that. As your best friend, she’s not worth it.” Agatha said into the phone, feeling absolutely exhausted.</p><p>“Are you in your office?” Wanda asked, Agatha could hear Wanda’s voice soften, trying to calm down for her friend.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Be there in five.” Wanda said into the phone and then hung up.</p><p>“What does Wanda do?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She’s a floating therapist for Stark Industries. She travels from building to building all week. Wednesday’s she’s here.”</p><p>“Good to know.” Rio said as she pulled Agatha closer to her.</p><p>“Magic takes the path of least resistance” Agatha said honestly as she leaned against Rio a little more and sighed. They sat there for a long moment before Agatha groaned loudly. “My ass hurts.”</p><p>“So does mine, but I’m staying right here until you want me to get up.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I want to get up.” Agatha said as she tried to pull away from Rio who gave her some resistance but finally let her go. She got up quickly before helping Rio up. As they were holding hands from the assist up Wanda walked in.</p><p>“How did you get here so fast?” Wanda asked looking over at Rio.</p><p>“Goddesses is that a loaded question.” Agatha said as she started packing all her things up and started shutting everything off.</p><p>“I’ll explain later, wanna help me get her home?” Rio asked softly, knowing Agatha was fragile right now.</p><p>“Did you drive here?” Wanda asked as she walked over to Agatha and took her into her arms. She hugged Agatha like they’d done this a million times before. Wanda was holding Agatha’s head softly with one hand while the other rubbed up and down her back. It felt so strange for Rio, she wasn’t jealous about it. She actually could feel how comforted Agatha felt by Wanda.</p><p>“No. I was dragged/teleported here.” Rio explained which caused Wanda to look at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“It’s a long story.” Agatha said as she pulled away from Wanda and turned to grab Rio’s hand before saying. “We will explain later. I just want to go home.”</p><p>“I have to go back down and finish my shift. The only reason I knew anything was because Tricia was a little horrified and asked to speak to me personally.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Tricia! Is she okay?” Agatha asked in a horrified tone, realizing what her secretary experienced.</p><p>“She’s fine, let’s focus on you for now.” Wanda said as she guided Agatha and Rio out of the office. “I’ll get you down to her car and then you can take her back to her place. I’ll be home around 5:30.”</p><p>“I can do that.” Rio said as she guided Agatha over to the elevator.</p><p>“What about…” Agatha started to ask.</p><p>“No, stop worrying about everyone else. You need to worry about you.” Wanda said cutting Agatha off. Agatha huffed at her best friend who gave her a pointed look.</p><p>“Fine. I’m too emotionally exhausted to argue.” Agatha said as she leaned against Rio. They got on the elevator and made it down to the lobby that was congested and full of staff members still. Agatha looked panicked for a moment before Rio took her hand and Wanda quickly guided her out a side door toward the parking lot. Wanda rushed them over to Agatha’s car and handed Rio the keys to Agatha’s car.</p><p>“Get her home. I’ll be there soon. Thank you Rio.” Wanda said as she helped get Agatha into the car.</p><p>“Thank you Wanda.” Rio said softly. Wanda looked down at Rio and smiled brightly at her.</p><p>“I’m gunna hug you now.” Wanda said before she hugged the woman tightly. Rio was shocked and hugged Wanda back softly. “Thank you for coming into our lives. I’ll get her favorite snacks on the way home. Keep her calm. There’s a weighted blanket stashed in the hope chest at the end of the bed. Draw her a bath and force her to soak for a little while if she has another attack. It always seems to calm her down.” Wanda reassured.</p><p>“Thanks for the advice. I’ll get your number out of her phone and text you when we get there. I appreciate you, tell Pepper I appreciate her too if you see her.” Rio said as she let go.</p><p>“I will, now I’ve gotta handle this shit.” Wanda said before she ran off.  Rio sighed and climbed into the car and started it. She looked over at Agatha who seemed to be staring at her hands intensely. Rio sighed softly and backed it out of the space before she reached over and placed her hand softly on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“I’m right here.” Rio said softly as she squeezed Agatha’s knee. She focused on driving back to Agatha’s place, a few moments later Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand softly with her own.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha mumbled, Rio shook her head as she continued to drive.</p><p>~Stark Law Offices~</p><p>“Alright! Clear out! If you need counseling go to the third floor. If you need to collect your items or shut off your computers go back to your desks and do so then head home!” Pepper announced over the intercom disrupting the chatter in the main lobby. Most of the employees took the hint and dispersed.  Wanda walked over to where Pepper was standing at the desk.</p><p>“Wanda, we need to have a serious conversation.” Pepper said as she brought the woman toward the elevator.</p><p>“What is the plan?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Oh, she’s been arrested. I’m about to pull some strings to make sure it’s impossible for her to make bail.” Pepper said as she pressed the up button.</p><p>“May I make a suggestion?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You may.” Pepper said as they stepped into the elevator.</p><p>“Call a head coven counsel meeting. Summon the heads of several covens to sit as the jury for this trial. I recommend the defense use memory sharing spells so they can see this woman for the vile creature she is. Also may I suggest a glamor dissolving spell as well. No prettying up anything for anyone involved.”</p><p>“You cannot expect several large coven heads to show up to jury duty.”</p><p>“Oh, they will for a trial against Evanora Harkness.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“How could you possibly know that?” Pepper asked as she stepped off the elevator.</p><p>“That woman has made enemy’s of many.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“Now that I believe.” Pepper said as she opened the door of her office and let Wanda in. “I’ll consider it. But we cannot do this the wrong way, it must be executed perfectly. No tricks, no hand picked jury, nothing. Evanora has to dig her own grave.”</p><p>“Yes, but she is a coven head. A jury of your peers… so to say.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Every person on the jury must have magical abilities, and a full understanding of what it means to be a spirit witch. Those are the conditions I’m sending the judge. The rest is in the universes hands.” Pepper said as she sat down at her desk and reached for her phone.</p><p>“Perfect, more than I could’ve ever asked for.” Wanda said as she turned to walk back out the door.</p><p>“One more thing…” Pepper said, haulting Wanda’s steps.</p><p>“Yeah?” Wanda asked not bothering to turn around.</p><p>“How weak is Evanora?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Most of her power is gone from the siphoning. Someone helped her with that glamor spell. I suggest we find out who.” There was a long pause before Wanda spoke again. “Oh, and Rio says thank you.” Wanda said as she opened the door and walked out, leaving Pepper alone in her office with a simmering anger that she wouldn’t be able to quell for quite some time.</p><p>With a sigh Pepper picked up the phone and made a phone call to the courthouse, it rang a few times before someone picked up.</p><p>“Judge Heart’s Chambers.” A man spoke into the phone.</p><p>“It’s Pepper Potts. You are about to have a thick file come across your desk. My company is personally pressing charges against Evanora Harkness.” Pepper said into the phone. A loud sigh came through the receiver, he hated hearing that name.</p><p>“What did she do this time?” He asked.</p><p>“Broke the PPO again, but this time she actually made it into the building to harass Agatha.”</p><p>“I’m setting the bail so high she won’t be able to get enough money together by the time her court date comes.” He said as he rubbed his eyes. He was tired of this woman. It seemed like every five or six years she popped up to harass Agatha.</p><p>“I had a suggestion made to me… One that you absolutely do not have to take into consideration at all. But it may get us somewhere.” Pepper suggested.</p><p>“I’m listening.”</p><p>“Trial judged by her actual peers. Call coven heads in to be the jury. Require they use a glamor dampening potion and possibly a memory sharing spell. Let her memories dig her own grave.”</p><p>“I shall consider these things. Thank you Mrs. Potts.”</p><p>“Thank you Judge Heart.”</p><p>“You know she’s gunna have to be a witness this time, right?” He asked into the phone.</p><p>“I know. Fortunately this time… she’ll have someone there to support her who loves her. Well besides Wanda, Pietro, and I.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“Now that… is new?”</p><p>“It is but I think she’s here for the long haul.” Pepper said into the phone before continuing. “Thank you. Have a great night. Now I gotta go deal with my egregious security team.”</p><p>“Good luck with that.” The judge said with a chuckle before he hung up.</p><p>Pepper sighed and took a long moment to herself before she picked her phone up again and called her husband.</p><p>“Pepper! You never call me before you leave work!” Tony said as he continued to tinker with something.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness managed to make it into the building today.” Pepper said into the phone. A loud clang resounded through the phone.</p><p>“Excuse me? How did she get past my security measures?” Tony said in an irritated tone, as he grabbed the wrench off the floor that he had dropped.</p><p>“Someone made her a very heavy glamor spell. I need your help finding out who.”</p><p>“I’ll call Strange and get back to you.” He said as he started to pull up the man’s contact information.</p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate it. If he needs to come to the office, the entire floor has been evacuated. She couldn’t make it past Agatha’s protection spell she had on her office door.”</p><p>“Good, thank god for contingency plans.” Tony said into the phone. “I love you, go handle business. I’ll see you tonight.”</p><p>“I love you.” Pepper said before she hung up the phone. She didn’t want to deal with the security team’s horrible response time. It shouldn’t have taken them that long to get upstairs. But she had to, for Agatha’s sake and the rest of her employees.</p><p>~At Agatha’s~</p><p>Rio had placed Agatha on the couch with a bottle of water and a kiss on the head as she drew her a bath. She was in the bathroom enchanting the water with soothing properties when her phone started ringing in her pocket.</p><p>Rio stopped for a moment and grabbed her phone to see it was her mother calling. With a sigh she answered the call. “Momma, I will call you back.”</p><p>“Why was Evanora Harkness arrested today?” Rita asked her daughter.</p><p>“I will call you back. More important things need attended to than talking about that vile woman.” Rio said into the phone trying to focus on the spell she was using to create a calming bath for Agatha.</p><p>“Okay. Are you with Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes Momma. I love you. Goodbye.” Rio said softly into the phone.</p><p>“Love you.” Rita said into the phone before disconnecting the line.</p><p>Rio sighed loudly as she looked at the water in the tub that was glowing a soft green. She walked out of the bathroom into Agatha’s bedroom then out into the living room.</p><p>“I drew you a bath babe. Come with me.” Rio said as she offered her hand to Agatha. Agatha sighed loudly and took Rio’s hand as she got up from the couch. Rio guided her into the bathroom and turned Agatha toward her. She helped Agatha undress slowly, taking extra care to make sure she felt safe. Then she guided her into the tub and placed a soft kiss on her head.</p><p>“Thank you for taking care of me.” Agatha said with a sigh as she sunk into the water. Rio sat down on the floor next to the tub so she could be close to Agatha.</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. I’ll always be there for you when you need me.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“But you shouldn’t have to be! I’m thirty six years old. I should’ve handled it myself, you had to close the bookstore because of me! I ruin everything!” Agatha said in a frustrated tone.</p><p>“You didn’t ruin anything, tell me something. If I was in distress and I called for you. What would you do?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’d tell Tricia to hold down the fort and be by your side in a heartbeat. If I was in court I would have asked for a recess. I would have gotten to you no matter what.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“So you’re allowed to do that for me, but I’m not allowed to do that for you?” Rio pried.</p><p>“But you just opened your store…” Agatha defended.</p><p>“And it will open tomorrow like nothing ever happened. In a few months I’ll be able to hire an employee or two and then I’ll never have to close the store ever again. Right now. You matter more.” Rio said reassuringly.</p><p>“But I shouldn’t.” Agatha said as she felt tears well up in her eyes.</p><p>“I know that woman has done more damage than anyone can repair, but I am not her. You matter to me, you are someone I care about, you are deserving of love and care. So stop assuming you deserve nothing, you deserve the world. You deserve everything I do for you, and Wanda does for you, and Pepper does. She isn’t your inner voice, stop letting her take up space in your wellbeing and mind.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“I’ll try.” Agatha responded.</p><p>“That’s more than I could ever ask for. Now, relax for me please.” Rio begged softly.  Then her phone dinged in her pocket. Rio sighed exasperatedly as she pulled her phone out of her pocket.</p><p>“Do you need to make a phone call?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, my mother is just being my mother.” Rio said softly as she looked at the message.</p><p>Rita Vidal (ICE) 4:15 p.m: I found your great grandmothers spell book. There’s something you both need to see. Attachment Image.</p><p>The writing on the page was visible so Rio could read it.</p><p> <i>I, Violet Vidal, am of the belief that spirit witches are not born but made. We are a result of our environment. My mother and father were cruel to me because my powers didn’t manifest at all. I was abused and neglected by them for many years before one day my body finally had enough and something inside of me snapped.</i></p><p>
<i>My mother was punishing me for making another mistake that was unavoidable. As if by magic my powers flared to life. She struck me hard, and then my magic began to siphon her magic from her body. My father did not know how to handle the moment and attacked me as well. I drained them of their life force and magic.<i></i></i>
</p><p>
<i>My aunt has taken me in and told me she will care for me as her own. I am scared and horrified. I am only 16 and an orphan by my own hands.<i></i></i>
</p><p>
</p><p>Rio sat there and reread the photo several times over. Then she sent a quick text to her mother</p><p>Rio 4:20 p.m: Momma, we need more proof than that but it’s a good start.</p><p>Rita Vidal (ICE) 4:21 p.m: already on it. Take care of my daughter in law.</p><p>Rio sighed and tucked her phone away from a moment.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha asked, her eyes were closed but she could hear Rio sigh.</p><p>“Nothing we need to worry about right now. I just want to focus on you. But I need to go get Wanda’s number from your phone real quick so I can text her.” Rio said softly as she stood up.</p><p>“Grab me a towel so I can dry my hands off and I’ll put it in your phone. It hasn’t changed since we were 20.” Agatha said as she raised her hand out of the water, Rio grabbed a towel and let Agatha dry her hands off before handing her, her phone. Agatha typed the number into Rio’s contacts and handed it back to her.</p><p>“Thank you my love.” Rio said without thinking. Agatha paused for a moment but decided to not say anything because Rio was occupied with sending Wanda a message. A soft smile spread across Agatha’s face as she sunk deeper into the water. It wasn’t a confession but it wasn’t not one either.</p><p>Rio 4:30 p.m: Hey, it’s Rio. Got Agatha soaking in a soothing bath. She’s calm but i figured it would help. Once she’s done I’ll get her into bed or on the couch with the weighted blanket.</p><p>“Alright, sent Wanda a text. Do you want to soak longer or do you want to get out and cuddle?” Rio asked softly as she brushed some of Agatha’s hair out of her face.</p><p>“I’d rather be cuddling with you but this bath is very soothing.”</p><p>“We have all night for that. Just enjoy the bath. I’m gunna go grab a drink, do you want anything?” Rio asked as she stood up.</p><p>“Water is probably the safest bet. Alcohol sounds like a bad idea.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.” Rio said as she bent down and gave Agatha a soft kiss on the forehead.</p><p>“Can I have a real kiss before you go?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course.” Rio said before she gave Agatha a soft kiss on the lips. Rio ran out into the kitchen and grabbed herself a bottle of water before snatching the bottle she had given Agatha off the couch. Before she made her way back into the bathroom.</p><p>“I’m back. Here you go.” Rio said as she handed Agatha her bottle.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said softly before she opened the bottle and chugged it.</p><p>“Want me to refresh the water?” Rio asked looking at the tub.</p><p>“No, I want out honestly.” Agatha answered. Rio grabbed a big fluffy towel and stood next to the tub ready to wrap Agatha up in it. Agatha leaned forward and unplugged the tub before she stood up and stepped out of the tub.</p><p>“Let’s get you dressed in something comfy and cuddle up on the couch until Wanda gets here.” Rio suggested.</p><p>“Sounds perfect.” Agatha said as she leaned into Rio’s embrace.</p>

<p>Rio made sure Agatha was dressed as comfortably as possible and nestled on the couch in a little nest of pillows and blankets with the weighed blanket over her. Then she took a few moments to collect her thoughts.</p><p>“Do you want to read what my mother sent me?” Rio asked as she pulled her phone out and slapped it against her hand. Like she was debating on even giving Agatha this information.</p><p>“My day cannot possibly get any worse. Sure. Let me read it.” Agatha said honestly as she held her hand out for Rio to hand her the phone. Rio pulled the photo up and handed it to Agatha. Then she sat down and braced for impact. She could feel her own anxiety bubble up as Agatha read the passage from her great grandmothers spell book.</p><p>Then, something amazing and quite shocking happened Agatha begun to laugh. Like a real authentic laugh that scared Rio even more than if Agatha had been angry.</p><p>“If that’s true, I no longer feel guilty about almost killing her 20 years ago! How can we prove this?” Agatha said as she calmed down.</p><p>“Really? You want to know if we can prove it?” Rio asked excitedly, all her anxiety and fear melting away.</p><p>“Yes, because if it’s her fault I’m a spirit witch then she has no one to blame for her own problems other than herself! She created this ‘monster’ herself.” Agatha said with a shake of her head.</p><p>“Do you want me to call my mom? She said she was working on something.” Rio asked.</p><p>“Fuck it! Put her on speaker.” Agatha told Rio. Rio took her phone back from Agatha and called her mom on speaker.</p><p>“You better be taking care of her, why are you calling me back?” Rita said into the phone softly.</p><p>“I showed her the photo. She asked me to call you.” Rio explained</p><p>“Hello Mrs. Vidal.” Agatha greeted the woman.</p><p>“Oh. Oh! Hello witchlett! I hope my daughter has been caring for you well!” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“She has, very well in-fact.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“What have you been working on Momma?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Well, I’ve managed to get ahold of three of the five other spirit witches in the United States.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“How?” Agatha asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Now… let’s not worry too much about that.”</p><p>“You asked Lilia for their names and phone numbers didn’t you.” Rio asked in a frustrated tone.</p><p>“Hey! When you are best friends with one of the most powerful diviners in the world. You cash in a favor…”</p><p>“Wait… Lilia Calderu?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes, why?” Rita asked Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve heard of her. She’s extremely difficult to get a hold of supposedly.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“For most, yes. Me personally? Never. Anyway, on to what we were talking about. I have spoken to three of them already since I found out Evanora was arrested today.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“And? Was great grandma right?” Rio asked her mother.</p><p>“That seems to be the general consensus. 16 years old, abused their whole lives, something just snaps, dead abusers.” Rita summarizes.</p><p>“That’s the most fucked up version of karma I’ve ever heard of.” Agatha mentions.</p><p>“The only difference here is that Evanora managed to live.” Rita explained.</p><p>“So… We blame Wanda.” Rio joked.</p><p>“No! We don’t blame Wanda.” Agatha said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“What are we blaming me for? I probably deserve to be blamed.” Wanda said as she walked into the house carrying a few plastic bags and something that looked like a brown paper sack.</p><p>“Call me back when you get settled, it sounds like Agatha’s best friend just arrived. I’m going to try and get ahold of the other two.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“I love you momma. Thank you.” Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“Love you too baby.” Rita said before she hung up the phone.</p><p>“Sorry! Didn’t mean to interrupt your phone call.” Wanda said as she set the bags on the coffee table.</p><p>“It’s fine, we are just learning things.” Agatha said as she looked at the bags curiously.</p><p>“What did we learn? I got you your favorite snacks, chocolate, and soda. I also picked up Chinese food.” Wanda said as she pulled out a few things from the bags.</p><p>Rio took a long moment to memorize everything that Wanda was pulling out of the bags. Honey mustard pretzels, twizzlers,  Reese’s peanut butter cups, Root-beer, salt and vinegar chips, and several other things that Rio lost track of.</p><p>“Oh, that Evanora has no one to blame but herself.” Agatha said as she grabbed the bag of pretzels and a soda.</p><p>“We knew that but I have a feeling you mean something else.” Wanda said as she looked over at Rio.</p><p>“My mother has been contacting the five other spirit witches in the United States and is learning how their powers manifested.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Color me intrigued! What have we learned?” Wanda asks excitedly as she got rid of empty bags by putting them in another bag.</p><p>“That they all experienced the same thing I did. Years of abuse, something happens at the age of 16 and their magic snaps into place, parent strikes them with magic, ding dong dead parents.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“Oh…. So that’s why I’m being blamed. Because I unintentionally saved Evanora’s life.” Wanda said suddenly realizing.</p><p>“Unfortunately.” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>“I didn’t stop the siphoning because I wanted to save her life. I stopped it because I wanted to save yours.” Wanda said as she sat down next to Agatha.</p><p>“I appreciate that, I really do.” Agatha said as she nudged Wanda with her shoulder.</p><p>“So what do we do with this information?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Nothing at the moment. But… it has taken a weight off my shoulders.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Great! I’m glad you are feeling much better about things.” Wanda told Agatha, then she turned and leaned forward to grab the Chinese. “Now who wants Crab Rangoons?”</p><p>“Please don’t tell me that’s a whole bag of them!?” Agatha asked in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“What if it is?” Wanda asked knowing they were Agatha’s favorite. Agatha sighed loudly and Rio burst out laughing at the woman’s antics.</p><p>“Seriously? A whole bag?” Agatha asked as Wanda opened it and handed Agatha a cup of sweet and sour sauce and a styrofoam container.</p><p>“Yes, a whole bag. Today was a bad day. Crab Rangoons make it better.” Wanda said with a bright smile.</p><p>“She’s definitely a chaos witch.” Rio said with a chuckle as she looked over at the two of them.</p><p>“This is why I cook breakfast for us every morning. That way I’m guaranteed she eats one balanced meal a day.” Agatha said as she shook her head.</p><p>~Meanwhile At The High Security Institution For The Magically Inclined~</p><p>Evanora was in her cell, stewing in her own anger when she felt something shift. She looked up from her bunk to see an entity in the corner. A woman in black stood in the corner, she was holding a scythe. Evanora could see her skull through the paper thin skin on her face.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness.” A voice that sounded like thousands of souls speaking at once resounded through the cell. Evanora was paralyzed with fear. Her whole body started to shake as the being stepped closer to her.</p><p>“No! It’s not my time!” Evanora finally screeched out after a long moment.</p><p>“It is not, though that doesn’t mean you are undeserving of death. If you ever bother my grandchild or her bride again. My next visit will not be so kind.” Death said as she stepped forward again.</p><p>“Who is your grandchild?” Evanora asked full of fear.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, The green witch. The next in line to take my place as Death. Your daughter is her fated bride. If you bother either of them again. I will bend the rules. I will take you. For now, consider this your final warning.” Death told the woman sitting on the bed. Evanora was horrified, she felt herself grow weaker as the woman moved closer.</p><p>“You cannot harm me!” Evanora yelled flinching in fear.</p><p>“Who said I’d harm you?” Death asked as she tilted her head to the side. She stepped closer to the woman who was shaking on the bed in fear.</p><p>“No in-fact, I think I’ll just do the whole world a favor and take what little power you have left. It only seems fair. You don’t use it for anything sensible or good anyway.” Then death ran a cold knuckle down the side of Evanora’s face, collecting the last of her blue magic in her palm and smiled at the woman.</p><p>“Hasta la próxima Evanora Harkness.” Death said as she disappeared from the cell.</p><p>“You can’t do this to me! I don’t deserve this!” Evanora yelled into the empty room.</p><p>~Agatha’s Place~</p><p>All three women were cuddled up on the couch watching something stupid on the t.v. When Rio’s phone rang again. Wanda grabbed the remote and paused the show.</p><p>“Hey Momma, what did you learn.” Rio asked as she answered the phone and put it on speaker.</p><p>“Our current theory is correct. Even down to the age it happened.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“Fascinating.” Agatha said as she processed the information, before she came to a realization. “Wait! Are they all okay? They had to relive their trauma because of me.” Agatha said guiltily.</p><p>“No sweetie, that’s not how these conversations went down. I called them and told them about you and your current situation and what you experienced. They were more than willing to give up information once they found out that this wasn’t something exclusive to them. All of them were relieved to hear they weren’t alone.” Rita explained.</p><p>“It is nice to know we are the smallest group of witches for a reason.” Agatha answered honestly.</p><p>“I’m shocked there aren’t more.” Wanda blurted out.</p><p>“Wanda!” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Honestly I’m inclined to agree with Wanda.” Rio told the group of women.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha scolded her girlfriend this time.</p><p>“Maybe it depends on the abuse?” Rita asked over the phone.</p><p>“What do you mean Momma?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“It seems like every case of Spirit witch development was brought on by severe abuse, neglect, fear, and pain.” Rita explained.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about that right now.” Wanda said trying to protect Agatha.</p><p>“I’m fine. I promise.” Agatha said as she placed a hand over Wanda’s, before she adds. “But yeah I don’t want to relive any more of that today. Please and Thank you.”</p><p>“Of course witchlett! No need to bring up anymore pain today. What are you girls doing?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Eating an ungodly amount of Crab Rangoons, junk food and watching tv.” Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“Good! Am I to expect you this Saturday?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Me? Yes. Agatha…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“I have a ton of damage control I have to do tomorrow. My boss canceled my last two meetings today.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“If you are free, and have the time you are more than welcome to come.” Rita said honestly.</p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate the offer.” Agatha said appreciatively.</p><p>“I must call Lilia back, let her know what I’ve found out. Have a great night girls.I love you Rio.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“Goodnight Momma! Love you!” Rio said before she hung up the phone. Rio looked over at Wanda and Agatha after she hung up the phone and both of them had different expressions. Wanda looked like she wanted to make a joke but was trying to hold it back. Agatha just looked happy.</p><p>“Just say it Wanda.” Rio said with a huff.</p><p>“It’s so cute you still call your mom, Momma. Literally the most adorable thing ever.” Wanda said with a nose wrinkle.</p><p>“Watch it Wanda, I’ll have my girlfriend beat you up for picking on me!” Rio joked.</p><p>“Oh I’m so scared!” Wanda jabbed back. Both women then started laughing.</p><p>“I’m limiting the time you two spend together…” Agatha said in a completely serious tone causing both women to look at her as if they were offended.</p><p>“That reminds me. It’s getting late. You should go lay down you know how hard you sleep on days like this.” Wanda said as she stood up and started cleaning up the mess they had all made.</p><p>“Who’s staying?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I am.” Rio answered.</p><p>“I’m a text away.” Wanda said with a shrug. Before she continued to clean. Rio got up and stretched, her shirt rising slightly as she did so.</p><p>“How many tattoos do you have?” Wanda asked as she caught a flash of color before the shirt settled.</p><p>“Three so far. But the vines are really like a sleeve.”</p><p>“What’s the one on your hip?”</p><p>“Six Poppy flowers growing out of a skull’s eye sockets sitting on two monstera leaves.” Agatha explained. As she took the weighted blanket off herself and stood up.</p><p>“Got them all memorized already I see.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“Not justifying that with a response.” Agatha said as she helped collect all the junk food on the coffee table. She followed Wanda into the kitchen and put stuff away. They got everything taken care of and put the left over Crab Rangoons in the fridge.</p><p>“I love you Aggie, don’t you forget that. I’m gunna head home and call Pietro and let him know what’s going on. Unless you don’t want me to?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You can call him now. That way you can take him with you when you leave. Tell him you already got me snacks though. Remember last time?” Agatha asked as they walked back out into the living room. Rio walked over to Agatha and took her hand in hers.</p><p>“What are we doing?” Rio asked softly as Agatha leaned her head against Rio’s.</p><p>“I’m calling my brother.” Wanda told Rio as she pulled her phone out and dialed him. It rang once.</p><p>“What’s up sis?”</p><p>“Evanora Harkness was arrested today. She managed to make it into the building and up to Agatha’s office. Rio and I have been spending time with her and I spoiled her with snacks.” Wanda said into the phone. There was a long pause, like an even longer pause than Wanda expected.</p><p>Then the front door flew open and shut quickly. Rio was gently moved aside and Agatha was wrapped up in the biggest softest hug Pietro could muster. Rio noticed Wanda and Pietro hug the same way. One arm wrapped around Agatha’s head cradling it against their shoulder and chest while the other ran up her back and pressed their palm flat between her shoulder blades. Agatha hugged him back tightly, for a long moment before pulling away.</p><p>“You okay?” Pietro asked softly as he pulled away and checked Agatha over.</p><p>“Yes, but I was about to go to bed. I’m very tired. If you want to go home with Wanda she can fill you in.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“That’s okay. I’m only one call away. I’ll stay at her place tonight.” Pietro told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you two. You’re the best siblings I could’ve asked for.” Agatha told Wanda and Pietro.</p><p>“I don’t know. I could live without him sometimes.” Wanda joked before grabbing her brother by the arm and dragging him to the door. “Come on Zippy, let’s go home.”</p><p>“Bye Agatha, Bye Rio.” Pietro said before the door shut quietly.</p><p>“Let’s go lay down.” Rio said softly as she used her magic to lock the door and shut off the lights. They made their way into the bedroom and climbed into bed before they shut off the lights. Once it was dark and they were under the covers Agatha pressed her ear to Rio’s chest so she could listen to her heartbeat.</p><p>“Thank you for taking care of me today.” Agatha said sleepily.</p><p>“You’re welcome, but there’s no reason to thank me.” Rio mumbled out as she pressed a soft kiss to the crown of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Get used to me thanking you. I’m going to do it for the rest of our lives.” Agatha said with a yawn. Before she slid her hand under Rio’s shirt and pressed a finger to the sigil. Rio felt an overwhelming sense of calm and comfort. “That’s how you make me feel.” Agatha said slowly as she drifted off.</p><p>Rio’s heart swelled as her eyes filled with tears. She held Agatha close as she drifted off to sleep. Neither woman any the wiser about the fact that their lives were about to get a little easier.</p><p>~ Meanwhile At The High Security Institution For The Magically Inclined~</p><p>Evanora couldn’t even muster up a single spark of magic any more. Her little bit of glamor she had left faded completely after death had visited her.</p><p>“I’m powerless!” Evanora said in a frustrated tone. Then there was a knock on the cell door before it opened.</p><p>“You have a visitor.” The guard said as they opened the door.</p><p>“It’s past visitation.” Evanora said grumpily as she got up off the bed and walked over to the door.</p><p>“When this person says they want to speak to someone. We don’t argue. Now move.” The guard said as the held the gauntlets out for Evanora to put on.</p><p>“Absolutely unnecessary.” Evanora said as she held her hands out. The gauntlets locked around them and then didn’t glow at all. The guard looked at them suspiciously.</p><p>“I told you it was unnecessary.” Evanora said as the guard guided her down the hall and into the visitation room where two men were sitting at a table.</p><p>“Thank you for meeting with us Evanora Harkness.” The taller man said as he looked down at the woman.</p><p>“And you are?” She asked unsure of who the two men were.</p><p>“Well, I am Dr. Stephan Strange and this is my friend and co-worker Tony Stark. And we have a few questions for you. Please take a seat.”</p><p>“I don’t have to answer any of your questions. I know my rights.” Evanora seethed.</p><p>“That is true. But we aren’t cops. Our lawyer isn’t here. This is just a friendly conversation.” Tony explained.</p><p>“Yeah right.” She scoffed at the man.</p><p>“Honestly, we just wanted to know who helped you create the glamor spell that got you into my building.” Tony explained.</p><p>“That’s none of your concern.” Evanora hissed out.</p><p>“That’s fine, but I am curious. What happened in the last few hours that you are now completely powerless. When you arrived here you were labeled as a danger level 1. Now I can’t even detect a hint of magic in you.” Stephen said to Evanora.</p><p>“Ya know. I do think that is quite interesting. I noticed the gauntlets weren’t glowing at all when she walked into the room. Seems like somebody ran out of juice.” Tony said as he held his hands together and pointed both index fingers at them before tapping them to his mouth.</p><p>“You fowl mouthed cretin! Haven’t I been through enough? First my horrible daughter steals most of my power! Then! Her friend hexes me into the next century! When I finally get a chance to give the horrible little bitch a taste of her own medicine. I’m arrested for stupid shit like trespassing and breaking a PPO! So I’m thrown in this hellish place for something dumb and moronic. The last of my power was taken by Death herself! I don’t deserve this! I have done nothing wrong! Spirit witches are the scum of the earth and should not exist!” Evanora yelled at the two men as she slammed the gauntlets down on the table.</p><p>Two guards appeared a moment later and started to drag her off back to her cell.</p><p>“Death?” Tony asked after the door shut.</p><p>“Hey, I’ve never personally met the entity. But I’m aware of her existence.” Stephen said honestly.</p><p>“That will be unpacked later. Let’s go.” Tony said as he tapped the side of his glasses.</p><p>“Got all that Pepper?”</p><p>“Yep!” Pepper said loudly through Tony’s glasses.</p><p>“Perfect. Alright Strange, Let’s head to the office. Maybe you can find a trail of magic.” Tony suggested.</p><p>“Way ahead of you.” Strange said as she opened a portal to the office and stepped through it.</p><p>“Can you believe she called me a cretin?” Tony asked as he stepped through.</p><p>“Honestly…” Stephen said with a chuckle. “Yes, you have that effect on people who think they are better than everyone else.”</p><p>“You’ve wanted to call me one haven’t you?” Tony joked.</p><p>“Yes. Because you are irritatingly right all of the time. Now shush. Let me focus.” Stephen said as he walked around the office he found a trail of blue magic and followed it.“You good if I leave you here?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m sure Pepper is still around here somewhere.” Tony said as he opened the door and walked toward the elevator.</p><p>“I’ll call you with what I find.”</p><p>“Thanks Dr. Strange. I appreciate the assist.” Tony said as he pressed the button for the elevator.  Got in and turned around and realized he was alone in the office. He shook his head and hit the top floor button.  A short elevator ride later Tony was walking into Peppers office.</p><p>“Hey babe, did you get a chance to look at the footage?” Tony said as he looked at his wife who was sitting at the computer chewing her thumbnail.</p><p>“Yeah… I’m confused about her power being gone…” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“I really don’t know. Strange said that he’s never met Death but he know’s she exists.”</p><p>“Obviously Death exists, we all die. But I have a feeling you are talking about an actual entity.” Pepper said with a shrug.</p><p>“I am. But let’s head home. I know you care about Agatha but you need rest.” Tony said honestly.</p><p>“You’re right. Let’s go.”  Pepper said she got up and closed her laptop before sliding it into her purse. Tomorrow was going to be interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>Rio woke up first, her alarm blaring loudly from her phone as she reached over and smacked at the device. A groan came from Agatha as she looked at her own phone.</p><p>“Nooooooo.” Agatha whined loudly, she didn’t want to get up at all. She nestled her head into Rio’s neck again, hiding against her chest.</p><p>“I know my love. I know. But we both have to work today.” Rio said softly as she kissed Agatha on the forehead again.</p><p>“Stupid.” Agatha grumbled as she kissed Rio on the chest and neck.</p><p>“Don’t start that right now.” Rio groaned as she magicked the light on.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll get up and shower alone.” Agatha said with a sigh as she rolled away from Rio.</p><p>“Wait! I didn’t say that!” Rio yelled in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“You told me not to start anything. If you shower with me… I’ll start something.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’ll set an alarm for 20 minutes and bring my phone into the bathroom. So if we end up doing something we have an alarm.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Sounds like a good enough idea.” Agatha said as she got out of bed and took her shirt off, showing Rio her bare back as she went into the bathroom.</p><p>“This woman is going to be the death of me.” Rio groaned as she got up and followed Agatha into the bathroom.</p><p>Twenty five minutes later they were out of the shower and getting dressed. Agatha decided to wear a black button up, with a lavender tie and a gray suit. She took the time to put her rings on her fingers by hand this morning.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve been meaning to ask. Which ring did Pietro put on me the other day?” Rio asked as she looked at Agatha’s hands. Agatha paused for a moment and pulled the ring off her index finger and handed it to Rio.</p><p>“This one. It’s the first ring I bought myself after I graduated law school. Honestly, I have no idea why he picked that one.” Agatha said as she pointed to the ring. It was a silver band with ivy leaves etched into it.</p><p>“Why ivy leaves?” Rio asked looking at the band, she slid it onto her left ring finger for a moment which made Agatha’s heart flutter.</p><p>“I graduated from an Ivy League school. Seemed fitting. Do you want me to magic an outfit onto you?” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“Makes sense. Also kind of fitting, that he picked this one ironically, seeing as my arm is covered in Ivy leaves. Would you? I’d appreciate it so much so I don’t have to wear my clothing from yesterday...” Rio explained. Agatha smiled and waved her hand. A moment later, Rio was dressed in a comfy loose fitting deep green tee shirt, black jeans and a cute black leather jacket.</p><p>“That seems fitting for you.” Agatha said as she walked over and kissed Rio softly on the lips.</p><p>“I guess you’ll want this back, also thank you, I’m very comfy.” Rio said as she took the ring off and handed it to Agatha.</p><p>“I appreciate it, thank you.” Agatha said as she slipped the ring onto her hand, it nestling against her second knuckle on her pointer finger.</p><p>“Wanda will be here soon demanding breakfast I’m sure.” Rio said with an eye roll.</p><p>“I don’t know if I have enough food to feed Pietro, but we will find out.” Agatha said as she turned and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>Once they were in the kitchen Agatha threw on an apron and started cooking breakfast for the four of them. Scrambled eggs, ham, and pancakes. She had most of breakfast made by the time the Maximoff twins rushed into the house.</p><p>“Breakfast smells great Aggie!” Pietro said as he zipped around the kitchen collecting a plate of food and pouring a generous amount of syrup on everything.</p><p>“Ooooooo pancakes!” Wanda said as she sat down at the island next to Rio. “Morning Rio. How did last night go?” Wanda whispered to the woman next to her.</p><p>“Fine, we both slept like babies.” Rio answered as Agatha set a plate down in front of Rio. “Thank you babe.”</p><p>“Good.” Wanda and Pietro said in unison.</p><p>“Here’s your breakfast Wanda.” Agatha said as she placed a plate in front of her best friend.  Agatha took two pancakes and some eggs for herself and a slice of ham. “The rest of the pancakes are yours Pietro. Unless Rio and Wanda want more.”</p><p>“I’m good, thanks though.” Rio said as she cut into her pancakes and took a bite.</p><p>“Just eat them bro. You have to travel across six states to get to work in twenty minutes.” Wanda said with a wave of her hand.</p><p>“Thanks!” Pietro said as he grabbed the giant plate of pancakes and covered them in syrup. Literally thirty second’s later the entire plate was gone.</p><p>“Woah.” Rio said in a shocked yet impressed tone.</p><p>“Alright, eat up. Do you want coffee to go?” Agatha asked Pietro.</p><p>“Nah, I’ve got time to stop and get one.” He answered before he walked over to the sink and rinsed his dishes off. “Alright, I love you both, call me if you need me. But I’ve got young minds to teach. Nice to see you again Rio!” Pietro said before he was gone in a flash.</p><p>“Honestly, I should’ve made more pancakes…” Agatha said quietly as she watched the front door close.</p><p>“He’s a big boy, he will get more food if he needs.” Wanda said as she continued to eat her breakfast. Agatha decided she needed to finish eating her own as well.</p><p>“High metabolism?” Rio asked</p><p>“He requires 20,000 calories a day. More when he’s running around like this.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“I guess the super speed has a benefit of letting him eat fast…” Rio trailed off before she took another bite of food.</p><p>“Yeah. Almost ate our parents out of house and home when his powers manifested.” Wanda said as she took a sip of Agatha’s coffee.</p><p>“Hey! Get your own!” Agatha scolded. Wanda looked her dead in the eyes as she continued to drink.</p><p>“Insufferable.” Agatha grumbled softly as she walked over to the cupboard and grabbed herself an insulated tumbler and made herself a fresh cup of coffee to take into work with her. Wanda finished her breakfast and got up to wash her plate off.  Then she grabbed the cup and headed out the door.</p><p>“Thanks for breakfast! Have a good day.” Wanda said as she walked out the door with the open cup.</p><p>“She really just is the embodiment of ‘I don’t give a fuck.’ Isn’t she?” Rio asked as she watched Wanda leave.</p><p>“A thousand percent.” Agatha said before she took her last bite of pancake. “Finish your breakfast, I’ll drop you off at the book store on the way to work.” Agatha said as she cleaned her plate off and then rinsed it in the sink.</p><p>“Can I have a to go cup of coffee as well please?” Rio asked before she started stuffing a couple bites into her mouth. Agatha turned around and grabbed another cup and filled it with coffee.</p><p>“How do you take it?” Agatha asked as she grabbed the creamer out of the fridge.</p><p>“The way you made it the other day was perfect. I like sweet things.” Rio said honestly, Agatha pumped some simple syrup into each cup and then added the creamer before putting the lids on.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Agatha asked as Rio stood up and walked over to the sink to rinse off her plate.</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio said as she turned around and gave Agatha a kiss on the lips. Agatha handed Rio both the coffees so she could use her hands.</p><p>“Let me clean up and grab my briefcase and we will go.” Agatha said as she waved her hand, the kitchen was instantly cleaned and then they walked into the entryway and Agatha grabbed her briefcase and keys. They made their way out of the house and into the car.</p><p>Agatha dropped Rio off at the bookstore with a kiss and a goodbye before she rushed off to work herself. She made it in fifteen minutes early. Most of her staff had arrived and was working quietly when she stepped off the elevator. Tricia seen her first and stood up to greet Agatha.</p><p>“Good morning Ms. Harkness. Mrs. Potts is in her office waiting for you.” Tricia told her.</p><p>“Of course she is. Can I speak to you privately first before I go up there?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course.” Tricia said as she followed Agatha into her office and shut the door behind her.</p><p>“Are you alright? Wanda told me you came and found her after everything that happened.” Agatha asked as she set her briefcase down.</p><p>“I am fine, I was more worried about you than anything. I’ve never seen you that shaken up before. I knew she was your best friend so I went and told her. Was that the wrong thing to do?” Tricia asked in a worried tone.</p><p>“No, you didn’t do anything wrong. Thank you for telling her. Do you have any questions?” Agatha asked the woman.</p><p>“Yes… You have a girlfriend?” Tricia asked curiously.</p><p>“We just started dating but yes. I have a girlfriend.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Awesome! She’s very pretty. I hope she makes you happy.” Tricia said with a smile on her face.</p><p>“She does, any other questions?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Actually yes… Is she the reason you wore green yesterday?” Tricia asked.</p><p>“Yes, she’s a green witch and I felt like wearing something that reminded me of her.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Makes sense. Your meetings you missed are rescheduled for tomorrow. Now go see Mrs. Potts her message seemed urgent this morning.”</p><p>“I’m going I’m going. Do I have court today?” Agatha asked feeling frazzled.</p><p>“Not tell next Tuesday. Just a few meetings today and 3 employee reviews.” Tricia answered.</p><p>“Not reviews!” Agatha groaned out exasperatedly.</p><p>“They hate them just as much as you do.” Tricia reassured.</p><p>“Fine, I’m gunna go talk to Pepper now. Make sure nothing crazy happens while I’m gone.” Agatha said as she headed out the door. It seemed like everything went back to business as usual no one even batted an eye as she got in the elevator and headed to the top floor.</p><p>Agatha stepped off and headed toward Peppers office. Timothy stood up as Agatha approached his desk.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, Mrs. Potts is waiting for you. Go right on in.” Timothy said as he waited for Agatha to make it to the door before sitting down. Agatha opened the door</p><p>“How are you doing today?” Pepper asked as she stood up and walked around the desk.</p><p>“Considering yesterday? Great.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I have a feeling I’m about to make it even better. Come sit, I have a video to show you.” Pepper said as she pulled her desk chair out for Agatha to sit in.</p><p>“Oh really? How is that?” Agatha said as she sat down.</p><p>“Have a watch and let me know how you feel afterwords.” Pepper said as she pressed play. Agatha sat and watched her mother have an absolute breakdown but something in the middle of it caught her attention.</p><p>“Did she say Death took the last of her power?” Agatha asked as she looked up at Pepper with a strange look on her face. She got that look when she was trying to unravel something.</p><p>“Yes. Why? What’s running through that head of yours?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Nothing I can share at the moment. Can you send me this video?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“What can’t you share?” Pepper pried.</p><p>“Pepper… please. Let me figure this out first. Trust me, once I know for sure… I’ll share.” Agatha said to Pepper.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll send you the video.” Pepper relented knowing Agatha wasn’t going to budge.</p><p>“Thank you. Now I have to go make a phone call and attend meetings.” Agatha said as she stood up.</p><p>“Do you feel a little better knowing she’s completely powerless now?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yes. Much actually. Thank you for sharing this with me. I appreciate it so much.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Good, because here comes the bad news. I need you to testify this time.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“I was waiting for that. I might have an even better solution to things than just my testimony. But… I have to ask first.” Agatha told Pepper.</p><p>“Tell me what it might be and I’ll let you know if it’s a good idea.” Pepper requested.</p><p>“So… fuck. I don’t even know where to start… Rio’s great great grandmother was one of the first known documented spirit witches…” Agatha started to say as she paced back and forth while spinning the ring Rio had tried on this morning.</p><p>“And?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“And she documented in her spell book… that her family abused her because her powers didn’t manifest at all. Then at the age of 16 something snapped while she was being abused. Her powers came to life and she siphoned her mother’s power, her father tried to intervene and she killed both of her parents.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Ooof. So you think spirit witches are created not born?” Pepper asked</p><p>“I know they are, Rio’s mother called the most powerful divination witch in the world and asked for their names and phone numbers and spent all night contacting each one.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“And the consensus is?” Pepper asked very curious at this point.</p><p>“Abusive caretakers, years of neglect, they turn 16, the abuse happens one last time and then dead abusers.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“So your ability comes from the fact that your body finally had enough and decided to take over and eliminate the problem.” Pepper explains.</p><p>“Yep, all of us had the same shitty experience growing up and unfortunately for everyone but me, it ended in their parent’s deaths.”</p><p>“Would it have been so horrible if Evanora died?” Pepper grumbled.</p><p>“No one deserves to die, no matter how horrible they are. Also I wouldn’t be here if I had killed her.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I didn’t think about that...” Pepper said before continuing. “I’d love to have their testimonies, but… I don’t want them on trial for their parents murders.”</p><p>“Yeah that’s my only problem.” Agatha said.</p><p>“Statute of limitations might be a benefit but if you could get a photo of the spell book page that could be a good start. I’ll have a couple of the interns and PA’s start scavenging the internet and the library of witch craft for any documented proof. Thanks for telling me about this.” Pepper said as she sat down.</p><p>“Please send me that video. It’s important.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“Doing it now.” Pepper said as she clicked a few buttons.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll text you when I know more.” Agatha said as she grabbed the door handle.</p><p>“Good. I’ll let you know when her hearing is.” Pepper said.</p><p>“Who’s handling this case?” Agatha said pausing at the door.</p><p>“Me. I’m done playing games.” Pepper said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha said as she opened the door and walked out.  She made her way back down to her office and cast a heavy sound dampening spell.</p><p>“Tricia. Give me twenty minutes. I have to make a very important phone call.” Agatha said before she rushed into the room with-out waiting for a response. Agatha pulled her phone out, confirmed she got the video and then sent it off to Rio. Then she waited. Her phone started ringing a few minutes later.</p><p>“Hey. Did you watch it?” Agatha asked into the phone.</p><p>“Yeah…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“Violet Vidal the current standing entity of Death isn’t she?” Agatha asked. A heavy sigh resounded through the phone.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio answers.</p><p>“Well that explains that.” Agatha said as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She took the last of my mother’s powers, I’m just trying to figure out how she left her alive.” Agatha said as she leaned forward and grabbed her coffee to take a drink.</p><p>“Maybe it wasn’t her time to die?” Rio suggested.</p><p>“That or she’s figured out how to control the siphoning.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“I’ll call mom once we are done talking.”</p><p>“Pepper is getting suspicious. She knows I’m not telling her something.” Agatha said honestly, afraid Rio was going to get mad at her.</p><p>“You can tell anyone who you feel needs to know. I trust you.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Are you sure? I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Wanda, Pietro, and Pepper have stuck through so much when it comes to you. I don’t think they will be shocked or even bat an eye at this information.” Rio said vaguely.</p><p>“I’m more worried about Tony wanting to ask you a million questions if Pepper slips up.”</p><p>“I’d gladly answer any questions he has.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Thank you dear. I’m sorry that we’ve only been dating a week and things like this keep happening.” Agatha apologized.</p><p>“Don’t make me come down there and kiss you!” Rio sassed Agatha.</p><p>“What if that’s what I want?” Agatha flirted.</p><p>“Ma’am you are at work!” Rio scolded.</p><p>“This is true, and I have three employee reviews to do today. So I better let you go.” Agatha said sadly.</p><p>“Good luck babe. Call me on your lunch if you get a chance.”  Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“No promises. I don’t know how busy I’ll be. Have a good day.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“You as well my love.” Rio said into the phone before hanging up. Agatha got up out of her chair, opened her door and looked at Tricia with a smile.</p><p>“Let’s get shit done.” Agatha said as she walked over to Tricia’s desk. “What’s first?”</p><p>“You have a 10 a.m. meeting.” Tricia answered.</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha answered, she was ready to get back to normal.</p><p>~Vidal Books~</p><p>After hanging up Rio watched the video a few times. Then she felt something shift, like time itself stopped. Rio looked up and around the book shop to see nothing had changed then she turned her head to the left to see Death standing next to her with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“Hello witchlett!” Death said in a happy cheerful tone. Rio’s eyes widened as she looked at the entity.</p><p>“Uh. Hi?” Rio asked in a shocked tone.</p><p>“Don’t fret. I’m not retiring for a very long time. But I wanted to stop in and talk to you for a moment. Your bride seems to be having a rough time at the moment and I’m trying to make it a little easier.” Death reassured.</p><p>“How are you making it easier? How long?” Rio asked, she needed to know.</p><p>“I visited Evanora and took what was left of her power. Once you die a natural death you’ll take over. You and Agatha will have a long time together.” Death reassured.</p><p>“That explains that also, that’s reassuring.” Rio said relaxing slightly.</p><p>“You can ask me any questions you want.”</p><p>“What happens to Agatha when I take my place as Death?” Rio asked.</p><p>“If she outlives you, you can visit her at any time. If you outlive her I’ll take care of her until you take my place. My wife is currently at home in our comfy cabin waiting for me.” Death answered.</p><p>“Will Pepper, Pietro, and Wanda knowing that I’m next in line effect anything?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, honestly it isn’t a big deal if it’s a secret or not. Everyone has to die eventually.” Death answered.</p><p>“About your spell book…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“It would be an honor if you gave it to her. Now. I really must be going. I have souls piling up. If you ever need me, just call.” Death said as she waved her hand over Rio’s cellphone.</p><p>“Thanks for answering my questions.” Rio answered.</p><p>“I had to wait for you to find her, before I could talk to you.” Death answered before she disappeared and time restarted. Rio stood there in the book store with her brow furrowed as she replayed the conversation in her head.</p><p>“Wait! What!” Rio whisper yelled into the empty store.</p>

<p>Rio wanted to call Agatha again in that exact moment after Death had left, but she knew she was in meetings so she settled for texting her.</p><p>Rio 10:45 a.m: Please call me on your lunch! Or ASAP! Nothings wrong. Just got new information.</p><p>“That will have to do.” Rio said with a sigh as she set her phone down. A few minutes later a very cute blonde walked into the store. Rio could tell the woman was a witch.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books, spell books are in the back corner.” Rio said to the woman who turned and looked up shocked. Rio pointed to the back corner.</p><p>“I uh… thanks!” The blonde said as she walked in that direction. Rio stood at the counter and waited for the woman to finish shopping.  A few minutes later the blonde came up to the counter holding a common spell book on analog magic, and a couple lgbt novels.</p><p>“Did you find everything you were looking for?” Rio asked as she rang the books up.</p><p>“Actually… no, there is one other thing I was looking for.” The blonde said softly, Rio looked up and tilted her head.</p><p>“Oh, sorry maybe I can order it in for you. What’s the name of the book and the author?” Rio asked.</p><p>“It was actually your number…” the blonde trailed off.</p><p>“Ah, sorry. I actually have a girlfriend. But her best friend is single.” Rio said thinking on her feet.</p><p>“Bummer. I’ll keep that in mind. How much do I owe you?” The blonde asked.</p><p>“$45.80.” Rio said as she started bagging the books up. The blonde handed Rio a $50 and Rio gave her, her books and change before saying. “Thank you for shopping with Vidal Books.”</p><p>The blonde smiled softly and walked toward the door before pausing. “Is she hot?” The blonde asked.</p><p>“ I don’t know about hot, but she is tall, objectively pretty, skinny, a redhead, with blue eyes, a chaos witch, with a spunky attitude, and very compassionate.” Rio listed off.</p><p>“Fuck it! Give me her number?” The blonde asked.</p><p>“One moment. Let me text her real quick.” Rio answered as she grabbed her phone and sent Wanda a quick text.</p><p>Rio: 11:05 a.m: found you a date, permission to give her your number?</p><p>Wanda 11:05 a.m: If you’re serious? Sure!fuck it!</p><p>“Okay, I’ve got the greenlight.” Rio said as she grabbed a bookmark and a pen. She opened Wanda’s contact and wrote her name and number down. “Here you go.” Rio said as she walked over and handed the woman the bookmark.</p><p>“Thank you. Have a good day!” The blonde said before rushing out the door. Rio walked back over to the desk and grabbed her phone. It literally started ringing the moment she picked it up. Agatha was calling.</p><p>“Hello my love.” Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“What’s wrong? That sounded urgent.” Agatha said slightly worried.</p><p>“So you’ll never guess who stopped by the book store today.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Your mom?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, Death. Well, Violet Vidal.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Tell me everything right now, if you can.” Agatha requested, she was excited to hear about this.</p><p>“She paused time and just popped into the store. Reassured me that we will have a long life together before she retires. Then basically confirmed that she took the rest of your Mothers powers.”</p><p>“Well that’s good. Anything else?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“She told me that it doesn’t matter who knows about me, so we can tell them freely. Then… I asked about her spell book.”</p><p>“And?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“She said she’d be honored if I gave it to you. She wants you to have it.” Rio answered.</p><p>“I’m going to need to hear that from her personally before I keep it.” Agatha said into the phone as she shuffled some paperwork.</p><p>“You could call her tonight. She put her contact in my phone.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Funny death has a phone number, maybe I will.” Agatha joked back before asking. “Is that everything?”</p><p>“No! She told me she had to wait for us to meet before she could speak to me then dipped! Who does that!” Rio said exasperatedly, which caused Agatha to chuckle.</p><p>“Sounds like something Wanda would do. Thank you for telling me all of this.” Agatha told her appreciatively.</p><p>“You gotta get back to work?” Rio asked sadly.</p><p>“Unfortunately. Both my meetings are done for the day, but I gotta give reviews. Which takes so long. It’s like 45 minutes to an hour.” Agatha explained with a sigh.</p><p>“I believe in you babe.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Thanks. I appreciate it. Make sure you eat something. I’m about to have a chicken wrap.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“I’m gunna magic my left over pizza to me and eat that.” Rio told Agatha who hummed happily at the thought of pizza.</p><p>“That pizza was good.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“It was. Call or text me after your done?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Of course. Bye babe.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Goodbye my love.” Rio said softly before they both hung up. Rio sighed into the empty book store then summoned her pizza and a drink and started eating it cold.</p><p>The rest of her day was relatively slow, a few customers would pop in at a time.  It was a relatively slow day until around 3:30 p.m. then things picked up a little. It seemed like school had gotten out and the kids who wanted a place to chill or read before they went home for the night had filtered in.</p><p>Agatha 4:05 p.m: I’m sorry I assumed earlier. Are we spending time together tonight?</p><p>Rio 4:05 p.m: I’d love to spend time with you. My place or yours?</p><p>Agatha 4:06 p.m: Depends. Do you want a home cooked meal?</p><p>Rio 4:06 p.m: What kind of question is that? Of course I do.</p><p>Agatha 4:07 p.m: perfect. I have an idea on what I want to make. See you tonight 💜</p><p>Rio 4:07 p.m: what no hint?</p><p>Agatha 4:08 p.m: No. but if you could text me your allergies and food that you don’t like to eat that would be great so I don’t accidentally kill you.</p><p>Rio chuckled at that text message before she responded to Agatha.</p><p>Rio 4:09 p.m: no allergies, but I’m not super fond of fish.</p><p>Agatha 4:10 p.m: Perfect. I want to talk with Pepper before I leave for the night. I’ll text you when I leave work.</p><p>Rio set the phone down and focused on the customers in the book store. Yesterday may have sucked but at least she got to be there for Agatha and she now had less anxiety about being Death in the future.</p><p>~Stark Law Offices~</p><p>Agatha put her phone in her internal breast pocket of her suit and then stood up and headed for the door. Thankfully the employee’s she had to give review to today were all relatively good workers who did their jobs well so it wasn’t absolutely unbearable.  She walked out into the main office and stood next to Tricia’s desk.</p><p>“Tricia, can you call Timothy and ask him if Mrs. Potts has a moment to speak to me?”  Agatha asked her secretary.</p><p>The woman picked up the phone and dialed a number and waited. There was a long pause before she spoke. “Is Mrs. Potts free for a meeting with Ms. Harkness?” Then there was another long pause. “Thank you. Bye.”</p><p>“She’s free.” Tricia said as she hung the phone up.</p><p>“Perfect. Thank you. I’m unsure how long this is going to take. If I don’t see you before you leave, have a great night.” Agatha said as she patted the desk before walking away. She made her way to the elevator and headed to the top floor. Timothy smiled from his desk before he realized it was Agatha and stood up to be respectful.</p><p>“You don’t have to stand up every time Timothy, it’s fine.” Agatha said as she walked past his desk and opened the door to Peppers office.</p><p>“Thank you Tony. Tell Stephen I appreciate it as well.” Pepper said into the phone. Agatha took the hint and sat down in one of the chairs across from Pepper at her desk.</p><p>“She just got here. So I’m going to let you go and talk to her about this.” Pepper said into the phone, there was a pause before she spoke again. “I will. Love you too honey.” She responded to her husband before pulling the phone away and hanging up.</p><p>“What’s up Agatha?” Pepper asked as she set her phone down.</p><p>“Where to start… I’ll let you decide.  Do you want the information I’ve been withholding or do you want what I’ve learned?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Oh one thousand percent what you’ve been withholding.” Pepper said.</p><p>“Can I cast a sound dampening spell? I don’t want anyone I don’t trust knowing this information.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I give you permission to do whatever makes you comfortable.” Pepper answered the woman. With a flick of Agatha’s wrist the room seemed to quiet.</p><p>“Okay. So have you done any reading on the Vidal family?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, I’m nosey and typically would’ve but I’ve been dealing with a pain in the ass named Evanora Harkness.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“They are the original Green Witch Bloodline. Which means nothing to you. But to witch-kind it’s a big deal. Think old money.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Okay so you’re dating someone of status? Is that what the big deal is?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“No, I’m dating Rio Vidal, THE Green Witch. She is the next in line to take up her family’s mantle. The Green Witch Blood line originated as Death. Rio’s great great grand mother is the current standing entity of Death.” Agatha explained. She could see the gears in Pepper’s brain grind to a stop. There was a very long pause before she seemed to collect herself.</p><p>“So… let me get this straight… You, Agatha Harkness are dating and bound to the future embodiment of Death.” Pepper asked as her brain started working again.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha answered, she sat and waited for Pepper to fully process.</p><p>“Okay. Cool. We are just gunna back burner that for a second while I process. What did you learn?”</p><p>“That Violet Vidal, the current standing entity of Death was a spirit witch and took the last of my mother’s power last night. Rio sent me an urgent message around eleven this morning. She decided to pay Rio a visit and answer some questions.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“What kind of questions?”</p><p>“Things that have been bothering Rio for a while now. Death can decide to retire at any point and then Rio would have to take her place. So there was some anxiety about that. She basically reassured Rio that we will have a long happy life together before she retires when Rio dies naturally.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Well it’s good to know I won’t be seeing your wife when I die. I mean it might be a comfort for it to be someone I know… let’s not dwell on that for too long.”</p><p>“She’s not my wife.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Oh come on Harkness. That sigil on your chest says otherwise. The only one denying it is you!” Pepper jabbed.</p><p>“Can’t you just let me be delusional?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No.” Pepper said seriously.</p><p>“Too bad. I’m gunna hang out in delululand for at least 6-9 months.” Agatha told Pepper.</p><p>“Normally I love how stubborn you are but right now… It’s irritating.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“That’s because it’s normally not directed at you. Anyway, what did Mr. Potts have to say?” Agatha joked trying to change the subject.</p><p>“He thinks that’s hilarious by the way, but that’s beside the point. Stephen Strange found the individual that made the glamor spell for your mother.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Oh? Do tell.” Agatha asked as she leaned forward, Pepper had her attention.</p><p>“Not much to tell, just some random witch that makes specified glamor spells for individuals who want to present as the opposite gender. Affordable gender affirmation spells. She had no clue what Evanora was using the spell for.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Well at least there was no intended malcontent when it came to the spell. Maybe that’s why she got past my security measures so easily. The intent was made out of goodwill.”  Agatha explained.</p><p>“I know you have sigils on the front of the building. Do we have witches who work here that need gender affirming care? Is that why it didn’t alert you?”</p><p>“I mean yes, but I’m going to be straight forward with you. It’s much easier to cast a spell than it is to go through hormone treatments, surgery’s, and all the other uncomfortable things needed to present as your preferred gender. So I allow that glamor to slip through the cracks.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“You have a good heart Agatha. Unfortunately Evanora used that to her advantage.”  Pepper said as she rubbed her eyes with her thumb and index finger.</p><p>“Yes, well I’d rather my employees be happy at work instead of miserable. So I’ll work on fixing the spell so that they can still be comfortable. We should have a sign posted in the lobby after I fix it saying something along the lines of ‘If you aren’t a Stark industries employee glamor spells will be ineffective in this building.’ Or something similar.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“That sounds good. Now… back to Rio.” Pepper said in a tone Agatha didn’t recognize.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’m thinking a fall wedding… or maybe spring the following year.” Pepper said with a grin.</p><p>“That’s it. I’m hexing you!” Agatha said with a laugh.</p><p>“Oh come on!” Pepper yelled exasperatedly.</p><p>“Look, I know that we are each others end all be all and that is very reassuring but… Right now I just want to enjoy what we have. I want to learn about her naturally, I want us to just be.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“You are literally no fun.”</p><p>“I know. It’s the best.” Agatha said sarcastically as she scrunched her nose.</p><p>“Anything else?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Probably can have her moved to a regular non-magical facility. I expect with her magic gone she’s going to start aging rapidly. Soon.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I mean… Now that I know she’s lost her magic I don’t think Evanora Harkness will make it to her trial. She’s 250 years old in human years. Magic is the only reason witches live 800 plus years.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“You’re fucking kidding me!” Pepper said as she stood up, she almost seemed excited.</p><p>“This is new and unprecedented. She could live another 30 years easily, or she could die next week. She may look 55 but she’s no spring chicken.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“So right now continue with the legal proceedings and if she dies she dies?” Pepper asks.</p><p>“If she dies, she dies.” Agatha said as blandly as possible. “Either way, I’m finally free from her. She’s powerless, in prison, and getting her comeuppance.”</p><p>“Is it sad I want her to live another 30 years so we can see her rot?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“No, but it is petty.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Okay, I’m okay with petty. But it’s 4:30 and I have to go home early today. So I’ll see you tomorrow. Also, you aren’t working this weekend. I don’t care how behind you are. Spend Saturday with Rio. Go to the botanical gardens, do something.” Pepper told Agatha leaving no room for argument.</p><p>“The bookstore is open Saturdays. She can’t hire employees yet, so she’s gotta work every day she’s open. But she did invite me to family dinner to meet her mother. So I guess I can tell her I’ll be coming tonight when I see her.”</p><p>“That is unfortunate…” Pepper said in a tone Agatha did recognize. It was Peppers ‘I can fix that tone.’</p><p>“Pepper…” Agatha drew out her name slowly, like a warning.</p><p>“What? I was just saying it sucks that she can’t afford to hire an employee. So she can spend the weekends with you. Now go home!” Pepper said as she shooed Agatha out of the office.</p><p>“Rude.” Agatha said as she got up and walked over to the door. “Behave Pepper.” Agatha requested before she walked out the door and made her way toward the elevator.</p><p>“Yeah, Harkness. I won’t be doing that.” Pepper said to herself as she smiled brightly and picked the phone up to call Tony.</p><p>“Hello Darling, how did the conversation with Agatha go?” Tony asked loudly, Pepper could tell he was in his lab working on something.</p><p>“It sure was enlightening… to say the least. But that’s not why I called.” Pepper told her husband.</p><p>“Then why did you call?” He asked.</p><p>“Got any ideas on how to make a bookstore successful over night?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Call schools and libraries in the surrounding areas and ask them what books they need desperately. Order books from said store, then donate those books. Request the libraries and schools keep a standing list of books they want or need and order them from the store each month. Alternatively we could just have contracts with those areas that whatever book they order from the store is paid for by Stark Industries and foot the bill.” Tony offered.</p><p>“Would you be okay with that?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Do you realize how much money Agatha Harkness has earned and saved us in the last 12 years? I’m more than okay with that, especially if it’s to support her girlfriend.”</p><p>“About that.. we have to talk in person about what I learned today.”</p><p>“Must be super important. Alright, when will you be home?”</p><p>“Soon, I’m getting ready to leave the office.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“I need a shower. I’ll speak to you when you get here. I love you.” Tony said into the room.</p><p>“Love you. See you soon.” Pepper said as she hung up the phone.</p><p>Agatha made it back down to her office in time to make sure Tricia was leaving on time. She grabbed her briefcase, empty coffee cup, and keys before she shut her office light off and headed out the door.</p><p>“Come on Tricia I’ll walk you to your car.” Agatha said to the woman who was packing her things up.</p><p>“Oh thank you.” Tricia said slightly shocked. Most of the office was empty so she quickly packed up and followed Agatha to the elevator.</p><p>“The two meetings I have tomorrow. What time are they scheduled for?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Both are in the morning. The rest of the day is free. Why?” Tricia asked as Agatha hit the down button.</p><p>“I think I’m going to take a half day tomorrow.” Agatha said with a smile on her face. Tricia almost dropped her purse in shock.</p><p>“What? You don’t.. excuse me?” Tricia asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“I’m meeting Rio’s family on Saturday, I want to bake something so I’m going to take time off to do it. Not like I don’t have almost a year of personal days to use.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Happiness looks good on you Agatha. I’m glad you are finally taking care of things that aren’t work.” Tricia said as she stepped off the elevator into the main lobby.</p><p>“Thanks. I think it will be nice to take a break for a change.” Agatha said as they walked out of the building and into the parking lot.</p><p>“Have a goodnight Agatha.”</p><p>“You as well Tricia.” Agatha told the woman as she broke away from her and headed toward her own car. She needed to get some groceries for what she had planned for dinner. But first she needed to text Rio.</p><p>Agatha 5:00 p.m: leaving work now! Gotta go to the store then head home and start cooking. See you soon!</p><p>One quick stop at the store and a drive home later Agatha hauled everything she would need into the house to make dinner and bake the surprise she had planned for Saturday.</p><p>“Let’s get this started.” Agatha said to herself as she walked into her bedroom and removed her suit. She put on a pair of sleep shorts and a baggy tee shirt and a pair of fuzzy socks. Then walked back out into the kitchen and tossed on an apron.</p><p>“Not that I need to pull out all the stops or anything but I think some marry me chicken sounds great.” Agatha whispered to herself as she opened the chicken breasts on the counter.</p><p>She coated the bottom of her pan with oil, and lightly dredged her chicken in seasoned flower before pan searing it. While they were searing she got the baby potatoes in the oven with seasoning. She pulled the chicken out after it had a good crust on both sides and then started making the sauce. Agatha took the time and care to make sure each ingredient was added in at the right time then the chicken was added back in and a lid was put on and set to simmer.</p><p>A knock on the door came at the perfect time. Agatha walked out of the kitchen and into the entryway. She opened the door to see Rio standing there with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“Hey babe! Come on in, I’m almost done cooking.” Agatha said as she let Rio into the house.</p><p>“It smells amazing in here. What are we having?” Rio asked as she followed Agathta into the kitchen.</p><p>“Salad, roasted garlic new potatoes, and marry me chicken.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Sounds amazing.” Rio said as she slid closer to Agatha. She wrapped her arms around Agatha from behind and softly kissed the back of her neck and shoulder.</p><p>“Rio…. Let me finish cooking.” Agatha said with a sigh. She felt all the tension melt away from her body.</p><p>“I’m not doing anything wrong.” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s skin as she slid her hands under her shirt to softly glide her fingers against Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“How was the rest of work?” Agatha asked as she turned off the heat on the stove and oven. She side stepped and grabbed the salad out of the fridge before setting it on the countertop.</p><p>“I forgot to mention that I got flirted with by a customer today when I called you. I told her I was taken and actually texted Wanda to see if I could give her, her number.”</p><p>“Was she cute?” Agatha asked in a neutral tone.</p><p>“To me? No. Objectively? Yes. I don’t think Wanda would have any complaints about how she looks.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Nice. Anything else? Also you gotta let me go so I can bend over and grab the potatoes out of the oven.” Agatha requested. Rio groaned and let go of Agatha before stepping back and moving over to the counter.</p><p>“Not really, nothing too exciting really. It was a slow day today.” Rio told Agatha as she leaned against the counter. Agatha set the potatoes on the stove and grabbed two plates out of the cabinet.</p><p>“I actually have a table we can eat at if you want.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“Whatever you’d like. I don’t mind sitting at the island.” Rio answered.</p><p>“So… I’m taking a half day tomorrow and I have the weekend off.” Agatha started to say as she served the salad into bowls and then the potatoes and chicken onto plates. She set everything on the counter and bent down to get a bottle of white wine. She magicked it open and grabbed two glasses. She poured Rio a glass and then one for herself before grabbing silver wear for the both of them.</p><p>“Really? So you’re coming to dinner?” Rio asked excitedly.</p><p>“Yes. I’m also bringing a dessert if that’s okay with your mother? What kind of dressing do you want?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Ranch tonight please, I’ll text her right now.” Rio said as she pulled her phone and texted her Mom.</p><p>Rio 6:45 p.m: Agatha is coming to family dinner, she has decided to bring dessert if that’s okay?</p><p>Rio sent the message and then looked at the plate in front of her. “This looks delicious.”</p><p>“Dig in.” Agatha said as she sat down next to Rio. They both started eating, Rio took the first bite of chicken and moaned softly.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha.” Rio husked out as she looked over at her girlfriend who had a smirk on her face.</p><p>“Yes Rio?” Agatha asked with a smile as she picked up the glass of wine and took a drink.</p><p>“You did this on purpose. How is this so good!?” Rio asked as she took another bite.</p><p>“Did what on purpose? And because I made it.”</p><p>“Made food that would make me want to propose to you.” Rio said in a serious tone.</p><p>“I actually made it because it sounded good and I wanted to thank you for taking care of me.” Agatha clarified as she took a bite of food, once she finished chewing she continued.“So about Death… can you message her? I have a few questions.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Sure.” Rio said as she pulled her phone out and opened the contact. A moment later Agatha and Rio felt something shift.</p><p>“You called?” The woman asked looking so casual, nothing like the embodiment of Death.</p><p>“Hi great great grandma.” Rio said to the woman as she stuffed her face. The woman rolled her eyes at the young witch.</p><p>“Hello Rio, Hello Agatha. Nice to offically meet you.” Death said as she held her hand out for Agatha to shake. Agatha stood up and shook Death’s hand.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, I actually asked Rio to call you because I have a few questions if you don’t mind?” Agatha asked politely.</p><p>“Sit down and eat. I’ll answer any questions you have.” Death instructed, Agatha sat down and went back to eating.</p><p>“So… now that you’ve taken my mother’s magic… does that mean she’s no longer a witch? I’m trying to figure out how much longer she has left to live.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I cannot give you the exact day of her Death. But, let’s just say she’s very human now.” Death explained.</p><p>“Human like she’s relatively 55 years of age, or that 250 is about to catch up to her fast human?” Agatha asked before she took a bite of her food. Rio was still eating quickly.</p><p>“Could be either but I’m thinking option B. This is new for everyone involved. I know when you die. Not how.” Death answered.</p><p>“Good to know. Next question. Violet or Death?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Either is fine.” The woman said with a shrug.</p><p>“I have one. Why did you say you had to wait for me to meet Agatha before you could talk to me?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Honestly it’s very complicated but the simple summarization is that until that sigil showed up, you couldn’t see me. I’ve been watching you your whole life.” Death explained</p><p>“So the love binding spell is the only reason we can see you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It’s more complicated than that. Here.” Death said as she manifested her spell book and handed it to Agatha. “This is yours now my dear. Hopefully it can answer some questions for you both.”</p><p>“I would argue that Rita would be angry about this but.. it’s technically yours.” Agatha said as she took the deep purple book with black scythes crossing on the cover.</p><p>“She will get over it. Anything else?” Death asked the two women.</p><p>“Should we expect anything else to show up? Sigil wise? Also, do you eat? Want some dinner?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“There is always a possibility for more things to pop up. I can, but my wife is making dinner as we speak.”  Death answered.</p><p>“We shouldn’t hold you up any longer.” Rio said before she took a drink of wine.</p><p>“I have a few souls to pick up before I head home. Don’t be strangers girls.” Death said before she disappeared from the kitchen.</p><p>“I have a feeling she’s going to do that every time she leaves” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“Probably.” Agatha said before she took a bite.</p><p>“Can I have seconds?” Rio requested as she popped the last potato in her mouth.  Agatha laughed softly at Rio.</p><p>“Yes. But save room for dessert.” Agatha reminded Rio.</p><p>“What’s for dessert?” Rio questioned as she got up to make herself a second plate.</p><p>“Me.” Agatha flirted.</p>

<p>“Me.” Agatha flirted.</p><p>Rio paused her action of removing the lid from the pan of chicken. “You are playing a dangerous game Agatha.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“How so babe?” Agatha asked sweetly. Rio shook her head and took the lid off the chicken and grabbed another piece with sauce before putting the lid on. Then she scooped up more potatoes. She walked over and set her plate down on the counter before she spun Agatha’s bar stool so that she was facing her.</p><p>Rio softly grabbed Agatha’s face and kissed her passionately. Agatha’s head was spinning, Rio slid her hand between Agatha’s thighs and cupped her though her shorts.</p><p>“What would you do if I made you slip these off and had you for dessert right here?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I thought you wanted seconds.” Agatha husked out.</p><p>“I do. But you’ve also been tempting since I walked in the door as well.” Rio said as she leans forward and kisses along Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha gasped out as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair. She pulled back softly, removing Rio’s lips from her neck.</p><p>“Eat. Don’t make me waste all this food. If you behave, I’ll let you use the strap first.” Agatha offered. Rio paused and sighed before she turning around and sitting back down so she could eat. Agatha turned herself back to her own food and continued eating. She finished her food and got up to clean the kitchen and put food away while Rio ate.</p><p>Rio took time to savor the food this time around. She was seriously contemplating proposing to Agatha in this exact moment. Rio knew that wasn’t a good idea, so instead she settled for having some patience and finishing her food. Everything was so good, Rio couldn’t believe she had gotten so lucky with Agatha.</p><p>“I really am the luckiest woman in the world.” Rio said as she watched Agatha clean up.</p><p>“Oh really? Why’s that?” Agatha asked over her shoulder as she rinsed dishes and loaded the dish washer.</p><p>“Because soon I’ll be able to come home to you and enjoy nights like this. I get to spend the rest of eternity worshiping you.” Rio said with a bright smile. Agatha turned the sink off and dried her hands before she turned around to look at Rio.</p><p>“How does that make you the lucky one? If I’m the one being worshiped by Death itself, I’d argue I won the universe’s lottery.” Agatha commented before looking at Rio’s plate with a raised eyebrow. Rio grumbled and continued to eat instead of flirting.</p><p>“You don’t have to force yourself to finish it. I can pack it up for your lunch tomorrow.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Actually.. can you? I have something else I’d rather be eating.” Rio said as she raked her eyes over Agatha’s body. She slid the plate over to Agatha who quickly packed it into a to go container and put it in the fridge before rinsing Rio’s plate and putting it in the dishwasher.</p><p>Rio got up and slid behind Agatha again after she finished adding the detergent to the machine and slid her hands under Agatha’s shirt. Agatha sighed softly as Rio gripped her hips slightly before dipping under the waistline of her shorts.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha whispered as she shut the machine and hit start. She was trying to hold onto the thread of self control she had left.</p><p>“Yes Agatha?” Rio asked as she toyed with Agatha’s panty line.</p><p>“Take me to bed.” Agatha groaned out as she leaned against Rio. Her head falling against Rio’s shoulder. Rio kissed Agatha’s neck softly before lightly biting down on her shoulder.  Agatha groaned loudly before she teleported them to bed. They were both lying down together in the same position they were just standing in. Rio removed herself from Agatha and pushed her onto the bed softly.</p><p>“Couldn’t help me out by removing our clothing again?” Rio joked.</p><p>“Nah, I wanna make you work for it.” Agatha husked out as she stretched on the bed. Agatha’s hands reaching up and caressing the pillows softly with a smile on her face. Rio was slightly frustrated she didn’t take more time to read how to remove clothing in Agatha’s book so she did the next best thing. She grabbed Agatha’s shorts and panties and pulled them off as quickly as possible before shoving her shirt up so she could see her breasts.</p><p>“Someone’s impatient.” Agatha said with a chuckle as Rio straddled one of her thighs.</p><p>“Well maybe if someone didn’t make me ‘work for it’ I wouldn’t be.” Rio said as she started kissing down Agatha’s body.</p><p>“Maybe I should give you a little lesson on how to remove clothing with magic later.” Agatha whispered as she felt Rio kiss down her body.</p><p>“I’m willing to learn right now.” Rio suggested as she kissed the sigil up Agatha’s chest. She was just letting her lips roam over Agatha’s chest and torso. With each kiss along the sigil Agatha could feel Rio’s arousal corse through her.</p><p>“It’s fairly simple. Just imagine the clothing somewhere else. I usually aim for the floor or hamper.” Agatha said softly. Rio took a moment and imagined Agatha’s shirt in the hamper. With a puff of green smoke it disappeared.</p><p>“Good job, now your clothing.” Agatha requested. Rio focused hard and imagined her outfit in her hamper at home, then she was naked. Core pressed firmly against Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Magnificent.” Agatha praised before groaning out. “Goddesses you are wet.”</p><p>“I told you, you’ve been tempting me since I arrived. Now… where were we.” Rio said as she imagined her green strap around her waist. A moment later she felt it settle comfortably against her hips.</p><p>“I see you are a quick study.” Agatha said with a grin.</p><p>“You gave great motivation.” Rio answered as she slid her hand down to cup Agatha’s core. Fingers sliding between folds before she found her clit and softly rolled it under her fingers.</p><p>“Oh! Rio.” Agatha gasped as she rolled her hips softly. Rio dipped her fingers down to collect some of Agatha’s arousal.</p><p>“It seems like I’m not the only one who’s wet.” Rio groaned as she thrust into Agatha. Agatha lifted their thigh up and pressed it hard against Rio’s core. A soft moan fell from Rio’s lips as she rolled her hips against Agatha’s thigh as she curled her fingers into the woman.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. You know… I had an idea.” Agatha moaned out as Rio continued to thrust into her.</p><p>“You can tell me all about it once you come for me.” Rio said as she leaned forward and kissed Agatha passionately. Moans echoing into her mouth as Agatha clenched down hard on her fingers as she came, sparks flashing across her vision. Rio pulled away and sighed happily as she felt Agatha’s wall’s flutter around her fingers.</p><p>“What was your idea babe?” Rio asked as she kissed along Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Let me show you? Lay down on the bed next to me.” Agatha said as she patted the bed.  Rio grumbled softly before listening to Agatha and lying down next to her. Agatha slid down the bed and settled between Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio asked but was quickly answered by Agatha gripping the toy and running her tongue along the length of it.</p><p>“Woah.” Rio said as she felt Agatha take the head into her mouth and swirl her tongue around the toy. “That… feels..” Rio started to say but she lost her words.</p><p>Agatha smirked softly before sucking hard on the toy before taking the whole length into her mouth. Rio moaned at the feeling of Agatha’s tongue swiping back and forth across the toy. Agatha then brought her fingers up to Rio’s pussy and slid two fingers deep into her curling them as she sucked on the toy. Agatha could feel drool pool in her mouth.  She pulled her mouth away and coated the toy with her drool.</p><p>“Do you feel like you could come this way?” Agatha asked before she swirled her tongue around the head again.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio husked out as she looked down at Agatha.</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha said before she started thrusting into Rio as she sucked on the toy. She started curling her fingers as she bobbed her head up and down.</p><p>“Fuck! That’s so good.” Rio husked out at the new sensations she was experiencing. It felt like her clit was being sucked off instead of the toy. Agatha started thrusting into Rio faster and moaning as she sucked on the toy, sending vibrations straight to Rio’s core. Rio felt herself growing closer to an orgasm.   Rio was trying her best to keep her hands to herself but she desperately wanted weave her fingers into Agatha’s hair. Rio opted for clutching the sheets instead.</p><p>“Agatha! Goddesses above! Fuck!” Rio screamed as she came. Her hips jerking as Agatha pulled her mouth away. Agatha smiled softly as she sat up and climbed into Rio’s lap, sliding the toy into her. A soft moan slipped from Agatha as she settled onto Rio’s hips.</p><p>“Wait…” Rio groaned out trying to collect her thoughts.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha questioned as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“This isn’t letting me use the strap first.” Rio whined.</p><p>“You’re wearing it my love. What did you have in mind?” Agatha asked as she rolled her hips. Rio groaned and grabbed Agatha’s hips, stilling them so she could focus for a moment.</p><p>“I want to take you from behind.” Rio requested, Agatha groaned softly at the thought.</p><p>“But that means I have to get off you.” Agatha complained a pout gracing her lips as she looked down at Rio.</p><p>“I’ll make it worthwhile” Rio promised. Agatha huffed and climbed off Rio and adjusted the pillows so that her hips were propped up in the air but her chest was pressed against the bed. Her arms were folded and she was resting her head on them comfortably.</p><p>Rio moved quickly and got behind Agatha, lining herself up with her entrance Rio thrust into her slowly. A muffled moan came from Agatha a moment later as Rio felt Agatha clench down on the toy. Her warm wet heat feeling almost like heaven. Rio moaned softly as she grabbed Agatha’s hips and started thrusting slowly into her. Rio leaned forward and kissed Agatha’s back softly.</p><p>“Oh. Rio.” Agatha sighed as Rio started to thrust into her slowly.</p><p>“Agatha… you feel so good. Goddesses above.” Rio husked out as she left open mouthed kisses against Agatha’s back. Rio slid her hands down Agatha’s arms and Agatha moved her hands so she could grasp Rio’s hands with her own. Agatha’s moans and whimpers pushed Rio closer to the edge as she thrust into Agatha.</p><p>“More.” Agatha gasped out as she tried to move her hips back.</p><p>“Fuck yes.” Rio hissed out as she started to thrust into Agatha faster. “Come on Agatha, be a good girl for me baby.” Rio praises as she locked her left hand’s fingers with Agatha’s. Her right hand had moved back up to her elbow and kept her pined to her bed. Agatha was practically screaming into the mattress as she came she could feel their magic start to thrum in the air.</p><p>“Fuck. Good girl. Now give me another.” Rio requested as she started thrusting into Agatha again. Agatha felt like her whole body was alive with magic as Rio picked out the pace. This time Rio could feel her own orgasm creeping up as she set a brutal pace. “Cum with me Agatha. I want to feel you clench down on me as I cum. Please baby. Please cum with me. ”</p><p>Rio’s begging as she continued to thrust into Agatha. She could feel Agatha clench down on the toy, each thrust causing her hips to twitch as Rio continued.</p><p>“Oh! Fuck!” Agatha screamed into the mattress as she felt herself fall off the edge again. Rio felt herself tumble over the edge before she sunk her hips deep against Agatha. Soft moans and whimpers came from Agatha as Rio kissed along her shoulders and spine.</p><p>“Good girl.” Rio praised as she left a soft nip to Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha turned her head so she could breathe before she moaned softly as Rio rolled her hips.</p><p>“Unfair.” Agatha groaned out as Rio started moving faster.</p><p>“I know, but I want more.” Rio husked out, she wanted Agatha in a puddle under her once she was finished. Agatha was moaning as Rio continued to thrust slowly into her, Rio could feel her clenching down on the toy. Her soft wet heat was almost euphoric. “Do you have any idea how good it feels to be inside of you?” Rio husked out.</p><p>Agatha’s body was shaking, she felt so overwhelmed by two orgasms back to back. But she didn’t want this to stop, she felt this harsh coil start to wind even tighter inside of her than she ever had before. She gripped Rio’s left hand with her own tightly. “Rio, fuck! Please!” Agatha begged, she felt like she had lost all control of herself as Rio thrust into her.</p><p>“What do you need baby?” Rio huffed out. She was close again herself. She never realized how much energy it would take to focus when she could also feel everything. It was so enjoyable, but also overwhelming.</p><p>“Clit, touch my clit.” Agatha begged. Rio slid her right hand down Agatha’s body and between her legs. She found the sensitive bud between her legs and started rolling it softly as she thrust into her. “Harder. Please.” Agatha begged.</p><p>Rio listened and pressed harder on her clit. Agatha buried her face into the mattress and screamed loudly as she came undone. Magical energy crackling though them as she did, clenching down hard on the toy inside of her. Rio sunk her hips in deep and moaned softly as she came with Agatha. She laid against Agatha, pressing her body weight on the woman. Agatha turned her head and took a deep breath. She felt so warm and fuzzy, from the lack of oxygen and magic.</p><p>“I don’t know what the goal was… but you’ve exceeded it.” Agatha mumbled softly as she groaned out.</p><p>“Who said I was done?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Rio…. Please I need a moment.” Agatha requested. Rio grumbled softly to herself before she removed herself from Agatha and settled next to the woman. She willed the strap on and pillows away as she pulled Agatha close to her.</p><p>“This is your own fault you know.” Rio said as she kissed Agatha’s shoulder, Agatha turned her head and looked at Rio with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh really? How so?” Agatha asked. Rio started trailing her fingers softly across Agatha’s back. Fingers swirling patters and designs across the sensitive flesh.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to give me a blowjob and finger me at the same time. That was intense.” Rio mumbled against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“I had more planned for you than that but someone threw a monkey wrench in that plan.” Agatha said as she rolled over so she could face Rio.</p><p>“Oh? What were those plans?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“Well, I was going to ride you while I made out with you. Maybe leave a couple more marks on you. Then once you had came a few times I was going to get rid of that toy and eat you out.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“I think that sounds like a great idea. I never did get my dessert.” Rio said with a smirk as she softly pushed Agatha over and slid down her body.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio husked out, Agatha groaned softly as she kissed her stomach softly before settling between her legs.</p><p>“Or we could eat each other out at the same time?” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“That is an idea, but I really just want to focus on you.” Rio said as she spread Agatha’s legs and leaned in to capture her clit with her mouth.</p><p>“I’m using an energy spell after this and giving you a taste of your own medicine.” Agatha said before she let out a long moan. Rio smiled softly as she continued to suck and flick her clit with her tongue.</p><p>“Goddesses above. That mouth.” Agatha moaned out as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair and tugged softly.  Rio moaned softly as Agatha rolled her hips and gripped her hair. Rio swirled her tongue around Agatha’s clit quickly making the woman below her moan. Rio then slid a hand under her chin and slid her fingers into Agatha.</p><p>“Fuck. Yes!” Agatha hissed out as Rio started to curl her fingers into her roughly.  Rio picked up her tongues speed as she continued to thrust into Agatha. Agatha felt herself tumble over the edge.</p><p>“Goddess yes!” Agatha screamed as she came. Rio removed her mouth but kept her fingers in place.</p><p>“Do you want another?” Rio asked as she kissed Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“No. I want to touch you.” Agatha said with a raspy tone from all the screaming.</p><p>“I could spend an eternity right here.” Rio whispered as she kissed Agatha’s thighs. Agatha huffed and grabbed Rio’s hand. The woman was then teleported so that she was sitting on Agatha’s chest. Agatha had apparently used that energy spell as well.</p><p>“It’s my turn my love.” Agatha said as she kissed the side of Rio’s thigh before she pulled her pussy down to her face. Rio’s hand shot up go grasp the headboard as Agatha found her clit and started swirling and thrashing her tongue along Rio’s clit.</p><p>“Okay, didn’t know you could do that!” Rio gasped out as Agatha continued to drink her in. Her tongue rolling and curling across her clit.  Agatha chuckled as she continued to assault Rio’s clit with her tongue. Rio was close her body was curling as she gripped the headboard. Moans and profanities spilled from her lips as Agatha continued to use her tongue on her clit.</p><p>“Fuck!” Rio screamed out as she rolled her hips softly, her orgasm tore through her. Agatha gripped Rio’s hips harder and started moving her tongue faster as she continued to eat the woman above her out.  Agatha was drinking every drop of Rio up like she was the sweetest wine.</p><p>“Agatha! Fuck! Goddess Damn it!” Rio screamed as she felt Agatha curl her tongue around the sensitive bud. Rio was so close to coming again, she could feel the coil in her stomach start to wind faster than she even expected.  Then with the perfect flick of Agatha’s tongue Rio tumbled over the edge.</p><p>“Yes! Fuck yes!” Rio screamed as her body begun to shake. Rio fell to the side quickly collapsing on the bed with a groan.</p><p>“Oh if you think we are done you are sorely wrong.” Agatha said as she turned and grabbed Rio by the hips softly.</p><p>“Wha?” Rio started to ask but then she was in the position she had Agatha in moments ago. Ass in the air, hips propped up by pillows as her face was in her arms on the bed. Agatha had her strap on and thrust into Rio to collect her arousal on her fingers.</p><p>“I told you I was going to give you a taste of your own medicine my love.” Agatha reminded Rio as she thrust into the woman a couple times before removing her fingers and coating the toy with Rio’s arousal. Agatha settled comfortably on the bed slid the toy into Rio.</p><p>Both women moaned loudly as the toy slid into Rio, Agatha felt her walls fluttering around her, wet slick heat of Rio’s pussy feeling almost glorious.</p><p>“Fuck you feel so good.” Agatha mumbled as she grasped Rio’s hips and started thrusting into her slowly. Rio felt so full in this position, like Agatha was stretching her slightly. She bit her lip as Agatha started to move faster. Agatha removed one hand soothed it over Rio’s butt cheek before she reeled back and smacked the sensitive flesh.</p><p>“Fuck! Agatha!” Rio screamed into the bed as Agatha soothed the flesh again with her palm. She paused as she allowed Rio to catch her breath for a moment.</p><p>“Verbal confirmation needed babe.” Agatha said as she palmed her ass.</p><p>“Green light!” Rio yelled as she turned her head. Agatha smirked and reeled her hand back again and smacked her ass again as she continued to thrust into Rio. Rio was teetering on the edge with that last slap.</p><p>“Good girl. Are you going to cum for me?” Agatha asked as she soothed her ass with her hand. Agatha continued to thrust into Rio, long steady strokes had her reeling.</p><p>“Yes! Please Agatha!” Rio begged. Agatha reeled back one last time and slapped Rio again. She felt Rio clench down hard as she came, Agatha was moaning softly as she soothed Rio’s ass again. Softly massaging the flesh as she continued to thrust into her.</p><p>“Perfect.” Agatha praised as she slid her right hand up Rio’s back and wove her fingers into Rio’s hair palming the back of her head before tugging lightly.</p><p>“Oh fuuuck.” Rio moaned out as she felt herself cum again as Agatha continued to fuck her through her orgasm.</p><p>“Did you just?” Agatha asked as she felt Rio clench down on the toy.</p><p>“Yes. Yes. Yes!” Rio screamed as she rolled her hips. Green and purple sparks flashing across her vision as Agatha drew out the longest orgasm she had ever experienced. Agatha continued to fuck her into the mattress as she felt her clench down on the toy.</p><p>Once she finally came back to reality she realized Agatha was still thrusting into her. She felt her whole body flush as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“Now who’s being greedy.” Rio moaned out as she felt Agatha tug on her hair. Agatha let go of her hair and placed her hand on the bed as her free hand slid around to toy with Rio’s clit.</p><p>“Me.” Agatha husked into Rio’s ear as she continued to fuck her into the mattress.</p><p>“I… I… can.. tell.” Rio gasped out between thrusts.</p><p>“Come on baby. Cum with me.” Agatha demanded, she was so close she could taste it. Rio felt herself start to shake as Agatha thrust into her, each stroke feeling like she was being dragged under. Rio was drowning in euphoria as Agatha continued to fuck her. Rio felt like she was crashing and soaring all at once. She came undone, screaming into the mattress as magical energy thrummed through the both of them.</p><p>“Fuck yes! Agatha!” Rio screamed as she fell apart, clenching down hard on the toy that Agatha burried deep inside her. Agatha tumbled over the edge a moment later as she collapsed against Rio’s back. Soft kisses peppered Rio’s back as Agatha picked herself up off Rio.</p><p>“How you doing babe?” Agatha asked</p><p>“You win. I’m tapping out.” Rio said with a groan.</p><p>“Wasn’t the goal but I’ll take it.” Agatha said as she magicked the harness and pillows away. Rio rolled over and cuddled into Agatha’s arms with a sigh.</p><p>“You’re perfect.” Rio mumbled as she kissed the top of Agatha’s sigil on her chest. Agatha felt herself flooded with love and happiness.</p><p>“So are you.” Agatha whispered to Rio as she kissed the top of her head.</p><p>“What time is it?” Rio asked softly, feeling spent.</p><p>“I have no clue. One second.” Agatha said as she summoned her phone. 8:06 p.m  and 4 texts from Wanda sprawled across the screen. With a soft sigh Agatha unlocked her phone to read the messages.</p><p>“It’s only eight, Wanda is texting me one second babe.” Agatha said as she read the messages.</p><p>Wanda 7:30 p.m: I have a date with the cute girl from the book store.</p><p>Wanda 7:35 p.m: She’s a botanist!</p><p>Wanda 7:35 p.m: tell Rio to answer her texts! I messaged her first!</p><p>Wanda 7:37 p.m:  you are obviously busy… once you’re done please answer me!</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she summoned Rio’s phone.</p><p>“Babe, someone has something important she wants you to read.” Agatha said as she handed a very sleepy Rio her phone.</p><p>“Whyyy.” Rio groaned out as she took her phone and cracked one eye open to see that Wanda had texted her 7 times. “Your bestfriend is ridiculous.”</p><p>Wanda 6:45 p.m: she’s so fucking cute!</p><p>Wanda 6:45 p.m: we’ve been chatting for the last 3 hours. She’s a botanist.</p><p>Wanda 6:47 p.m: if this date goes well I owe you.</p><p>Wanda 6:50 p.m: Tomorrow!</p><p>Wanda 6:55 p.m: woman answer me! I’m trying to thank you!</p><p>Wanda 7:00 p.m: What did Agatha make for dinner?</p><p>Wanda 7:05 p.m. I guess it’s fend for myself night :(</p><p>Rio 8:09 p.m: Agatha made marry me chicken, roasted garlic new potatoes, and a salad. Your welcome?</p><p>Rio sent the text off and looked over at Agatha who was smiling at her. “What?”</p><p>“I’m glad she likes you. If makes this so much easier.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I think possibly finding her a girlfriend helps significantly.” Rio says as she hands Agatha her phone so she can read the messages.</p><p>“I think she’s just happy you make me happy.” Agatha said as she read the messages.</p><p>“Jeeze Wanda. Chill.” Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“Let me see what she said to you.”  Rio said as Agatha handed her, her phone. Rio read the messages quickly.</p><p>“Should we get dressed and tell her she can come over and eat?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No… I wanna stay in bed cuddled up with you all nakey.” Rio grumbled as she kissed Agatha.</p><p>“That’s fine but she’s blowing our phones up again.” Agatha explained as she felt Rio’s phone vibrate in her hand. She read the message and laughed softly.  Before handing the phone to Rio.</p><p>Wanda 8:15 p.m: did you propose? Please that’s one of her best dishes… now I know why y’all were ignoring me!</p><p>Rio 8:16 p.m: oh believe me I wanted to…</p><p>Wanda 8:16 p.m: good I approve. Have a good night!</p><p>“Apparently I’ve got permission to propose to you already. What did she say to you?” Rio said with a chuckle before asking Agatha what was happening over on her end.</p><p>“She just told me her name, and where they are going tomorrow night.” Agatha explained as she set her phone down and focused back on Rio.</p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p>“Liliana Grey. She’s apparently a botanist.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Fascinating. I think I’ve heard something about her.” Rio mused trying to remember where she had heard the name before.</p><p>“Not super important right now. I wanna check in with you. How was that? Too rough? Not rough enough? How’s your ass feel?” Agatha said turning her attention back to their activities</p><p>“Perfect. You weren’t too rough. The soothing with your palm after really helped.” Rio answered before she kissed Agatha softly. She took her hand in Agatha’s as they  cuddled closer. Agatha’s left hand holding Rio’s right.</p><p>“Good I never want to actually hurt you, but you mentioned impact play…” Agatha trailed off as she looked down at their hands, her left ring finger had something on it that it didn’t before they started having sex. Agatha’s finger had a silver ring on it with vines engraved around the band, they were glowing the same green as the sigil on her chest. She felt her heart skip a beat as she looked at the ring.</p><p>“Whoa! Wait…. I… uh.” Rio exclaimed before she started to backtrack.</p><p>“It’s a spell, I know you didn’t do it on purpose. Let me see yours.” Agatha said Rio brought her left hand up for Agatha to see. The ring was silver with engraved clouds that seemed to roll along the band,  the engraving had purple rolling though that was the same color as Rio’s sigil. “That tracks. Spirit witches typically align with the air element.”</p><p>“How are you not freaking out right now?” Rio asked in a high pitched tone.</p><p>“Because literally nothing shocks me anymore. Though Pepper is going to be insufferable tomorrow if she sees it.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked still looking at the ring. She tried to take it off but it wouldn’t budge.</p><p>“That’s permanent babe, looks like you’re actually stuck with me now. Also because Pepper was already trying to plan our wedding this afternoon.”</p><p>“Just because I wanted to propose to you earlier… stupid magic… wait what?” Rio was mumbling to herself before focusing on Agatha.</p><p>“Oh so you did want to propose?” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“Wait a second let’s rewind. Pepper was what?” Rio asked trying to get everything in order.</p><p>“I went to visit her to tell her about you. She took it well enough. I think she’s still processing. Then we started talking about the glamor potion that someone made for my mother. She was a trans-inclusivity, which made glamor potions for cheap. She had no malcontent when she made it which is why my mother made it as far as she did. Then once we were done talking about everything she joked that we should have a fall wedding or a spring wedding the following year.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Are you really okay with this?” Rio asked as she touched the ring on Agatha’s hand that seems to be thrumming with her magic.</p><p>“I would’ve liked this to happen six to nine months from now. And you technically haven’t proposed to me. Your magic did and apparently so did mine. We both said yes to each other. No arguing with that. It’s fine. We can still call each other our girl… girl.. girl… apparently not.” Agatha said as she tried to say girlfriend.</p><p>“I can’t call you my girl… fuck! Why can’t I say it.” Rio said in a frustrated tone.</p><p>“Fiancé? Rio Vidal is my fiancé. Well thats inconvenient…” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Can I try something?” Rio asked as she took Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Go for it.” Agatha told Rio who tried to take the ring off, it refused to budge.</p><p>“Looks like you’re actually stuck with me.” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“I knew that when this showed up.” Agatha said as she trailed a finger down the sigil on Rio’s chest.</p><p>“It feels so rushed.” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“Yeah, well that’s what we get for fucking like rabbits.” Agatha said before she kissed Rio softly. “Rio Vidal is my partner. Rio Vidal is my girl.” Agatha said trying those loop holes on for size.</p><p>“There we go. That works.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Perfect, see. No need to worry.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Until Wanda sees it in the morning.” Rio mentioned.</p><p>“Ugh. We will tackle that hurdle when we get there.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Agreed. Alright I’m getting tired. Wanna make out until we fall asleep?” Rio asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Nothing sounds better than making out with my fiancé until we pass out.” Agatha said as she cuddled close to Rio and started kissing her softly. Both women giggled into the kiss as they just enjoyed this moment together.</p>

<p>They woke up early the next morning, both of them feeling pleasantly sore as they cuddled against each other.</p><p>“Good morning my love.” Rio whispered as Agatha kissed along her neck.</p><p>“Good morning my love.” Agatha mumbled as she kissed her neck and shoulder.</p><p>“We need to get a shower in.” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“Probably but I really just want you.” Agatha said with a groan as she suckled Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“Sunday we can spend the whole day in bed” Rio promised.</p><p>“No, I have something planned for you. There’s a surprise in my briefcase that I haven’t gotten to give you yet because of everything that happened with Evanora.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh what’s that?” Rio asked curiously.</p><p>“Let’s go take a shower and I’ll show you.” Agatha explained as she rolled away.</p><p>“Ugh fine! If I must leave this comfortable bed!” Rio complained.</p><p>“You must.” Agatha said as she kissed Rio before she got up.</p><p>Forty minutes later they were out of the shower. Agatha was getting dressed in a black suit with a gray button up and a dark purple tie with silver constellations dotting it. She braided her hair and let it run down her back perfectly.</p><p>“Why is every outfit you put on so immaculate?” Rio asked as she looked over at Agatha.</p><p>“Years and years of building my wardrobe.” Agatha answered as she slipped on a pair of heels and smiled at Rio who was still standing in a towel. “Going to try and get dressed with magic this morning or do you want me to do it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’ll try but all I can imagine is you naked… so maybe you should…”</p><p>“Give it a shot. If I end up naked I’ll just magic my outfit back on. Just focus on what you want to wear today.” Agatha instructed. Rio really focused and imagined herself in her favorite jeans, and a soft baggy band tee. A moment later she was dressed standing in Agatha’s bedroom.</p><p>“I forgot underwear and a bra…” Rio said in a frustrated tone. Agatha waved her hand and Rio was wearing panties, a bra, and socks under her clothing. “Thanks babe.” Rio said appreciatively.</p><p>“Come on I’ll make waffles for breakfast.” Agatha told Rio before she headed out of the bedroom toward the kitchen. Rio followed and sat down at the island so she could watch Agatha.</p><p>“I wonder if your vanishing spell will work on these?” Agatha asked as she put an apron on.</p><p>“Worth a shot. Come here.” Rio requested as she took Agatha’s left hand in her own. “De facie evanescant, solum mereantur videre. De facie evanescant, solum mereantur videre. De facie evanescant, solum mereantur videre” Rio spoke clearly. Putting her intention clear in her mind. After she was finished she let Agatha’s hand go.</p><p>“I guess we will have to wait and see if that worked.” Agatha said as she turned to make breakfast.  She pulled the waffle maker out and started heating it up while she made the batter. Once that was made and the first waffle was cooking she started making cheesy scrambled eggs and some ham.</p><p>Ten minutes later Wanda barged into the house excitedly. “This woman is fantastic! Rio I’m so glad you and Agatha met!” Wanda said excitedly.</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Rio said with a shocked look on her face.</p><p>“Okay Wanda, tell me everything.” Agatha asked as she continued to cook breakfast.</p><p>“She’s a published botanist that just moved here. She actually found Rio’s bookstore on Instagram and decided to check the place out yesterday. You should probably change your relationship status on your private Instagram to taken by the way.” Wanda said as she turned and focused on Rio for a moment.</p><p>“She thought the same thing I did when she seen you. ‘Oh she’s cute.’  And decided to shoot her shot after buying a couple books… So if you want to avoid this in the future. I’d recommend doing that. Any way. We spent all night texting. We have a date tonight.” Wanda explained, Rio instantly magicked her phone into her hand and started doing something on it.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I thought about taking her to the botanical gardens…” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. If she’s looking for a job Tony is looking for a replacement for Jeffery.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“She is published in her field and well known so I’ll suggest it.” Wanda answered. Then something clicked for Rio.</p><p>“Oh my goddesses! Liliana Grey! Now I know why her name sounded familiar! She’s published a few papers on plants and potions work! I’ve read them!” Rio said excitedly.</p><p>“No! Bad Rio! She’s mine.” Wanda said as she playfully swatted at the woman.</p><p>“What? No. You can have her. Agatha’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Rio said as she scrunched her face at Wanda.</p><p>“Wanda’s a jealous person babe, watch.” Agatha said as she set two plates of waffle, eggs, and bacon down in front of the two women.</p><p>“Can I get her number? Maybe she’d like to take us both for a spin.” Agatha joked, knowing Wanda would get jealous.</p><p>“No. Back off Harkness. I’ll stab you with a fork.” Wanda said as she magicked one into her hand. Agatha chuckled before she turned around and grabbed Rio a fork and handed it to her.</p><p>“You know she wasn’t being serious right?” Rio asked as she started eating.</p><p>“I know, that’s why the fork is still in my hand, and not through hers.” Wanda said with a glare before she dug into her breakfast.</p><p>“I constantly forget you are a chaos witch and then I am abruptly reminded.” Rio states.</p><p>“Do you two want coffee?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes please.” Rio and Wanda said in unison. Agatha shook her head and poured three cups of coffee. She made two cups exactly the same and the third cup with just sugar.</p><p>“Black coffee with sugar for my favorite psychopath.” Agatha said as she set the coffee in front of Wanda. Then handed Rio one of the other two cups.</p><p>“Perfect thank you.” Wanda said as she took a sip before she continued to eat.</p><p>“Thank you babe.” Rio said as she also took a drink.</p><p>They sat comfortably together as they ate their breakfast. Agatha finished her breakfast first and cleaned up the kitchen with a wave of her hand.</p><p>“Let me go grab you the surprise I forgot about until this morning.” Agatha said as she walked into the entry way and grabbed the lifetime passes out of her briefcase. She made her way back into the kitchen and walked behind Rio before she slid the two passes into view.</p><p>“You must be joking! These must’ve cost a fortune!” Rio said excitedly before she got quiet and serious. “No Agatha you have to return them. They are so expensive.”</p><p>“I guess it’s a good thing I didn’t pay for them then huh?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“What? How?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Pepper felt bad for interrupting our date and Tony noticed how much you loved the place on the cameras. So they decided to give us these just in case I ever left Stark Law.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh. I see. Well, can you thank them for me today?” Rio asked as she held the two passes.</p><p>“Lucky witches. How’s it feel to be loved by the world’s most powerful couple?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You do know you get free admittance because you work for them right? This is just in case I ever leave the firm, or if Rio wants to go solo.” Agatha reminded Wanda before she told the two women. “Now eat. I’ve got two meetings today then I’m coming home and making dessert for tomorrow night.”</p><p>Wanda stuffed the last couple bites of food in her mouth before she chugged the rest of her coffee. She quickly got up and cleaned her plate off and rinsed everything before walking over to Rio and hugging her.</p><p>“Seriously, I know I was joking the other day about you finding me a date. But I really do appreciate it.” Wanda said before letting Rio go.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Have fun. Keep us updated.” Rio requested.</p><p>“I will.” Wanda said as she walked over to Agatha and hugged her. “What dessert are you making?”</p><p>“Oh no, go away Maximoff! Not telling you shit.” Agatha said as she shoved her best friend toward the door.</p><p>“Okay! okay. I’m going. I’m going. Have a good day you two!” Wanda yelled as she bolted for the door.</p><p>“We really should tell her everything soon.” Agatha said after the door shut.</p><p>“Maybe after her date…” Rio said as she looked toward the front door.</p><p>“Probably for the best. Can’t have her spiraling.” Agatha said with a shrug before continuing. “Want me to bring you lunch today? I am taking a half day.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Only if you aren’t busy. I appreciate it. Now let’s head to work.” Rio said as she stood up and stretched.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m not looking forward to these meetings.” Agatha said as she headed toward the entryway.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because they are the ones that got canceled Wednesday…”</p><p>“Oh, great. Sorry babe.” Rio said as she turned toward Agatha.</p><p>“It’s okay. Give me a kiss and let’s get this show on the road.” Agatha said as she pulled the woman close.</p><p>“Make it two and you’ve got yourself a deal.” Rio joked before she leaned in and kissed Agatha who softly laughed as she kissed Rio several times before breaking away. The smiled softly at each other and made their way out the door.</p><p>~Meanwhile At The High Security Institution For The Magically Inclined~</p><p>The cell door opened and Evanora Harkness looked over at the door. There was a guard standing there looking at her with a sneer.</p><p>“Get up. You are being moved to a regular women’s facility seeing as you no longer have any powers.” The woman said as she stood in the door. Evanora sighed loudly and got up.</p><p>“Like I need another reminder that I’m powerless.” Evanora grumbled as walked over to the man.</p><p>“Your hearing with Judge Heart is Monday.” The guard explained as he guide her out the door and toward the inmate transfer area. Evanora decided to just keep her mouth shut as the guard forced her to sit down and locked her restraints to the bench.</p><p>“She’s the woman’s prisons problem now Glenda.” The guard said as he walked away.</p><p>Evanora looked up at the woman behind the glass and sneered at her before looking back down at the floor. She had accepted that no matter what she did, no one would ever believe that her daughter was a waste of space, time, and energy.</p><p>~Pepper’s Office~</p><p>The phone rang loudly through the room as Pepper looked up from her document.</p><p>“Pepper Potts, how may I help you?” Pepper asked into the phone.</p><p>“Pepper, it’s Judge Heart. Her bail is set at twenty thousand. She’s being transferred to the women’s prison today. Her hearing  is Monday. Are you prepared for it?”</p><p>“I almost am. I do need to speak to Agatha one more time before I finish preparations.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Perfect, don’t tell me anything. Have a great day! See you personally on Monday.” The man said into the phone.</p><p>“See you Monday.” Pepper said as she pressed the button on the receiver and then dialed Agatha’s secretary.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness is in a meeting at the moment Mrs. Potts.” Tricia said into the phone.</p><p>“How did you know it was me?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I set my phone up so that one of the lines is a direct line to your office. I always know when you call.” Tricia explained.</p><p>“Can you tell her to stop by after her meetings I have a few questions for her.” Pepper requested</p><p>“Of course, have a great afternoon Mrs. Potts.”</p><p>“You as well Tricia.” Pepper said before she hung up the phone.</p><p>An hour later Agatha finished her second and last meeting for the day. She packed everything up for the day and walked out of her office.</p><p>“Mrs. Potts would like to see you before you head home for the day.” Tricia said to Agatha.</p><p>“Of course she would. Thank you Tricia. I appreciate you.” Agatha said before she made her way to the elevator. She made her way up to the top floor and Peppers office. Timothy wasn’t at his desk for once which shocked Agatha but she quickly made her way to Peppers door and let her self in because she could see she was alone.</p><p>“Hey, what’s up?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Is there anyway you could get written testimony’s from each of the spirit witches? With dates these things happened? If the statute of limitations is up on their parent’s deaths, then we will use it on Monday. If not, we won’t.” Pepper reassured.</p><p>“Let me call Rio real quick.” Agatha told Pepper before she pulled her phone out of her pocket and called Rio. The phone rang a couple times before the woman answered.</p><p>“Hey babe, everything okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Everything’s fine, is there any chance you could send me your mother’s number so I could call her and ask her a question?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Sure, what’s the question?” Rio asked as she pulled her phone away from her ear and sent Rita Vidal’s number to Agatha.</p><p>“Pepper would like written testimony’s from the women so we have proof that every spirit witch orients from abuse.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh. Well she has today off so I’ll text her real quick and let her know to expect your call.” Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“Thank you my love, I appreciate it.” Agatha said softly into the phone.</p><p>“You’re welcome. I’ll call you once I’m done with work. Have a good day my love.” Rio said into the phone before both women hung up.</p><p>Rio 11:30 a.m: Rita Vidal Contact.</p><p>Agatha clicked the contact info and then hit dial. Her heart was in her throat, she wanted to vomit but swallowed the nerves as the phone connected.</p><p>“Hello Witchlett! Lilia told me you’d be calling me today. I already requested hand written letters but instead, every single witch has sent me a photo of their diary entries already. I just need your work email.” Rita said into the phone.</p><p>“I… Uh… thank you? I mean, Thank You Rita I really appreciate it.” Agatha said in a confused tone.</p><p>“You’re welcome Witchlett! When your best friend is Lilia Calderu you’re privy to things before most are.”</p><p>“I appreciate that, tell Lilia I appreciate her being so helpful with this as well. She owes me literally nothing.” Agatha said into the phone before she continued after a moment.“I’ve actually gotta give you my bosses email. She’s handling this case.”</p><p>“That is fine! I’m already sitting here with the email composed so just let me know and I’ll send it.” Rita said into the phone</p><p>“<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bdedd8cdcdd8cf93edd2c9c9cefdcec9dccfd6d1dcca93ded2d0" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a> Potts is with two T’s” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Perfect. I appreciate it. I’m sending it now. Now, what are you bringing for dessert tomorrow?” Rita asked.</p><p>“What’s Rio’s favorite dessert? I was thinking a dolce de leche cake.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“That sounds delightful. She’s always been a chocolate lover though. Just something to think about.” Rita told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate the info and all the help. You are a blessing.” Agatha said into the phone appreciatively.</p><p>“So are you, you just don’t realize it yet. Have a good day.” Rita said into the phone</p><p>“You as well.” Agatha said before they both hung up.</p><p>“Got the email already, do you want to read these?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“No… Maybe? I know I’ll have to hear them on Monday.” Agatha said with a blanch.</p><p>“You will. It’s okay you can read them at any point this weekend just email me if you want them. Now we need to talk about the elephant in the room…”</p><p>“Huh? What elephant in the room?” Agatha asked looking around sarcastically.</p><p>“The green and silver ring on your finger that seems to be flowing with magical energy because the green is fucking glowing.” Pepper said as she pointed at Agatha’s left hand.</p><p>“Great. You can see it.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Explain. ‘Miss let me be delulu for 6-9 months.’ Because yesterday I clearly remember you saying that.” Pepper scolded lightly.</p><p>“Look… our magic is intertwining deeply. I have zero control over this… last night I made her dinner and we had sex again then this showed up.” Agatha said as she lifted her hand up.</p><p>“So… your magic literally said ‘fuck you we are married now.’ And you have no choice in the matter?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Perfect. Does she need insurance?” Pepper pried.</p><p>“Legally we aren’t married Pepper.” Agatha sighed.</p><p>“Yet.” Pepper corrected with a smug smile on her face.</p><p>“You know, I thought the spell we put on the rings this morning had them hidden from everyone! I was hoping no one would be able to see it.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“One second.” Pepper said as she pressed a button on her phone. “Timothy come here.” Pepper requested.</p><p>The young man stood up and walked into the office a few seconds later. “Yes Mrs. Potts?” The man asked as he walked over to her desk.</p><p>“Can you look at Agatha’s hands and tell me if you see anything unusual?” Pepper asked the young man who looked over the rings on her hands.</p><p>“No ma’am just her normal arrangement of rings. Nothing new or unusual here. I always wondered why you never wear any on your ring fingers though Ms. Harkness.” The young man said to the two women.</p><p>“Perfect, thank you that is all.” Pepper told him before he shook his head yes and then went back to his desk.</p><p>“Seems like only I can see it. Any theory’s on that?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“You are the only person in my life who knows that Rio is next in line to be death.” Agatha lamented as she rubbed her eyes, coming to a realization.</p><p>“Oh that sounded like you just realized something you didn’t want to.” Pepper said to Agatha.</p><p>“I’m meeting Rio’s parents tomorrow. At the very least her mother… who definitely knows Rio is next in line…”</p><p>“Oof you better make the best damn dessert you’ve ever made.” Pepper said with wide eyes.</p><p>“Geeee thanks Pepper.” Agatha said sarcastically before sighing. “Can I go home and bake now?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t need you anymore today. But I do think your future mother in law is a badass bitch.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“I’m inclined to agree. Have a good day, call me if you need anything. Otherwise I’m going home and baking.” Agatha said as she grabbed her things and headed out the door.</p><p>“Good luck!” Pepper said as she went back to work.</p><p>~Some Random Correctional facility Bus on the interstate.~</p><p>Evanora Harkness was stewing in her own anger as she stared out the window. She was just being transferred to the county jail  but she was so angry at everyone who ever believed her daughter was capable of being anything other than a monster.</p><p>She couldn’t believe Agatha had manipulated so many people into believing she was the problem. She wished she had just ended her life with her own hands instead of trying to do so with magic.</p><p>“Useless child.” Evanora grumbled quietly to herself before the bus came to a stop at the county jail. A guard stepped onto the bus and unlocked the restraints that she had holding her into the seat and hiked her up by the shoulder of her jumpsuit.</p><p>“Move it Harkness.” The guard said as they guided her off the bus.</p><p>“When do I get to call my lawyer?” The woman hissed out.</p><p>“Once you’re booked.” The guard said as they guided her into the building.</p><p>“Great.” Evanora sneered as she was forced to sit down and locked back onto the bench.</p><p>“Book her and let her call her lawyer Sully.” The man said to another officer.</p><p>“You got it!” The man named Sully said as he got up and started the booking process. The man looked at Evanora’s paperwork.</p><p>“Woof, had to fuck with the one lawyer in the state no criminal wants to be against did ya? Sounds like you’re about to have a bad time.” The man said.</p><p>“Just stop talking to me about my ungrateful shithead of a child.” Evanora said with a scowl.</p><p>“Ooookay then. Let’s get you booked.”</p><p>~Agatha’s Place~</p><p>Agatha had made it home and finished baking the cakes off for the dessert. She decided on the way home she would make two separate cakes. Death by chocolate and Dolce De Leche for tomorrow evening. She wanted to make sure everything was perfect for tomorrow.</p><p>Agatha spent the rest of the afternoon finishing up the cakes and getting them in the fridge before she took the scraps and made a parfait and magicked it onto Peppers desk with a note that said “thank you for everything.” Along with a fork.</p><p>Right as she was about to sit down her phone started ringing. She looked at it to see that it was Pepper calling her.</p><p>“Hey, did you get your snack?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes, it’s delicious thank you. Got everything done?” Pepper asked as she looked at the clock, it was almost 5 p.m.</p><p>“Yep just finished, was about to sit down and read Violet Vidal’s spell book.” Agatha said as she sat down on the couch and magicked the book into her lap.</p><p>“Sounds good. Thanks for the cake. I appreciate it. Enjoy your book. See you Monday morning, bye.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“Have a great night. Bye.” Agatha said as she pulled the phone away before she heard Pepper hang up.</p><p>Agatha opened the book and read the very first passage that she read the other day. She continued to read and learn about Violet Vidal and all the things she experienced after she killed her parents. Things started getting interesting when she met Rosaline, a chaos witch that was magically compatible with her.</p><p>“Fascinating.” Agatha said as she magicked a pen and paper next to her so she could take notes. “Magical connection, check. Love binding spell sigil, check. Rings, Check.” Agatha said as she wrote down a few notes.</p><p>“Any questions Agatha?” Death asked from next to Agatha on the couch.</p><p>“Yeah, actually who can see this?” Agatha asked as she held her left hand up.</p><p>“Oh we are that far along already?” Death asked.</p><p>“Apparently, but that didn’t answer my question.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Just Pepper at the moment. Rio’s spell specified basically those who know she’s next in line. So once you tell Wanda and Pietro they will be able to see it.”</p><p>“Good. I can handle Pepper. I don’t know about Wanda right now.” Agatha said as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“Any other questions?” The entity asked Agatha.</p><p>“Is Rosaline still alive?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No. Our cabin is in my own realm. You are privileged in the sense that because Rio is your partner you don’t ever really get to die. I mean you will die but your spirit will live on in Rio’s dimension once she takes her place as death. It’s not super complicated really. If you die first Rosaline and I will care for you until Rio does.” Death explained.</p><p>“So… is this how deep it goes?” Agatha asked as she held her hand up again.</p><p>“In the mortal realm yes. Once you die it gets a little deeper. But that’s not for centuries.” Death explained.</p><p>“So… about your parents.” Agatha trailed off softly.</p><p>“Horrible people but not nearly as bad as Evanora Harkness. I don’t know how you survived as long as you did Witchlett.” Death said as she placed a reassuring hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Wanda and Pietro definitely made it easier.”</p><p>“Ah yes the twins. I am thankful for the both of them for your sake.” Death said honestly.</p><p>“Did you always know I was Rio’s magical soul mate? Is that what we are calling it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, unfortunately for Me and every iteration of Death you are a blind spot. So my predecessor couldn’t see Rosaline for example. But once we find our ‘bride’ Death can speak to us and them freely. Which is why I’m here.” Death explained.</p><p>“Interesting…” Agatha said as she grabbed the notebook and wrote things down before asking her next question “Why did you want me to have your spell book?”</p><p>“Honestly? I know how hard it is to be a spirit witch. I wanted to grant you some comfort, just so you’d know you aren’t alone. Plus there are some really great spells in there that only you can do.”  Death said as she reached over and flipped the book open to a spell that Agatha had never even thought of before.</p><p>“Magical transfers? Wait… I can take someone’s magic and give it to someone else?” Agatha asked as she read over the page.</p><p>“Yes, it takes lots of practice. Siphoning can be stopped as well. But it’s very difficult and painful for all parties involved in the beginning. I took the last of your mother’s magic but I could’ve easily given it all back to her if I wanted. I have the ability to do so, and one day you will as well. It just takes practice. If that’s what you want to do. I recommend it though so you don’t accidentally kill someone in the future.” Death explained.</p><p>“Why am I privy to this information?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“Honestly? Because I relate to you more than anyone else I’ve ever met. I know how you feel and I don’t want any other witches to experience it. I know you’ll do great things with this information. But I can feel the bodies piling up. So I must go. Sorry.” Death explained to Agatha before disappearing completely.</p><p>“Enlightening.” Agatha said as she turned back to reading. Then a moment later Agatha got a text.</p><p>Wanda: 5:35 p.m: I NEED help with an outfit.</p><p>Agatha 5:35 p.m: coming.</p><p>Agatha sighed as she closed the book and got up from her couch and walked over to Wanda’s. She walked right in the door and made her way to Wanda’s bedroom.</p><p>“What’s the problem?” Agatha asked as she opened the door. The whole room was a mess. Dresses and outfits strewn around the room and bed. Agatha waved her hand and sighed as the room cleaned itself up.</p><p>“I don’t have anything to wear.” Wanda said in a frustrated tone.  Agatha chuckled at her best friend and then waved her hand again. Wanda was then dressed in a pair of black slacks, with a dark red button up with the sleeves rolled up 3/4ths of the way, she had a black vest on that was covered in embroidered roses, along with a black tie that had small red roses that matched the vest.</p><p>“There. Any other issues Maximoff?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Fuck, how do you manage to make things like this happen?” Wanda asked as she looked in the mirror.</p><p>“There’s also a matching jacket but I felt like that was overkill. Now hair?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Can you actually braid it for me? Like braid it and put it in a bun? I miss having girly days where we’d play with each other’s hair during sleepovers.”</p><p>“Yeah sit down on the floor. I’ll do your hair. Where are you going?” Agatha asked as she sat on the bed, Wanda sat down on the floor and Agatha magicked the materials she would need to do Wanda’s hair.</p><p>“I’m picking her up at 6:30 and we are going to the botanical gardens. They are open till 10 tonight so we are going to go check everything out there, then after that I’m going to take her to dinner.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Sounds great. Do you need an emergency escape route?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’ll ask Jen to do it. Just in case you and Rio get busy…” Wanda trailed off.</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to talk to you about her.” Agatha said as she brushed Wanda’s hair.</p><p>“Oh? Finally gunna tell me what you learned in the cabin?” Wanda asked, she may be unobservant but she wasn’t forgetful.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well spill Harkness! I don’t have all night!” Wanda said exasperatedly.</p><p>“Rio is part of The Original Green Witch blood line. Which originated as death, she’s next in line to be the entity of Death. Her great great grandmother Violet Vidal is the current standing entity of Death. The reason we have this deep magical connection is because I’m her other half.” Agatha explained as she braided Wanda’s hair.</p><p>“Okay. I feel like we skipped a few steps here.” Wanda said as she collected her thoughts.</p><p>“I mean yes and no. It was a connection when we touched, we had sex the other day and a love binding spell showed up trailing down our chests which I will show you after I’m done braiding your hair! Stop moving.” Agatha scolded as she grabbed Wanda’s head and forced her to look forward.</p><p>“Okay. So why are you telling me this?” Wanda asked. Then Agatha sighed and shoved her left hand into Wanda’s face.</p><p>“Because this showed up last night. Her magic asked, mine said yes. Now. Before you freak out. We put the invisibility spell on it so you wouldn’t see it this morning. Now that you know Rio is next in line to be death you can see it.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Cool. Cool. Cool. One question?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“What.”</p><p>“Do I get to be the maid of honor?” Wanda joked as Agatha took her hand back and continued to braid her hair.</p><p>“If I don’t kill you first, yes.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“You love me! Also, honestly… very ironic that a spirit witch is the bride of death.”</p><p>“I said something similar, but it was ‘nothing more ironic than a spirit witch dating the embodiment of death, even if they are in their gestation period.’ You cool with this?” Agatha asked her best friend as she finished her hair. Wanda stood up and turned around so she could look Agatha in the eye.</p><p>“You are my best friend, all I’ve ever wanted is to see you as happy as Rio makes you. Who gives a fuck about her being death in the future? I can tell you two are head over heels already. Don’t sweat it too much. Now show me that sigil!” Wanda demanded. Agatha sighed and unbuttoned her shirt and opened it for Rio to see, the green sigil softly growling.</p><p>“Wow… okay. Fuck that’s cool! Shit I have a date!” Wanda said in a confused tone as Agatha buttoned her shirt.</p><p>“Sorry for dropping this on you before your date. But I really haven’t had time to talk to you.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“No it’s fine. The ring is beautiful by the way. Now get outta my house I gotta go pick up Lily.” Wanda said as she slipped a pair of shoes on and shoved Agatha toward the door.</p><p>“Fine! I’m going! I’m going!” Agatha said as she walked out of the bedroom and headed toward the front door.</p><p>“Thank you, I appreciate your help but I don’t want to be late!” Wanda said as she grabbed her wallet, badge and keys.</p><p>“You’re welcome bye.” Agatha said as she walked out the front door and then headed toward her house. Wanda ran to her car and got in quickly before pulling out of the driveway.</p>

<p>Wanda stopped and grabbed a bouquet of flowers before she headed to Lily’s place to pick her up. She made her way up to the apartment and knocked on the door. A few moments later a gorgeous blonde woman with stunning green eyes wearing a soft blue sundress opened the door.</p><p>“Hello Wanda!” The woman said excitedly as she took Wanda in. “Fuck you look fantastic.”</p><p>“So do you! I got you some flowers.” Wanda said in a slightly nervous tone as she handed the flowers to Lily.</p><p>“They are perfect, thank you. Let me go put them in some water real quick and then we can go.” Lily said as she disappeared into her apartment, a few moments later she reappeared and grabbed her purse by the door.</p><p>“Okay, I’m ready. Where are you taking me?” Lily asked with a smile as she looked up at the tall redhead.</p><p>“That’s a surprise, but I can almost guarantee you’ll love it.” Wanda reassured her as they made their way to Wanda’s car.</p><p>“That’s a bold statement.” Lily said as she followed Wanda, who opened the passenger side door for her. Once she was settled into the car Wanda shut the door and rushed to the driver side before buckling and starting the car. She backed out of the parking spot and made her way to toward the Botanical Gardens.</p><p>“So what do you do for a living Wanda?” The woman asked.</p><p>“I’m a floating therapist for Stark Industries.” Wanda explained as she pulled up to a light.</p><p>“Interesting, so what does your best friend do?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Agatha is a lawyer for Stark Law. You’ve met her girlfriend Rio, she owns the bookstore.”</p><p>“She’s very pretty. I wonder how beautiful your friend is to have caught her attention.” Lily mused.</p><p>“Agatha… is well… fuck it I’m just going to get it out of the way. She’s a spirit witch. If that’s a deal breaker for you let me know and I can turn around.” Wanda said as she continued to drive.</p><p>“How long have you two been friends?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Thirty years. We can get into deep conversations about what spirit witches actually are because we’ve had quite a few realizations this week when it comes to them if you want. Just know that my best friend is not a threat to you or anyone else for that matter.” Wanda said seriously as she pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>“I mean if you want to tell me what you’ve learned I’m willing to listen.” Lily said.</p><p>“Spirit witches are created not born that’s why they are so rare. Their parents abuse them for whatever reason and their magical abilities flare up around the age of 16 and when they are attacked magically they siphon their care takers magic effectively killing them. It’s a defense mechanism. Unfortunately for Agatha.. her mother lived because of me and my twin brother.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“Oh… so your best friend…” Lily said sadly.</p><p>“Yeah… she’s got really bad ptsd from her mother. But anyway. She’s a great person, I promise. Now let’s not talk about this heavy shit, let’s go on our date.” Wanda said as she turned off the car and got out to open the door for Lily.</p><p>“Thank you.”  Lily said appreciatively as she got out of the car before looking around. “Where are we?”</p><p>“You’ll see in a minute. Come with me.” Wanda said as she offered Lily her hand. Lily took it with a smile and followed Wanda toward the gardens. Wanda watched her face light up when she realized where they were.</p><p>“No way!” Lily said excitedly as she started dragging Wanda toward the entrance.</p><p>“Yeah, I figured you’d want to visit this place. Specialized botany is something you are all about. So let me grab my badge, and we can go in.” Wanda said as she pulled her badge out of her back pocket.</p><p>“What do you need your badge for?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Stark Industries Employees and their family members get free admittance.” Wanda explained as she opened the door and let Lily walk in first. Wanda followed suit and scanned her badge.</p><p>“Welcome Wanda Maximoff and Guest.” The terminal said to the two women. They made their way into the building.</p><p>“We’ve got until ten. I hope that’s enough time.” Wanda said as she guided Lily toward the greenhouse.</p><p>“I hope you know I’m about to become the worst conversationalist on the planet.” Lily said happily as she dragged Wanda toward a few plants. Wanda just smiled and allowed Lily to drag her from plant to plant explaining their uses in magic and medicine. She spent the whole time in the gardens explaining each plant to Wanda.</p><p>“I’m glad you are enjoying yourself.” Wanda said after about an hour of them hopping from plant to plant.</p><p>“I really am! This is one of the nicest gardens I’ve ever been to! Thank you so much Wanda!” Lily said excitedly before she stood up on her tiptoes and gave Wanda a kiss on the cheek. Causing a blush to creep up onto Wanda’s face.</p><p>“I uh, you’re welcome.” Wanda finally got out after a long moment.</p><p>“Come on, we’ve got so much more to look at.” Lily said excitedly as she grabbed Wanda’s hand again and tugged it softly.</p><p>“I’m coming smarty pants, I’m coming.” Wanda said happily as Lily started talking about another plant. Wanda was trying to absorb as much as possible.</p><p>“I feel like you and Rio are going to be best friends.” Wanda blurted out randomly as she watched the woman observing a plant.</p><p>“Oh yeah? Why’s that?” Lily asked.</p><p>“She’s a green witch.” Wanda told her.</p><p>“That doesn’t necessarily mean she’s interested in botany.” Lily said as she stood up and looked at Wanda.</p><p>“True but I know she is.” Wanda clarified.</p><p>“Really, well if things go well for us hopefully I’ll get to meet Agatha and see why she’s so fascinating to you and Rio.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Still a little salty my best friend got to her first?” Wanda joked with a smile that made her nose crinkle cutely.</p><p>“I mean… Maybe. But at the same time I’m still on a date with a hot woman on a Friday night in a greenhouse. So I guess I can forgive your best friend because if it weren’t for her I wouldn’t be here right now.” Lily said with a shrug.</p><p>“I promise, she’s likable.” Wanda said with a laugh trying to not upsell Agatha.</p><p>“We shall see. Now, are you getting hungry? Should we leave and head to dinner?” Lily asked.</p><p>“That’s up to you. I know several places open til midnight or later if you want to stick around here and check everything out.”</p><p>“Really? Are you sure? I don’t want to bore you.” Lily said excitedly before she calmed herself down.</p><p>“Yeah it’s fine. Oh! I just remembered… This place is looking for a new head of botanical research. Theirs got fired last Sunday.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Lily asked as she paused for a moment.</p><p>“Agatha and Pepper work together and are friends. I mean she’s my friend too but Pepper is way closer to Agatha than me. Agatha suggested I tell you they are looking for a replacement this morning at breakfast.” Wanda explained as they started walking toward a new section of the green house.</p><p>“You had breakfast with her this morning?”</p><p>“Yeah, we live next door to each other, and I can’t cook for the life of me. So I steal Agatha’s food.” Wanda explained. She wasn’t about to start lying to save face.</p><p>“Goddesses above you two really went. ’When we grow up we’re gunna be next door neighbors and our kids are going to be best friends’ didn’t you?” Lily asked with a chuckle.</p><p>“I think it was more. ‘My bestfriend has panic attacks but wants to be independent.’ Than anything else.”</p><p>“Oh…You are a good friend.” Lily said with a sigh.</p><p>“She’s really more of a sister at this point. I mean we call her our sister.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“We? Oh yeah you’re a twin. Sorry I forgot.”</p><p>“It’s okay, not like you could tell looking at us. Pietro lives 6 states away. He works at the school for mutants as a teacher.” Wanda explained as Lily guided her into the carnivorous plants section.</p><p>“Your brother’s a mutant?” Lily asked as she looked around the small area of plants.</p><p>“Dad’s a mutant, Mom’s a witch. Mix em together and what do you get? The same thing.” Wanda said flatly.</p><p>“What is his ability?” Lily questioned.</p><p>“Superspeed. If I called him right now he’d be here in 2 minutes flat. Which I’m not doing because the man is insufferable. He wanted to go creep on Rio the second he found out Agatha was dating her. I had to convince him to wait until the bookstore was open the next day. He just didn’t expect Agatha to be at the book store when he arrived.” Wanda said with a laugh.</p><p>“Interesting. Does she have a habit of that?”  Lily asked as she checked out a couple flytraps.</p><p>“Of what?” Wanda asked as she watched the woman observe the plants.</p><p>“Being in the right place at the right time?” Lily questioned.</p><p>“Oh yeah. I think it’s just Agatha’s luck. She’s always exactly where she needs to be.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Attention guests. Stark Botanical Gardens will be closing in 15 minutes please make your way to the front entrance.” A voice said over the speakers.</p><p>“What a bummer, I was really enjoying this place.” Lily said sadly.</p><p>“We can always come back again at a later date.” Wanda offered as she guided Lily toward the exit.</p><p>“That would be nice. If we make it to a second date.” Lily said as she took Wanda’s hand and followed the woman.</p><p>“What are you in the mood for? Burgers? Pizza? Sushi? Chinese?” Wanda asked as she opened the door for Lily to exit the green house.</p><p>“Burgers sound nice.” Lily answered.</p><p>“Okay, now fancy burgers or horrible greasy no good for you burgers?” Wanda asked as they walked through the lobby and toward the main door.</p><p>“Depends, what happens after we eat the horrible greasy no good burgers?” Lily asked as Wanda opened the door for her.</p><p>“Either way, I can take you home or we can hang out and talk some more. Or if you want we can get a couple drinks and take a cab home.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“Let’s go eat then decide what we are doing.” Lily offered as they made their way back to Wanda’s car.  Once they got to the car Wanda went to open the door for Lily but Lily stopped her and gently took her face into her hands.  Before she placed a soft kiss on Wanda’s lips. Both women felt butterflies in their stomachs as giggles bubbled up.</p><p>“Woah.” Wanda said with a bright smile.</p><p>“I just had to check. Sorry if that was too forward?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Not too forward. Just unexpected. Now all I’m going to be thinking about is kissing you the rest of the night.” Wanda said as she opened the passenger door for Lily.</p><p>“Thank you, and I will admit it was probably a mistake because same.” Lily answered, a blush painting her cheeks.</p><p>“Well at least we both enjoyed it. Now let’s go get something to eat.” Wanda said as Lily got in the passenger seat and buckled as Wanda shut the door for her. She quickly rushed around the car and got in before buckling up and starting the car. They pulled out of the parking lot and headed toward the burger place Wanda had in mind.</p><p>They pulled up to an old diner that looked like it had been around since the before either woman was even a thought in their parents minds. “What is this place?” Lily asked as Wanda parked the car.</p><p>“A diner that Pietro, Agatha and I used to hang out at and study at while we were in college. They are open 24 hours, always have the best burgers and don’t care how long you camp while you do your homework.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Sounds like a college students dream.” Lily said as Wanda turned off the car and unbuckled before getting out and making her way around the car so she could open the door for Lily.</p><p>“Honestly it was. But I still like eating here every once in a while.” Wanda answered as Lily got out of the car. They made their way into the diner and sat down at a booth.</p><p>“Heya Wands! Where’s Aggie and Zippy?” A waitress asked as she walked up to the table. She was an older woman who looked like she had been there forever.</p><p>“Hey Cassie! How are ya? Agatha’s at home.. or her girlfriend’s house and Pietro is probably sleeping.” Wanda said as she looked at her watch.</p><p>“Aggie got a girlfriend!? Finally! Okay what will you gals have to drink? We’ve got coke products blondie.” The waitress said to Lily as she set a menu down in front of her.</p><p>“Just a regular coke. Please.” Lily requested.</p><p>“Got it, be right back with your drinks. Take a minute to figure out what you want.” Cassie said to the blonde.</p><p>“She already knows your order?” Lily asked.</p><p>“She does. I order the same thing every time and she’s been here since forever.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“So.. Aggie?” Lily asked as she looked over the menu.</p><p>“Agatha hates being called it, I think Cassie and Pietro are the only ones that can actually get away with calling her that without a blast of magic being thrown at them.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Two cokes and straws. Need more time or do you know whatcha want blondie?” The waitress asked.</p><p>“Can I get a double bacon cheese burger with lettuce, onion, pickles, ketchup and mustard? With a side of fries please?” Lily requested.</p><p>“Perfect, enjoy your date while I go harass my cook.” The waitress said as she walked away.</p><p>“I see why you like it here. It’s chaotic. Suits a chaos witch like you.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“I find comfort in chaos. It’s nice to find people who embrace it as well.” Wanda said with a smile.</p><p>“So tell me about you Wanda, not your best friend or brother.” Lily requested.</p><p>“What would you like to know?” Wanda asked as she picked up her straw and opened it before putting it in her drink and picking it up to take a sip.</p><p>“Favorite color? What do you like to do in your free time?” Lily asked</p><p>“My favorite color is red, I like drawing in my free time, I mean I have several hobbies but art is a favorite of mine. I also like exercising, gotta burn off all this extra chaos energy. What about you? ” Wanda explained.</p><p>“My favorite color is teal, and I do like exercising, but I really enjoy gardening. I’d love to have my own again soon. Unfortunately I have to deal with my small apartment for now.” Lily explained before two baskets of fries were set down in front of the women along with two burgers neatly wrapped up in paper.</p><p>“Here ya go Ladies.” Cassie said as she put the food down.</p><p>“Thanks Cassie!” Wanda said excitedly as she unwrapped her burger. The woman smiled as she walked away from the table.</p><p>“So you had a garden at your last place?” Wanda asked before she took a bite of her burger.</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s hard finding opportunities for a botanist in rural areas.” Lily explained.</p><p>“I can understand that, fortunately for me I can get a job anywhere. I’m glad you decided to move here though.” Wanda said with a smile, before she grabbed the bottle of ketchup and squeezed it onto the paper from the burger.</p><p>“I’m seriously considering applying for that job now that I know it exists. I’m currently working remote for a company that barely covers my bills.” Lily explained as she opened the burger and took a bite.</p><p>“I encourage it! The worst they can say is no, and based off what I learned from you tonight I highly doubt they will.” Wanda said with a smile.</p><p>“I appreciate the vote of confidence.” Lily said as she grabbed a fry and took some of Wanda’s ketchup.  She popped the fry in her  mouth and moaned happily. “Ooo those are good.”</p><p>“You should try the burger.” Wanda suggested. Lily unwrapped her burger and picked it up to take a bite. She did a little happy dance that made Wanda laugh softly at her.</p><p>“Why is everything so good?” Lily asked after she finished chewing and took a drink to swallow the bite.</p><p>“I don’t know but I’ve found that places like this either have the best or worst food.” Wanda explained before she continued to eat her dinner.</p><p>“I’m glad I said yes to this date.” Lily said with a smile before she took another bite of her burger.</p><p>“I’m glad Rio thought of me, tonight has been fun.” Wanda said with a bright smile. The two women settled into a comfortable silence and just ate happily for a moment before their waitress walked over and slid the bill under Wanda’s elbow.</p><p>“When you get the chance Wands.” The woman said before she walked away. They ate their food quickly and Wanda got up and paid their bill and left a generous tip on the table.</p><p>“Ready?” Wanda asked as she held her hand out for Lily to take.</p><p>“Yeah, thanks this was actually great.” Lily said in a shocked tone that made Wanda laugh.</p><p>“Let’s get you home it’s almost 11:30.” Wanda said as she guided Lily out the door. They made their way to Wanda’s car. She held the door for Lilly one more time before running around to the other side and getting in. She started the car and pulled out of the parking spot. The drive back to Lily’s apartment was short and they were parked in front sooner than either woman realized.</p><p>“Would you like to come up for a while?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Sure.” Wanda said nervously, before she turned the car off and unbuckled. She then got out and walked around the car to open the door for Lily.</p><p>“Thank you by the way, I’ve never had a date get the door for me the whole night.” Lily said throughly impressed by Wanda.</p><p>“Well that’s just lame.” Wanda said as she held her arm out for Lily to take. They made their way up to Lily’s apartment and Lily unlocked the door and let Wanda in.</p><p>The apartment was sparse but seemed to be something that was inherently Lily, like she was still growing in the space.</p><p>“It’s not much, but it’s home for now.” Lily said as she guided Wanda into the living room.</p><p>“It’s nice, not over crowded or empty feeling.” Wanda told the woman as she looked at the bookshelves and noticed her degree sitting on them.</p><p>“How about you come sit down with me and we talk some more?” Lily asked as she plopped down on the couch. Wanda smiled at the woman and walked over to sit next to her on the couch.</p><p>“What did you want to talk about?” Wanda asked with a smile as she sat down. Lily took the opportunity to scoot closer to Wanda and reach her hand up to turn her head so she could look at her.</p><p>“Well I’d like to revisit that kiss if I’m being honest.” Lily told Wanda as she looked down at Wanda’s lips. Wanda smirked and leaned in to press a soft kiss to Lily’s lips. Lily scooted closer so she could deepen the kiss, Wanda moaned softly and raised her hand so she could weave her hand into Lily’s hair and pull her closer. Wanda’s tongue softly trailed across Lily’s bottom lip.</p><p>Lily accepted the kiss and deepened it as she moaned into Wanda’s mouth. Both women definitely felt some chemistry in the kiss. Wanda pulled away for a breath after a moment.</p><p>“Well I’d say we have chemistry.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“I agree. Now do you want to continue this or….” Lily started to ask but trailed off.</p><p>“Or?” Wanda asked with an idea of what Lily wanted but she wanted to hear it.</p><p>“Damn are you really gunna make me work for it Wanda?” Lily asked.</p><p>“I am tempted to yes.” Wanda flirted, which caused Lily to huff. Before she pulled away and stood up so she could straddle Wanda’s lap.</p><p>“I thought chaos witches were supposed to be bold?” Lily teased as she settled onto Wanda’s lap and grabbed the tie around her neck.</p><p>“Oh we typically are, but I didn’t want to scare you off. I was hoping for a second date.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Only way you are getting a second date is if you start being bold.” Lily said as she leaned forward to kiss Wanda again. Wanda slid her hands under Lily’s dress and up her thighs before pressing her thumbs to the inside of them. Lily’s breath caught in her throat as she looked down at Wanda who was smirking.</p><p>“You sure about that?” Wanda said as she raised her hands higher and trailed her thumb along her panty line. Lily felt a surge of arousal course through her.</p><p>“Yes. I am.” Lily rasped out before she leaned forward and captured Wanda’s mouth with hers. Tongues battled each other as they kissed passionately. Wanda adjusted herself so that her right hand was able to rub Lily through her panties.</p><p>Wanda moaned as how damp the panties already were. She thought about just sliding them aside and thrusting two fingers deep inside the woman above her. Lily was keening in Wanda’s lap as she rolled her hips. The kiss muffling most of the sounds they were making.  Lily pulled away from Wanda so she could breathe. Her head felt like it was spinning.</p><p>“Bold enough for you?” Wanda teased.</p><p>“No.” Lily teased in a raspy tone. Something defiant bubbled up in Wanda, she bit her lip as she magicked the panties away and found Lily’s arousal coating her fingertips.</p><p>“Goddesses above just touch me. Please!” Lily begged.  Wanda slid her free hand up and placed her thumb on Lily’s clit, while her other hand slid down and thrust a finger into her slowly. Lily felt her hips twitch as Wanda curled that finger once before pulling out and sliding two back onto her.</p><p>“Fuck your wet Lily.” Wanda whispered as she curled her fingers and thrust onto her while rolling her clit with her thumb.</p><p>“Whose … Ah! fault.. is that?” Lily asked between gasps and moans.</p><p>“Couldn’t be little ol’ me.” Wanda joked as she started to thrust faster. She could feel Lily’s arousal start to run down her hand.</p><p>“Fuck. Wanda! Yes!” Lily hissed out as she felt herself getting closer to the edge of oblivion. Wanda curled her fingers in as she used her other thumb to circle her clit.  Lily’s head fell against Wanda’s shoulder, she was breathing heavily and her body was shaking.  A soft nip to Lily’s collarbone sent her over the edge, she moaned loudly into the empty apartment as Wanda continued to thrust into her.</p><p>“Perfect. Let’s try for another one.” Wanda complimented as she started moving her fingers even faster.</p><p>“Wha…. Oh! Fuck.” Lily started to question but quickly came to the realization that she had no control over what was happening with her body. Wanda’s thrusts, mixed with her mouth on her neck and thumb on her clit had her reeling.</p><p>“You wanted bold, now you’re getting it.” Wanda said as she kissed up the woman’s neck. Wanda wanted nothing more than to magic Lily’s dress off her so she could take a nipple in her mouth but both hands were preoccupied. Lily’s brain seemed to completely malfunction as Wanda continued to thrust into her. Her hips seeming to roll of their own accord into Wanda’s thrusts.</p><p>“I wonder how many orgasms I can get out of you. Fuck, I can feel how wet you are, I wonder. Could you take another finger?” Wanda mused to herself as she continued to thrust into Lily.</p><p>“Yes!” Lily practically screamed at the thought of Wanda filling her with a third finger.  Wanda slid back and lined her ring finger up and thrust in slowly. “Oh fuck!” Lily moaned loudly as Wanda started slowly thrusting into her.</p><p>“Fuck is right.” Wanda husked out as she continued to thrust into the gorgeous blonde above her. She could feel her walls flutter and clench down on her fingers, she could tell the woman was close again already.</p><p>“Tell me what you need Lily.” Wanda requested, trying to cut through the brain fog they both were experiencing.</p><p>“Kiss me.” Lily finally managed to get out as she pulled her head off Wanda’s shoulder and kissed her. Wanda instantly defined the kiss while rolling her thumb on her clit and thrusting into her a little faster. She felt the woman clench down hard on her fingers as she moaned  into Wanda’s mouth. Wanda slowed her fingers but kept them buried inside Lily. She waited a long moment before Lily pulled away from the kiss and melted into Wanda.</p><p>“Fuck….” Lily said with a groan as she tried to focus, but that was incredibly difficult with Wanda’s fingers still inside her.</p><p>“Yes, that’s what I’d call this.” Wanda joked as she curled her fingers.</p><p>“Gods above stop. Let me think.” Lily scolded halfheartedly.</p><p>“I can take them out of you’d like.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“Yes… No! Wait!” She said but the then quickly backtracked, but it was too late Wanda slipped her fingers out of her and moved her hands to their sides which caused Lily to groan.</p><p>“Sorry.” Wanda apologized.</p><p>“It’s fine, I don’t know what came over me… I’m usually not this forward.” Lily said as the brain fog started to clear.</p><p>“So you don’t normally straddle your dates laps and goad them into fucking you senseless on your living room couch?” Wanda teased.</p><p>“No Never. You just made it easy to feel confident and ask for what I want.” Lily complimented.</p><p>“Good, now… do we want to continue this in the bedroom or?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“If your ass thinks you’re going anywhere but my bed, you are sorely mistaken.” Lily said as she tried to get up but her legs were shaking. Wanda stood quickly so she could support the shorter woman.</p><p>“Lead the way gorgeous.” Wanda said with a smile as she helped the woman down the hall.</p><p>~Meanwhile at Agatha’s~</p><p>Agatha was tossing and turning in bed. She couldn’t sleep. Her body seemed to be acutely aware of the fact that its other half was missing. She had fluffed her pillow several times already and was extremely frustrated by the fact that rest would not come. She rolled over and tried imagining Rio’s soft breaths against her neck, her warm body pressed against her back, their legs nestled together perfectly and her arm slung over het stomach. She could almost feel the comfort of Rio as she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Little did Agatha know, that their magic was always willing to give the women exactly what they wanted. Rio moaned softly as she cuddled into Agatha and kissed her neck and shoulder. Both women none the wiser to the fact that Agatha was now in Rio’s bed.</p>

<p>Agatha  woke up the next morning surrounded by the smell of Rio. She could feel the woman’s arm weighing heavily on her side, draped over her stomach holding her close.</p><p>“What?” Agatha whispered sleepily. She opened her eyes and realized in the low morning light that she was in Rio’s bed.</p><p>“What, what? Go back to sleep babe.” Rio groaned out before she sat up quickly. Realizing that Agatha was in bed with her.</p><p>“I clearly remember going to bed by myself last night…” Rio said sleepily.</p><p>“Same. But I was imagining cuddling with you because I couldn’t sleep.” Agatha said clearly as she pulled Rio back into her arms.</p><p>“Magic… is special.” Rio groaned out as she cuddled into Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“Are we really complaining?” Agatha asked with a soft laugh as she tilted Rio’s head up so she could kiss the woman.</p><p>“No, not at all. What time is it?” Rio asked after a couple quick pecks on the lips.</p><p>“Probably too early…” Agatha said as she waved her hand and her phone appeared in it. The bright screen illuminating her face as she looked at the time. “It’s seven thirty. Don’t you have a book store to open in an hour and a half?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“That gives me thirty minutes to make out with you before I have to shower.” Rio said happily as she pulled Agatha in for another kiss, both women hummed happily as they did.</p><p>~Stark Tower, PentHouse Suite~</p><p>“Pepper! I got all the contracts signed by the school boards yesterday. The local libraries sent theirs over this morning as well. Can we both go down to the bookstore together and deliver this amazing news?” Tony asked.</p><p>“Sure, we can go around 10. They open at 9, but expect to see Agatha there. She’s got today off and I feel like they are going to be glued at the hip for an eternity.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“You mentioned they are magically bound the other day but didn’t elaborate. What did you mean by that?” Tony asked his wife as he walked over to her and handed her a cup of coffee.</p><p>“You know how Evanora Harkness said the last of her power was taken by Death?” Pepper asked as Tony sat down on the couch next to her.</p><p>“Yeah. Still a little lost on that but I have a feeling you’re about to explain.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal is THE green witch, which means she’s next in line to take up the title of death. Her great great grandmother Violet Vidal is the current standing entity of death. Agatha is magically bound to her and is her future bride. Their magic has intertwined somehow because of this. I don’t know much about it because I’m not a magic user but I’ve seen the sigil on Agatha’s chest and the new ring that popped up yesterday.”</p><p>“She’s known this woman a week and they are engaged?” Tony asked, the question didn’t sound judgmental at all just curious.</p><p>“I think their magic is the one driving at the moment. Neither of them have made a conscious choice here. It all seems to be ‘well I found you I’m locking you down.’  Kind of thing.” Pepper explained before she took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“Interesting, I wonder if Strange knows anything about this… their magic interacting with each other I mean.” Tony clarified.</p><p>“Just don’t ask Rio too many questions about being the next Entity of death while in public. We can have them over for dinner or something and you can ask a million questions then.” Pepper suggested.</p><p>“I will be on my best behavior.” Tony promised.</p><p>“Good. Now, we’ve got a couple hours to kill. What do you want to do?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I’d suggest trying again this month but you’ve got a lot on your plate with Evanora so I’m just happy to cuddle with you.” Tony said as he snuggled up to Pepper and took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>“Thanks babe. Maybe we can try later.” Pepper said as she kissed the top of his head.</p><p>“Oh, did you know that Wanda had a date last night with a published botanist?” Tony asked.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Pepper asked as she chuckled at her husband.</p><p>“She took her to the botanical gardens and the facial recognition picked up that she walked into the building… So I may have listened in to see if she’s a qualified replacement for Jeffery.”</p><p>“Anthony!” Pepper scolded.</p><p>“What? I hate doing interviews! She seems over qualified honestly.”</p><p>“Well you can have a meeting with Wanda on Monday or Thursday next week and talk to her about the woman and see if she thinks she’d be a good fit.” Pepper suggested.</p><p>“Great idea my dear!” Tony said excitedly.</p><p>~Lily’s Apartment.~</p><p>Lily woke up first and rolled over to see that Wanda was still there sleeping next to her. She smiled softly at the gorgeous redhead next to her and trailed a finger softly down her spine.</p><p>“Tickles.” Wanda mumbled softly.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t realize you were awake.” Lily said as she scooted closer and kissed Wanda’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’m a light sleeper.” Wanda whispered softly before clearing her throat. “So can I ask you a question about last night?”</p><p>“I’m sorry if I left a bad taste in your mouth with all my questions.” Lily said quickly, trying to get ahead of the problem.</p><p>“That wasn’t what I was going to ask… Are you autistic?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Would it be a deal breaker if I was?” Lily asked nervously.</p><p>“Not at all. I don’t care it would just explain many things.” Wanda said with a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, I am. I’ve been told I can be a bit much often and I ask personal questions. But I really just wanted to get to know you better. Agatha seems like a big part of your life, so I want to learn about her just as much as you. I’m sorry if I upset you.” Lily explained.</p><p>“You forget that I’m a therapist… I seen the signs and I just ignored them because they aren’t red flags to me.” Wanda said softly as she scooted closer to Lily.</p><p>“I should’ve lead with it though. It was just so easy texting you the other day, then you didn’t even batt an eye when I asked questions last night, and now I feel bad.” Wanda placed her hand softly on Lily’s cheek, before she leaned forward and gave her a kiss.</p><p>“Don’t feel bad. I could tell. It’s really not a big deal. I’m glad you are interested in my best friend. She’s a major part of my life.” Wanda reassured.</p><p>“Do you want to hang out today or do you have things you need to do?” Lily asked nervously.</p><p>“Where did that confident woman I fucked last night go?” Wanda asked with a smirk.</p><p>“She’s around here somewhere. But I just woke up so I’m in my feels.” Lily explained.</p><p>“Let’s fix that, Lily would you like to hang out with me today?” Wanda asked as she brushed her thumb across her cheek.</p><p>“That sounds delightful.” Lily said with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“I’ll give you a tour of the city seeing as you said you just moved here. Then we can stop at the book store and harass Rio.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“Is that something you like to do? Harass Rio I mean.” Lily clarified.</p><p>“No but Agatha will probably be at the store and I do like harassing her.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Can we cuddle a little longer?” Lily asked as she snuggled into Wanda’s arms.</p><p>“Of course.” Wanda said as she kissed Lily on the head softly.</p><p>~Vidal Books~</p><p>Agatha decided she’d help Rio out with the book store today in anyway she could. She spent a good chunk of the morning helping Rio get books onto shelves while Rio helped customers.</p><p>Around 10:30 a.m: the bookstore’s customers slowed down to a trickle. So Rio took a moment to breathe as she leaned against the countertop as she checked her phone for a moment.</p><p>Rita Vidal (ICE) 10:01 a.m: what time will you and Agatha be arriving?</p><p>Rio Vidal 10:35 a.m: we have to stop at Agatha’s before we come to the cabin… long story. But we will come straight from there so hopefully the latest we get there is 6:45.</p><p>Rio sent the text off to her mom and then the front door opened and the bell rang  alerting her to a customer coming into the store.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books!” Rio greeted politely before she looked up and realized it was Pepper and Tony.</p><p>“Nice, this place is awesome!” Tony said excitedly as he looked around the store. Pepper reached out and grabbed his hand before he could run off to look at books.</p><p>“Business first dear, then you can act like a kid in a candy store.” Pepper reminded her husband who sighed then snapped into his business persona.</p><p>“Right, Rio Vidal I have a proposition for you. I’m all about supporting local businesses and getting more books into schools and libraries. We have made contracts up with each school and library in the area that they will order books from your shop and they will all be paid for by Stark Industries personally. You can have your lawyer look over the contracts and let us know next week if you would like?” Tony said as he handed Rio a usb drive.</p><p>“Pepper what did I say!” Agatha scolded as she came out from behind a bookshelf. Rio was standing at the counter with a shocked look on her face.</p><p>“It was Tony’s idea!” Pepper said as she held her hands up.</p><p>“Yeah my left foot. I assume I’m the lawyer in this case.” Agatha said with a grumble, not actually irritated but irked.</p><p>“I mean she’s your wife.” Pepper jabbed with a smile on her face.</p><p>“I regret telling you everything.” Agatha said as she walked over to Rio.</p><p>“Am I dreaming?” Rio asked as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“No, you aren’t. Tony does this, though I think Peppers the mastermind here.” Agatha said as she side eyed the taller woman.</p><p>“Can I go look now?” Tony asked as he looked around the store.</p><p>“Yes you can, thank you.” Pepper said as she bent down and kissed her husband softly on the cheek. Tony ran off to look at the books.</p><p>“I’ll review this tomorrow.” Agatha said as she took the usb and stuck it in her pocket.</p><p>“I also emailed it to you before we walked in.” Pepper clarified.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked in a confused tone that was directed at Pepper.</p><p>“Because you make my friend happier than I’ve ever seen her and I know that you’re officially a permanent fixture in her life. Might as well make it easier on both of you.” Pepper answered.</p><p>“Ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous the lot of you!” Agatha said exasperatedly, Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand and smiled at her brightly.</p><p>“Look at it for me please? I trust you to make the best choice for me and my business.” Rio requested with a smile on her face that Agatha absolutely could not say no too.</p><p>“Anything for you.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Gross Harkness has gone soft.” Tony teased as he walked over to the counter carrying a couple books.</p><p>“Shut up, Mr. Potts.” Agatha softly bit back, while keeping eye contact with Rio. “Alright, I’m gunna continue to stock books.”</p><p>“I think I’ll actually look around now that we’ve got the business aspect out of the way. What did you find babe?” Pepper told the group before she asked her husband.</p><p>“Just a couple books on green sustainability. Maybe we can upscale it.” Tony said as he showed Pepper.</p><p>“Alright let’s look. Maybe we can find you something to read that is just for leisure.” Pepper suggested as she guided Tony toward the romance section.</p><p>A few seconds after Tony and Pepper walked away the front door opened. Rio looked up to see Wanda’s bright red hair dash into the room followed by a shorter blonde.</p><p>“Wanda, nice to see you. Agatha’s in the back.” Rio said with a chuckle. She was realizing everyone in Agatha’s life was filtering into her bookstore.</p><p>“Rio! Nice to see you, I told Lily I’d buy her a book after dragging her around the city a little. Your store is just a stop before we head off again.” Wanda said with a smile as Lily took her hand and waited for her to finish talking.</p><p>“Wanda just walked in Agatha!” Rio yelled toward the back of the store. Agatha popped her head out from behind a bookcase and sighed when she seen the bright red hair on her best friend’s head. Agatha got up and dusted herself off before walking to the front of the store.</p><p>“Why is everyone here right now?” Agatha asked with a sigh as she walked over to Wanda who smiled brightly and hugged her friend.</p><p>“Agatha, meet Lily!” Wanda said excitedly, Agatha met eyes with the blonde who looked Agatha up and down for a long moment.</p><p>“I never had a chance in hell.” Lily said before she realized that she said it out loud. “I mean, nice to meet you Agatha. My name is Lilian but everyone calls me Lily! Please ignore the first thing I said.” Lily said with a blush.</p><p>“Nice to meet you Lily, I’ll try my best to remember that but, you’ve inflated my ego slightly.” Agatha flirted.</p><p>“I will stab you.” Wanda threatened which caused Agatha to laugh.</p><p>“She flirted with me first, didn’t ya cutie?” Agatha asked before she winked at the blonde who blushed brightly. Rio literally was trying her best to not keel over laughing at her fiancé’s harassment of her best friend.</p><p>“Agatha, for your own health I recommend you don’t piss Wanda off too much.” Pepper said as she walked over to the group.</p><p>“I feed her, she’d never actually hurt me.” Agatha said before she walked back over to Rio and placed a hand on the small of Rio’s back.</p><p>“Perfect! I don’t have to wait for you to put your application in. Lilian Grey, would you like to come in on Monday for an interview for the head of botanical research for Stark Industries?” Tony asked as he popped his head around Pepper.</p><p>“I… Uh.. what?” Lily asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“What my husband is trying to say is. Hello we are Pepper Potts and Tony Stark owners of Stark Industries and we are currently looking for a replacement for our head of botanical research. Tony has read a few of your research papers in the last day or so and believes you are more than qualified for the job. Would you like to come into the botanical gardens on Monday for a proper interview?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I’d be honored. Thank you for this opportunity.” Lily said politely.</p><p>“Monday. 4 p.m. work for you?” Tony asked.</p><p>“Yes that works for me Sir, thank you so much.”</p><p>“Look at that! You didn’t even have to put in an application!” Wanda said excitedly as she held Lily’s hand shaking it with joy.</p><p>“Wanda, don’t shake your date it’s rude.” Rio scolded from behind the counter, she felt for the girl they were both in very overwhelming positions for different reasons.</p><p>“Well, we really must be going. Tony let’s get our books. I have a few things that need done at home.” Pepper said as she guided her husband over to the counter.  Tony set five books down and Rio rang them up.</p><p>“That will be $110 even Mr. Stark.” Rio said and the man pulled his phone out and tapped it to the keypad. The payment went through quickly and he smiled at Rio.</p><p>“Please call me Tony. We will be business partners soon anyway!” Rio shook her head at the man and bagged up his books before handing them over to him.</p><p>“Enjoy your books Tony. Have a wonderful day you two!” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“You as well Rio.” Pepper and Tony said in unison before they headed out the door.</p><p>“Why were they here anyway?” Wanda asked as she jabbed her thumb toward the door.</p><p>“Pepper has a wild hare up her ass and is determined to make sure Rio is successful.” Agatha answered as she shook her head.</p><p>“Well she’s your fiancé so I’d fucking hope so.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“You guys are engaged?” Lily asked and  caused the three women to freeze.</p><p>“Uh… did I say fiancé? I meant girlfriend.” Wanda tried to backtrack.</p><p>“Wanda you’re a horrible lair.” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“It’s complicated.” Wanda and Agatha said in unison.</p><p>“Ya know what.. I don’t need to know yet. I wanna be nosy but I’ve been nosy enough lately.” Lily said as she let the conversation drop.</p><p>“Thank you. She’s gunna kill me later.” Wanda whispered to Lily before she spoke up. “Anyway, did you want to look for a book?”</p><p>“Yes I did. I’ll go do that while you three talk.” Lily said as she walked away.</p><p>“Way to go Maximoff.” Rio chided quietly.</p><p>“Does she know how long you have been dating?” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“No but it’s bound to come up at some point!” Rio hissed.</p><p>“Stop. We will have to tell her or we won’t. It’s fine. Stop stressing. You two might not work out.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“I mean I hope we do. She’s pretty great.” Wanda said with a soft smile.</p><p>“Oh. Well then. That’s new.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“What?” Wanda asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh nothing, don’t worry too much about it just enjoy your date.” Agatha said with a smile directed at her best friend. She then turned to look at Rio. “I’m gunna go finish stocking books my love.”</p><p>“Thank you I appreciate you.” Rio said with a smile before she gave Agatha a kiss.</p><p>“Ew public displays of affection.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“If we weren’t in the bookstore right now.” Agatha said with a sigh as she walked away.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Wanda asked Rio.</p><p>“I’ve kinda made it an accidental rule… nothing in the bookstore.” Rio whispered as she looked over at Agatha who was bent over putting books away, giving Rio a perfect view of her ass in the jeans she was wearing.</p><p>“Ahh I see. Well good luck keeping that rule in place.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m a weak bitch and I know it. Now get out of the way I have other customers.” Rio said as she waved Wanda to the side.</p><p>“Sorry! I’m harassing my future sister in law.” Wanda said as she stepped out of the way of a pair of teenagers.</p><p>“You guys are friends with Tony Stark?” The young boy asked.</p><p>“We aren’t, but that cool lady over there with the wavy long black hair is. He’s just my boss.” Wanda explained as she pointed at Agatha.</p><p>“That’s awesome!” The young man said as the girl jabbed him in the arm.</p><p>“Just get your book Jake. They were talking.” The girl said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“It’s alright, she’s just waiting on her date to find a book and I own the place. Come on up, let’s get you checked out.” Rio told the two teens as they walked up to the counter and she rang the book up.</p><p>“That will be $18.99.” Rio said as she tucked the book into the bag. The boy gave Rio a $20 bill and she gave him his change with a smile.</p><p>“Thanks for shopping with us! Have a good day you two.” Rio said as the two teens walked out of the building.  Leaving the four women alone in the book shop. Lily walked over to Wanda and Rio a few minutes later holding a couple books.</p><p>“I’ll pay for these.” Lily said as she walked over to the counter.</p><p>“No, you won’t.” Wanda said as she looked Rio dead in the eye.</p><p>“Wanda let me pay for my own books. Rio, please.” Lily begged.</p><p>“I’m literally stuck with her for the rest of my life… Sorry Lily. She wins.” Rio said with a sigh.</p><p>“You and Agatha could break up. You never know, we live a long ass time.” Lily said honestly not realizing how untrue that statement was.</p><p>“Trust me when I say this Lily, that’s never gunna happen.” Wanda reassured as she handed Rio her card.</p><p>“Why do I believe you?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Because it’s the truth.” Wanda said with a shrug, Rio put the books in the bag and then handed Wanda her card and the receipt.</p><p>“Have a good rest of your date you two.” Rio told them as they walked toward the door. Once they were out of the store and down the street Wanda took Lily’s hand and brought it up to her mouth so she could kiss the back of it.</p><p>“I have like seven questions. Give or take.” Lily said causing Wanda to laugh.</p><p>“I’ll answer them to the best of my ability.” Wanda reassured as they turned the corner toward the coffee shop.</p><p>“Have you and Agatha ever…” Lily started to ask but trailed off not wanting to actually ask.</p><p>“Yuck, no. She’s literally like a sister to me.” Wanda answered with a blanch.</p><p>“Ok. Why was she flirting with me?” Lily asked trying to understand their recent conversations.</p><p>“To piss me off if I’m being honest. If you need I’ll tell her to not do that because it makes you uncomfortable and she will stop instantly.” Wanda reassured as they walked up to the shop and she opened the door for Lily.</p><p>“Good to know… are you a jealous person?” Lily asked, even though she had a pretty clear idea. Lily got in line with Wanda while they waited their turn.</p><p>“Yes, I’ll try to keep that to a minimum though. If or when we start officially dating  all bets are off.” Wanda explained while she looked at the menu.</p><p>“Does that translate to possessiveness?” Lily asked, she took a moment to look at the menu as well. “You bought me books let me pay for the coffee.”</p><p>“Yes, and into the bedroom on top of that. No, I asked you out on this date I’m paying ” Wanda answered as the line moved a little.</p><p>“Fine, you can pay but next time I am. How long have Rio and Agatha been dating? A year? Maybe two? How can you know for sure they are each others forever.” Lily trailed off trying to make sense.</p><p>“They have a special connection I promise. I’ll tell you about it one day.” Wanda told Lily before they got to the counter.</p><p>“Welcome in to Coffee Co. what can I get started for you ladies today?” The barista asked.</p><p>“Can I please get a black coffee with 3 pumps of hazelnut syrup?” Wanda requested.</p><p>“And you?” The barista asked Lilly.</p><p>“Can I have the cookies and cream frappe with a shot of espresso please?” Lily asked politely.</p><p>“Sure that will be $10.50 and a name for the order?” The barista asked as Wanda handed her card over to her. The girl swiped it, made sure it went through and handed it back.</p><p>“Wanda. Thank you.” Wanda answered as she took her card back. Lily and Wanda stepped off to the side to continue talking while they waited for their drinks.</p><p>“Is Mr. Stark always so forward?” Lily asked Wanda which made the woman chuckle.</p><p>“Yes. Yes he is.” Wanda answered.</p><p>~Back at the Bookshop~</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the day taking care of customers while Agatha cleaned and took care of things for her. Around 5:30 the store seemed dead to the world. So Rio took a moment to walk over to Agatha and give her a couple quick kisses.</p><p>“Thank you for helping today. Now we can spend the whole day together tomorrow doing whatever we want.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“You’re welcome babe, should I run home and get the cakes?” Agatha asked after she pulled away slightly to look at her watch.</p><p>“Nah, we will head to your place once we lock up then open a portal to the cabin there.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Do you have a laptop here?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, don’t worry about their proposal right now. I want you to relax you’ve been helping me all day.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I honestly have no doubt they made sure it was fully to your benefit.” Agatha explained, then before Rio had a chance to respond the front door opened again. They broke apart and Rio went to greet her customer.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books!” Rio said in a cheerful tone as she walked back toward the front. Agatha went and sat down on the couch in the spell book section. She pulled her phone out and checked her email and started reading the document on there.  Everything seemed pretty straight forward for legal jargon.</p><p>20 minutes later the book store was locked up and Rio was ready to head to Agatha’s place. She walked into the back of the store and looked over at Agatha who was reading on her phone.</p><p>“In a store full of books you decide to read on your phone?” Rio teased.</p><p>“I remembered Pepper emailed it to me. So I’m reading it. I didn’t mean to offend the books or you.” Agatha said as she locked her phone and stood up.</p><p>“Anything interesting?” Rio asked as she walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“It was exactly what I was expecting. Pretty straightforward. We can talk more about it after dinner. Let’s head to my place.” Agatha said before she gave Rio a soft kiss, pulling her close. Rio could feel something bubble up inside her as Agatha slipped her hand under Rio’s shirt to press her left hand against her lower back.</p><p>“Behave we have to be at the cabin in 40 minutes.” Rio whispered as Agatha kissed her neck.</p><p>“Fine… I suppose I’ll have to wait to do what I wanted to.” Agatha said as she brought her left hand around and pressed it against Rio’s sigil. Rio felt desire flood through her. The ring seeming to amplify the sensation.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio groaned out weakly.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha husked before she kissed her on the lips again and then pulled away. “Let’s go, my love.”</p><p>“I’m going to get you back for that.”</p><p>“Why? Didn’t you tell Wanda you made a rule of no fucking in the book store?” Agatha said with a smirk as she walked toward the back door. Rio sighed and followed Agatha knowing they didn’t have time for anything.</p><p>They quickly locked the door and armed the security system before getting in Rio’s car and heading toward Agatha’s place.</p><p>“So I’ve heard a lot about your mom, what about your dad?” Agatha asked as Rio put the car in drive.</p><p>“He works a lot, I don’t even know if he will be there tonight. It might just be you, me, and momma.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“What does he do for a living? Is he a witch?” Agatha asked as she watched the city drive through the window.</p><p>“He’s a Millwright, so he travels all over the country fixing machines that are too big to move. He is, but he rarely practices. He says if he can’t wrench it into submission he doesn’t want anything to do with it. A real fixer.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t magic help with his job?” Agatha wondered.</p><p>“I mean probably, but then he wouldn’t be built like a brick shit house. I personally think he likes the manual labor. Probably why I prefer analog magic most of the time. It feels like you’re earning it.” Rio explained.</p><p>“You seem to use magic the normal way around me a lot.” Agatha mused.</p><p>“Well since meeting you it’s become easier for me. I don’t know if that’s our connection or what but things seem easier and lighter than they used to when I did magic.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Interesting because I’ve felt more grounded since meeting you. Like I’m not as stressed about things anymore.” Agatha thought aloud, more to herself than anything. Then they both seemed to come to the same understanding at the same time.</p><p>“Looks like you two figured it out finally!” Violet said from the back seat startling both women. A loud yelp came from Agatha as she clutched her chest, Rio only jumped slightly as she looked in the rear view mirror.</p><p>“Okay grandma don’t do that shit while we are driving!” Rio scolded, as she glared into the mirror.</p><p>“Explain.” Agatha said after she calmed down.</p><p>“Death needs balance. You balance each other out, in every aspect. Your magic fills in the weak spots for each other. Which is why you feel more grounded now Agatha and why magic is easier for you Rio.”</p><p>“So… we can use each others magic?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Less use each other’s magic. More you are both earth spirit witches. I’m a spirit chaos witch and so is my wife.” Violet explained.</p><p>“Can regular witches do what we do or is this just something exclusive to us?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’ve seen a few deep bonds that make it as far as the sigil on their chests but the rings never appear. Take that information and digest it however you’d like.” Violet explained.</p><p>“Interesting.” Agatha said as she thought about it.</p><p>“You girls enjoy dinner, tell Rita I love her please Rio.” Violet said before she disappeared again right as Rio parked in Agatha’s driveway.</p><p>“Let’s go get the cakes and head to dinner. We can talk about all that later.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“That’s fine my love.” Rio said with a smile before she got out of the car. Agatha got out and used her magic to unlock her door because she realized she didn’t have her keys.</p><p>“Maybe we should leave keys at each other’s places just in case this keeps happening.” Agatha said as she let Rio into the house.</p><p>“If we keep having things like this happen I agree.” Rio said as she shut the front door. Agatha walked into the kitchen and grabbed the two cakes out of the fridge and then headed back into the entryway.</p><p>“Ready?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yep, I’ve already done the hard work so let’s go to your bedroom door and use that portal.” Rio said as she walked toward Agatha’s bedroom.  She reached for the handle and opened the door to present a swirling green portal.</p><p>“Come on. Momma’s dying to meet you.”Rio said as she guided Agatha through the portal.</p>

<p>Agatha stepped through the portal first into the lush green forest floor. The soft moss cushioning her steps as she turned around to wait for Rio who stepped through a moment later.  Both women stood in the clearing, Rio felt her whole body relax the second her feet hit the earth.</p><p>“Why did my shoes disappear?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Oh. No shoes in the forest. Kinda like the moms that yell ‘no shoes in the house’ well this is the house for our family.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Makes sense, could’ve warned me.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I forgot until just now that we came here barefoot the first time. “ Rio explained.</p><p>“That’s fine, as long as those shoes are still at home because I love them.” Agatha said as she started walking toward the cabin.</p><p>“They are right by the door I promise.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Good. Now let’s get this over with before I chicken out.” Agatha said as they stood at the steps of the cabin.</p><p>“I promise she will love you.” Rio told Agatha as she walked up the steps and put her hand on the doorknob.</p><p>“You have to say that.” Agatha said with a chuckle. Rio opened the door and the cabins warmth rushed over them as they walked into the house. Sounds could be heard from the kitchen as Rio guided Agatha deeper into the cabin.</p><p>“Momma it smells amazing!” Rio said as she walked into the kitchen. Rita Vidal was standing at the stove cooking something when they walked into the room. Agatha paused a moment later as the woman turned around to look at the younger women. She looked just like Rio, the only difference between the two women was Rita being a little shorter than her daughter, had smile lines, and a large gray streak framing both sides of her face.</p><p>“Rio! Papa will actually be here at 7, so I’m glad he gets to meet Agatha! Speaking of Hello witchlett! You are even more beautiful than I could’ve ever imagined!” Rita said as she rushed over to the two women. Rio hugged her mother tightly for a long moment before she let go. Rita went to hug Agatha and realized she was holding the cakes.</p><p>“These look stunning but let’s put them down witchlett! You deserve a real hug.” Rita said as she took the cakes from Agatha and set them on the countertop behind her. She then pulled Agatha in for a soft hug. Agatha felt so safe and loved in Rita’s arms. She had never been hugged like this by Evanora. Tears welled up in her eyes as she realized she had never been actually hugged by her mother. Agatha pulled away first and tried to wipe the tears away.</p><p>“Sorry. I..” Agatha tried to apologize but the words didn’t want to come out. She felt like there was a massive lump in her throat.</p><p>“Momma! Don’t make her cry.” Rio scolded. Agatha swallowed hard and tried to speak again but nothing came out. She took a deep breath and took Rio’s left hand and touched the ring there. Trying to communicate how she felt in this moment. She knew Rio could feel her emotions. Just not strongly. It seemed stronger when they touched sigils but the rings felt like a connection as well.</p><p>“Oh. I… ah I see. I’m sorry babe. Take a moment. It’s okay. Then you can tell her.” Rio said softly. Agatha breathed deeply and sighed loudly after a moment.</p><p>“I’m sorry, my mother never hugged me. I didn’t know what that felt like.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Oh witchlett! I’m sorry but you are gunna have to get used to hugs like that for the rest of my life. Now let me finish cooking dinner while we wait for my husband.” Rita reassured, hugging her softly again before turning around and going back to the stove.</p><p>“What is Mr. Vidal’s name?” Agatha asked as Rio guided Agatha over to the table to sit down.</p><p>“Daniel.” Rita answered, a moment later the front door of the cabin opened then shut.</p><p>“Girls I’m here!” A deep voice resounded from the living room.</p><p>“In the kitchen Papa!” Rio yelled for her father. A few moments later a tall muscular man walked into the room. He seemed about average build for a man to Agatha, just a few inches taller than Rio.  He had dark black hair, tan skin, deep green eyes, and a handsome face with a warm smile.</p><p>“Pepita!” Daniel said loudly as soon as he seen Rio, he scooped her up into his arms and spun her around as they laughed in the kitchen before he set his daughter down. Agatha stood up during the spin so she could greet the man.</p><p>“Papa, I’d like to introduce you to Agatha. Don’t hug her, momma already almost made her cry. ” Rio said introducing her father to her fiancé.</p><p>“Ahh, well Pepita, that’s Agatha’s choice. Would you be okay with a hug?” Daniel asked.</p><p>“As long as my feet stay on the ground.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I can do that.” Daniel reassured as he stepped closer to Agatha and gave her a soft hug. Both of Rio’s parents put so much love and warmth into their hugs. It felt so nice. Agatha soaked in the hug this time and then pulled away.</p><p>“Alright. Dinners done.” Rita told them.</p><p>“What are we having?” Daniel asked his wife.</p><p>“Ropa Vieja with rice, and Agatha was so kind to make us dessert.” Rita told her husband as she started serving up bowls of food and her husband walked over to the counter to help her grab the bowls. They all sat down at the table a few minutes later with their food in front of them.</p><p>“Thank you for dinner Mrs. Vidal.” Agatha said politely.</p><p>“Oh none of that Mrs. Vidal stuff, you can call us by our first names. Now eat, please.” Rita told Agatha, who looked shocked to say the least.</p><p>“Momma, she’s not used to this. We are going to have to give her some grace here.” Rio explained to her mother.</p><p>“Agatha, it’s okay. You don’t have to worry here. My wife is just trying to make you comfortable, just call us whatever makes you comfortable.” Daniel said softly.</p><p>“Thank you Sir. I appreciate that.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“So, tell us about yourself! Rio has been so busy we haven’t gotten to talk much lately.” Rita requested before she started eating.</p><p>“Well, you know the bad stuff already. So we will start with I’m partner at Stark Law offices, but I still take high profile cases. I graduated top of my class. I started college right after my mother tried to kill me because I had no other choice. Graduated highschool at 16, graduated law school at 24, got hired in at Stark Law as a little baby intern and climbed my way to the top. I like to cook, read, practice magic, and just learn as much as I can.” Agatha told Rio’s parents.</p><p>“Oh so you’re clever, good. Someone’s gotta be to keep Rio on her toes.” Daniel said with a chuckle. Agatha took a bite of her food and hummed happily. It tasted so good, like a dish that made you feel like you were home.</p><p>“This is amazing Rita. I’ll need the recipe so I can make it for Rio.” Agatha said after she finished chewing her food.</p><p>“Momma, don’t… please if you care about my waistline.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Why is that sweetie?” Daniel asked as he watched Agatha pick apart the food looking it over and analyzing it. Like she was taking mental notes of every item in the dish.</p><p>“Because she made this chicken for me the other night and it was so good! She can cook already, don’t give her the family recipes… she might improve them.” Rio told her father, before she added the last part sheepishly.</p><p>“I doubt I could improve this Rio. It’s perfectly balanced.” Agatha complimented.</p><p>“What was the chicken?” Rita asked.</p><p>“It’s called marry me chicken. It’s chicken breast pan fried in a light dredge of flour then cooked off the rest of the way in a rich cream sauce.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Maybe we will trade recipes then! That sounds good.”  Rita said with a wink before she went back to eating.</p><p>“She also roasted off mini potatoes that were super yummy as well. Honestly I’m probably going to get fat if she cooks like that for me for the rest of our lives.” Rio told her parents.</p><p>“What do you do for a living Rita?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I own a green house here in Washington that I run. Keeps me busy while Daniel is out running around the country.” Rita explained.</p><p>“I’d love to see it sometime.” Agatha said as she took another bite of food.</p><p>“I’m sure that can be arranged.” Rita said as  stood up. “I forgot drinks. Who wants some wine?” Rita asked the group.</p><p>“Can I just have some water please?” Agatha requested. Rita waved her hand and three glasses of wine and one glass of water appeared on the table. “Thank you.” Agatha said as she reached for her glass.</p><p>“So Rita told me you’re a spirit witch… and we’ve learned some interesting things about that lately.” Daniel said softly, trying to not sound brash or aggressive.</p><p>“Unfortunately of no choice of my own. You can thank Evanora Harkness for that.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I spoke to Lilia about her…” Rita trailed off unsure of how to say the next thing.</p><p>“I don’t want to think about her right now. Honestly. She’s ruined enough of my life. I don’t want her tainting how you two feel about me.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“She wouldn’t, her actions are her own.” Rita said before she dropped the subject and changed it to something lighter. “So, I just have to ask because I’m not getting any younger. Do you want kids?”</p><p>“Momma!” Rio scolded. This caused Agatha to pause mid bite and put her spoon down.</p><p>“We haven’t really talked about that yet. It’s only been a week. But if you are asking me personally? Yes I’d love to have a couple. But right now I just want to spend time getting to know your daughter better.” Agatha answered as she reached over and took Rio’s hand softly. She then went back to eating her meal after.</p><p>“I can accept that as an answer. No rush! Not like we won’t have a ton of time to harass you about grandbabies in the future.” Rita reassured.</p><p>“They literally never have to have kids.” Daniel said honestly.</p><p>“If Rio wants to retire from being death I’d recommend doing so.” Rita responded to her husband.</p><p>“Maybe if someone didn’t have me and only me… I wouldn’t have to worry about kids.” Rio jabbed at her parents.</p><p>“You were more than enough.” Rita and Daniel said in unison.</p><p>“Tell me all about her as a child! I’d love to hear it!” Agatha requested as she continued to eat her meal.</p><p>“Noooooo.” Rio groaned out.</p><p>“She never kept her shoes on for the life of us! Ever since she could walk she was a barefoot bohemian! Which was fine here but once school started for her it was a nightmare.” Rita said honestly.</p><p>“Not to mention trying to keep her alive! She was such a dare devil! She took so many risks.” Daniel said to Agatha.</p><p>“Hey, we knew I was next in line! Death wouldn’t take me early! I was just being a kid having fun.” Rio said trying to pass the shit she did as a child off as being a kid.</p><p>“Taking a dive off the balcony into a pile of pillows isn’t having fun. It’s trying to put me in an early grave with a heart attack!” Rita scolded.</p><p>“Oh Jeeze, and you want me to have children with her?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“You seem like you’ve got a good head on your shoulders. I have confidence that my grandchildren will make it to adult hood with you as their mother.” Rita reassured Agatha.</p><p>“Are you all done eating? I’ll clear the table.” Daniel asked as he stood up and grabbed his bowl.</p><p>“Yes thank you.” Agatha said as she handed him her bowl. Rio handed hers to her father and Rita did as well. Agatha stood up and followed Daniel over to the island.</p><p>“Do you guys want dessert?” Agatha asked as she took the tops off the cakes.</p><p>“Of course!” The three chimed in unison which caused Agatha to chuckle.</p><p>“Can you help me Daniel? I need two knives and some plates.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“Of course one moment.” He said as he placed the dishes in the sink then turned around to pull out plates to hand to Agatha before he opened a drawer to hand her two knives.</p><p>“Dolce de leche? Or chocolate?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Both.” Rio answered.</p><p>“I’ll take the dolce de leche please.” Rita requested.</p><p>“Can I have both as well Agatha?” Daniel asked as he grabbed forks for everyone.</p><p>“Of course!” Agatha said as she sliced the cakes and served them. Daniel took the two plates of cake over to his wife and daughter and then came back for his own plate. Agatha took a small slice of the dolce de leche cake for herself. She walked over to the table and sat back down.</p><p>Rita took a bite quickly before anyone else and looked over at her daughter who was taking a bite of the dolce de leche cake.</p><p>“Why is it so good?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Because I made them from scratch.” Agatha said simply, not bragging just making a statement. Daniel decided to take a bite quickly to see why his daughter and wife were so happy.</p><p>“This is so good!” Daniel said happily as he took another bite.</p><p>“I’m glad you all enjoy it. Wait until you two get to the chocolate.” Agatha said with a smile and then took a bite of her own cake. She looked over at Rio who was shoving the last bite of dolce de leche cake into her mouth.</p><p>“My love, breathe. There’s plenty of cake.” Agatha joked as she watched Rio.</p><p>“If our daughter doesn’t marry you, we are disowning her and adopting you.” Daniel told Agatha.</p><p>“Rude, very rude Papa!” Rio scolded her father. Who just laughed and shook his head.</p><p>“So on a different note did you notice that Violet Vidal’s spell book is missing?” Agatha asked Rita.</p><p>“I did not. But I assume there’s a very good reason for that.” Rita answered.</p><p>“Can you see the rings on our fingers?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yes, I just didn’t want to mention them.” Rita answered.</p><p>“They are part of our magical connection. We can actually see Violet Vidal now. She gave Agatha her spell book.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Oh and how is she?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Fine, she popped into the car on the way home tonight and told us to tell you she loved you. Though she did scare the fuck out of us.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Good to know she’s still the same as death as she was in life.” Rita said with a sigh.</p><p>“How old were you when she became death?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I was 6, but she loved scaring me and my sisters.” Rita answered.</p><p>“Ah, okay. Makes sense.” Agatha said as she went back to her cake. Rio had paused her eating to speak to her mother and realized that she hadn’t tried the chocolate cake on her plate. Rio took a quick bite of the cake and looked at Agatha.</p><p>“This cake is coming back with us.” Rio said seriously.</p><p>“Let me have a bite honey.” Rita asked her husband who was still eating the dolce de leche cake.</p><p>“No, go get your own slice.” He said defensively as he shielded his cake from Rita.</p><p>“Rio let Momma have a bite.” Rita said turning to her child now.</p><p>“Nope I’m not sharing.” Rio said as she protected her plate as well.</p><p>“I don’t want a whole slice. Just let me have a bite.” Rita said to her daughter with a huff. Agatha was smiling at the family’s antics as they bickered at the table. Agatha got up and got herself a small slice of chocolate cake and walked over to Rita.</p><p>“Take a bite of mine, I’ll share.” Agatha said with a smile as she held out her plate.</p><p>“Thank you witchlett!” Rita said as she took her fork and took a bite and brought it up to her mouth. Agatha walked back over to her seat. Rita looked over at Agatha with a shocked look before she spoke again. “That is the richest chocolate cake I’ve ever had.”</p><p>“It has coffee in it, that’s why. The coffee adds depth to the chocolate.” Agatha explained as she took a bite of cake.</p><p>“They were both amazing Agatha. I’m glad we finally have a baker in the family.” Daniel complimented as he stood up to take his dish to the sink.</p><p>“Are you two staying for game night?” Rita asked.</p><p>“I didn’t warn Agatha about that because I didn’t think Papa would be here.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Games?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“When Daniel and I are here we play games with Rio. It’s a family tradition, but you girls don’t have to stay for it if you don’t want to.” Rita explained.</p><p>“What games? Wanda, Pietro and I used to play board games on nights we all had off. That sounds fun, and possibly less chaotic.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I feel like Pietro would cheat.” Rio told her fiancé.</p><p>“He did. Often. So hopefully it’s easier to catch when you aren’t being spun in circles while taking your turn.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Let’s clean up and then head back to the den.” Daniel told the women. Rita got up and brought her plate over to her husband so he could wash it.</p><p>“Rio once Agatha and you are done eating bring them to your father.” Rita told her daughter.</p><p>“I can help with something.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“You can help by relaxing witchlett!” Rita said from the kitchen as she packed the food up. Rio took their plates over to Daniel and put the lids on the cakes and helped her mother put everything in the fridge. Agatha turned around and watched the family go to work cleaning the kitchen.</p><p>Twenty minutes later they were sitting on the couch cushions around the coffee table with a game of scrabble on the table.</p><p>“I’m unsure this is the best game to play with a book store owner and a lawyer.” Agatha told the group.</p><p>“Might be fun!” Rita said enthusiastically.  They opened the game and set up the board. They were about to find out exactly how competitive the two women were.</p><p>Agatha won the game by the smallest margin possible. Rio was slightly fuming from having to get the dictionary out at one point. Rita spent most of the evening watching these two women get more and more competitive and trying to not laugh at them.  Daniel was honestly just as amused as his wife by the two women. They finished the game and put it away before getting up and cleaning the den back up.</p><p>“It was wonderful meeting you witchlett! Thank you for coming into our girls life.” Rita said with a smile before she hugged Agatha again. This time Agatha leaned into the hug and sighed softly. Rita rubbed her back reassuringly. She then whispered softly to Agatha. “You are perfect, never doubt that baby.”</p><p>Agatha broke away and smiled softly at Rita before the woman grabbed her daughter and gave her a bone crushing hug. “Don’t forget your cake girls.” Rita reminded them.</p><p>“Oh shoot!” Rio said as she broke away from her mother and ran off toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Damn it Rita! I wanted those.” Daniel scolded. They all stood there for a long moment before Rio walked back out into the living room carrying only one container.</p><p>“I split the cakes and put half of one and half of the other in one container so you can have some cake Papa.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Thank you pepita! I love you.” Daniel as he kissed Rio on the head.</p><p>“Let’s head home. I love you both. Goodnight!” Rio told her parents as they walked out the door.</p><p>“We love you!” Daniel said as they watched the girls head down the stairs and toward the door that was still standing in the middle of the mossy forest floor.</p><p>“They love you.” Rio said as she walked up to the door.</p><p>“I think the cake helped.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I think you being you helped.” Rio said as Agatha opened the door for her.</p><p>“Let’s get home. I have a victory to celebrate.” Agatha said smugly.</p>

<p>“Let’s get home. I have a victory to celebrate.” Agatha said smugly.</p><p>“I never agreed to any terms of your celebration.” Rio said with a smirk as she walked through the door.</p><p>“I’m inclined to think you’d enjoy it.” Agatha teased after she stepped through the door.</p><p>“Care to tell me what it might be?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I wanna be pampered.” Agatha answered as she took the container of cake from Rio and headed toward the kitchen.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asked as she followed Agatha.</p><p>“I want to be pampered. I want to be a pillow princess, I want you to focus on me, I want you to do whatever you want to me.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I think I can handle that.” Rio said with a grin. “First things first, I’m going to draw you a bath. Then we will go from there.” Rio said as she walked away from Agatha.</p><p>“Wait… that’s not what I meant.” Agatha said in a defeated tone as she put the cake in the fridge. She walked into her bedroom and into the bathroom to find Rio enchanting the water. It was a different color this time.</p><p>“What is the spell we are using?” Agatha asked, noticing the water was glowing a soft pink.</p><p>“Nuh uh! You wanted to be pampered. So no questions, shut off your brain.” Rio said as she helped Agatha out of her tee shirt she was wearing, before she undid her bra clasp. She then helped Agatha out of her jeans, and underwear, before guiding her over to the tub. Agatha stepped in and settled into the water, she felt so calm already. Like her whole body was settling into the softest of things.</p><p>“Comfortable?” Rio asked as she checked Agatha out.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha responded as she leaned her head back and relaxed, long hair hanging outside of the large claw foot tub.</p><p>“Good, stay here I’ve gotta open a portal to my apartment for a few things, I’ll be right back.” Rio said as she bent over and gave Agatha a kiss.</p><p>“Noooo.” Agatha whined.</p><p>“I promise you won’t notice I’m gone. Just enjoy the bath.” Rio reassured before she walked out of the bathroom. Literally less than a minute later Rio walked back into the room. “See, super quick.”</p><p>“I see, what did you go get?” Agatha asked still keeping her eyes closed.</p><p>“Just a couple things to take care of you.” Rio reassured Agatha cracked an eye open to look at Rio. “Once you’re done bathing, I have something else I want to do for you.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha questioned, she was confused honestly.</p><p>“Why are you confused? You want to be pampered. I’m going to do it right.” Rio reassured, before turning serious. “So relax in the tub, and once you are ready to get out I’ll take care of you.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, I’ll try.” Agatha answered as she slid deeper into the bath. She wasn’t sure what Rio had planned but she asked for this. Rio walked back out of the bathroom into the bedroom to do a couple things. She then came back into the bathroom and grabbed two towels. She set one on the toilet next to the tub then walked back out into the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha felt the water cooling down and sighed sadly. “I’m ready to get out Rio.” Rio walked back into the room and grabbed the towel for Agatha.</p><p>“Perfect timing my love. Let’s get you into bed.” Rio said as Agatha pulled the plug. A moment later she stood up and climbed out of the tub. Rio wrapped the towel around Agatha and let her dry off some before she guided her into the bedroom.</p><p>“Towel off and lay down on your stomach please.” Rio requested as she pointed at the bed. Agatha did as she was told and dropped the towel on the floor and climbed into bed. Rio then took off her shirt and pants leaving her in a bra and panties. She then walked over to the bed and climbed onto the mattress. She straddled Agatha’s ass and moved Agatha’s long hair out of the way.</p><p>“First, I’m going to give you a massage.” Rio said as she grabbed a bottle of oil from next to her on the bed. She poured some into her hands to warm it then started rubbing it all over Agatha’s back.  A soft moan emanated from Agatha’s chest as Rio massaged her back.</p><p>“That smells so good.” Agatha mumbled as she melted into the bed.</p><p>“Jasmine, lavender, and sandalwood oils mixed with a base.” Rio explained as she massaged the oil into Agatha’s back. She took time to make sure she found every knot in Agatha’s shoulders and helped soothe them before moving down to the middle of her back and doing the same.</p><p>“Goddesses that feels so nice. This isn’t what I meant when I said I wanted to be pampered but I’m not complaining at all.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Oh, we will get to the pillow princess part soon. I just wanted to show you how much I appreciate you.” Rio said as she continued to massage Agatha’s back. She finally reached her lower back and noticed a few scars on her back, she felt her stomach drop. “Do I want to ask where these are from?”</p><p>“You can, but I guarantee you won’t like the answer.” Agatha said with a sigh as Rio softly massaged them.</p><p>“Are there more?”  Rio asked.</p><p>“Unfortunately. If you scoot down you’ll see them.” Agatha said with a watery tone.</p><p>“You didn’t deserve this. But I’ll make sure you never feel anything like this again.” Rio said as she slid down. She noticed several long inconsistent scars covering Agatha’s ass and lower back.</p><p>“What a fucking monster.” Rio said as she massaged Agatha’s scars before leaning forward and kissing the ones on her lower back softly.</p><p>“You’ll find more. I’m sure. She would use a switch on me when I was overly disobedient.” Agatha said as she tried to blink away the tears.</p><p>“I have healing magic, I can make something to soften them and make them less visible, if you’d like?” Rio offers.</p><p>“I’ve lived with them this long. I don’t care. I just didn’t want you to see them.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Agatha, these scars don’t mean anything to me when it comes to how I feel about you. They only make me hate her more. If I could’ve met you sooner…” Rio said in a frustrated tone.</p><p>“You met me right when I needed you the most. Stop.” Agatha demanded softly.</p><p>“Fine, now I’m going to continue to pamper you, my love.” Rio said softly as she massaged Agatha’s thighs. Once she made it down to her calves and feet she softly tapped Agatha’s hip. “Roll over.”</p><p>Agatha sighed softly and rolled over, Rio grabbed the bottle of oil and started massaging her feet before moving up to her calves and thighs.  Agatha just closed her eyes and relaxed as Rio slid between her legs and massaged her stomach softly. Rio softly touched the sigil that trailed between her breasts.</p><p>“Shit.” Agatha whispered, as her whole body was flooded with a warm soft feeling. Like she was experiencing pure tenderness.</p><p>“I can avoid the sigil if you want?” Rio asked tenderly, she didn’t want to overwhelm Agatha.</p><p>“No it’s fine. I just didn’t expect you to feel this way right now.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I always feel this way about you. You feel more like home than anyone I’ve ever met.” Rio reassured as she massaged Agatha’s ribs before reaching up to cup her breasts. A soft moan left Agatha as Rio smiled at her and tweaked her nipples before she moved up to massage her shoulders.</p><p>“Please Rio. You’ve already got me so wound up.” Agatha complained.</p><p>“Patience babe. I’m not done taking care of you.” Rio mumbled as she straddled Agatha’s thighs, started massaging her shoulders before moving down her right arm and massaged it before moving to her left and doing the same.</p><p>“You are so mean.” Agatha complained.</p><p>“You are impatient. You wanted to be pampered and I’m giving you what you wanted.” Rio explained as she brought her left hand up to her mouth and softly kissed the ring on her finger. Agatha felt tears well up again at such a tender moment between them. She closed her eyes to keep them from spilling out as Rio kissed each knuckle.</p><p>“Why must you be so sweet?” Agatha asked in a pained tone.</p><p>“Just making up for all the love you never received.” Rio said as she kissed Agatha’s ring one last time. This time the sigils on their chest glowed brightly. Shifting and changing on their chests. Something bloomed to the left and settled over where their hearts were.</p><p>A simple green heart sigil that looked like vines settled on Agatha’s left breast. A purple wispy heart that had clouds rolling through the inside of it settled on Rio’s left breast. Rio reached forward and softly touched the marking.  Agatha’s hand slid up Rio’s stomach and breast before settling on the heart on her chest.</p><p>“Forever.” Resounded loudly in both their minds, like the other woman was speaking inside their head.</p><p>‘Woah!’ Rio thought to herself but Agatha heard it loud and clear.</p><p>“Darling, I can hear your thoughts.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Why can’t I hear yours?” Rio questioned.</p><p>‘Because this was the first thing I learned how to protect. If she couldn’t get into my mind, she couldn’t punish me for my thoughts.’ Agatha thought clearly.</p><p>“You are amazing. One of the most fascinating people I’ve ever met.” Rio said aloud, ‘and I’m falling in love with you.’</p><p>“Did you mean to think that…” Agatha asked with a shocked tone.</p><p>“Not really, sorry.” Rio said as she removed her hand from the heart on Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“I know I’m falling in love with you Rio, you are one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“And I’m not even that great.” Rio joked, her voice cracking.</p><p>“I think you’re the best. I mean that Rio.”<br/>Agatha said as she tugged on Rio’s arm. “Come here I want to kiss you.”</p><p>“Yes my love.” Rio said as she leaned down and kissed Agatha softly. Rio’s leg slid between Agatha’s as she scooted closer to Agatha.</p><p>“I wonder if I can share memories…” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Do you want to try?” Rio asked as she moved away. Agatha brought her hand up and pressed against the sigil once more.</p><p>~The soft memory of Wanda sitting in the passenger seat of Agatha’s car. Talking about Rio’s bookstore, mentioning Rio was just her type.</p><p>Then it cut to the first time she met Rio.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books. Your girlfriend went that way.” Rio said in her memory. The memory of Agatha thinking how laughable that sentence was flooded through them both.</p><p>“Not my girlfriend. Just my annoying best friend.” Agatha said in her own memory.~</p><p>Then Agatha pulled her hand away. Rio reached forward and continued the memory by placing her hand on Agatha’s sigil.</p><p>~“Not my girlfriend. Just my annoying best friend.” Was spoken again but this time Rio’s original thoughts paired with it.</p><p>‘How could someone so beautiful be single?’ Rio thought to herself as she watched Agatha walk away. She felt her spellbook being picked up and tucked into Agatha’s arms, her magic happily humming in Agatha’s embrace.</p><p>Rio walked over to Agatha with a smile on her face. “Anything I can help you find?”</p><p>“Not at this moment in time, I’m just soaking up your beautiful store.” Agatha answered her.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be around if you need me.” Rio said before she walked back over to the counter.  Rio watched as the woman and her best friend came over, they seemed to be having a conversation. Before Wanda handed Agatha the books she wanted and then rushed out of the store.</p><p>Then it cut again to the memory of their handshake. The memory of their magic mingling; feeling almost like a call home now.~</p><p>“You really thought I was beautiful the first time I met you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“The most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, I promise.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I honestly think that title goes to you. You are stunning.” Agatha said as she pulled her hand away and soothed it over Rio’s hip.</p><p>“We could argue about that forever.” Rio said with a laugh. Before she continued “But let’s get back to pampering you.” Rio said as she leaned forward and kissed Agatha again before she sat up and kissed down her stomach.</p><p>“Do you know what I’m going to do now?” Rio asked as she spread her legs.</p><p>“Eat me out?” Agatha asked hopefully.</p><p>“Yes, relax my love. Let me take care of you.” Rio said as she kissed Agatha’s thigh. Before she spread her legs and dove in, her tongue found Agatha’s clit and curled around it softly.  Hands wove into Rio’s hair and gripped the soft locks.</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha hissed out as Rio continued to curl her tongue around Agatha’s clit. Rio softly moaned as she tasted Agatha on her tongue.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha breathed out as she rolled her hips begging for more. Rio moaned again as she slid a hand between her own legs and found her clit, swirling her tongue around Agatha’s clit the same way she did with her finger. Rio moaned into Agatha’s pussy as she continued to eat her out.</p><p>“Rio, please.” Agatha begged and Rio started moving her tongue faster. Pressing her tongue hard against Agatha’s clit. “Yes! Right there!” Agatha praised as Rio continued to swirl and flick her clit. Agatha’s second hand shot down to grip Rio’s hair.</p><p>Agatha’s hips rolled as Rio continued to suck and flick on her clit. Agatha felt like she was about to fall over the edge. With another perfect flick of her tongue she came.  “Fuck yes!” Agatha screamed as her orgasm washed over her.  Her hips continued to roll as Rio’s tongue picked up its pace yet again.</p><p>“Shit!” Agatha cursed as she felt herself barrel rolling toward another orgasm. Moans and whimpers spilled from Agatha’s lips as her hands softly flexed in Rio’s hair. ‘Be a good girl and cum for me Agatha.’ Rio thought clearly in her mind.</p><p>“Oh fuck!” Agatha said in a shocked tone as she felt herself cum. Her body curled around Rio’s head as she screamed. She felt herself getting sensitive.</p><p>“Sensitive.” Agatha said with a gasp. Rio pulled her mouth away after a couple more flicks to Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Darn.” Rio said with a smirk before continuing, she started kissing up Agatha’s body. “I guess I’ll have to find other ways to take care of you.”</p><p>“I think I’ve been pampered enough.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I’d beg to differ.” Rio mumbled as she magicked her toy and harness on. She then magicked a pillow under Agatha’s hips and slid between her legs.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha groaned out as Rio massaged her legs softly.</p><p>“Agatha. You said you wanted to be pampered, you wanted to be treated like a pillow princess. Remember?” Rio reminded.</p><p>“I didn’t think it would be so agonizingly sweet also.” Agatha complained softly.</p><p>“Stop. You love it.” Rio teased as she magicked a bottle of lube into her hand and poured some into her free hand and rubbed it over the toy.</p><p>“I really do, I’ve found my match with you.” Agatha praised as Rio slid the toy along her folds.</p><p>“I could say the same about you.” Rio said as she slid the toy into Agatha. Rio settled against Agatha’s hips and moaned loudly as she sunk into her.</p><p>“Is it more intense?” Agatha asked feeling so full and over whelmed, not just by the toy but the sensations they were experiencing.</p><p>“Yes. Like it’s deeply connected to me. Like you are actually pulling on the connection now.” Rio answered. She slowly started thrusting into Agatha, moans and whimpers started to spill from her lips.</p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Agatha my love.” Rio hissed out as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“Goddesses above! You feel divine.” Agatha moaned out as she grappled for Rio to lean down and kiss her. Agatha wove her fingers into Rio’s hair and tugged her down to her mouth so she could make out with Rio as she thrust into her. This kiss was deep, passionate, and languid they took their time exploring each other before pulling away.</p><p>“Do you think you can hold out for me tonight? Do you think you… fuck! Can be a good girl and not cum until I say so?” Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“Depends…” Agatha answered her breathing already labored. Rio looked at her and repositioned herself so she could thrust into Agatha easier.</p><p>“On?” Rio asked.</p><p>“If you can also hold out?” Agatha questioned as she clenched down hard on the toy.</p><p>“Oh fuck!” Rio moaned out, she started thrusting into Agatha without even realizing it. She just felt this deep pull, like the ocean’s waves lapping at the shore, she couldn’t stop herself.</p><p>“I think I can manage it. Now let’s see how many I can get from you tonight my love.”  Rio husked out in a greedy tone her hips picking up their pace as Rio’s hands slid up to her breasts and softly played with her nipples.</p><p>“Un… Fair.” Agatha hissed out as she grappled for Rio’ she found her forearms and gripped them softly as Rio continued to thrust into her. Moans spilled from their lips as Agatha rolled her hips with Rio.</p><p>“I’m so close.” Agatha whimpered out.</p><p>“Already? Come on babe, you can hold out a little longer.” Rio husked out as she slowed down to an agonizing pace.</p><p>“No! Rio please!” Agatha begged and Rio didn’t change her pace, just a slow steady rhythm. Agatha could feel herself growing even more frustrated, her arousal was unsurmountable. She could taste her orgasm but it was so far out of reach.</p><p>“I want to spend all night with you like this. If I get you too sensitive too quick I won’t be able to. So be a good girl and just enjoy what I give you.” Rio praised as she trailed a finger down her sigil on her chest. Agatha’s arousal seemed to almost double in that moment. The ache in her core made her clit throb painfully.</p><p>“Please just one! Rio baby I need to cum!” Agatha begged as she clenched down hard on the toy. She was trying to get anything she could.</p><p>“I could never deny you for long, just know it will be worth it my love.” Rio reassured as she leaned forward and took a nipple in her mouth and swirled her tongue around the nipple. Agatha’s hands found purchase in Rio’s hair once more. This time though Agatha decided to play dirty. If Rio was going to torture her she was going to return the favor.</p><p>“You’ve just made a grave. Ah. Mistake my love.” Agatha whispered her body still rolling with Rio’s hips, she needed to cum and she was going to make Rio regret withholding that from her.  A flat palm slid against the base of Rio’s skull before fingers curled into the hair there and tugged hard.</p><p>A loud moan came from Rio as she sunk her hips deep into Agatha. The toy touching places it hadn’t before. “Oh fuck.” Agatha moaned out as her hips shook. She was trying so hard to not come undone under Rio.</p><p>“That’s a dirty trick.” Rio groaned out as she scooted closer to Agatha before she started thrusting into her faster.</p><p>“Fine, if you want to cum so badly. Then you better hold on.” Rio said as she pulled her hand away. Agatha let her hair go as Rio sat up and slipped her thumb between them. She found Agatha’s clit and circled it.</p><p>“I can’t.. I can’t when.. you.” Agatha tried to get out but she couldn’t find the words. She just wanted Rio to pick up the pace.</p><p>“I want you to cum. I want you to drench these sheets with your arousal. I want you a whimpering mess under me.” Rio said as she picked up an unrelenting pace, hips slam</p><p>“Rio… Please.” Agatha whimpered out, she was so close.</p><p>“Now be a good girl for me Agatha and cum.” Rio demanded. Agatha felt herself tumble over the edge. Her back arched off the bed as she came undone. A loud scream echoing through the room as she came.</p><p>“Goddesses above you are stunning when you cum.” Rio praised as she ran her hands over Agatha’s stomach and sides.  She continued to fuck her through her orgasm. “Good girl, my perfect woman.” Rio praised again this time claiming Agatha as she sunk her hips in deep and stopped moving.</p><p>Agatha’s breath came back to her after she came, her breathing was heavy and she threw an arm over her eyes so she could focus. “You… are… so.. mean…” Agatha said between gasping breaths.</p><p>“I know. But it’s only because you enjoy it.” Rio promised.</p><p>“I don’t know how many times I can do that. I felt like I was dying.” Agatha said with a groan.</p><p>“I have confidence in you my love.” Rio praised.</p><p>“I don’t!” Agatha wined.</p><p>“Remember you can say red light at any time and we can stop.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Yellow light.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“One more and then you can cum whenever you want?” Rio asked.</p><p>“One more.” Agatha said with a sigh, she was enjoying herself.</p><p>“Good, now. Tell me what you want.” Rio requested.</p><p>“No, you’ll do the opposite.” Agatha said with a huff.</p><p>“You are so clever.” Rio said with a laugh as she magicked the toy away.</p><p>“Wait! What are you doing?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Using my fingers on you. I want to make this purely about you.” Rio said softly as she magicked her hands clean and laid down next to Agatha. “Plus I like how much closer I can be to you like this. Like I can press my body against yours and kiss you without worrying about knocking into you.”</p><p>“Can I make one request?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Sure. What would you like?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Once you’re done having your fun with me I want you to sit on my face.”  Agatha requested.</p><p>“I think that can be arranged.” Rio said with a smile as she slid her hand between Agatha’s legs and softly curled a finger around her clit before slipping two fingers into her. A soft moan came from Agatha at the feeling of Rio’s fingers inside of her.</p><p>“So different but still so good.” Agatha said with a sigh as she scooted closer to Rio and wove her fingers into her hair so she could bring her mouth to hers. The kiss was so soft and delicate that even Rio felt tears well up in her eyes. She curled her fingers into Agatha and started thrusting into the woman. Drawing moans from Agatha as she did so. Rio broke the kiss a moment later and started kissing down the side of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha husked out as the woman curled her fingers into her.</p><p>“I like this better anyway, I can just focus on pleasing you.” Rio whispered before softly but down on her collarbone. Her fingers working slowly inside of Agatha, curling and hitting her g-spot softly.</p><p>“Goddesses above!” Agatha moaned out as Rio continued the slow pace. She kissed down her breast before taking a nipple in her mouth. She swirled her tongue around the sensitive bud. Agatha’s hand twitched in Rio’s hair, as a soft sigh fell from her lips.</p><p>‘Tell me when you’re close.’ Rio thought clearly as she continued to use her tongue on Agatha’s nipple. She continued her thrusts and curling her fingers quickly.</p><p>“If you… keep doing that… I’m not going to last.” Agatha groaned out as she rolled her hips.</p><p>‘Try.’ Rio insisted in their minds as she continued to thrust into Agatha. Hips shot off the bed as Agatha’s legs spread begging for more.</p><p>“Rio… baby… please!” Agatha begged she could feel her body starting to shake. Her whole body felt like it was being compressed, like the coil deep in her core was about to snap.</p><p>Rio softly bit down on Agatha’s nipple drawing a muffled scream from Agatha as the woman bit her lip. She softly pulled the nipple up with her teeth before letting go. “Cum for me babe.” Rio requested. Agatha’s hips locked in the air as she came, her body was arching off the bed. Moans and whimpers fell from Agatha’s lips as she fell apart under Rio’s touch.</p><p>She was breathing heavy as Rio removed her fingers from Agatha and settled against her. ‘You make me feel so loved.’ Agatha thought clearly in Rio’s mind making the woman next to her tear up.</p><p>“Good. I’m glad.” Rio said with a bright smile and tear filled eyes.</p><p>“Come sit on my face.” Agatha half demanded.</p><p>“Yes my love.” Rio said with a smile as she climbed up the bed and settled against Agatha’s chest. Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s thighs and pulled her closer.</p><p>“Now this is the dessert I actually wanted earlier.” Agatha whispered before she slid her tongue through Rio’s folds collecting her essence before she found her clit and started circling it.</p><p>“Oh! Agatha…” Rio moaned out, she was so close from all the sensations she experienced through out the night.</p><p>‘You always taste so divine. I could lay here like this forever drinking you in.’ Agatha thought as she continued to curl her tongue around Rio’s clit.</p><p>“You.. can’t.. fuck! Think things like that!” Rio said as she felt herself start to teeter closer to the edge.</p><p>‘Oh but I can! I love how you taste, how you smell, how soft you are. I love how you react when I do this.’ Agatha thought as she curled her tongue around Rio’s clit before flicking it faster.</p><p>“Oh Fuck! Agatha!” Rio screamed out as she felt herself clench down on nothing. Rio’s hands found the headboard as she came. Agatha didn’t stop her tongue or her movements.</p><p>‘Another.’ Agatha demanded in her mind. Agathas tongue set an unrelenting pace as she tried to make Rio cum again. A few more flicks of her tongue and Rio felt all the air leave her lungs as Agatha forced another orgasm from her. Her mouth falling open in a silent scream.</p><p>Agatha felt so greedy in that moment. She just kept her pace hoping Rio would cum again. Rio finally caught her breath and looked down between her legs to see piercing blue eyes looking at her with love, admiration, and determination.  “Fuck.” Rio whispered at the realization that she has put herself in a position where Agatha could hold her in place and ravage her clit with her tongue.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio whispered out she felt so weak already.</p><p>‘Yes my love? My goddess? My divine?’ Agatha praised in her mind as she questioned what Rio needed. She continued to assault her clit with her tongue as she moaned into Rio’s pussy.</p><p>“Stop. Fuck. I need a moment.” Rio begged.</p><p>‘No, you can give me one more.’ Agatha thought as she continued her unrelenting pace. Rio tried her best to not break Agatha’s nose as she bucked her hips against her face. Rio felt herself barrel rolling toward an orgasm. She reached down and placed a hand over Agatha’s as she leaned forward and pressed her head to  her arm resting on the headboard. Agatha sucked hard on Rio’s clit, she felt herself cum a moment later as her body shook.</p><p>Agatha teleported Rio into her arms so she could rest comfortably after that orgasm. Her body was still shaking as she cuddled into Agatha’s arms. “Rest up, once we feel like moving again we can go have some cake and make out on the couch.” Agatha said with a chuckle as she kissed the side of Rio’s head.</p><p>“Sounds perfect. My love. Do you feel throughly pampered?” Rio teased.</p><p>“Yes, and loved.” Agatha said as she tilted Rio’s head up to give her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>~Meanwhile in Death’s Dimension~</p><p>“Did you feel that Darling?” Violet asked as she walked into the house. Her gorgeous blonde wife with striking violet eyes looked up at her from the chair she was sitting in and smiled.</p><p>“Yes, any idea what that was?” Rosaline asked.</p><p>“I think they are surpassing the mortal limits of their connection…” Violet comments.</p><p>“You think their sigils moved?” Rosaline asked.</p><p>“I felt something shift. I can go check on them tomorrow.” Violet said as she looked over at her wife. She could feel the red heart under her clothing crackle with electricity as Rosaline looked at her with lust filled eyes.</p><p>“Wise choice. I haven’t seen you in two days. Bedroom. Now.” Rosaline demanded as she pointed toward their room.</p><p>“Yes my sweet.” Violet said as she magicked her clothes away and made her way into the bedroom with her wife hot on her heels.</p>

<p>~Sunday morning, County Jail~</p><p>“Evanora Harkness your lawyer is here to see you.” A man said from outside the jail cell. Evanora grumbled as she sat up, she felt even weaker than she did the day her powers were taken. She hobbled over to the door and stuck her hands through the gap in the door and allowed the man to cuff her before he opened her cell. She slowly made her way to the meeting area and was sat in a booth and grabbed a phone so she could talk to the man.</p><p>“You know, you should’ve let sleeping dogs lie.” An older man said as he picked up the phone and spoke to her.</p><p>“Shut up Bob. She’s a monster and you know it! I just wanted the fucking hex’s to stop!” Evanora whisper yelled into the phone.</p><p>“Yeah and look where it got you. You barely pass for human now. What happened. You look horrible.” He said into the phone as he looked at the gray haired woman.</p><p>“No magic, no glamor. This is what I look like jackass.” Evanora scolds.</p><p>“Got it, I recommend just taking a plea deal. At most you’ll get 6 years. If you want to fight this… which I don’t recommend. You could end up here way longer.” He said in a tone that told Evanora he wasn’t joking.</p><p>“And let that little bitch have the last laugh? Hell no, we are fighting this! I don’t care what it takes we are showing the world how much of a monster she is!” Evanora said in a vile tone.</p><p>“Alright. Well the judge has requested memory sharing spells conducted by a third party tomorrow. Do you consent?” He asked as he pulled paperwork out.</p><p>“Yes.” Evanora said with a wave of her hand, smug that her memories would prove her daughter was a monster.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll let them know in the morning. Anything you’d like to request?” He asked the woman behind the glass.</p><p>“No. I don’t care about this at all. I just want to go home.”</p><p>“I’ll see what I can do. Have a lovely day Evanora.” The man said as he hung up the phone. Evanora grumbled again as he got up and walked away. Evanora didn’t realize that Death was watching her, waiting for her to make the same mistake she made once already, again and again.</p><p>~Agatha’s House~</p><p>Agatha was in her kitchen cooking breakfast for her and Rio. A bright smile on her face as she wore a loose fitting v-neck tee shirt that left the sigil exposed. She had on a pair of cute shorts and was content as she cooked breakfast.</p><p>Rio was wearing a hoodie that looked like it had swallowed her whole and a pair of fuzzy socks as she sat on the countertop watching Agatha. When Agatha’s phone pinged on the countertop.</p><p>“Read that for me babe, the code is 8395.” Agatha said without even blinking. Rio grabbed the phone and read the text.</p><p>Wanda 8:05 a.m. Can I bring Lily to breakfast?</p><p>“Wanda wants to bring Lily to breakfast.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Let her. I don’t care I can make more pancakes and eggs.” Agatha said with a shrug.</p><p>“I think it’s hilarious that they are still technically on their first date.” Rio said with a chuckle as she sent a text.</p><p>Agatha 8:07 a.m: sure, come on over!</p><p>“We should probably change…” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Nah, I think you look great like this. Plus I love seeing this.” Rio said as she hopped off the counter and pressed a soft kiss to the green heart sigil on Agatha’s chest. ‘Mine’ resounded possessively through Agatha’s mind sending a shiver down her spine.</p><p>“Behave. Go put shorts on at least.” Agatha said with a huff.</p><p>“Make me.” Rio teased as the front door opened. Agatha waved her hand and suddenly she was wearing a pair of shorts.</p><p>“Mean.” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“We’re here! Hopefully you two are dressed.” Wanda said as she walked toward the kitchen wearing a pair of sweatpants and a tank top. Lily followed behind wearing a one of Wanda’s hoodies and a pair of basketball shorts.</p><p>“Good morning to you too Wanda.” Agatha said as she shook her head at her best friend before she looked at Wanda who had several hickies dotting her collarbones and shoulders. “Wow. Impressive Lily. I’ve never seen her so thoroughly marked.”</p><p>“What?” Wanda asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Ohhhh…. Never mind. You totally shouldn’t go to the bathroom and look at yourself… No, not at all.” Agatha said sarcastically before going back to cooking. Wanda walked away a moment later leaving Lily alone with Rio and Agatha. She hadn’t started making eggs yet thankfully. So she added four more to the bowl and started cooking pancakes for them while she waited for Wanda to come back.</p><p>“I didn’t think to tell her…” Lily said in a guilty tone.</p><p>“It’s okay. This is a judgement free zone when it comes to possessive marking.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Holy shit, I have no idea how many are actually on me but it’s more than what’s visible.” Wanda said as she walked back into the kitchen wearing a Harvard Law hoodie.</p><p>“Really?!? My favorite hoodie?” Agatha asked in an irritated tone as she flipped a couple pancakes.</p><p>“It’s the softest one! Well second softest one. Rio stole the softest one already.” Wanda said with a huff. Agatha snapped her fingers and Wanda was wearing her own hoodie, out of her closet.</p><p>“Rude!” Wanda scolded.</p><p>“Impressive!” Lily complimented as she watched Agatha continue to cook. “I’d love to pick your brain about that particular spell later. If you don’t mind.”</p><p>“Aren’t you a potions witch?” Agatha asked as she continued to cook.</p><p>“I am. But I also like trying different spells.” Lily answered.</p><p>“It’s a simple manifestation spell. But it’s easy to mess up, in the sense that whoever you are dressing might end up naked of you desire that more.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Is that why… never mind.” Rio started to ask before she finished the thought in her mind ‘is that why you had me practice taking clothing off you?’</p><p>‘Yes.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“No Rio, please finish that sentence.” Wanda requested, with a shit eating grin on her face.</p><p>“Nah, I already know the answer to what I was going to ask. Now help me set up the table that we never use.” Rio said as she opened the silverware drawer and grabbed utensils for all of them.</p><p>“Ugh! You two are no fun.” Wanda complained as she got in the cupboard and grabbed four coffee cups and headed over to the table. Rio set the silverware at the table and then headed back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Who wants coffee?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Me.” All three women answered in unison. Agatha waved her hand again and a bag of coffee floated down from the cupboard along with a coffee filter and the scoop. Agatha’s magic made the coffee as she continued to make pancakes.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later the eggs, bacon, and pancakes were made and plated up. Each woman got exactly how much food they wanted and then made their way over to the table. Agatha set her plate down and walked back into the kitchen and grabbed the coffee pot, creamer, simple syrup and headed back into the dining room. All the women were sitting down waiting for Agatha.</p><p>“Eat! I’ll pour the coffee.” Agatha instructed as she set the creamer and simple syrup down. She grabbed each cup and filled them leaving room for cream and sugar before pouring herself a cup.</p><p>“Thanks Aggie!” Wanda said excitedly as she poured simple syrup into her cup.</p><p>“Only she gets to call me that for the record.” Agatha clarified to Lily.</p><p>“Well her and Pietro.” Rio corrected.</p><p>“Thats okay. I’ll stick to Agatha.” Lily said honestly. They started eating their breakfast in relative silence. Before Lily spoke up again. “So… Wanda’s been very vague about how long you two have been together.”</p><p>“Oof, that’s a loaded question. Uh Wands, you serious about this girl? Your answer determines ours.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I haven’t asked her to be my girlfriend or anything but I’d like to give us a shot.” Wanda answered honestly.</p><p>“Well we don’t want to scare her off.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“If you do that’s on her. You witches are stuck with me.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“Okay you guys are all being very vague and my tism is giving me anxiety. I don’t care, just kindly tell me please.” Lily asked.</p><p>“We officially started dating Monday.” Agatha said with a shrug as she took a sip of coffee.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.” Lily said incredulously.</p><p>“Goddesses, this week has been so long!” Wanda said as she rubbed her face with both hands.</p><p>“I feel like I missed so much.” Lily said in a confused tone.</p><p>“To summarize in the simplest way possible. They are each others magical soulmates.” Wanda explained before stuffing a bite of pancake into her mouth.</p><p>“Okay. That just leads to more questions…”</p><p>“We have a deep magical connection, our magic is intertwined now. Rio is a green witch and I am a spirit witch. But because our magic is connected… I can use her powers and she can use mine.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Wait…. You have double powers?” Lily asked in an excited tone.</p><p>“Uh… well no. It’s far more complicated than that honestly because I’m a spirit witch…” Agatha explained before taking a bite of her own food.</p><p>“How so?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Because Spirit witches inherit their own powers and the magic they siphoned. So Agatha has an affinity for illusion, potions, kitchen, green, divinity, protections, and her own spirit magic.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“That I will explain later. Too much trauma before tomorrow. Let’s not trigger a panic attack.” Wanda explained as she patted Lily softly on the hand.</p><p>“I’m fine. She’s officially powerless. My mother and her coven tried to execute me at the age of 16. I siphoned the magic of an entire coven, the only reason they are still alive is because Wanda and Pietro stopped the siphoning.” Agatha explained simply. Rio reached over and placed her hand on Agatha’s.</p><p>“The whole coven?! Wanda! You said it was just her mother…” Lily said remembering their conversation Friday night.</p><p>“To be fair… I was glossing over the details… and you don’t know the full story still. We are just giving you the highlights.” Wanda clarified.</p><p>“So… that’s why you said they were “it” for each other. Makes sense.” Lily said before she went back to eating.</p><p>“I want to ask questions right now but I don’t want to confuse Lily anymore.” Wanda said as she looked at the heart sigil on Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Couldn’t give you any if I wanted to.” Rio said as she took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“Oh bullshit!” Wanda said in a raised tone, not exactly yelling but not quiet either.</p><p>“Really, I couldn’t. I still don’t know the extent of it yet.” Rio said honestly, then the world paused around them. Lily and Wanda  frozen in their seats.</p><p>“Violet, nice of you to stop by.” Agatha said as she took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“You two just keep surprising me!” Violet said excitedly as she clapped her hands. She was sitting on the countertop wearing an old tank top and jeans. She looked like a normal human. Minus the sigils and crown.</p><p>“So… you told us last night we wouldn’t have anything else pop up until we passed away… and that was obviously not true…” Rio said collecting her thoughts.</p><p>“Well until last night it was the truth…” Violet trailed off looking the sigil on Agatha’s chest. “Today you two broke the status quo, those weren’t supposed to show up until Rio took her place as death. It’s essentially the eternal vow. You two are so deeply connected now that nothing in the universe will ever be able to keep you apart. Congratulations to the literal meaning of ‘for better or worse.’ Every time you’re pissed at each other and try to leave you’ll be dropped back into each other’s laps no matter how hard you try.”</p><p>“I need a better explanation than that.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“How about a real life example.” Violet asked as she got off the countertop and walked over to Rio.</p><p>“How are you going to give us a real life example?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Well that’s for Agatha to find out. Hold still dear, the first time we do this you might get nauseous.” Violet said as she placed her hand on Rio’s shoulder and then they were both gone. Panic settled in Agatha’s chest a moment later and she reached out for Rio unintentionally. A moment later Rio was sitting in her lap. Arms wrapped around her shoulders.</p><p>“That’s what I mean.” Violet said with a smile as she reappeared a moment later.</p><p>“We could teleport to each other with this sigil…” Rio said as she placed her hand on the sigil on her chest.</p><p>“Yes, in great distress that was always a thing. I took you to my home, in another dimension. She pulled you back faster than even I expected. I was hoping to introduce you to my wife.” Violet said with a smile.</p><p>“How powerful are we?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Even I don’t have the answer to that question yet. I’ll have to talk to Life, see what she has to say.” Violet answered the girls.</p><p>“Who is life?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Gaia, the goddess. She’s a delight at dinner parties. I’ll talk to her sometime today and get a few things sorted and pop back in.” Violet explained before she looked directly at Rio. “I am so proud of you, you are going to be great once you take my place. You both will. Now you have breakfast to get back to, and I have bodies to collect. Have a good day!” Violet said with a smile before she disappeared, leaving Rio still sitting in Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Rude!” Rio yelled into the ether.</p><p>“What just happened?!?” Lily asked in a confused tone as she looked around the room.</p><p>‘I should’ve asked her if they were going to make it.’ Rio thought as she got off Agatha’s lap and went back to her seat.</p><p>‘Nothing we can do about that now. Let’s just be honest.‘ Agatha thought back.</p><p>“Sorry Wanda. If we ruin this for you.” Agatha said with a sigh. “Lily, Rio’s family is the original green witch bloodline.”</p><p>“The original green witch was the first embodiment of death. When I die, a long time from now, I will take my great great grandmothers place as death so she can retire.” Rio explained as the sigil on Agatha’s chest started to appear for Lily, the rings on their fingers glowing brightly as well.</p><p>“These markings and rings are our magical connection. We have had zero control over them popping up over the last few days. I’m Rio’s and she is mine. Our magic has decided that.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Fascinating. How did you two discover this?” Lily asked.</p><p>“We felt these tingles when we touched for the first time. Our magic mingling together and unifying.” Agatha said with a soft smile as she looked over at Rio.</p><p>“My destiny as death had a lot to do with this. But, the current standing entity of death did say it can happen to normal witches like you two. She just didn’t clarify on how…” Rio explained.</p><p>“Wait… we could have magical soulmates?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Has your magic interacted with each other yet?” Agatha asked. She knew it was a long shot but it was worth one.</p><p>“No, and I’m afraid to try right now.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Oh come on! What’s the worst that could happen? You’re a chaos witch! Embrace it!” Lily said as she held a hand out crackling with pink magic. Wanda sighed and reached out with her red magic. Before they even touched sparks reached out and arched to their hands.</p><p>“Woah!” Wanda said as she reached out and touched Lily’s hand. A rush of magical energy flooded through both women as they felt a connection snap into place.</p><p>“Fascinating…”</p><p>“Congratulations. You’re officially stuck with us Lily.” Rio said with a chuckle as she watched the two women.</p><p>“Good luck. I recommend brewing some energy potions.” Agatha said as she went back to eating her food before she realized it had gone cold. With a wave of her hand the food was warm again. “Eat before it gets cold again.”</p><p>“I… uh… we…” Wanda said as she kept her eyes locked on Lily. Agatha kicked Wanda under the table. “Hey!” Wanda yelled.</p><p>“Focus, you can be horny later.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Rude. How did you know.” Wanda said with a glare.</p><p>“Because I did this already. I’ve experienced this already. You are in for a fun week, just cool your jets and eat your breakfast. You two can go do whatever you want after you eat.”<br/>“Was it this strong for you the first time?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Yes and no. Wait until you find the thread connecting your magic and give it a little tug. Someone wasn’t very delicate about it and had me reeling in the bookstore on our first date. I had to just be horny the whole day. You can make it through breakfast.” Agatha explained to her best friend. Who looked over at Rio.</p><p>“What, I never said I was delicate about things!” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>“You can be, but that was just mean.” Agatha said with a sigh as she started eating again. Lily was staring intensely at Wanda.</p><p>“I think I’ve more than made up for it.” Rio said with a smile and a shake of her head.</p><p>“You have. Now, you two.” Agatha said to Rio before she turned to look at her bestfriend and Lily.</p><p>“Huh? Yeah! What’s up?” Wanda said trying to focus on anything but Lily.</p><p>“Absolutely hopeless.” Agatha said to herself before she spoke again. “Eat. You’ll need your energy. Are you taking tomorrow off for the hearing Wanda?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I am. I’ll be there. Sorry. I feel all fuzzy and weird.” Wanda said as she shook her head.</p><p>“You’ll get used to it. It’s not so bad after you have sex for the first time.” Rio said bluntly.</p><p>“We’ve already had sex…” Lily said as she tried to shake her own head so she could clear the arousal clouding her thoughts.</p><p>“Oh, this will be different though. Promise.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Should we guide them?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Nah let them have fun with it.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Wait! I have questions…” Lily said honestly.</p><p>“Eat, then when you are done we will talk more.” Agatha said as she started eating again. The women settled into a silence as they finished their breakfast then cleaned the kitchen together.</p><p>“Let’s head to the living room and talk.” Agatha said as they finished taking care of everything. Wanda and Lily followed Agatha and Rio to the living room. Wanda and Lily sat down next to each other on the couch and Agatha took Rio into her arms on the other side of the couch.</p><p>“Ask your questions Lily.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Well for starters… you said pulling on a  thread?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Close your eyes and focus on Wanda’s magic. Do you see a red thread connecting hers to yours?” Rio asked. Lily closed her eyes and focused, she could see a faint line connecting them.</p><p>“Yes? It’s very faint.”</p><p>“That’s because you two haven’t built a deep connection yet. Try and grasp it and I cannot emphasize this enough LIGHTLY pull on it.” Rio told the woman.</p><p>“Yeah. I don’t want to hear the noises Wanda makes in the bedroom please and thank you.” Agatha said with a blanch.</p><p>“Okay, no promises.” Lily said as she reached out in her mind at gently tugged on it. Wanda seemed to twitch for half a second before her eyes snapped open.</p><p>“Nope, nope we are not doing this here. We are leaving now.” Wanda said as she stood up and grabbed Lily’s hand pulling her up from the couch. She dragged Lily out the door so fast that neither women had a chance to even say goodbye to the couple.  Agatha burst out laughing a moment later, as she watched her best friend drag Lily past her front window and flip her off in the process.</p><p>“I guess they will be busy the rest of the day.” Rio said as she watched the woman drag the poor blonde behind her.</p><p>“There are worse ways to spend a Sunday.” Agatha said as she found their connection and tugged on it softly.</p><p>“Oh really? You didn’t get enough last night.” Rio said as she felt the hint of arousal.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll ever get enough of you.” Agatha said as she kissed Rio’s neck softly.</p><p>“You are insatiable.” Rio said with a softly laugh as she leaned her head to the side to give Agatha better access.</p><p>“I know, but you love it.” Agatha whispered into her ear.</p><p>“I really do.” Rio whispered back sensually as Agatha continued to kiss up her neck.</p><p>~Meanwhile at Stark Tower, in the Penthouse Suite~</p><p>Peppers phone rang loudly through her personal home office. She looked up from her file she was working on and picked up the phone. “Pepper Potts. How did you get this number?”</p><p>“Hello, my name is Lilia Calderu I am the best divination witch in the United States, I’m calling to offer my services tomorrow for the Harkness hearing.”</p><p>“I… uh. Excuse me?” Pepper asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“I can see the future dear. But I can also look into the past. I have the memory sharing spell already set up. I have called the judge and spoken to him. I just wanted to greenlight this with you as well because you will be the one calling me forward to do this spell.” Lilia explained as she locked her front door and headed toward the car.</p><p>“While I understand why I would be, I don’t understand how you knew I would need you. Or a divination witch in general.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“Oh that’s simple. I fucking hate Evanora Harkness. But my spells are the best as showing the truth, and nothing but. I just have been waiting for her to fall from grace for over a hundred years. So I keep tabs on my enemies.” Lilia said as she started the car and pulled out of the driveway.</p><p>“Tomorrow, 9:30 a.m. at.” Pepper started to say.</p><p>“Yes Pepper, I know where I’m going. Don’t worry too much. This can go one of two ways and I have a feeling it’s going to go exactly the way I want.” Lilia said with a smile.</p><p>“How would that be?” Pepper pried.</p><p>“Now if I told you, you wouldn’t believe me. And it could ruin our odds of having the most favorable outcome. You unfortunately are just going to have to trust me.” Lilia told Pepper.</p><p>“This week has been a whole series of things ‘I wouldn’t believe.’ But I’ll trust you until you give me a reason not to.” Pepper said with a sigh.</p><p>“I’ll throw this in for free. If you and Tony want a girl, try every day in your ovulation cycle. I won’t spoil anything but that’s the best I can give you. I cannot wait to formally meet you tomorrow. Have a wonderful night Pepper.” Lilia said into the phone and waited.</p><p>“Uh.. thank you? I will meet you tomorrow, have a wonderful night.” Pepper said in a confused tone before she hung up the phone.</p><p>“Jarvis.” Pepper said into the room.</p><p>“Yes Mrs.Potts?”</p><p>“Everything about Lilia Calderu you can find this instant.” Pepper requested.</p><p>“Searching. Lilia Calderu, she is a 450 year old diviner. She has accurately predicted every disease and pestilence that has plagued the earth since she was 16. Lost her entire coven to the Spanish flu and now works with the CDC to contain and prevent  future disease. She had prevented infinite disease outbreaks. In her spare time she makes memory recall spells for Alzheimer’s patients, and the spell is currently in long term testing on witches who have been hexed with memory loss spells. Most human patients find their memories improve after the first spell.” Jarvis said over the speaker.</p><p>“Anything else you might find noteworthy?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“She is Rio Vidal’s mother’s best friend. But based off call logs neither woman has spoken to each other since Wednesday. So this seems prompted by Ms. Calderu.”</p><p>“Thank you Jarvis. Check on Tony for me. I’d like to talk to him if he’s not too busy.” Pepper said as she leaned back in her chair and thought pensively. “Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day.”</p><p>~Back at Agatha’s~</p><p>“I should probably. Ah. Review the. Fuck Rio. The proposal from Tony.” Agatha said as Rio  had broken their kiss and made her way down Agatha’s neck down to her chest before she swirled her tongue around the heart there.</p><p>“Probably…. But I can think of better things…” Rio said in a lust filled fine.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha groaned out as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair and pulled her mouth away from her chest.</p><p>“What? You started it!” Rio complained as Agatha pulled her away.</p><p>“Give me an hour to review it, then we can go to the botanical gardens or make out on the couch some more.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Fine. I should also pop into my place and water my peace lily…” Rio said trailing off realizing that today was Sunday.</p><p>“Oh yes. The drama queen. She must feel very neglected now that I’m here taking up all your time.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Careful I’ll share the memory of it whining!” Rio joked as she got up off the couch and headed toward the bedroom door and opened it before walking through a swirling green portal. Agatha chuckled at Rio before she got up and went to her office on the opposite side of the living room. She made sure to leave the door open so Rio could find her.</p><p>“At least moving will be kind of easy… but I don’t want her to have to commute 30 minutes everyday to work.” Agatha said to herself as she opened her laptop and pulled up the email. She started reviewing it and checking everything again.  The longer she read it the more laughable the contract became. It was so full of loopholes it wasn’t even funny. Literally every paragraph basically gave Agatha a chance to get Rio out of this contract at any moment.</p><p>“Pepper you know better than to leave this many loop holes… Rio could cancel this contract ten minutes after she started it if she wanted. Fuck I feel loved.” Agatha said with a smile on her face. She looked at the time and realized that she had been reading the contract for 45 minutes already.</p><p>“Why do you feel loved?” Rio asked from the living room.</p><p>“Because Pepper is ridiculous but I know she did this because she loves me and wants me happy.” Agatha said honestly as Rio walked into the room.</p><p>“So she left herself vulnerable?” Rio asked.</p><p>“This is lawyer speak for ‘this is your wedding gift but not really because when you get married we are spoiling the fuck out of you.’ She basically is giving you this contract with the ability to back out at any point. No money owed, no dues paid nothing. Just take this money for helping educate young minds.”</p><p>“What money? I thought I was just going to be the school and library systems new distributor essentially. Like they only buy books from me.” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yeah there’s also the stipulation that you hire two salary workers and the funds that go along with them. Tony and Pepper are basically writing you a check for $100,000 so you can pay two people $50,000 to work for you. Every year they stay on your staff they will be paid that amount by Stark industries until you can afford to pay them that rate on your own.” Agatha explained to Rio who just stood there with her mouth agape.</p><p>“No. No way? What?!?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“It’s there in black and white. Just need’s your signature babe. It’s one hundred percent safe.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Print it off and I’ll sign it?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Nah, we do e-signatures let me grab my iPad.” Agatha said as she leaned over and grabbed her iPad from the drawer and pulled open the document. She handed Rio her pencil and let her sign. Then signed next to her signature and sent it off to Pepper.</p><p>“Now you have me all to yourself. Do you want to go to the botanical gardens with your sketchbook seeing as it’s only noon? That will give you 7 hours in there to have fun drawing and observing plants.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Please? That sounds amazing.”</p><p>“Well let’s get dressed and go!” Agatha said with a smile on her face as she stood up from her chair. Rio followed her out the door with a smile on her face as they made their way toward the bedroom. Today was going to be a good day.</p>

<p>The next morning Agatha and Rio got up and got dressed for court that day. Agatha put on her favorite deep purple suit that made her feel the most confident, she paired it with a light purple button up and black tie. Rio on the other hand let Agatha decide her outfit.</p><p>“What am I wearing?” Rio asked as she dried her hair. With a wave of her hand Rio was dressed in a formal black suit, deep emerald green button up and Agatha’s green tie with gold monstera leafs she was wearing last week. Rio’s hair was slicked back into a neat bun.</p><p>“Perfect, just perfect. I may have done too well though… you look good enough to eat.” Agatha said in a lust filled tone.</p><p>“No, no, no. Behave. We have to go to this. Plus Wanda will be here any second begging for food.” Rio said backing up slightly. Agatha sighed loudly before she walked out of the bedroom and toward the kitchen.</p><p>“I hate my mother so fucking much.” Agatha grumbled under her breath as she threw on an apron; and started to make breakfast for the four. She assumed Lily would be joining them as well.</p><p>“I’m inclined to agree but at least I’ll be there for you.” Rio reassured as she hopped up on the counter to watch Agatha cook.</p><p>“You’ll be behind me and Pepper. Along with Wanda. But I appreciate you coming.” Agatha said as she started making waffle batter.</p><p>“If you feel stressed or worried just talk to me in your mind I’ll be there. You’ve got me.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Thank you babe. I appreciate it. You being there would’ve been more than enough. I’m glad I have this connection with you as well.” Agatha said as she walked over to Rio before she gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>The front door swung open a moment later.<br/>“Good morning!” Wanda said cheerfully as she walked into the kitchen, Lily following behind her looking like a zombie.</p><p>“Wanda, you gotta make sure you let her sleep. Not all of us run on 3 hours of sleep and chaos.” Agatha said as she walked over to Lily and soothed her hands over the woman’s face, chanting an incantation in the process. Lily’s eye bags and sleepy demeanor seemed to almost completely vanish as soon as Agatha let her go. Lily walked over to the empty barstool next to Wanda and sat down to wait.</p><p>“There, that should help some. Sorry my best friend doesn’t know what rest is. Maybe you’ll be able to teach her.” Agatha said with a smile as she walked back over to the waffle maker.</p><p>“Wow! That is an amazing spell, what is it?” Lily asked curiously.</p><p>“Just an energy boost, something small that will get you through the day. You have an interview at 4 don’t you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes, with Mr.Stark.” Lily said cheerfully.</p><p>“Good you’ll need that spell and some coffee. I swear if Tony had been born to magical parents he would’ve also been a chaos witch.” Agatha joked as she waved her hand and the coffee maker started setting itself up for a large batch of coffee.</p><p>“Thank you Agatha. I appreciate it.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“What can’t you do, my love?” Rio asked with a smile, admiring Agatha’s ability.</p><p>“Lots of things but that doesn’t stop me from trying to do new things. The first step to being good at something is being really fucking bad at it.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah, like you’re cooking when we got our first apartment.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“It was still better than yours is now.” Agatha jabbed back.</p><p>“Hey! You learned how to cook, I learned how to do other important things…” Wanda said sadly.</p><p>“Like?” Rio teased.</p><p>“I’m not saying, you guys are being mean.” Wanda said with a playful huff. She was trying to avoid the real answer, but Agatha instantly knew.</p><p>‘Keeping panic attacks at bay, keeping me from ending up in a psyche ward.’ Agatha told Rio in her mind.</p><p>“You are a good friend, stop sulking. I just like teasing you.” Agatha told Wanda before she continued. “But seriously… Lily. Energy potions. Lots of them.”</p><p>“Wayyy ahead of you. I ordered ingredients on my phone while you were talking. I just have to stop at Kale Cosmetics and Sundries sometime today to pick them up.” Lily said with a sigh.</p><p>“Oh! Shit! Have you spoken to Jen and Alice this week?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No… probably should but you know how Alice gets…” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“After the hearing, but you should text her and let her know your girlfriend? Girlfriend. Is coming in and picking stuff up.” Agatha told them.</p><p>“Wait… your friends with Jennifer Kale?” Lily asked.</p><p>“I also would like clarification here…” Rio piped up.</p><p>“Jennifer and her girlfriend Alice are our friends yes.” Wanda clarified.</p><p>“Small world.” Rio said with an amazed yet amused tone.</p><p>“Where ever you are, a coven there shall be.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“God, I hate that fucking rule.” Wanda grumbled.</p><p>“Oh stop it’s a good universal truth to know.”</p><p>“Yeah but why does it always have to sound so snarky?!? Like you’re not going to find a coven in the middle of the forest.<br/>Right?” Wanda pondered.</p><p>“Actually….” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“Green witches and their fucking forest living.” Wanda complained again.</p><p>“Hey my family’s cabin is quite nice thank you very much.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“I don’t doubt that. I’m sorry I guess I’m just cranky because I have to deal with Evanora today.” Wanda said in a grouchy tone. Lily walked over and kissed Wanda softly on the cheek.</p><p>“It’s okay. You’re allowed to be a lil grumpy. But look at Agatha, she doesn’t seem stressed at all.”</p><p>“That’s because the bitch is powerless now.” Agatha said happily.</p><p>“Have we thought about the coven showing up?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I haven’t, but I have wards up with the judges permission.” Agatha explained as she finished playing up the waffles and eggs. She pulled a bowl of fruit out of the fridge and set it on the counter.</p><p>“If any of them socialize with her anymore.” Wanda clarified as she watched Agatha use her magic to get everything to the table and then grab the pot of coffee off the warmer.</p><p>“Grab the creamer and simple syrup please Rio.” Agatha requested as she shooed Wanda and Lily to the table.</p><p>“Of course my love.” Rio said with a smile as she jumped off the counter and got in the fridge to get what Agatha requested. She followed her over to the table along with the other two women. They all sat down and ate  much faster today, knowing they had to be out the door by 8:45 a.m.</p><p>“You are a really good cook Agatha.” Lily complimented as she finished her last bite of waffle.</p><p>“I know I hit the jackpot when I met her didn’t I?” Rio told Lily but she was totally flirting with Agatha under the ruse of bragging.</p><p>“Honestly, yes. I’m just stuck with her hot bestfriend.” Lily joked.</p><p>“Thank you, I appreciate the compliment.” Agatha said with a smile as she stood up and started clearing the table. She cleaned the plates off and dumped them in the sink.</p><p>“Wait was that a backhanded compliment?” Wanda asked with a scoff as she stood up with her coffee cup and grabbed her own plate.</p><p>“Kind of? Unintentionally. Sorry.” Lily said apologetically as she picked up her plate and cup and followed Wanda into the kitchen. Rio picked up the rest of the table and followed suit, all of the women filtering in and cleaning up.</p><p>“Don’t apologize to her Lily, she likes being bullied by us.” Agatha said with a chuckle as she waved her hand and cleaned the kitchen instantly. Purple magic sparking around the kitchen.</p><p>“I never said that!” Wanda said defensively as she stood up.</p><p>“Are you wearing that today?” Agatha asked as she looked at Wanda’s outfit. She was wearing her slacks and a loose button up.</p><p>“Yes?” Wanda asked the question coming out as a high pitched squeak.</p><p>“No.” Agatha said as she waved her hand and changed her outfit into a deep burgundy suit with black embellishments, a white button up and a slick black satin tie. Wanda’s hair was braided loosely down her back. “Much better.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“I… um… wow.” Lily said appreciatively.</p><p>“Wanna try that again with actual words Lily?” Rio asked as she ushered all the women toward the front door.</p><p>“No, I’m done embarrassing myself.” Lily said with a blush.</p><p>“Suit yourself.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Lame pun babe.” Agatha said with an eye roll, then she took a deep breath and said. “Let’s get on the road. Today’s going to be a shitshow.”</p><p>Lily and Wanda hopped in Wanda’s car and drove off. Agatha and Rio got in Agatha’s car and made their way to the court house. Twenty minutes into the drive Rio pulled her phone out to see a text.</p><p>Aunt Lilia 8:30 a.m: I will be there today as a the memory spell administer. Do not acknowledge me. Love you.</p><p>“Huh…” Rio said aloud.</p><p>“Huh what babe?” Agatha asked as she pulled into the courthouse parking lot.</p><p>“Lilia is going to be administering the memory sharing spell. She doesn’t want me to acknowledge her, which I will respect.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Interesting, let’s go I have to meet with Pepper.” Agatha told Rio as she unbuckled and turned off the car.</p><p>“Okay. But first. One kiss, just to settle the nerves?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I can agree to those terms.” Agatha said as she turned and gave Rio a soft kiss on the lips before pulling away and getting out of the car. Rio sighed sadly and got out of the car, she quickly made her way around the car and to Agatha who was waiting for her. She took Agatha’s left hand and brought it to her lips. This time pouring as much love and care into the soft kiss against the ring.</p><p>“I don’t want to cry right now Rio.” Agatha said softly before she tried to let Rio’s hand go. Rio let her hand drop back to her side but kept holding it. They walked up the stairs quietly for a moment before Rio spoke up.</p><p>“Sorry. Not the intended goal. I just.. I want you to know you are cared for, desired, and frankly needed by me. I don’t know how I’d live without you now.” Rio said honestly which caused Agatha to laugh.</p><p>“I guess it’s a good thing you are stuck with me then isn’t it?” Agatha teased as she opened the door to the courthouse, Rio felt the wards on the courthouse bend and shape around her.</p><p>“Sorry, they are a bit heavy but it’s for a good reason.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“It’s not that. It’s just very impressive. Most people can’t keep a spell like that running, let alone multiple.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“This one is old. Honestly it’s been here twelve years? I don’t know for sure. I just know that I put a lot of energy into it in the beginning and now it’s self sustaining. Come on, Pepper’s waiting.” Agatha said with a smile. They made their way into the court room and Agatha guided Rio over to her seat before she went to speak privately with Pepper.</p><p>“Good morning, I hope you are ready for a long day.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“As I can be, but you, Wanda and Rio will be here for me.” Agatha said with a strange tone.</p><p>“I promise, she can’t hurt you.” Pepper reassured.</p><p>“Wanda asked if we were worried about her coven showing up. I strengthened the wards on the door as we walked through them.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Way ahead of you. Any magical user here in support of Evanora Harkness has to have on magic suppression gauntlets or sit outside until the hearing is over.” Pepper explained. “Tony was irritated she actually made it into the building so he made contingency plans. Stephen Strange is also here sitting in the very back.” Pepper reassured.</p><p>“That makes me feel better. Thank you.” Agatha said with a sigh as she sat down.</p><p>“You gunna be okay? I did some research on our consultant, she’s the best memory recall  spell caster that exists currently.” Pepper asked before explaining.</p><p>“I’ll be just fine. I promise.” Agatha reassured. She seen a blur of red hair and burgundy zip into the court room out of the corner of her eye, before settling next to Rio.  Five minutes later Evanora Harkness was guided into the room.</p><p>‘Goddesses she looks like shit.’ Agatha thought clearly in her mind projecting it to Rio.</p><p>‘Yes, she does. I assume that’s what happens when you suddenly lose all your magic.’ Rio answered before the bailiff came out and spoke.</p><p>“Please rise for Judge Heart.” The man’s voice booming through the courtroom. Everyone stood and waited for him to enter the room. He walked in and settled at his podium and banged his gavel as he sat.</p><p>“Be seated. Today we are having the formal hearing on the Harkness Vs. Harkness case. I will hear Evanora’s side first. Please have your lawyer come to the stand and present your evidence.”</p><p>“Thank you Judge Heart. Today I present to you a mother who has tried over and over again to get her daughter to stop tormenting her. My client claims her daughter is a spirit witch and we all know what spirit witches are, they steal peoples powers. That’s all they are good at. All my client wanted was for Wanda Maximoff’s hexes to stop. She had no other way of contacting Agatha Harkness so she found another way.” Evanora’s lawyer explained.</p><p>“What proof do you have that spirit witches steal people’s power? Do you have documentation of this? Or is it just word of mouth?” Judge Heart asked.</p><p>“It’s common knowledge at this point.” The man said with a shrug.</p><p>“Would your client be willing to take a plea deal if Wanda Maximoff was to stop hexing her?”</p><p>“No!” Evanora spoke up in anger. A loud bang resounded through the courtroom.</p><p>“I was not speaking to you Evanora Harkness! Do not speak unless spoken to, or I’ll add contempt in court to your charges!” Judge heart said in a booming tone before turning his eyes back on her lawyer. “Have you prepared anything else in defense of Evanora Harkness?”</p><p>“Just proof of the twenty plus hexes Wanda Maximoff has on my client.”</p><p>“Paper document? If so hand it to the reporter.” The judge told the lawyer. He walked over to his briefcase and heaved a couple papers before he walked over to the reporter.  “Please read the document for us.” He requested.</p><p>“All hexes in place as of last week. Numbers 1-6 are glamor malfunction hex’s,  7-13 are bad luck hex’s, 14-20 are binding spells. 21 is new. Unknown origin, unknown type.” The court reporter spoke out.</p><p>“Would you like to call a witness for cross examination?” The judge asked.</p><p>“Yes, I call Wanda Maximoff to the stand.” The lawyer said in an irritated tone. Wanda sighed and got up, walking around the bench and through the swinging doors before she made her way to the witness stand.</p><p>“Religious affiliation?” The bailiff asked. Wanda magicked her thick spell book into his hands and placed her right hand on it while raising her left.</p><p>“I Wanda Maximoff, swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me goddesses and gods above and below.” Wanda spoke clearly. Before she magicked her spell book onto Pepper and Agatha’s table.</p><p>“Ms. Maximoff, is it true you have hexed Evanora Harkness twenty one times in the last twenty years?” The lawyer asked.</p><p>“No. I have hexed her twenty times in the last twenty years. I have no idea who hexed her the twenty first time.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Why would you hex a woman who has been through so much already?” The lawyer asked, which caused Wanda to scoff.</p><p>“Why? Every one of those hex’s was earned. A year worth of panic attacks, sleepless nights, and self deprecating behavior all caused by her neglect all brought to a head every time she would try and contact Agatha. I have spent 20 years of my own life watching my best friend fall apart over this woman’s actions. One little hex a year could be considered under kill really.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“My client would argue other wise.”</p><p>“Your client would argue with a rock.” Wanda snapped back.</p><p>“Next question, you say Agatha Harkness is your best friend. Is that how you’ve made it this far without being siphoned by her?” The lawyer asked.</p><p>“Objection! He’s leading your honor.” Pepper said as she stood up.</p><p>“Overruled, I’ll allow it this time.” The judge said knowing exactly where this was heading.</p><p>“I’ve made it this far without being siphoned by her because I’ve never been dumb enough to blast her with my magic. A little fire ball here, a toss of chaos magic at her feet, a sprinkling of it in her morning coffee on a day she’s been a real pain in the ass but I’ve never taken all my magical energy and blasted her with it. I use my magic on her all the time. She does the same for me and look, still alive! Still have my magic!” Wanda said in a tone that was teetering on goading but not quite there.</p><p>‘In your coffee? Really?’ Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>‘Yes, really. Chaos witch. Remember?’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“Do you have any further questions?” The judge asked.</p><p>“Not for her, I now call Agatha Harkness to the stand.” The lawyer said dismissively before turning and pointing at Agatha. Wanda got off the stand and made her way back to Rio. Agatha got up and made her way to the stand. She willed her spell book into being visible for all in court before she magicked it into the bailiffs hands.</p><p>“I Agatha Harkness, swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me goddesses and gods above and below.” Agatha stated clearly and loudly for the judge and room to hear as she held her right hand over her own tomb and her left up in the air. She sat down and waited for Evanora’s lawyer to speak.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, is it true you are a spirit witch?” The lawyer asked her with a distasteful tone.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Is it also true you stole your mother’s powers?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Do you have remorse for doing so?” He asked.</p><p>“I used to. But after this week I no longer do.” Agatha said as she watched the man pace the room. Agatha looked over to Pepper, who had an intense look on her face.</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Objection, leading!” Pepper said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Sustained, ask a better question.” Judge Heart said in an annoyed tone.</p><p>“Are there any events that have happened in the past week to make you reconsider your remorse?”</p><p>“I think showing up in my office in full glamor as a man under the ruse of needing legal help to harass me about my best friend’s hexes was the straw that broke the camels back.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Why did you not stop the hexes when asked?”</p><p>“I have no control over Wanda Maximoff, you’d have better luck holding the ocean back with a broom. And unfortunately for all parties involved I am not well versed in chaos magic. I couldn’t undo them even if I wanted to.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Why not simply ask her to stop hexing your poor mother?”</p><p>“Why would I treat someone to a kindness they never afforded me? My mother has never been loving, compassionate, caring, or even capable of a kindness toward me. Why should I give something I was never given?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Because I’m your mother you ungrateful brat!” Evanora screamed, quick succession of the gavel hitting the wooden block rang through the room.</p><p>“Last warning Evanora Harkness! You speak when spoken to!” Judge Hearts loud and booming voice rang through the chamber.</p><p>“I have no further questions.” The man said as he stepped away.</p><p>“Good, Pepper Potts. Please bring forth whatever evidence you have against Evanora Harkness. Agatha you may return to your seat.” Judge Heart requested before speaking softly to Agatha.</p><p>“I have several documents from the last 12 years Agatha Harkness has worked for me of every attempt made by Evanora Harkness trying to harass my client. She never made it past security until last week.” Pepper said as she handed over the documents to the court reporter.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness has attempted to break into Stark Law Firm 9 times, her 10th attempt was a success. Video evidence has been sent to your email.” The court reporter said as they pulled up their computer and projected the video onto the screen behind the empty stand.</p><p>The video with time stamps for each event played for the next 5 minutes. Each attempt resulting in Evanora being ushered away by security, until the last. Where she made it up to Agatha’s office. Rio popped into the office seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>“Pause the video. Who is this fourth woman?” The judge asked</p><p>“Rio Vidal, Agatha Harkness’s partner.” Pepper answered.</p><p>“How did she get through the protection ward Agatha has in place?” The judge asked.</p><p>“Agatha’s wards are to protect from malcontent, which is why Tricia was able to walk through the door with ease. Rio is a green witch and can teleport.” Pepper explained vaguely.</p><p>“Continue.” Judge Heart requested as he watched the scene unfold. Once the video was finished he looked at Pepper. “Any more evidence?” He asked, knowing Pepper was essentially holding a nuclear bomb.</p><p>“Yes, I would like to present five spirit witches diary entries from their 16th birthdays. Each detailing how their powers manifested.” Pepper said as she brought the papers over to the court reporter, before going back to her seat.</p><p>The reporter looked at the thick stack and grinned. They seemed to love things like this.</p><p>“July 7th 1950</p><p>My name is [redacted], and Today was my 16th birthday. My father had decided today was the day that he was sick of me. He woke me up this morning and dragged me out into the kitchen by my arm and made me kneel on the floor while he and my mother berated me. My mother finally snapped at me for not responding and slapped me hard across the face. My heart started to ache knowing they valued me so little because I had no powers. Then my father grabbed me with a red glowing hand, his fire magic intending to burn me again. I felt a searing pain rush through me before something snapped. Purple magic spread across my shoulder and neck before it over took his hand. Fear spread across my mother’s face as she tried to use her own magic to pry my father from me as all their magic drained from their bodies as they collapsed on the ground. The husks of their bodies still lay in the kitchen as I write this. I must collect things and flee. I am no safer here than I was a few hours ago, just for different reasons. “ The reporter spoke, coming to a strong realization as tension filled the room.</p><p>“Next.” Judge Heart said as he wrote something down.</p><p>“November 2nd 1926</p><p>I don’t know what I did to deserve this kind of abuse in my life… I tried so hard to be a good daughter but it never seemed to come. I didn’t wash the dishes properly today, that’s what triggered all of this. Mother found a dish with a spot on it. She screamed at me for a long time as I sat at the table staring at my hands. I was so terrified of her in that moment as she waved the dish at me.</p><p>Then she did something that even I never expected. She smashed the dish over my head! I felt the dish shatter against my head. I know I’m still bleeding. I didn’t even move or flinch. She screamed at me again and grabbed me by my arm; her yellow magic flaring to life as she intended to rewind time so I could relive the pain. Fear struck me as I felt things shift. Her yellow magic turned purple as something shifted in me. I felt her magic draining into my body. The look of fear on her face as she turned into a husk of herself almost matched mine.  I am so terrified. I don’t know what to do next.</p><p>[redacted]” the reporter spoke clearly but everyone in the room started to realize the implications behind these two documents.</p><p>“Objection! The evidence is too old!” Evanora’s lawyer yelled.</p><p>“Overruled. Shut up and sit down.” Judge Heart said in an irritated tone before looking back over at the reporter. “Continue.”</p><p>“January 17th 1976,</p><p>I, [redacted] discovered I am a spirit witch. Today wasn’t anymore unusual than any other day I’d experienced before. The only difference is that today is my 16th birthday. I was awoken by my father putting his cigarette out on my shoulder. He was cruel normally but today seemed excessive. I didn’t even bother flinching as I got up from the couch and walked away from him. He screamed something at me and I turned to look at him. His glamor magic was failing as he yelled at me. I don’t know what I did but something caused him to hit me with a horrible spell again. I felt something snap inside me as I flinched hard expecting a blow from him. His magic hit me but it turned from blue to purple as my body started siphoning his magic from his body. I stood and watched him crumple to the ground in a lifeless heap.</p><p>Mother will be home soon. I should pack my bags and leave. Her reaction will not be any kinder than my father’s. I don’t know where I’m going but I can’t stay here.” The reporter spoke clearly.</p><p>Each entry that was read aloud, twisted knots into Agatha’s stomach. She was so enraged by what these women had to endure. The only difference here is that these witches didn’t have abusers left standing.</p><p>‘You are okay. You are safe.’ Rio said clearly in her mind.</p><p>‘Thank you my love.’ Agatha thought back to Rio, attempting to calm down.</p><p>“Next?” Judge Heart asked as he continued to write things down.</p><p>“March 3rd 1995</p><p>Most teenagers are elated to turn 16, I’ve dreaded this day for years. My family have called me a disappointment for not having magic, they have abused me my whole life, and left more scars than I can imagine. I feel so broken for a young woman. My mother’s anger at me for being a non magical being has been growing as of late. This afternoon she poured scalding hot water over both my hands straight from the kettle, just to gloat that if I had powers I would’ve been able to heal myself. The pain was horrible. I begged her to fix my hands and she told me to suffer. I told her she was cruel and a horrible mother. She snapped at me and blasted me with a strong bolt of magic. I screamed in pain as I crumpled to the ground. Then something shifted in me. The pain turned into something else, I watched her green magic turn purple as her body withered away. I siphoned my mother’s life and magic from her body. I had no control over what happened and now my hands are fully healed. I can feel magic, my magic coursing through me. She finally got what she wanted, it just came at the cost of her life.</p><p>[redacted]”  The reporter spoke into the room. Evanora’s lawyer looked over at her with an almost unreadable expression. One that said ‘this isn’t a joke, we are fucked.’</p><p>“The last document please.” Judge Heart requested.</p><p>“August 21st 1897</p><p>Those dreaded horrendous creatures that I have called my family have drawn their last breath at my hands today, I have been neglected, abused, stepped upon and spit at more times than I can count in my life! I was scrubbing floors for mother as she sat in her chair eating her breakfast. My 16th birthday would be celebrated the same way my last 15 were. On the floor like a dog! Being thrown scraps of food because I didn’t have magic like my siblings. My whole family abused me for it. Today something changed, my father scolded me for missing a spot and stomped on my hand with the heel of his boot. I made the mistake of screaming out in pain. He tried to silence me with a spell, his red magic flaring to life as he blasted me. I felt my voice being stolen for a moment before something changed. His magic turned purple as my magic took over. My mother quickly stood and tried to intervene with her own magic causing my magic to siphon both of them dry. Their husks laid on the cobblestone floor as I stared at them. My youngest sibling ran into the room and screamed loudly. I tried to stop her but she ran off to get my two brothers who came back and attacked me. I lost my entire family to this stupid magic. Now I must leave, their coven will hunt me down if I don’t.</p><p>[redacted]” the court reporter spoke out, this time their voice was starting to waver. They took a deep calming breath after they finished speaking.</p><p>“Do you have anything else you’d like to present?” Judge Heart asked.</p><p>“No, now I’d like to call forth Evanora Harkness for cross examination.” Pepper said as she stood up from her seat. Evanora made her way to the stand and sat down.</p><p>“I no longer have magic. I need a Wiccan tomb to swear on.” Evanora said as she sat down. The bailiff grabbed the tomb from the corner of the room and brought it over for her to swear on.</p><p>“I, Evanora Harkness swear to speak the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me goddesses and gods above and below.” Evanora said as she placed her right hand on the tomb and raised her left.</p><p>“Perfect.” Pepper said as she stood and walked over to the witness stand. “Now Evanora, is it true you have violated the restraining order against you 10 times in the last 12 years Agatha has worked for Stark Law Firm?”</p><p>“Yes, because that brat wouldn’t call off the chaos witch!” Evanora said digging her own grave.</p><p>“Do you know why Agatha has a protection order against you?”</p><p>“Yes.” Evanora said begrudgingly.</p><p>“Care to elaborate as to why she has this PPO against you?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“No.” Evanora said turning her head and crossing her arms.</p><p>“Judge Heart, I’d like to call forth our court appointed third party memory spell caster. I think Evanora is unwilling to participate.” Pepper said honestly to the judge.</p><p>“Lilia Calderu If you could come assist us it would be greatly appreciated.” Judge Heart requested. Lilia stood up from the bench behind Rio and Wanda, then walked over to Pepper.</p><p>“How far do we want this spell to reach? Just you or everyone in the room?” Lilia asked the Judge.</p><p>“The whole room, if you can.” Judge Heart requested.</p><p>“If I can, insulting really. Which memory would you like to pull from?” Lilia asked Pepper.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness’s 16th birthday. The day of her attempted execution.” Pepper answered. Lilia started chanting softly before the whole room was bathed in a soft yellow hue.  Then everyone inside was teleported into Evanora’s memories.</p><p>“You wretched child! I should’ve killed you the second you were born! All you’ve ever been is a burden, a thorn in my side and now this! You are undeserving of drawing breath! How dare you!” Evanora scolded as she slapped Agatha across the face.</p><p>“Mother please! I love her!” A young Agatha begged.</p><p>“First you go running around with those abominable twins! Now this! You have been an utter disappointment since day one! How dare you. I put my blood, sweat, and bone into raising you. Just for you to shame me like this!” Evanora yelled as she slapped her daughter again. Purple magic flared from Agatha in that moment, haulting Evanora’s movements.</p><p>“Mother Stop!” Agatha pleaded, fear painting Agatha’s tone.</p><p>“You… you’re a…” Evanora started to say but stopped, her anger growing even deeper. Her face twisting into a look of disgust. She reached forward and grabbed Agatha by her hair and dragged her out of the house.</p><p>“Mother please! Stop!” Agatha pleaded, begging for her mother to let her go. Evanora shot a beacon of blue magic into the air and continued to drag Agatha though the woods.</p><p>Suddenly the rest of the coven was there pulling Agatha up by her arms and helping Evanora bind Agatha to a dead rotting tree. They left her there while they discussed her fate.</p><p>“She’s a fucking spirit witch.” Evanora spat loudly.</p><p>“To protect the coven we must kill her.” One of the other witches said. Evanora sneered in her daughter’s direction as she looked at her.</p><p>“She’s young and weak, we can fry her and end this now.” Evanora said to the coven before they walked over to Agatha. She was utterly disgusted with the child she bared.</p><p>“Mother please! I can be good.” Agatha begged struggling at her restraints tears spilling down her cheeks.</p><p>“No you cannot. You are incapable of it. It must be done my child. You cannot live. You are undeserving of life.” Evanora said to her daughter before continuing. “You have been nothing but a problem since the day you were born, today I eliminate that problem.” Evanora said as she blasted Agatha with her magic, the rest of the coven joined in.  An agonized scream left Agatha before something shifted. All the magic turned purple and they couldn’t stop it.</p><p>“No! No no no no no. Please no!” Agatha begged. Then everything went black.</p><p>The yellow hue faded away from the room as Lilia stood there and turned to look at Evanora.</p><p>“Permission to speak Judge Heart?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Permission granted.”</p><p>“If you haven’t grasped it yet Evanora, your neglect, abuse, and torment has created the ‘monster’ you view your daughter as. Her magic did the one thing it was meant to. Protect her. Every spirit witch that has ever existed has come from an abusive situation.” Lilia said while staring at Evanora, who finally seemed to grasp what was happening.</p><p>“No! That cannot be true! She was born evil!” Evanora said grasping at straws. Her lawyer was shaking his head in disbelief at the way Evanora treated her daughter.</p><p>“The evidence would argue other wise.” Pepper said with a shake of her head.</p><p>“No! You are manipulating the facts!” Evanora yelled from the stand, the gavel fell hard against the block.</p><p>“Cease! You ignorant woman! We all seen your memory! The only one in denial right now about the fact that Spirit witches are created is you!” Judge Heart yelled at Evanora.</p><p>“I did nothing wrong! She… she…” Evanora started to protest but even she started to realize she had no leg to stand on here. Pepper took a deep breath and sighed. She was enraged but she knew this wasn’t the place for that anger to bubble up.</p><p>“I’m done speaking to you. Go back to your seat. Do you want to ask any questions Judge Heart?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yes, just one. Evanora Harkness, do you have any remorse for how you treated your daughter?”</p><p>“No. She’s still a monster.” Evanora said clinging to the false truth about spirit witches.</p><p>“Give me a moment to speak to your lawyers before I make a decision. You two, my chambers now.” Judge Heart said to Pepper and Evanora’s lawyer.</p><p>“Give me five minutes I need to speak to my client.” The man said to the Judge.</p><p>“Fine. Bailiff call for someone to escort him to my chambers once he’s done.” Judge Heart directed.</p><p>“The best you are going to get is a plea deal. You dumbass.” Evanora’s lawyer said to her.</p><p>“I just want the hexes gone, I’ll do whatever time I have to.” Evanora said with a scowl.</p><p>“I’ll see what I can do. Keep your mouth shut while I’m gone.” He told the woman before he walked over to the second bailiff that had walked into the room. They guided him to Judge Hearts Chambers and opened the door for him.</p><p>“What’s the max amount of time she can get?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I’m not sending this to trial. I’m making the decision today. 7-10 years the multiple PPO violations and trespassing are doing the heavy lifting.” Judge Heart explained.</p><p>“That’s more than enough.” Pepper said with a sigh.</p><p>“She’s willing to take a plea deal if the chaos witch removes the hexes she has on her.” The man explained to the two.</p><p>“Bailiff collect Wanda Maximoff for me.” Judge Heart requested.</p><p>“Yes, sir.” The bailiff said before disappearing toward the courtroom. A few minutes later Wanda walked into the office.</p><p>“My presence was requested?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Yes, Evanora is willing to take a plea deal if you remove the hexes on her person.” Pepper said honestly as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“What happens if I don’t want to?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“This goes to trial, which might not be the greatest for Agatha’s mental health.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“How long?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“7-10 years depending on behavior.”</p><p>“She won’t live that long. I’ll lift the hexes the second you make your verdict. I have no clue who left the last hex though. So I can’t do anything about that.” Wanda promised.</p><p>“So it’s agreed? Plea deal?” Judge Heart asked.</p><p>“Plea deal. I don’t want this going to a trail… it would be a bloodbath.” Evanora’s lawyer said with a shake of his head.</p><p>“Good, as long as you’re aware of how dumb your client is.” Pepper said with a smile.</p><p>“Give me a moment to get everything in order, head back to the courtroom. Please.” Judge Heart requested. The three of them got up and headed back into the courtroom.</p><p>Agatha was sitting there starring at the door waiting when they walked back into the room. Pepper walked over to her and took her seat, a moment later Wanda made her way back to her place next to Rio and Evanora’s lawyer made his way back to his chair.</p><p>A few minutes later Judge Heart walked back into his room and took his seat. He cleaned his throat and begun to speak.</p><p>“In the case of Evanora Harkness Vs Agatha Harnkess I find Evanora to be guilty of breaking several PPO’s, and trespassing on private property with the intent to cause harm.  For these crimes you will serve 7-10 years jail time, Wanda Maximoff has kindly agreed to lift the hexes she has placed upon you once the verdict is final. The last hex is not her doing, therefore she cannot undo it. My verdict is final. You shall serve your time at the woman’s correctional facility.” Judge Heart said before slamming his gavel down.  The hexes on Evanora disappeared instantly. Red magic sizzling and hissing as they evaporated off her skin.</p><p>“Bailiff get this woman down in lock up until the next bus arrives for the correctional facility.” Judge Heart requested before he waved his hand. The bailiff walked over to Evanora and hiked her up by the arm and dragging her out of the room.</p><p>“I wonder who hexed her…” Wanda asked as she watched the door shut.</p><p>“That would be me, I hate that bitch.” Lilia said with a cheerful smile as she walked over to the group.  Pepper was shaking Evanora’s lawyers hand before she walked back to the group of women.</p><p>“I drove all night to get here, god it was even worse experiencing that the second time.” Lilia said as she shook her body trying to remove the memory from her mind.</p><p>“Yeah. I wish I hadn’t…” Agatha said with a sigh as she shook her own head. Rio reached across the median and took Agatha’s hand in her own.</p><p>“You did great. She’s no longer our problem.” Rio reassured as she pulled Agatha closer and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“Thank you my love. Sorry I was so anxious I didn’t even think…” Agatha said.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. I get it. Are you okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m okay. I’m free.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Good, now let’s get the fuck out of here!” Pepper said as she packed her briefcase up.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m officially over being in a suit.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I was thinking about requiring all Stark Industry therapists to wear suits starting tomorrow because of how good you looked.” Pepper said in a serious tone.</p><p>“Goddesses no. I’ll never get out of the house, Lily would never let me leave.” Wanda begged. Which caused Pepper and Agatha to laugh at Wanda.</p><p>“Now Rio, are you going to introduce your Aunt to your life partner?” Lilia asked her Niece.</p><p>“Oh I’m supposed to acknowledge you now?” Rio teased her aunt.</p><p>“Oh you little shit! Come here!” Lilia said as she reached out and grabbed Rio by the cheek before she let her go and gave her a big hug.</p><p>“Ah why! You’ve done that since I was a child! I’m a grown woman Lilia!” Rio complained after she hugged Lilia and let her go.</p><p>“Still just a wee pup to me. Now introduce me!” Lilia scolded.</p><p>“Aunt Lilia, this is my life Partner Agatha Harkness. Agatha, this is my adoptive Aunt Lilia Calderu. My mother’s best friend.” Rio said to Agatha and Lilia.</p><p>“Nice to meet the Legend, you are extremely impressive. Though experiencing that again wasn’t exactly fun.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“It’s okay sweetie, you never have to see her face ever again.” Lilia promised.</p><p>“I believe you, only because of your ability.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, I have to get back to the office, I think you have a couple meetings today as well Agatha.” Pepper said with a smile.</p><p>“I’m sure I do. Alright, let me take Rio home and I’ll meet you at the office.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“No need, I’ve got this one. I haven’t seen her in a while.” Lilia reassured before slipping an arm through Rio’s.  “Now you go have a good day at work.”</p><p>“Thank you, I appreciate it Lilia. Hopefully our next interaction is a nicer one.” Agatha told Lilia.</p><p>“I’m sure it will be, see you later.” Lilia answered, before she tried dragging Rio off.</p><p>“Let me say goodbye Lilia!” Rio whined.</p><p>“If you must! Not like you won’t see her tonight.” Lilia said as she let go of Rio who wrapped her arms around Agatha and gave her a hug before she kissed her goodbye.</p><p>“Have a good day. I’ll see you tonight.” Rio said after she let Agatha go.</p><p>“You too, enjoy your time with your Aunt.” Agatha told Rio before the two women walked away.</p><p>“You have married into an interesting family.” Pepper said to Agatha as they made their way to the front entrance with Wanda following behind.</p><p>“Not married.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“No, just cosmically bound to each other for eternity.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“Don’t you have somewhere else to be?” Agatha asked sarcastically.</p><p>“Nope, you are my top priority today. Be that annoying you or just hanging out.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“Go annoy your girlfriend for a couple hours before her interview… wait. Actually. Don’t do that.” Agatha started to say but back tracked.</p><p>“You know.. You never realized how much energy you waste keeping 20 hexes running at once. I feel like a whole new woman. I have so much energy now.” Wanda said as she bounced on her feet.</p><p>“Uh. Stark law firm has a gym on the main floor… maybe we should take her there and drop her in it?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Might not be a bad idea. Who knows what trouble she’ll get into now…” Agatha answered Pepper as they made their way down the steps.</p><p>“I’ll be fine! You two have a good day, I’m gunna go cause some chaos.” Wanda said with a smile before running off to her car.</p><p>“Don’t get arrested!” Agatha yelled to her friend.</p><p>“I won’t!” Wanda yelled back before she got in her car and sped off.</p><p>“I don’t know how I feel about a more energetic Wanda…” Pepper said as she watched the car drive away.</p><p>“I’m gunna call someone on the way into the office. I’ll see you soon.” Agatha said as she approached her car.</p><p>“See you soon.” Pepper said as she turned and headed toward her own vehicle. Agatha got in and quickly dialed Jen’s number as she started the car.</p><p>“Hey Agatha, good to know you’re still alive!” Jen said into the phone.</p><p>“It’s been a busy ass week, sorry. I actually am calling you for a few reasons… got time?” Agatha asked as she put the car in drive.</p><p>“Yeah, stores dead. The online order I got this morning is already taken care of, what’s up?” Jen asked into the phone.</p><p>“Is that order for a Lilian Grey?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, it is. Why? She a friend?” Jen asked.</p><p>“She’s Wanda’s girlfriend.” Agatha answered as she turned onto the street. There was a long pause.</p><p>“Excuse me.. I think my ears need cleaned. Wanda has a girlfriend? Is this the woman she went out with the other day that she never texted me back about after asking me to be a just in case bail out call?” Jen asked into the phone.</p><p>“One and the same. You’ve missed a lot.. honestly more than I can cover in a 20 minute conversation but I’ll summarize. I also met someone, she owns a bookstore. Her name is Rio Vidal, and I’ll elaborate more in depth on that later. Before you ask more important things are about to come out of my mouth.” Agatha explained then waited for Jen to say something.</p><p>“I’m waiting Harkness.” Jen said into the phone.</p><p>“My mother successfully made it into Stark Law offices  and up to my office under a glamor spell last Wednesday. Today was her hearing for breaking the PPO, and trespassing. She’s officially in jail for the next 7-10 years. Part of the plea deal was that Wanda had to lift her hexes off my mother. So… now Wanda has way more energy than she did yesterday.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Already working on it. I knew what the order was for based off the ingredients. I’ll make her 6? No 12 energy vials and maybe some liquid nectar for sustenance….” Jen said catching onto what Agatha was saying.</p><p>“Thanks, send me the bill for both. Now you can ask questions. You’ve got me for 5 minutes.”</p><p>“So you’ve got a girlfriend now too?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha answered. Still not technically a lie but it felt like one.</p><p>“What’s the bookstores name?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Vidal Books.” Agatha answered. She heard some typing in the background.</p><p>“Damn! She’s just your type Agatha! Score. Is she a green witch?” Jen asked.</p><p>“You could say that.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Oh? Tell me more.” Jen pried.</p><p>“I would love to, more than anything but I have meetings this afternoon. Maybe I’ll call you on my way home if Rio doesn’t call me before I get out the door.” Agatha told Jen.</p><p>“I miss the honeymoon phase. It was nice. Alright, I’ll talk to you later. Already sent you the Venmo request.” Jen told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you! I’ll call you later!” Agatha said before she hung up the phone. She parked her car and headed into the building.</p><p>~Meanwhile down in the courthouse inmate holding area~</p><p>“I cannot believe I have to suffer in prison for the next 7 to 10 years! Absolute bullshit! But the hexes are gone so maybe…” Evanora said with a grin that quickly fell from her face when she felt a cold shift in the room. Death was sitting next to her. Silently waiting. She looked over at the entity and stared.</p><p>Nothing happened for a long moment and then the door was being opened. “Get up Harkness it’s time to go.” A man said to her. She slowly stood up and made her way to the door. Death stood and followed her, always one step behind her, a cold creeping presence settling in the back of her mind as she walked.</p><p>Once she was loaded onto the bus Death sat next to her, the cold bitter chill of her aura bitting into her. Evanora could feel her bones start to rattle inside her. She was so cold, she just couldn’t shake the chill that was clinging to her. The bus stopped and they offloaded them into the prison. Every step in the process was followed by Death. Once she was locked in a cell alone Death finally spoke.</p><p>Evanora was on edge, her body was bitterly cold and she was terrified. She had no clue why Death was still following her around.</p><p>“Do you really think you won?” Death asked as she floated over to the woman.</p><p>“I think I’m free from all these fucking Hexes.”</p><p>“Yes, but at what cost? All that chaos energy that was clinging to your body was the only magical energy you had left…Don’t you see? Wanda Maximoff’s hexes were the only thing keeping you alive. Your body can’t keep up now that it’s got no juice left.” Death explained as she ghosted around the woman.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Evanora asked in a fear filled tone.</p><p>“You’ve always been destined to die this way you know… alone, scared, and confused. Just the way you made your daughter feel.” Hissed out. “If you’re lucky you’ll make it through the week, but you’ve never been lucky Evanora now have you?”</p><p>“No! No! I’m finally free! You can’t take me! It’s not fair!” Evanora screamed at the deity floating around her.</p><p>“Life isn’t fair. You got as much time as you got, and more time than you ever deserved. Now, are you going to keep fighting me or are you going to come willingly?” Death asked.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Evanora screamed out.</p><p>“Wrong answer Evanora.” Death screeched out with a thousand voices, her scythe slicing through her soul and plucking it from her body. Leaving the woman’s corpse crumpled on the floor.</p><p>“Now, you get to experience the fear and torment you put your daughter through for the next century. I’m throwing you in a pit and forgetting about you.” Death said as she opened a portal and dragged her through it.</p><p>“No! It’s not fair!”</p><p>“You keep saying that, but unfortunately for you it’s more than fair.” Death said as she dropped the woman into the void and walked out.</p><p>“Now to have a conversation with Gaia.” Death said as she dusted her hands off and teleported herself to Gaia’s domain.</p>

<p>Lilia and Rio got into Lilia’s car and headed toward Rio’s bookstore. They sat quietly in the car for a long moment before Rio spoke up. “Did momma put you up to this?”</p><p>“No, actually Rita has no idea I’m here. Honestly I’d like to keep it that way.” Lilia explained to Rio.</p><p>“Ooooo you’re in trouble.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Hardly… you just know how Rita can get…”</p><p>“How mad is she going to be when she finds out you did all this just to meet Agatha?” Rio asked honing in on the actual reason Lilia offered her services.</p><p>“Why you little shit!  How did you figure it out?” Lilia asked as she poked Rio in the side.</p><p>“I’ve been your niece for the last 35 years. I’m not stupid. No matter what future you divine, I will always know when you have ulterior motives. Helping Agatha may have been the primary reason but it wasn’t the only one.”</p><p>“Actually seeing Evanora get her just desserts was the primary motive. I’ve always hated that bitch.  Secondary motive was actually helping Agatha. Your mom asked me to look back when everything happened with her. All things considered,  she seems wonderful.” Lilia said to Rio as they pulled into the bookstore parking lot and parked the car.</p><p>“She’s fantastic! She’s amazing, and kind, and I just know one day she will be a great mother because of how well she puts up with Wanda and Pietro! She’s so intelligent and utterly stunning to look at! Her laugh is so cute and I really love it when she snorts. It’s adorable.” Rio told Lilia, spouting off all the things she admired about Agatha. Lilia smiled brightly at Rio, she was so happy that Rio was happy.</p><p>“That is the smile I’ve been looking to see on your face since you were told you were next in line! That smile right there is my favorite thing!” Lilia said with tears in her eyes, she was so happy she could cry.</p><p>“Lilia! Stop! If you cry, I’ll cry!” Rio said as she looked away from the older woman. Lilia laughed and wiped her tears away before she looked over at Rio.</p><p>“Come on! Show me your store! The fourth reason I drove all night to be here!” Lilia said as she unbuckled and got out of the car.</p><p>‘Testing. Testing.’ Rio heard Agatha say softly in her mind, almost like a whisper.</p><p>‘Why are we whispering?’ Rio whispered back to Agatha as she got out of the car.  She walked over to the side door Lilia was standing at and unlocked it before disarming the security system and turning on the lights.</p><p>“Wow! Look at this place! I could spend a whole Saturday in here! It’s stunning, the green really screams ‘Vidal’. Though the kids corner could use some purple, don’t you think?” Lilia asked with a wink.</p><p>“I hope our kids aren’t spirit witches… that would mean we were bad parents.” Rio said with a panicked look on her face.</p><p>“None of your children will be spirit witches.” Lilia reassured.</p><p>‘Still with Lilia?’ Agatha asked, still speaking softly.</p><p>‘Yes and she’s trying to bait me into asking her questions about our future children. One moment my love.’ Rio answered back before focusing on Lilia.</p><p>“Don’t, I know you looked. I don’t want answers to questions I didn’t actually ask.” Rio said to Lilia in a half serious tone.</p><p>“Fine! You are no fun! What’s the sense in knowing the future if you can’t tell anyone about it!” Lilia said with a huff.</p><p>“You tell the CDC everything.” Rio clarified.</p><p>“That’s not the same and you know it!” Lilia huffed out.</p><p>“Yes, but I physically cannot lie to Agatha, at all. I wish I was kidding but I’m not. She has a way of bringing out the truth without you even realizing it. If you tell me something, I will tell her and then… if she’s disappointed… I don’t think I could handle that.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Oh Rio, I don’t need to look into the future to know that you’ll never disappoint her. You both may do dumb things in your relationship in the future but you’ll never be a disappointment to her.” Lilia reassured.</p><p>“You have no guarantee of that, and I don’t want one either. Stop trying to bait me!” Rio said with a laugh realizing her Aunt was just trying to get her to dig for info.</p><p>“You’ve always been so good at evading me and my guidance.” Lilia said with a laugh.</p><p>“Do you want to crash at my place tonight? You look very tired.” Rio asked changing the subject.</p><p>“I can get a hotel.” Lilia told Rio.</p><p>“Yeah but I’m probably not going to be using my bed. I expect tonight to be a rough one for Agatha after today so I planned on staying the night with her.” Rio explained.</p><p>“It may be, or it may not. It’s one of those things that even I don’t know how she’s going to be once the sun sets.” Lilia said before she walked around the room.</p><p>“Why…. What aren’t you telling me?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Nope! You won’t let me talk about kids. You don’t get to know the other shit!” Lilia scolded before she softened. “But you should be a good partner and maybe get her some flowers or something…”</p><p>“I think I can do more than flowers. Let me text Wanda real quick.” Rio said as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>Rio 1:45 p.m: Hey, are you coming to Agatha’s tonight?</p><p>Wanda 1:45 p.m: maybe… really depends on how well Lily’s job interview goes. Do you realize how much energy I have right now?!? I feel like I’m buzzing.</p><p>Rio 1:46 p.m: how much magical energy were you using to hex her?!?</p><p>Wanda 1:47 p.m: a decent amount… like more than I probably should have… but I didn’t realize I was missing it because I was doing it in small chunks over the last 20 years. I feel like I’m 25 again!</p><p>Rio 1:48 p.m. maybe you should come over tonight so you don’t kill Lily.</p><p>Lilia walked over to Rio and smiled at her brightly as Rio sent the last text. Rio looked at her and smiled back. “What?”</p><p>“I’m just happy you are finally happy.” Lilia told her.</p><p>“You ready to head to my place so you can rest? Or I can open a portal for you and you can go harass momma?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, show me your apartment!” Lilia requested, them Rio turned around to head toward the back door they came through. before mumbling to herself “Even though it won’t be yours for long.”</p><p>“What was that Lilia?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Nothing, come on I’m tired, you can drive this time.” Lilia said as she walked over to Rio. Rio let them out of the store and then made her way over to Lilia’s car and got in the driver seat. Lilia handed her the keys and Rio started the car. They pulled out of the parking lot and 10 minutes later they were at Rio’s.</p><p>“Come on. I’ll change the sheets and get you fresh bedding.” Rio said as she handed Lilia the car keys. They make their way up to Rio’s apartment, and Rio lets them in.</p><p>“Thank you sweetie, I’ll keep myself busy while you do what you need to.” Lilia said as she walked through the apartment. Rio disappeared into her bedroom to clean and change the bedding.</p><p>~Meanwhile in Gaia’s Domain~</p><p>“Violet! Wonderful to see you!” Gaia said with a smile as she rushed up to the embodiment of Death. Green grass blooming brightly under each step she took with wild flowers popping up behind her in the grass.</p><p>“Gaia! Nice to see you as well.” Violet said with a smile.</p><p>“You’re late!” Gaia scolded.</p><p>“I had a pickup I needed to attend. My bad, I was waiting for the sands to run out on someone I’ve wanted to collect since the day she was born.” Violet said with a sneer.</p><p>“I told you to trust me, everyone is exactly where they are supposed to be!” Gaia said with a smile as she started to walk toward her home.</p><p>“About that… they’ve exceeded expectations.”  Violet said with a chuckle as she looked at Gaia, the woman next to her stopped in her tracks.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Gaia asked Violet.</p><p>“Their hearts have shown up.” Violet said as she continued to walk toward the home. Gaia zoomed over to her.</p><p>“What! When? Take me to them right now?!” Gaia said excitedly as she grabbed onto Violets shoulders and shook her lightly.</p><p>“You heard me. Saturday night I believe? And no, they aren’t even together right now. They are still human, and have day jobs.” Violet said as she tried to get out of Gaia’s grasp. She finally managed to break free and head toward the home.</p><p>“Any idea how they managed to do it?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“Besides the deep intimate connection they’ve already developed? I think the fact that Agatha is a whole coven rolled into one person has a lot to do with it. Don’t you?”</p><p>“Maybe….” Gaia said as she looked away from Violet.</p><p>“Come on Gaia! We can’t be keeping secrets from each other!” Violet yelled in an exasperated tone. Gaia looked like a kicked puppy.</p><p>“She’s just super powerful, I wish I could tell you more! There are infinite possibilities with her!” Gaia answered honestly.</p><p>“Narrow it down.” Violet told Gaia as she opened the door and walked into the kitchen and started making tea.</p><p>“Honestly, they both will surpass us power wise. Agatha may end up as something similar to a celestial, a cosmic being. Not sure what her role will be yet, but we will get there when we get there. We’ve got over a thousand years before we have to deal with this.” Gaia told Violet.</p><p>“What am I supposed to tell them?”</p><p>“That they should live their life! Let them just have each other. Let them be happy!” Gaia said to Violet.</p><p>“What if they get their crowns early? What if they transcend before death?”</p><p>“Then we worry about it when it happens.” Gaia answered which caused Violet to look at her with a panicked expression. “Which it won’t. I’ll make sure of it personally. I promise, take me with you when you go see them tonight after she gets the call about her mother.”</p><p>“Do we know how she’s going to handle that?” Violet asked.</p><p>“As well as she’s handled everything else in life.” Gaia answered.</p><p>“Well that’s reassuring… Now… did you want me to go get Rosaline so we can gossip?” Violet asked.</p><p>“Yes! I miss her!” Gaia said excitedly.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.” Violet said before she blipped out of Gaia’s domain and home real quick before she and Rosaline reappeared in the kitchen.</p><p>“Hiya Gaia!” Rosaline said as she rushed over to hug the goddess.</p><p>“Never fails. You say that every time!” Gaia said with a laugh.</p><p>“You love it! Now, let’s gossip while you two wait for Agatha and Rio.” Rosaline said as she sat down at the table. Gaia followed suit and allowed Violet to make the tea.</p><p>“I might be able to bend the rules and bring you along as well.” Gaia told Rosaline.</p><p>“I’m good. You two need to talk to the girls more than I need to meet them.” Rosaline said as she relaxed in the chair.</p><p>“Yeah, let’s not overwhelm them. They are technically going to meet ‘god’ today.” Violet said as she set the tea pot on the table and magicked 3 tea cups, honey, and milk.</p><p>“Valid point. Okay. So what have you two been up to?” Gaia asked getting into the gossip part of their tea time. Violet poured all of them a cup and sat down as she listened to her wife and friend chat away.</p><p>~Stark Law Firm~</p><p>‘Did you forget about me?’ Agatha whispered to Rio as she sat at her desk waiting for her second meeting of the day.</p><p>‘No, Lilia drove all night last night to make it in time for the hearing. So I brought her back to my place. I had to change the sheets and bedding and now she’s asleep in my room.’ Rio answered Agatha.</p><p>‘Why did the sheets need changed?’ Agatha teased.</p><p>‘I wonder.’ Rio said sarcastically in her mind before she let the memories of fucking Agatha with a strap on for the first time flood her mind.</p><p>‘Rio… please I’m at work.’ Agatha begged, sounding needy and desperate already. Rio shook her head and tried to think of something different.</p><p>‘My 3:30 is here, I’ll see you tonight.’ Agatha thought before closing the connection, it was much easier for her to do than Rio.</p><p>Agatha stood up and greeted her client before they sat down and got down to discussing their wants and needs out of an agreed deal. They really just wanted a contract written up that had zero wiggle room.</p><p>An hour later Agatha had an outline and was ready to work on getting the contract locked in after their meeting. She thanked her client for their time and sent them on their way. Tricia came into the office a few minutes after they left and grimaced a smile at Agatha.</p><p>“What is that face?” Agatha asked as she looked up from her computer to see Tricia.</p><p>“I don’t know how you’re doing… and I don’t know if you want me to ask. But I really want to.” Tricia said honestly as she wrung her fingers.</p><p>“You are beyond sweet Tricia, I’m okay. It was a rough hearing, but I had Pepper, Rio, and Wanda there with me. Speaking of which… her girlfriend had an interview with Mr. Stark at 4:00 I wonder how that went.” Agatha mused.</p><p>“What was the interview for?” Tricia asked.</p><p>“Head of Botanical Research at Stark Botanical Gardens.” Agatha answered before her phone in her office rang. She reached for it and picked it up.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness Speaking.” Agatha spoke into the phone as she looked at Tricia who was about to turn around.</p><p>“Hello Ms. Harkness, I’m calling you from the women’s prison… I have some unfortunate news. Evanora Harkness has been found dead in her cell.” A woman spoke into the phone. Agatha held her hand up and motioned for Tricia to come in and shut the door. Tricia did and waited.</p><p>“I see, thank you for calling me to inform me of this. Is there anything I need to do?” Agatha asked the woman.</p><p>“You can come pick up her possessions if you’d like. Otherwise we can just dispose of them.” The woman offered.</p><p>“Itemized list please?”</p><p>“A cellphone, wallet, ID, house keys, car keys.” She listed off the normal things that come along with people when they get arrested.</p><p>“I’ll come get the items. Thank you. What time do you close?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“We’re here all night. Take your time. Sorry for your loss.” The woman said into the phone compassionately, Agatha sighed softly.</p><p>“Thank you, that is much appreciated. Have a good day.” Agatha said into the phone trying to sound genuine.</p><p>“You as well.” The woman said before hanging up the phone. Agatha let the phone drop from her ear as she looked up at Tricia, tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>“Go get Pepper. Now.” Agatha said in a strange tone. She wasn’t distressed. She wasn’t happy. She wasn’t sure how to feel. Tricia bolted out the door leaving Agatha alone in her office.</p><p>‘Evanora is dead.’ Agatha’s voice rang  through Rio’s mind as she sat on her living room couch. She paused, surely that couldn’t be right…</p><p>‘Excuse me?’ Rio asked back, her brain going a million miles per minute.</p><p>‘Fuck if I know, the prison just called me to inform me.’ Agatha thought, then Rio felt a pull. She just let Agatha call her, the next thing she knew she was in Agatha’s office sitting in her lap.</p><p>“You know when Violet said in my lap yesterday, I kinda thought she was joking.” Agatha said with a laugh as she hugged Rio tightly.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked slightly worried as she got off Agatha’s lap. A moment later the door opened again and shut.</p><p>“What happened? Why did Tricia come get me? Oh, Hi Rio.” Pepper said in a rushed tone as she walked into the room.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness is dead.” Agatha stated clearly, her expression and tone absolutely unreadable.</p><p>“I… uh…  excuse me?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“That seems to be the general consensus today.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“She couldn’t have died yesterday and saved us all some time?” Pepper joked before she looked at Rio. “Got anyway of contacting Death and giving her an earful?”</p><p>“Even if I did, do you think she’d listen?” Rio asked Pepper, before the world seemed to grind to a stop.</p><p>“I listen all the time!” Violet said in a hurt tone from behind the two women.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio said as she and Agatha turned around. Violet Vidal was standing next to a gorgeous black woman who had a glowing white aura around her. Stunning green eyes seemed to peer into her soul.</p><p>“Yeah, I do. Unfortunately some chaos witch threw a monkey wrench in my plans. Also, I have someone who is dying to meet you.” Violet told the two women.</p><p>“Hello Rio, Hello Agatha. I’m Gaia. Nice to meet you both.” Gaia said with a smile as she walked over to the two women. Agatha stood there struck in awe of the goddess, Rio was standing with her mouth agape in shock.</p><p>“The pleasure is all mine, it’s not every day my mother dies and I get to meet the Goddess Gaia.” Agatha said charmingly before she smiled at the woman.</p><p>“Nice to meet you Goddess. Though, I am curious… why are you here?” Rio asked, bold and blunt as always.</p><p>“Oh, you weren’t kidding Violet. Not even a twitch of surprise. I see why you were so worried.” Gaia said as she observed the two.</p><p>“They stopped jumping in shock after I popped into the car. They seem acutely aware of when I’m arriving.” Violet said with a shrug.</p><p>“You said a chaos witch threw a monkey wrench in your plans? Care to elaborate?” Agatha asked as she crossed her arms and honed her eyes on Violet. Gaia raised an eyebrow at the question but then turned to look at Violet who was floundering.</p><p>“Wanda, your best friend. Her chaos energy was the only thing keeping Evanora alive. So when she asked for the hexes to be removed as part of the plea deal… She sealed her own fate.” Gaia explained to Agatha.</p><p>“I need you to deeply elaborate on how that’s even possible.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“Witches live so long due to the magical energy coursing through their bodies. The hexes were a form of magical energy. Evanora’s body was using that energy to keep her alive. The second they were gone, so was her bodies ability to keep going.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Wanda is going to be pissed.” Rio said quietly to herself.</p><p>“Well actually… she might find it absolutely hilarious.” Agatha said in disbelief.</p><p>“Why?” Violet and Gaia ask in unison.</p><p>“Because to put it simply, she held her life in her hands and that would’ve been the one thing Evanora Harkness hated more than anything. Knowing right before her death that the woman who hexed her was the only thing keeping her alive. The irony that she begged for those hexes to be lifted, oh man I wish I could’ve seen her face!” Agatha said gleefully, knowing her best friend was about to be on the moon.</p><p>“I mean…. I could replay the memory… later. Maybe in a hundred years or so.” Violet said honestly.</p><p>“You think Wanda is going to want to wait a hundred years?” Rio asked with a scoff.</p><p>“I’ll make the exception this one time Violet, Wanda and Lily can meet you. Just so you can give Wanda that gift. She deserves it after every thing she’s done for Agatha.” Gaia told the group.</p><p>“Really?!?” Violet said excitedly, she really wanted to interact with the chaos witch that Agatha called a best friend.</p><p>“Yes. Now onto the important reason we are actually here. Girls, you’ve surprised even me with how deep your connection is. So I have to pause it, only if you will allow me?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“Why does it need paused?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Because you’ll ascend and then never be able to live a normal life. You’ll get stuck in the in between. To give you the only real negative, you won’t be able to have children. The rest is more of a benefit than anything but I know how badly you both want them.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“How would you pause it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Oh, that’s simple. I just have to touch you. Might sting a little, godly aura can burn mortals. But you two are… well different, so I doubt it will hurt at all.” Gaia said unmoving from her spot.</p><p>“Can you let us discuss this for a moment?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Of course.” Gaia answered, she had all the time in the universe for these two.</p><p>‘What do you want? Do you actually want children?’ Rio asked in Agatha’s mind.</p><p>‘More than anything. You?” Agatha answered.</p><p>“With you, I want them. Anyone else? It wouldn’t matter.”</p><p>“How will this work?” Agatha asked Gaia.</p><p>“You walk over to me and if you’ll allow it, I’ll hug you, or take your hand.” Gaia answered. Agatha sighed and moved first, she walked over to Gaia and held her arms open. Gaia smiled happily as she reached out and wrapped her arms around Agatha pulling her into a hug.</p><p>Contrary to what Gaia told them it didn’t burn at all, the hug was the softest and warmest hug Agatha had ever received. It felt so full of a mother’s love that Agatha felt tears well up into her eyes as Gaia pressed her face against Agatha’s. Something warm and loving settled into Agatha’s chest. A pure and warm feeling that she had never felt before, it was like the hug Rita gave her but more intense. Gaia held onto Agatha for a long moment before she placed a soft kiss to her temple as she let her go.</p><p>Agatha pulled away and smiled softly at Gaia who smiled brightly at her. “I’ve never experienced anything quite like that before.” Agatha said with a soft sob.</p><p>“A mother’s love has been hard to come by for you. I guarantee you if you ever need a hug like that again I’m one call away. It seems your soul has decided for you that I’m exactly what you need.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Agatha questioned with a furrowed brow.</p><p>“That I am your mother now, witchlett. Deal with it.” Gaia said with a smile that left no room for argument.</p><p>“Aren’t you the mother of all technically?” Rio joked.</p><p>“Technically yes, but this is different. Now come here Rio.” Gaia requested. Agatha stepped aside and allowed Rio to walk over to Gaia, Rio held her arms open and Gaia took her into her arms as well. This hug was different yet familiar for Rio, it felt like she was hugging a close friend, that she hadn’t seen in years. She let Rio go much sooner than she did Agatha and smiled brightly at the two women.</p><p>“You my child, just need to call and I’ll be right there for you. Just like Rio can call this pain in the ass any time she needs.” Gaia told Agatha.</p><p>“Hey! I’m not a pain in the ass!” Violet said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“That’s subjective.” Gaia argued.</p><p>“Thank you, what do I call you?” Agatha asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Mom, Mother, Momma, Gaia, what ever you prefer. Just know that I’m here for you. Now, enjoy your lives! I expect grandchildren in the next hundred years or so!” Gaia said with a smile before she disappeared. Leaving Rio, Agatha and Violet standing in her office.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting that…” Violet said honestly as she looked at the bunch of flowers sitting on the floor where Gaia was standing. Rio bent over and picked them up and read the tag.</p><p>“A blessing for my daughter and her wife.” Rio said out loud as she handed the flowers to Agatha. It was a beautiful bouquet of lilies, hydrangeas and lavender.</p><p>“They all mean prosperity…” Violet said with a smile.</p><p>“And other things…” Rio answered vaguely as she looked over the bouquet.</p><p>“True but I know Gaia, if she wanted either of you pregnant she would’ve blessed you with that. Neither of you are.”</p><p>“Thank the goddesses and gods. I’m not ready to be a mother right now.” Agatha said as she rubbed her face.</p><p>“Honestly same, here ya go babe. These are technically for you. We will see you tonight?” Rio said as she handed Agatha the flowers before she turned to look at Violet.</p><p>“Yes. I’ll see the four of you tonight. Just summon me once you are all settled. Now I really must be going. Bodies are piling up again.” Violet said before time started back up and she disappeared.</p><p>“You didn’t have flowers in your arms a moment ago…” Pepper said in a confused tone.</p><p>“Well you asked if Rio could contact Death to give her an earful…” Agatha said trailing off as she looked down at the flowers.</p><p>“Oh? Did she pop in and have a conversation with you two?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yes, and this time she brought a friend.” Rio said with a shake of her head.</p><p>“Who? God?” Pepper joked.</p><p>“Close, Gaia.” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“If anyone other than you told me that I’d think they were fucking with me. What did we learn?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Well we can officially blame Wanda for wasting our time.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Elaborate, please.” Pepper requested as she leaned against the door.</p><p>“Wanda’s magical energy she had in those hexes was the only thing keeping her alive. So when the hexes were removed so was the magical energy.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Please, please tell me Death told Evanora that Wanda’s hexes were what was keeping her alive?!” Pepper begged trying to keep the laugher that was threatening to bubble up contained.</p><p>“Oh she did.” Rio said with a shake of her head. Pepper then keeled over with laughter at the thought of that woman coming to the horrifying realization that she was her own undoing.</p><p>“Perfect, immaculate even! Wanda will love that!” Pepper said after she collected herself and wiped away the tears in her eyes. “She deserves a raise…” Pepper mused to herself.</p><p>“I hope so, and that’s on you and Tony. She just got a large chunk of her magical energy back so she’s already going a million miles a minute. You seen her earlier…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>“Fair. Alright, well it sounds like everything is sorted out.” Pepper said as she walked over to Agatha. “I’m going to hug you, then you are going to collect that horrible woman’s items and we will figure out the legal bullshit tomorrow when it comes to her estate.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and let Pepper hug her, knowing she wasn’t getting out of this office without doing so. “Thank you Pepper. I appreciate you so much.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Just wait until you get my bill.” Pepper joked.</p><p>“Take it from my retirement I’ll never use.” Agatha jabbed back as Pepper let her go and headed toward the door.</p><p>“Go get her shit, I’ll start figuring out where everything is going.” Pepper instructed as she opened the door and walked out.</p><p>“Yes boss lady!” Agatha yelled back as she watched Pepper leave, she turned to look at Rio who was snooping around her office. “You want to go with me babe?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh yeah! Sorry, I was being nosy.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“No need to apologize. Let me pack up my stuff and we can head out.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Sounds great! I have a few questions though…” Rio said as she walked over to Agatha.</p><p>‘If they are about our connection I’d wait until we are in the car.’ Agatha thought before she spoke. “What would those be darling?”</p><p>“Do you know if she had a will?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Probably, we can go check the house out on Sunday and see if we can find anything. Or contact her lawyer. If Pepper hasn’t already started doing things. Ready?” Agatha asked as she looked at Rio who looked lost.</p><p>‘Are you okay?’ Agatha asked in her mind as she grabbed Rio’s hand.</p><p>‘I just can’t imagine losing my parents… so this is a little weird.’ Rio said back, squeezing it softly.</p><p>‘Evanora was never really a parent to me. But I understand what you mean. I’ll explain in the car. Come. Please.’ Agatha requested as she guided Rio out of her office.</p><p>“Tricia, have a great evening. See you tomorrow.” Agatha said to her secretary as she walked Rio toward the elevator. They made it down to the lobby and out the door before Rio spoke up.</p><p>“Are you sure you are okay? I know everyone thinks it’s funny, and it kind of is. But… she was still your mother. I just want to make sure you aren’t going to break.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“This is the freest I’ve ever felt in my life. If I could fly up into the sky and scream at the top of my lungs ‘I’m Finally Free!’ I would but I don’t need the government yelling at me right now.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“You can do that at the cabin on Saturday if you want.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I might just take you up on that offer. Now come on, I want to get this part over with.” Agatha said with a sigh as she guided Rio to her car. They got in and Agatha started it before pulling out of the parking lot.</p><p>“I don’t blame you. Sorry for being so weird about it. I was in my own head about my parent’s mortality. I know Evanora was a monster, and deserved what she got out of life. But I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”</p><p>“I appreciate it. But honestly I’m okay for now, that might change next week or next year. But right now, I’m relieved. I finally feel like I don’t have to be looking over my shoulder in fear constantly. Thank you for worrying Rio, it just proves to me that my magic chose the right person for me.” Agatha reassured the woman.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness I am of the belief that you were made just for me and I am so thankful for that gift.” Rio said sincerely.</p><p>“Okay stop being cheesy. That will make me cry.” Agatha said with a huff.</p><p>“So… are we gunna talk about the fact that our goddess just decided you’re her child now?” Rio asked changing the subject.</p><p>“That was the single most loving and maternal hug I’ve ever experienced. Rita’s hug was also so loving, but that hug… that hug felt like I was the most cherished and loved person on the planet. That hug felt like a hug I used to wish for from Evanora.” Agatha said with her voice cracking.</p><p>“Honestly, when she hugged me it felt like I was hugging an old friend I hadn’t seen in forever. But I believe you, I’m glad you are finally are getting all the love you deserve.”</p><p>“If I had only gotten you out of the deal. It would have been worth it. You coming into my life has been the best thing that has ever happened to me… well besides Wanda and Pietro… but those two knuckle heads aren’t here right now.” Agatha said with a chuckle as they pulled into the prisons parking lot.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Rio asked.</p><p>“As I’ve ever been.” Agatha said honestly as she shut off the car. “No let’s go collect her things and head home.”</p>

<p>Agatha and Rio went in, got Evanora’s shit and left quickly. Agatha kept everything in the evidence bag and threw it on the passenger side floor before she started driving home.</p><p>“Can I snoop?” Rio asked as she grabbed the bag.</p><p>“You are more than welcome to, but I doubt you’ll find anything interesting.” Agatha said as she turned.</p><p>“You never know. Maybe she had a fat stack of cash on her.” Rio joked as she pulled the tab on the evidence bag and pulled out Evanora’s wallet.</p><p>“I highly doubt that.” Agatha said as she focused on the road. Rio opened the wallet and found the woman’s ID, a few credit cards, deep in a hard to access pocket there was a picture of Agatha as a child.</p><p>“Huh… I wasn’t expecting that.” Rio said honestly. As she pulled the photo out of the wallet and looked at it.</p><p>“What’s that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I assume it’s a photo of you.” Rio answered.</p><p>“How old do I look?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Maybe 3? Not sure. You were cute as fuck though.”</p><p>“Ah, Right before the diviner of the coven figured out I was powerless. Probably. She had so much hope for me to be a powerful illusionist like her. I think that was the last time I was happy… but I was so young I don’t remember it. Let me see the photo.” Agatha requested as she pulled up to a red light. Rio handed her the photo and Agatha looked at it before handing it back over to Rio.</p><p>“Goddesses above you were adorable!” Rio said gushing over the photo.</p><p>“That was the last photo taken of me as a child.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“You must be kidding? Really?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She became bitter quickly when she realized that I was of no use to her or the coven. Honestly I’m shocked that was in her wallet.” Agatha said to Rio.</p><p>“It wasn’t in a place that was easy to access. She might have just shoved it in there and forgotten about it. Is this the same wallet she had when you were a child?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I think so actually. So you might be right.” Agatha told Rio as they pulled into Agatha’s neighbor hood.</p><p>“I’m going to text Wanda real quick and tell her to meet us at your place.” Rio said as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>Rio 6:10 p.m: We are pulling up. New things have happened, meet us at Agatha’s please.</p><p>Wanda 6:10 p.m: coming! Bringing Lily if that’s okay?</p><p>Rio 6:10 p.m: that’s fine.</p><p>“She’s bringing Lily.” Rio said as Agatha parked the car.</p><p>“Perfect I wanted to ask about her interview.” Agatha said as she turned the car off. They both got out and headed inside the house.</p><p>Rio decided to try some clothing manipulation as she walked into the house and changed her suit into a gray pair of lounge pants and a baggy soft green tee that hung off one shoulder. She then focused on Agatha, a cute little pair of dark purple sleep shorts and a soft purple tank top appeared on the woman.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha said excitedly as she turned around. “Good job babe, but I feel like this is a little revealing.” Agatha said as she looked at herself. Rio took her in for a moment and then took two quick steps forward to place a hand on the heart on her chest.</p><p>“It changed!” Rio said as she softly placed three fingers on the sigil. A halo like crown with stars dotting it, was behind the heart sigil. Rio was instantly reminded of the night sky with clouds shining in the moonlight.</p><p>“How? What do you mean? I can’t really see it with your fingers on it.” Agatha said with a huff, she was trying to see it but couldn’t.</p><p>“There’s a crown resting on it. Did mine change?” Rio asked as she pulled her shirt down, a crown was resting on the heart shaped sigil as well.</p><p>“Gaia.” Agatha said as she traced her finger over the jagged crown that looked like it was made from branches.</p><p>“You called?” Gaia asked.</p><p>Both women looked over at the goddess who had a bright smile on her face. “Oh! I see you found them! Your crowns that is, they aren’t your real ones mind you. Just a temporary cap so to say. Once you die they will become real and we can talk about everything that entails. But right now they are in stasis.” Gaia reassured the women.</p><p>“Oh thank goddesses… I mean…” Agatha said floundering.</p><p>“It’s okay witchlett! Your welcome. Even though that’s not what you meant.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“So we are safe? No accidental ascension?” Rio asked as she trailed her finger over the spires of Agatha’s halo crown on her chest.</p><p>“Safe as safe can be. No need to stress too much. Now. Violet really wants to meet Wanda, so I’m gunna go home. I love you both so much, take good care of my daughter Rio. I’m counting on you.” Gaia said with a soft smile before she disappeared again.</p><p>“What is so important that I had to walk ALL the way over here.” Wanda complained as she opened the door. Lily followed Wanda into the house looking a little more energized than she did this morning.</p><p>“For starters, how did your interview go Lily?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“You’re looking at Stark Industries New Head of Botanical Research!” Lily said excitedly.</p><p>“Awesome! We have multiple reasons to celebrate tonight then!” Agatha said while pumping her fist in the air.</p><p>“What did you want to tell us?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Let’s all go sit down and we will call Violet and she can tell you.” Rio said as she ushered the women into the room.</p><p>“Good idea.” Agatha agreed as she made her way to the living room.</p><p>“Is it me or did Agatha get more confident in the last 12 hours?” Lily asked Wanda.</p><p>“I think the outfit she’s wearing is blinding you.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“I won’t deny Agatha is hot… but no, something changed.” Lily told Wanda as they walked into the living room.</p><p>“Thank you?” Agatha questioned as she plopped down into the L of the couch. Rio settled next to her and, then Wanda and Lily sat down on the opposite side of couch.</p><p>“Okay seriously, what happened?”</p><p>“Evanora Harkness died shortly after being incarcerated today…” Rio said trailing off.</p><p>“You have to be fucking kidding me!” Wanda yelled as she stood up, no woman could get a read on this reaction. “Why couldn’t she have saved us some fucking time and kicked the bucket sooner! Goddess  above I hate that cunt!”</p><p>“Told you she’d be pissed. Also Pepper reacted the same way.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Wait, we haven’t gotten to the good part.” Agatha soothed, Rio smiled at her when Wanda turned around and honed her eyes on Agatha.</p><p>“What’s the good part Agatha? I don’t see how any of this is good. She’s put you through hell, she’s been a horrible mother, she’s been a thorn in my side for the last 30 years, so what’s the good part? Please tell me!” Wanda ranted animatedly as she paced around the living room. This time, time didn’t slow to a halt, but they all felt something in the room shift.</p><p>“Well that’s where I come in! Nice to actually meet you Wanda! I’m Violet Vidal, aka Death.” The woman said from behind Wanda. Lily, Agatha, and Rio could see the bright smile painting the normal looking woman’s face. Wanda turned around and looked over the woman for a long moment.</p><p>“I’m not dying today, so how come I can see you?” Wanda asked defensively.</p><p>“Because the Goddess Gaia has decided you deserve a gift for taking such good care of Agatha the last 30 years. I’m just here to share the memory of Evanora’s death with you.” Violet explained to Wanda.</p><p>“I uh… can I have an explanation?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Nah, I think you’ll enjoy this unfiltered. Now come here.” Violet said as she reached for Wanda’s face.  Wanda sighed but didn’t argue as she let Violet take her face into her hands and pressed her forehead to her own. A bright white flash happened in Wanda’s mind as the memories started to flood in.</p><p>~</p><p>“Do you really think you won?”</p><p>“I think I’m free from all these fucking Hexes.” Evanora hissed at the entity.</p><p>“Yes, but at what cost? All that chaos energy that was clinging to your body was the only magical energy you had left…Don’t you see? Wanda Maximoff’s hexes were the only thing keeping you alive. Your body can’t keep up now that it’s got no juice left.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Evanora asked in a fear filled tone, her eyes widening.</p><p>“You’ve always been destined to die this way you know… alone, scared, and confused. Just the way you made your daughter feel.” Death hissed out as she floated closer. “If you’re lucky you’ll make it through the week, but you’ve never been lucky Evanora now have you?”</p><p>“No! No! I’m finally free! You can’t take me! It’s not fair!” Evanora screamed at the deity floating around her. Her face contorting and twisting as death inched closer.</p><p>“Life isn’t fair. You got as much time as you got, and more time than you ever deserved. Now, are you going to keep fighting me or are you going to come willingly?” Death asked as she held her scythe above Evanora’s head.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Evanora screamed out.</p><p>“Wrong answer Evanora.” Death screeched out with a thousand voices, her scythe slicing through her soul and plucking it from her body. Leaving the woman’s corpse crumpled on the floor.</p><p>“Now, you get to experience the fear and torment you put your daughter through for the next century. I’m throwing you in a pit and forgetting about you.” Death said as she opened a portal and dragged her through it.</p><p>“No! It’s not fair!”</p><p>“You keep saying that, but unfortunately for you it’s more than fair.” Death said as she dropped the woman into the void and walked out.</p><p>~</p><p>Violet pulled her head away from Wanda’s and let her go with a smile. Wanda’s face split into a wide grin before she begun to cackle, a genuine witches cackle.</p><p>“Excuse me!?” Wanda said excitedly. “That’s not real! You have to be pulling my leg!”</p><p>“I promise you it’s not a joke dear. That’s exactly what happened. I would never fuck around like that.” Violet reassured.</p><p>“Goddesses, I could kiss you! That is the greatest gift! I won’t, because you have a wife and I have a girlfriend. But still! Thank you! Can I hug you?” Wanda rushed out excitedly.</p><p>“Yes, you can. I’m not going to hurt you.” Violet answered and Wanda scooped her into a hug so fast and squeezed her so tight.</p><p>“Thank you! Goddesses that was so gratifying!” Wanda said as she let Violet go and she started dancing around the room. “Ding dong! The witch is dead!”</p><p>“That’s the reaction I was expecting.” Agatha said with a bright smile as she pointed at Wanda. Rio just shook her head at Wanda’s antics.</p><p>“Unfortunately I cannot stay much longer to watch this unfold. I have things to do, bodies to collect, and a wife gossiping with Gaia still I’m sure.” Violet said with a sigh. “I’m sure you’ll tell Wanda all about that as well, she deserves to know. These two will never ascend like you two but their connection will get deeper over time.” Violet explained to Rio and Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah we can do that. Have a goodnight grandma!” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Goodnight girls!” Violet said with a smile before she clipped out of the room.</p><p>“Okay, what about Gaia?” Lily asked Rio and Agatha while Wanda continued to dance around the living room singing happily to herself.</p><p>“Oh, we met her today. She’s decided to adopt me and is my new mother. She also put these sigils on our heart sigils that represent our crowns. The heart sigils weren’t supposed to show up until we died.” Agatha explained to Lily, Wanda paused and turned to look at Agatha.</p><p>“Wait, what was that middle bit?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“The fact that I’m dating the daughter of a goddess?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yeah, that.” Wanda said before she walked over to Agatha. “What do you mean Gaia adopted you?”</p><p>“Can I give you the cliff notes version, please?” Agatha requested.</p><p>“No. You don’t get to just skim over this.” Wanda said seriously as she looked down at Agatha.</p><p>“Fine. Let me get some wine, and we can order some food and sit down and actually talk about everything. Discuss what you want while I get the wine.” Agatha said with a sigh as she stood up.</p><p>“Do you want some help Agatha?” Lily asked as she stood up.</p><p>“I’d appreciate it. Thank you.” Agatha said as she made her way to the kitchen with Lily, leaving Rio and Wanda in the living room.</p><p>“What’s the plan?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Keep her happy? I don’t know how she’s going to be once the sun goes down. Honestly, she seems fine right now. But I have no idea.” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“I have to go check on my Aunt at some point are you two staying here?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’ll be staying, I don’t know about Lily.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“Don’t you two want to celebrate her getting the job?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“Lily knows Agatha comes first right now.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Yes…. But all the magical energy you have…” Rio implied the need to burn the energy off without saying it.</p><p>“I’ll be fine.” Wanda said as she plopped down next to Rio.</p><p>“I do want to bring something up that might help with that but I don’t know how much you and Agatha talk about sex.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I mean Agatha really only did one night stands before you, I kinda was the same. If the sex was good we’d mentioned it to each other. If the sex was horrible we’d spend hours bitching about them.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“She doesn’t know about the magic trick babe.” Agatha said as she walked into the living room carrying two glasses of wine. She handed one to Rio as she sat down. Lily was carrying the other two glasses of wine.</p><p>“What magic trick?” Lily asked as she handed Wanda a glass of wine.</p><p>“This is about to get very personal.” Agatha told Wanda and Lily.</p><p>“Like that’s ever deterred me before. Spill.” Wanda said as she took a sip of wine.</p><p>“I created a spell that makes your strap on feel like it’s actually a part of you. So you can feel everything.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Share that with me right now.”  Wanda said in an aggressive tone, she needed that spell.</p><p>“That’s the problem… it’s something I have to make. I don’t actually have a spell for it. It’s more an intention than anything.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh….”</p><p>“I mean.. I could.. make you both your own. But that requires a few things.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I didn’t think about that when I suggested this.” Rio said honestly, realizing they would be possibly learning more than they wanted.</p><p>“It’s possible, it’s just something that might not be comfortable for Lily.” Agatha explained, looking over at the blonde.</p><p>“I’m more curious than I am embarrassed. I’d love to know more.” Lily said honestly.</p><p>“Describe your perfect dildo, length, girth, texture if that’s something you want. Then I can make it for you. I want this to be the most enjoyable experience for both parties if I’m going to make one. If you already have a toy you prefer… that might make it easier. The spell will be personalized as well so you can’t use the same one.”</p><p>“I’ve never used one honestly.” Lily answered.</p><p>“A toy? Or a strap on?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Both.” Lily told the group. Wanda turned and looked at Lily, for a moment.</p><p>“Is that something you’d be interested in trying? I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.” Wanda asked trying to make Lily as comfortable as possible.</p><p>“I’d like to try it, it’s more appealing now knowing you’ll be able to feel it as well.” Lily said honestly.</p><p>“We can shelve this for now…” Agatha offered. “I know Wanda’s never been on the giving end of one… as far as I’m aware so it’s going to be a learning experience for both of you.”</p><p>“Way to call me out Agatha!” Wanda scolded!</p><p>“What!? It’s the truth!” Agatha said with a shrug. A bright blush painted Wanda’s face, which caused Rio to burst out laughing at Wanda.</p><p>“Don’t be embarrassed, it will be a new experience for both of us Wanda.” Lily reassured as she took her hand.</p><p>“Awe, you two are perfect for each other.” Rio teased.</p><p>“Wait! I just had a magnificent idea!” Agatha said as she got up from the couch and magicked her spell book into her hands. She started flipping through the pages and read something. “I was working on enchanting clothing a while ago… maybe I can just enchant a harness…” Agatha said as she landed on a page. She sat back down and handed Wanda the book.</p><p>“What am I looking at.” Wanda said as she looked over the page.</p><p>“Right here. I was working on an incantation. It never seemed to work right. I don’t know if it was not having enough power to put into it or what.” Agatha said as she pointed in the book.</p><p>“That’s illusion magic. I can’t touch that even if I wanted!” Wanda said in an exasperated tone</p><p>“I’ll make you the harness and enchant it so that it spreads the magical energy into the toy, so do you both want one?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Why can’t we share?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Because the spell will be personalized to you. The harness will act as an extension of you and only you.” Rio explained.</p><p>“How do you…. Never mind.” Wanda started to ask.</p><p>“No Wanda, ask. I wanna hear this question.” Rio jabbed.</p><p>“I figured it out Rio.” Wanda said as she shook her head. While Agatha sat down and contemplated how to get this spell to work with just a harness, so that it would extend to the toy.</p><p>“Alright, I think I’ve got it! Unless you want personalized toys?” Agatha said as she looked over at the women.</p><p>“Let’s just go with the harnesses for now and if they don’t work like we think they should we can do the toy’s later.” Lily requested.</p><p>“Wanda come here. Stand in front of me.” Agatha said as she sat up a little better. Wanda sighed and handed Lily her drink and stood up in front of Agatha who looked up at her best friend. “Consent to tug on your magic?”</p><p>“Of course. I wanna try this out!” Wanda said excitedly. She then felt Agatha’s magic start to tug and pull on hers as Agatha held her hands at pelvis level. A moment later the harness was wrapped around Wanda’s waist over her pants.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help herself, a muffled laugh slipped out. If she had been drinking she would’ve spit it out. “Nice color babe.” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“It suits her! The harness is also based off her magic.” Agatha said as she pointed at the bright red leather harness.</p><p>“Over my pants? Really?” Wanda scolded.</p><p>“Fine” Agatha said with a wave of her hand and it was under her pants, tightly strapped to her legs and waist.</p><p>“You couldn’t put it in my nightstand at home?” Wanda said with a huff as she sat down on the couch.</p><p>“I’m not feeling that nice.” Agatha said with a chuckle, before she looked at Lily. “Your turn sweetie.”</p><p>Lily got up and walked over to Agatha and stood up in front of the woman. Agatha looked up at Lily and smiled before asking. “Consent to tug in your magic? Might feel a little weird the first time. Nothing like the connection you and Wanda have. More like it feels like someone’s plucking on your soul.”</p><p>“Yes, I trust you to not do anything weird.” Lily said as she looked down at Agatha. Agatha started doing the same motions that she had done with Wanda and a few moments later a bright pink harness settled on Lily’s hips.</p><p>“I’m noticing a pattern.” Rio said softly as she looked at the harness over Lily’s pants.</p><p>“I’ll magic yours to Wanda’s in a moment. Is it comfortable?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>“Yes. Thank you.” Lily said with a smile, then with a wave of her hand both harnesses were on Wanda’s bed.</p><p>“What pattern are you noticing Rio?” Lily asked a moment later.</p><p>“The harnesses are the color of our magic.” Rio answered.</p><p>“That tracks. I used their magic to make them. I think this could be considered spirit witch craft if I’m being honest.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Not to change the subject but I’m starving.”  Rio said as she looked at the group.</p><p>“Actually… I don’t think I’ve eaten since breakfast.” Agatha said realizing that it had been a long day.</p><p>“What are we ordering? I’m paying.” Wanda said excitedly as she plopped down.</p><p>“Pizza or Chinese?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“What do you want Agatha?” Lily asked.</p><p>“It’s your celebration Lily! You got the job.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Seriously? Aren’t we supposed to be comforting you?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Honestly I’m fine, I have seriously never felt more loved in my life than I do right now. I have this whole support system that has just grown and expanded over the last week and a half. My mother’s death is just the cherry on top. The last person that hated me for existing no longer does. So I promise you all. I’m fine.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Fine… Chinese sounds good!” Lily answered.</p><p>“Great. Wanda isn’t allowed to order.” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“Oh come on!” Wanda said in an exasperated tone.</p>

<p>“Why isn’t Wanda allowed to order food?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Because the last time she ordered Chinese she ordered like 6 orders of Crab Rangoons! And that was all we ate!” Rio said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Wanda! No egg rolls?!” Lily scolded as she shoved Wanda playfully.</p><p>“Hey, my best friend was sad. I got her favorite thing. Now what are we eating?” Wanda said as she pulled her phone out.</p><p>“Nuh uh! Not happening you chaos gremlin! You tell me what you want and I’ll pay this time.” Rio said as she pulled her phone out.</p><p>“How about I get my iPad and everyone just orders what they want, then I pay.” Agatha offered as she magicked her iPad into her hands and pulled up the website for the restaurant. She handed the iPad to Wanda. “You order first.”</p><p>“No fun. Fine. But I am getting at least two orders of Crab Rangoons!” Wanda said as she ordered her food. She then handed Lily the iPad so she could order. Lily ordered her food before handing the iPad across to Agatha and Rio. Agatha handed the iPad to Rio so she could order food. Then once Rio was finished Agatha put in her order and checked everything over and ordered their dinner.</p><p>“Thank you for not being absolutely chaotic Wanda.” Agatha said after she set her iPad down.</p><p>“Soooo.” Wanda started to ask.</p><p>“Just ask.” Agatha told the redhead next to her.</p><p>“You were adopted by our Goddess?” Wanda asked looking over at her best friend who was sipping her wine.</p><p>“I was really hoping the strap on thing would’ve distracted you.” Agatha said with a grumble as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“I’m a chaos witch, you can’t distract me that easily. I have a million things running around up here at once.” Wanda said as she tapped her temple.</p><p>“I think that’s just called ADHD.” Rio joked.  Agatha laughed softly at her best friend and partner.</p><p>“So when do you start your new job Lily?” Agatha asked, trying to distract them all again.</p><p>“Nuh uh! Stop trying to get out of this Harkness!” Wanda scolded, knowing exactly what her best friend was doing.</p><p>“Ugh! Fine! Seriously I don’t know what to tell you other than I’ve been adopted by a goddess!” Agatha grumbled out.</p><p>“Yes, but what does that mean? Are you a Demi-god now? are you the same person but more loved? What is it?” Wanda pried trying to get any information she could out of the raven haired woman next to her.</p><p>“I don’t know. I mean I could call her and ask but she’s a busy lady and I don’t want to bother her.” Agatha said with a sigh. She was exhausted and today had been a very long day. It wasn’t like she had a ton of answers for her best friend.</p><p>“You will never be a bother to me, my sweet girl! To answer Wanda’s questions though. She’s the same person she’s always been. She just can call me whenever she needs. She’s already extremely powerful, so no need for the title of Demi-goddess. Also I’m really not that busy… Everything is pretty self sustaining if I’m being honest. I could take a hundred years off and nothing would change.” Gaia told the group of women in the living room.</p><p>“Holy shit!” Wanda said in awe of the goddess in front of her. Rio was sitting on the couch just absolutely unfazed by the fact that another deity had popped into her fiancé’s living room.</p><p>“Wow. You are so beautiful, I mean I knew you were but wow!” Lily said in shock, her filter failing her the second she seen Gaia.</p><p>“Thank you. Any other questions Wanda?”</p><p>“How many am I allowed to ask?” Wanda asked as she looked at the glowing goddess in front of her.</p><p>“As many as you want, I’ll decide if they are worth answering.</p><p>“Why Agatha? Not that she doesn’t deserve to be loved by you or anything but why her in particular?” Wanda asked trying to figure things out.</p><p>“Oh! So we are asking the heavy ones first. Got it. Move over. I wanna sit down.” Gaia said as she patted Agatha on the leg. Rio slid over into the corner of the L on the couch and pulled Agatha into her arms.  Gaia sat down next to Agatha and placed her hand on her knee.</p><p>“This one right here has been through more hellish torment than most. She’s experienced things that children never should, and yes to me you are all children. But she’s special. Whether she realizes it or not, she is one of the most unique witches I have ever had the privilege of meeting. She has endured so much and is so powerful. She just hasn’t unlocked every ability she has yet. One day, a long time from now she will take her place as a goddess. But right now I just want her to experience being human. She deserves that.” Gaia explained before she looked at Agatha and smiled softly. “You deserve all the love in the universe witchlett, I’m sorry it took so long for it to come to fruition.”</p><p>“Stop, I will cry.” Agatha said with a lump in her throat. She felt overwhelmed by all the love in the room. She wanted to flee but Rio was holding her close, anchoring her in her spot.</p><p>“Tears are a good thing sweetheart. Nothing to be ashamed of for that. I promise. Now, what’s your next question Wanda?” Gaia reassured Agatha softly as she soothed a hand up and down the young woman’s leg.</p><p>“Is this going to be a normal occurrence? You just popping in whenever you’d like?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Only when Agatha is too stressed or needs me. Sorry sweetheart I could tell that you didn’t have answers for Wanda, or that you just didn’t want to talk about this in general. But I promise it’s okay. You are safe. Look at all the people in your life who show up in mass.” Gaia answered before turning back to Agatha.</p><p>“It’s just a lot to take in all at once…” Agatha said trailing off.</p><p>“It is, but I know how strong you are. But right now, in this moment. You are allowed to be weak. You have an amazing support system. You are loved.” Gaia told Agatha who actually started crying softly. Rio held her closer and kissed the side of her head and soothed her hands over Agatha’s arms. Agatha felt her body shake slightly but she held it together. Wanda quickly got up and settled on the floor next to her legs and pressed her face to her knee as she wrapped her arms around the one Gaia wasn’t touching.</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay. We are here. You can cry all you want but that’s not going to scare us off.” Wanda said softly, which made Gaia smile brightly at the redhead on the floor. They were all soothing Agatha in the best way they knew how by allowing her this moment.</p><p>The doorbell rang a moment later, and they all froze. “I’ve got it.” Lily said as she got up from the couch and made her way to the front door to collect their food. A few minutes later she came back into the living room carrying 2 large bags and set them on the coffee table.</p><p>“Thank you Lily.” Rio said softly as she held Agatha close. Agatha was still trying to compose herself and failing.</p><p>“No problem. I’m gunna go grab the wine from the kitchen and some silverware. Does anyone want anything else?” Lily asked the group.</p><p>“I’d love a glass of wine as well. I think I’ll stay and hang out with you girls tonight.” Gaia said softly as she watched Lily walk toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Momma no, you don’t have to do that.” Agatha said weakly, not even realizing what she said. Gaia felt her heart soar, as she smiled brightly at Agatha.</p><p>“Oh my sweet girl. I do, and I am. You are far more important right now than anything that may need my attention.” Gaia reassured as Lily walked back into the room and handed Gaia a glass of wine, making sure to not touch the Goddess.</p><p>“It’s utterly unfair.” Agatha whispered, feeling overwhelmed by all the love.</p><p>“What is Witchlett?” Gaia questioned softly, knowing Agatha was feeling helpless.</p><p>“How you all ganged up on me! My heart hurts so much!” Agatha told them, her voice cracking with emotion as she tried to calm herself down.</p><p>“How dare we love you? Is that what you’re saying?” Rio asked, as she squeezed Agatha tighter.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said weakly.</p><p>“Those pains you feel in your chest will settle into something amazing soon. I promise. But right now it’s gunna hurt a little, but this time it’s a good hurt.” Gaia reassured. “Now! You girls need to eat dinner.” Gaia said with a wave of her hand. The food started unpacking itself from the bags.</p><p>Wanda pulled away from  Agatha slightly so she could get her something to eat, Wanda opened the containers and grabbed the Crab Rangoons out for Agatha along with the sweet and sour sauce. She handed the food to Agatha and then looked at Rio. “What did you order?”</p><p>“Chicken lo-mein, but I can wait to eat.” Rio reassured, both her arms were wrapped around Agatha.</p><p>“No, let me go. You need to eat, please babe.” Agatha asked softly as she tried to wiggle out of Rio’s grasp. Gaia gladly threw an arm over Agatha’s shoulder and pulled her in.</p><p>“Fine, but only because it smells good.” Rio said with a huff as she let Agatha go and reached for the food Wanda was holding out for her. Lily had grabbed the food she ordered and settled on the floor in front of the coffee table. She was happily eating her food as she watched the small family interact.</p><p>“You will be just as comfortable as Wanda is with these two soon enough. Thank you for the wine.” Gaia reassured Lily.</p><p>“You’re welcome! I’m sure of it, I’m already pretty comfortable, I just didn’t want to overwhelm Agatha.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Too late for that! I’m so overwhelmed.” Agatha said after she finished chewing her bite of food. Rio smiled softly at her and gave her a kiss on the cheek before she took a bite of her own food.</p><p>“Did you have any other questions Wanda?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“I mean about a million, but nothing that matters. I do want to thank you for allowing Death to show me that earlier.” Wanda said with a smile as she opened a box of Crab Rangoons for herself.</p><p>“You’re welcome! I’ll be paying her a little visit tomorrow as well.” Gaia said honestly causing the women in the room to look at her with confusion.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Most souls get the chance for reincarnation. Especially witches. She never will.” Gaia explained before she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha said honestly before she stuffed another bite of Crab Rangoon into her mouth. “Wanda can I have my orange chicken please?” Agatha asked her best friend.  Wanda turned around and grabbed the orange chicken and a box of rice. Agatha magicked a bowl into her lap and put some of each item into it before she handed the take out containers back to Wanda.</p><p>“Can I ask a question?” Lily asked Gaia.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Can you explain the magical connection-compatibility thing to all of us? I feel like we are stumbling through the dark a little.” Lily asked trying to understand. Agatha paused mid bite and looked over at Lily.</p><p>“That is actually a very good question that even I want the answer to!” Agatha responded before she went back to eating her dinner.</p><p>“It’s simple really. Every witch has a weak point. Rio is phenomenal at analog magic, Agatha has always struggled with that because her birth giver never taught her anything. Rio doesn’t struggle much with anything because of who she was meant to be but this shared connection with Agatha will make her job in the future much easier. When it comes to you two in particular you have always been one to just let things happen, go with the flow. Your magic is the calm in Wanda’s storm of chaos. You two will balance each other out.” Gaia said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s not exactly what I was asking.” Lily said with a sigh unsure of how to ask this question.</p><p>“Oh, are you looking for how each connection deepens and the way we unlock them? Agatha and Rio managed to do all this in a week?” Lily asked waving at the women.</p><p>“Remember Agatha is a whole coven rolled into one? That has a lot to do with it, her and Rio’s magical connection is much deeper than any I’ve ever seen here on the mortal plane. They are the exception, not the rule. The deepest yours and Wanda’s will go is the rings. As for how you unlock them, it’s about having a deep intimate connection.” Gaia answered.</p><p>“So we have to have lots of sex? Is that how you two unlocked it?” Wanda asked as she poked Agatha in the thigh with her fork. A blush creeped up into Agatha’s face as she realized her best friend said that in front of her adoptive mother.</p><p>“Really Wanda?” Agatha asked in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Yes? No? I don’t know, I think we just were enjoying each other.” Rio explained.</p><p>“That’s a good way to do it, enjoy and live the experience. The sigils will show up when they show up. There’s nothing you can do to expedite it. It happens when it happens.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Makes sense. Can’t rush perfection.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Says the witch who found her magical soulmate and put a ring on it in less than a week.” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“I’m special. Deal with it.” Rio teased before she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“Momma, how am I going to put up with these two for the rest of my life?” Agatha asked Gaia.</p><p>“Lily is the blessing on that one, she will become your ally in arms against these two. When they get up to shenanigans.” Gaia explained to her daughter.</p><p>“Good, we can gang up on them together Lily.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“I’m game. Someone’s gotta keep them in line.” Lily said with a smile as she looked at Wanda and Rio. Their faces falling instantly.</p><p>“Wait! no… you aren’t allowed to team up against us!” Wanda said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Yeah wait a second babe, let’s talk about this…” Rio said in a nervous tone.</p><p>“Oh? I think we are, I mean you two have ganged up on me a few times this week. Maybe Lily and I will give you two a taste of your own medicine.” Agatha suggested before she winked at Lily. Rio and Wanda looked at each other like they were scared for a long moment.</p><p>“I think I can manage that. Wanda needs to be put in her place for once.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“We are so fucked Vidal.” Wanda said to Rio.</p><p>“Speak for yourself. I’m well behaved compared to you.” Rio told Wanda, which caused Agatha, Lily and Gaia to laugh at the panicked look on Wanda’s face.</p><p>“I don’t like this.” Wanda said sadly.</p><p>“You will live.” Agatha said as she patted her best friend on the head. The women settled into a comfortable silence and just went back to eating their dinner.</p><p>Once everyone was finished eating Agatha waved her hand and the food was magically put away, Wanda’s and Lily’s food was teleported into their fridge and while Agatha’s and Rio’s was put into her fridge. They all cuddled up on the couch together, Lily and Wanda were careful not to actually touch Gaia.</p><p>“I don’t know why but something in my souls  telling me I shouldn’t touch you.” Wanda said as she cuddled up with Lily.</p><p>“Good. Listen to it. It’s telling you that for a reason. Not that I’d hurt you. But it might not be a pleasant experience for you.” Gaia said to the woman next to her.</p><p>“I believe that. I knew Agatha was powerful, I just didn’t realize how much until she so casually touched a goddess with out flinching.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“I think it’s more because she decided I’m hers. But Rio seems to be able to touch her just fine.” Agatha said from her spot between Gaia and Rio.</p><p>“That’s because she’s next in line to be Death. She’s technically a Demi-god sweetie.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha said as she came to the realization that she was far more special than even she had thought.</p><p>“There it is! Finally. Took you long enough!” Gaia said excitedly.</p><p>“What?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Someone just realized how special she really is! Now you girls have a great night. I have things I need to attend to. I love you all very much. But you the most.” Gaia said as she softly tapped Agatha on the nose before pulling her into a hug and giving her a kiss on her temple. Then Gaia was gone, leaving them alone in Agatha’s living room.</p><p>“Wonder what’s so important?” Rio joked.</p><p>“No clue… anyway. Let’s get wine drunk and watch a stupid movie. I don’t want to think about life anymore today.” Agatha said with a sigh as she magicked the remote into her hand. Wanda and Lily scooted over and they all cuddled in a pile on the couch as Agatha turned on the tv.</p><p>~Meanwhile in some dark pit~</p><p>A bright flash of light illuminated the Darkness, as Gaia’s light flooded the pit Death threw Evanora in.</p><p>“You! You horrible creature! I don’t know how you slipped through the cracks last time you reincarnated but this time. I’ll make sure you never escape your cage!” Gaia said to the vile woman floating in the void.</p><p>“Fuck off Gaia!” Evanora screamed at the goddess.</p><p>“Starting to remember who you actually are? You know if you had been a good mother… all of this could’ve been avoided. But you always mess up don’t you?” Gaia asked as she walked closer. Evanora sunk into herself as much as she could, Gaia’s light was blinding after being in the dark for so long.</p><p>“I’ll get out again.” Evanora hissed.</p><p>“No, you won’t. This time I’m eliminating you. You don’t even get the hundred year punishment you deserve. All you’ve ever been is a cockroach that persists to come back time and time again. I’m tired. So very tired of you and your behavior. We are done.” Gaia said as she reached forward and grabbed Evanora by her neck. She stood up and held the woman above her head.</p><p>“With this spell, I cleanse the universe of your pestilence. I cleanse everything you’ve ever touched with your ichor, the vile hatred you spread shall die with you. I will make sure there’s nothing left of you for your souls to regenerate from. You’ve gone too far this time.” Gaia said as a bright energy started to spread from her hand down Evanora’s throat.</p><p>“Wait! We can talk about this! We can come to an agreement!” Evanora tried to barter as she grappled at the hand on her throat.</p><p>“I’m done giving you grace. Every life time, every iteration of you has created a spirit witch, and I am DONE. You’re out of chances.” Gaia said as the light spread and started to incinerate her soul. The light flashing brightly as Evanora’s body broke into pieces.</p><p>“What if she wants to face me!” Evanora screamed one final plea in hopes of getting out of this with her soul intact.</p><p>“Then when she becomes a goddess she can resurrect you. I’ll lock your broken soul in boxes in the deepest recesses of the universe, far far away from anywhere you could ever cause any damage. But for now you are going to experience this pain, and I’m locking you away. No chance of reincarnation, no light, nothing but darkness, pain, suffering, and the feeling of being incomplete. You won’t even know how long it has been since you felt anything besides the pain you are experiencing. I AM DONE. I’m sick of being kind and giving you grace. You’ve proven you don’t deserve it.” Gaia said as she blasted the woman’s soul with pure light, it fell apart in a crumpled heap in the floor. Leaving what looked to be glowing fragments of soul on the floor. With a wave of her hand Evanora’s soul was boxed in multiple boxes and sent to the darkest corners of the universe.</p><p>“Get fucked Evanora. You cunt.” Gaia said as she left the space Violet had created just for her. Now she needed to talk to Violet again. She decided to just head to Violets domain this time. She loved the deep lush forest the cabin Violet and Rosaline resided in.</p><p>Gaia walked up to the door and knocked before she waited a long moment. Rosaline opened it a moment later and smiled brightly when she realized it was Gaia.</p><p>“Gaia! Nice to see you again! What do I owe the pleasure?” Rosaline asked as she opened the door and let her into the cabin.</p><p>“I destroyed Evanora Harkness’s soul.” Gaia said passively as she walked inside.  Rosaline paused for a long moment before she turned around and looked at Gaia.</p><p>“Violet isn’t here.” Rosaline said with a huff.</p><p>“I can wait. I’ll summon some ambrosia and we can chat.” Gaia said as she made glasses of the golden nectar appear in their hands.</p><p>“Sounds delightful. Let’s go hang out in the living room.” Rosaline said as she walked toward the living area. Both women settled in the couch and started talking about everything that had happened over the last few days.</p>

<p>The next morning Agatha and Rio woke up before Lily and Wanda who had decided to stay in the guest room the night before. Rio had opened a portal to her apartment and checked on Lilia last night before they went to bed. The woman promised that she would  stop at the book store before she headed home.</p><p>“I think I’m going to open a portal back to my apartment and head to work from there after checking on Lilia again. Thank you for making her one babe.” Rio said as she took a bite of her breakfast sandwich Agatha had made.</p><p>“That’s fine I have court today. Lily when do you officially start working?” Agatha told Rio before turning to ask Lily.</p><p>“Tomorrow. Orientation at Stark Tower, then I get to meet my team on Thursday and probably clean house.” Lily said honestly.</p><p>“Did Tony give you permission to do that?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“He said I could start with a clean slate if I wanted. Which I don’t. But it’s an option.” Lily answered.</p><p>“Good to know. Alright everyone let’s get headed out. I have lots of work to catch up on after this past week.” Agatha said in a serious tone as she waved her hand and cleaned the kitchen. Purple magic flooding the room as she did.</p><p>“I’ll see you tonight.” Agatha told Rio before she kissed her softly on the lips. Rio grabbed the sandwich for Lilia before she walked through the portal she had opened in the hall closet.</p><p>“Alright, love you. Have a good day!” Wanda said as she dragged Lily out the door. Agatha magicked her things into her hands and made her way to her car.</p><p>~At Rio’s apartment.~</p><p>“Aunt Lilia! I brought you breakfast.” Rio said as she walked in her front door.</p><p>“Perfect, you have no food here! How do you live?” Lilia said as she walked out of the living room. Rio handed her the breakfast sandwich and grabbed her keys off the counter.</p><p>“Are you gunna check out the city today or are you headed home?” Rio asked Lilia.</p><p>“I think I’ll be headed home but I think I’ll be coming to dinner on Saturday.” Lilia told Rio as she took a bite of her sandwich. “This is good!”</p><p>“Agatha made that by the way.” Rio told her.</p><p>“And now I know why there’s no food here.” Lilia said with an eye roll as she continued to eat her breakfast.</p><p>“Can I ask you a question?” Rio asked.</p><p>“For once you are actually going to ask me for something!? Really?” Lilia teased.</p><p>“Two names. I need two names of employees that will work out and be a good fit for the store.” Rio requested.</p><p>“Oh darn. I thought you were going to ask me for something else. Fine. Sage and Rowen. Those two are the best fit. I won’t say anything else.” Lilia told Rio before she finished her sandwich.</p><p>“Tell Agatha I said thank you and her cooking is delightful.” Lilia said before she gave her a hug.</p><p>“I will, or you can if you come to dinner on Saturday.” Rio offered.</p><p>“That might be worth the trip. I love you witchlett, have a good day.” Lilia said as she collected her things and walked out the door.</p><p>~Wanda’s Place~</p><p>“Do you want me to call off today?” Wanda asked Lily as they walked over to their cars.</p><p>“No it’s fine, I need to call my parents and tell them I got the job. Then clean my apartment.”  Lily said with a smile before she gave Wanda a kiss.</p><p>“Or we could go shopping and spend the day in bed.” Wanda suggested softly as she brought her hand up to caress her neck and pull her close.</p><p>“As tempting as that sounds. You should go to work. I’ll go shopping today and pick up a couple toys for us to test out. Send me photos of what you think you might like.” Lily said as she pulled away and made her way to her car.</p><p>“Not helping!” Wanda said in a frustrated tone as she walked toward her house so she could get dressed and head to work.</p><p>~Stark Law Firm Peppers Office~</p><p>Pepper was sitting at her desk reading over Evanora’s final will and testament. Her brow was furrowed as she looked over the document. It was updated a year after Agatha’s birth.</p><p>“Why did you never update this?” Pepper wondered aloud as she continued to read. She grabbed her phone and dialed Tricia. The phone rang once before Agatha’s secretary picked up.</p><p>“Hello Mrs. Potts, Ms. Harkness is in court until after lunch. Is there anything I can assist you with or would you like to leave a message?” Tricia asked the women on the phone.</p><p>“Just tell her I’d like to see her when she gets back. No rush or anything I just have some interesting news for her.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“Can do, have a good day Mrs. Potts.” Tricia said into the phone before waiting.</p><p>“You as well Tricia.” Pepper said before hanging the phone up.</p><p>Pepper sighed loudly as she started reading over the document. She felt so confused by everything that was stated in it, she literally left every worldly possession to Agatha. It just made no sense to Pepper that after all these years she never bothered to change it. She really wanted to talk to Agatha but she knew she had to be patient so she settled for calling her husband.</p><p>She picked her phone up and dialed Tony. It rang once before her husband picked up. “Heya Pepperoni! What’s up?” Tony asked off in the distance.</p><p>“I’m reading over Evanora’s last will and testament… and it’s confusing me.” Pepper told her husband.</p><p>“How many of those spells did Maximoff have on this woman again?” Tony asked.</p><p>“Yeah but that was after they turned 16. The last time she updated this document was right after Agatha’s first birthday…” Pepper said in a confused tone. Like she couldn’t understand why this was the last time she updated the document.</p><p>“Hey, maybe she got busy, then she got hexed. Who knows, not like you can call her up and be like ‘why didn’t you ever update this shit?’ She’s dead.” Tony said into the phone.</p><p>“Maybe… but now I have to force Agatha to take bereavement so she can get all this shit sorted out.” Pepper said with a sigh.</p><p>“Or just have her plan a vacation? Ask her what she wants to do? We can hire a company to go clean the house out for her so she doesn’t have to think about it?” Tony offered.</p><p>“Honey…. Evanora Harkness was alive for 250 years. She had stocks, bonds, bank accounts, and a plethora of other things lined up. She owned stocks in our company. She’s an original stock holder. The woman may have been a bitch, but she was financially well off.”</p><p>“How many?” Tony asked.</p><p>“You don’t want the answer to that question.” Pepper said nervously.</p><p>“Don’t tell me this woman was a major stock holder!” Tony said in a disgusted voice.</p><p>“Well… Now Agatha is… if that makes you feel any better.” Pepper told her husband.</p><p>“Hey Jarvis, how much was a Stark Industries stock when our company started?” Tony asked his computer.</p><p>“$0.25 sir. The current value of Stark Industries stocks is $20,000.”  Jarvis said over the intercom system.</p><p>“How many stocks does she have Pepper?”</p><p>“Tony let’s just hope she doesn’t decide to cash it all at once.” Pepper said with a shake of her head.</p><p>“Or retire….” Tony said with a sigh as he started looking up original stock holders.</p><p>“I doubt she’d retire. She likes her job too much.” Pepper told her husband.</p><p>“How did Evanora Harkness have so much money back then? Dad started this company during the war.” Tony pondered to himself.</p><p>“Let’s not get into the ethics of Evanora Harkness right now… let’s just say with everything that’s here she’s about to be in the same tax bracket as us.” Pepper told her husband.</p><p>“Are you actually worried she’s going to leave?” Tony asked his wife.</p><p>“No… maybe… this is a lot of money.” Pepper said to her husband.</p><p>“Well we will see. I doubt she’ll book it. Especially seeing as we are helping Rio out.” Tony explained.</p><p>“Or she could quit and just have a happy simple life working at the bookstore with her wife.” Pepper said in a worried tone.</p><p>“Stop stressing. We will cross that bridge when we get to it. I have no regrets about helping her or Rio out. I doubt Agatha will leave. She loves you too much to just bail.” Tony reassured his wife.</p><p>“You’re right.” Pepper said with a sigh as she continued to read over the paperwork.</p><p>“Did Evanora at least have a decent lawyer set everything up?” Tony asked.</p><p>“Yeah…. One of the best family and estate lawyers you can get. She didn’t use our firm in her case because she knew she was black listed by us.”</p><p>“It was your mother wasn’t it?” Tony asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Yeah, impressive really. I should call her and commend her on her work making sure Agatha would get every single penny.”</p><p>“Maybe you should. How about this. You call your mom, and I’ll be annoying somewhere else. Maybe have a moment of existential dread in the bathroom.”</p><p>“Don’t be a drama queen Tony.” Pepper said with a chuckle.</p><p>“It’s only a thousand stocks Tony.” Pepper reassured her husband who sputtered on the other end of the line.</p><p>“Insanity. Absolute insanity! I’m just glad it’s in Agatha’s hands now.” Tony said trying to calm himself down.</p><p>“It’s okay. If she decides to dump them. We will figure it out. I love you. I’m going to call my mom now.” Pepper told her husband before she continued. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.” Tony told his wife before she hung up.  Pepper then picked her cellphone up and called her mother on it.</p><p>“Pepper! What do I owe the pleasure on a Tuesday morning?” Peppers mother asked into the phone.</p><p>“Hi Mom. This is going to be a weird one but I have a question. Do you remember an Evanora Harkness coming into your office 35 years ago and getting an estate set up for her daughter?” Pepper asked into the phone.</p><p>“Yeah, that woman was loaded. She wanted to make sure her daughter could follow in her footsteps after she passed as America’s greatest illusionist witch.” Her mother explained into the phone.</p><p>“Do you have any idea why she would’ve never changed it?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Oh, that’s simple. She signed a document saying she wouldn’t edit or alter the document until her daughter was 50.  That way if something bad happened to her before she reached full witch maturity she would be taken care of.” Her mother explained.</p><p>“Where is it? I can’t find it anywhere.” Pepper asked her mother.</p><p>“Oh no, did the young woman’s mother pass?”</p><p>“Oh… wait… sorry, I forgot I haven’t talked to you in a few weeks. Evanora Harkness… wasn’t a good person or mother.  Honestly the reason I called you was to talk to you about this because I was so confused as to how this stayed this way.”</p><p>“Care to elaborate for your mother?”</p><p>“Long story short, Evanora Harkness turned into a horrible parent the second she found out Agatha wasn’t going to be Americas next great Illusionist witch. Agatha was born powerless.” Pepper explained to her mother.</p><p>“Oh… Wait.. is this the same Agatha that is a partner in your firm?”</p><p>“Yep.” Pepper told her mother, waiting for the dots to connect. She rarely talked to her mother about work. But when she did Agatha was usually brought up, but never her last name.</p><p>“But she’s a spirit witch isn’t she? Oh. Oh! I remember! Oh god, she’s the one that’s been harassing her daughter hasn’t she? She really fucked herself didn’t she?” Peppers mother asked.</p><p>“In more ways than even I can count I’m sure. But we’ve come to a few realizations when it comes to Agatha and being a spirit witch.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Cliffnotes?” Her mother asked.</p><p>“I’ll send you the notes from the court reporter, and you can read everything.” Pepper said as she started typing on her laptop.</p><p>“I’ll do that once we get off the phone. Did you need any other questions answered?”</p><p>“No, the why has been answered at least. I’m sorry I don’t call you more. I’ve been very busy lately.” Pepper told her mother.</p><p>“That’s okay, between running a law firm and keeping Tony in line I’m surprised you have time to sleep. I love you. I’ll text you after I read the documents.”</p><p>“Love you too mom. Try to have a good day.” Pepper said into her phone before hanging up. “I doubt she will after she reads that though.” Pepper mumbled to herself before she sent a text off to Tony.</p><p>Pepper 11:16 a.m: she had it set so that she couldn’t change it until Agatha turned 50. Just in case something bad happened, that way Agatha was guaranteed to be taken care of.</p><p>Tony 11:17 a.m: Oh the irony!</p><p>Pepper rolled her eyes at her husband before she set her phone down and closed her laptop. She needed a moment to not think about everything.  She leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes for a moment.  She was absolutely baffled by the way everything was happening lately.</p><p>Ten minutes later there was a knock on her door. “Come in.” Pepper said loud enough for the person to hear.</p><p>“You wanted to see me?” Agatha asked as she walked into the office.</p><p>“Yes, I did. I received all of your mother’s documentation this morning along with her final will and testament…”</p><p>“I’m sure she left everything to her coven.” Agatha said as she walked over to the chair in front of Peppers desk.</p><p>“Actually… No. She left everything to you. She had her will set up so that you would receive everything, financial assets, the home, all worldly possessions go to you. And before you ask, I contacted the lawyer who set this up and your mother had it sealed until you were 50 so she couldn’t edit the document until that point.” Pepper explained to Agatha.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.” Agatha said in a shocked and disbelieving tone. Pepper sighed and opened the document on her computer and turned the laptop toward Agatha before she got up and walked to the door.</p><p>“Read it, I’m going to have Timothy order lunch for us.” Pepper said as she stepped out of the office. Agatha grabbed the laptop and started reading the document, her whole world felt like it was spinning. Each asset that was listed just kept getting grander and grander as time went on. She felt a strange sinking feeling at the realization, she never had to worry about money again.</p><p>A soft hand on her shoulder pulled her from her downward spiral. She looked up to see Pepper smiling at her. “Welcome to the rich kid club.”</p><p>“I feel like this is some kind of sick joke.” Agatha said as she looked over the document.</p><p>“Funny, I thought the same thing until I called my mother and asked her about it.” Pepper said as she squeezed Agatha’s shoulder and then sat down in the seat next to Agatha.</p><p>“Your mother wrote this?” Agatha asked knowing the woman had a reputation for iron clad family documentation.</p><p>“The one and only. It’s real. Evanora Harkness really did fuck herself six ways to Tuesday with you… now for the hard part. You have to take bereavement. You have to go get this all sorted out.”</p><p>“No I don’t. Not right now. I can handle all of this at a later date.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Agatha…” Pepper warned the woman softly.</p><p>“I’d rather burn that house down than step foot in it ever again.” Agatha told Pepper.</p><p>“You can hire a company to clean it out if you want but I recommend just doing it yourself. Go in, take what you want or need. Cancel the insurance on it. Call the local fire department and offer it up for training and tell them you want it burned to the ground.” Pepper suggested.</p><p>“Now that’s the best idea you have ever had.” Agatha complemented a bright smile spreading across her face imagining the place up in flames.</p><p>“Hiring you was the best idea I ever had. But I’ll take the compliment. Now miss millionaire… what will you do with your new found financial freedom?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I’m not quitting, I like it here. I like my job. But I think I will be moving now that I can afford anything I want.” Agatha said with a smile, she was already making plans with this new found wealth.</p><p>“Moving?” Pepper questioned.</p><p>“Yeah, I think it’s time for a bigger house, closer to work and the book store. So Rio and I don’t have to commute as far. Fuck it! Maybe I’ll build one.” Agatha said with a smile setting her priorities on building a future with Rio.</p><p>“That… was not what I was expecting your reaction to be.” Pepper said honestly as Timothy walked into her office carrying two take out containers.</p><p>“Here you ladies go, I’ll fetch you something to drink as well. What would you like?” Timothy offered.</p><p>“No need, I’ve got that handled.” Agatha said as she waved her hand and two drinks appeared on Pepper’s desk. Timothy smiled and then walked out of the room.</p><p>“I know you’ve been stressed this week. If you want Tony and I can handle things?” Pepper offered.</p><p>“Honestly, I’m fine. I can get this sorted out, I appreciate it. I’ll talk to Tricia after lunch.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Take as much time as you need. Most of the money has started moving into your accounts though. Just as a warning, the coroner submitted her death certificate this morning. Off shores accounts might be a little more difficult, you’ll have to talk to her financial advisor. Which is in the email I was about to send you before you walked in.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Good to know. Thank you.” Agatha said appreciatively to Pepper before she opened her container Timothy had handed her and picked up the chicken wrap to take a bite of it.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re good?” Pepper asked nervously.</p><p>“What are you worried about?” Agatha asked as she set her wrap down.</p><p>“Honestly a lot has happened this week. I’m afraid you are going to have a mental break. Which is why I’m encouraging you to take your bereavement. Just as a little break. You also have so much accumulated time off… I’d rather you take a break than actually break.” Pepper told Agatha in a worried tone.</p><p>“Pepper, listen. I promise you. I’m fine. You, Rio, Wanda, and our literal goddess Gaia are here for me. Among several others. I am actually genuinely happy for the first time in my life. Let me get everything sorted out and make sure I have a clear week with no cases, hearings, meetings. Then I’ll take my bereavement. I promise.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Fine, eat your lunch. But if I notice you with even a hair out of place. I’m throwing you at Rio and deactivating your badge for a week.” Pepper threatened.</p><p>“You would never!” Agatha said in a sarcastic shocked tone. Pepper rolled her eyes at the woman and sighed.</p><p>“Don’t tempt me. I’ll do it at the end of the day Harkness.” Pepper scolded.</p><p>“I’ll behave. I promise. I’m fine. Now let me eat my lunch.” Agatha said before she picked her wrap back up and started eating.</p><p>“You know sometimes you confuse the living hell out of me.” Pepper said as she opened her own container and started eating.</p><p>“How so?” Agatha said with half a mouthful of food, covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>“How are you so composed all the time? Like most people who find out they are coming into this kind of money would be like ‘I’m quitting my job and buying an island.’ Or some other crazy outlandish shit! You are just over here like ‘yeah, I’m gunna buy a house and keep working my job.’ It’s almost too sensible.” Pepper explained before she took a bite of her own food.</p><p>“Yes… but most people only get 80 years on this planet. I can literally work this job for another 50 years and then happily ‘retire’ and live a happy life with my wife. I get a thousand or more. No point in rushing out and blowing it all in one sitting. Gotta think about the long term.” Agatha explained, to her it was as simple as talking about the weather.</p><p>“You suck, I always forget you think too far ahead.” Pepper told her.</p><p>“I’ve spent my whole life walking on egg shells. I learned to plan my moves before I made them. She may have been a horrible mother but I definitely learned a lot from her.” Agatha said before she popped the last bite of her food into her mouth and chewed slowly.</p><p>“I’m so glad you work for me. I’d hate to ever have to be against you in anything.” Pepper said honestly before she smiled at Agatha. “Go communicate with Tricia and take time off. Bosses orders.”</p><p>“Fine! I’ll go do that. Oh by the way, do you want Rio to cancel the contract with you and Tony? I’m sure I could finance her ambitions now.” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No! Sorry, no. I’d rather you not. Think of it as an engagement gift.”</p><p>“But.”</p><p>“No Agatha, no buts. Accept the gift. Please.” Pepper requested.</p><p>“Fine! Only because I’m too tired from everything to argue with you right now.” Agatha said with a sigh as she got up and headed toward the door. “Thanks for always taking care of me Pepper.” Agatha said softly before she darted out the door, not giving Pepper the chance to say another word.</p><p>Agatha made her way down to her office and stood next to Tricia’s desk for a moment. The blonde looked up at her with a raised brow.</p><p>“How may I assist you Ms. Harkness?” Tricia asked.</p><p>“How many meetings do I have next week?” Agatha asked as she peered toward the cubicles dotting the large space.</p><p>“A few. Nothing that can’t be rescheduled though. You have no hearings at all next week though, seems kind of slow. Why?”</p><p>“Reschedule those meetings for this week if you can. I’m being forced to take bereavement, seeing as I won’t be here, how about you take next week off as well. Spend time with your kids and husband.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“I’ll consider it.” Tricia said with a smile as she reached for her phone. “Let me start working on rescheduling your meetings. You have one in an hour also.”</p><p>“Thank you, I appreciate it.” Agatha said before she turned around and headed into her office. She sat down and pulled open her laptop. She opened the email from Pepper and decided to call the financial advisor her mother was using.  She found the number and grabbed her phone to call it.</p><p>“Thank you for calling Wicca and Co Finance. How may I assist you today?” A woman said politely into the phone.</p><p>“Hello my name is Agatha Harkness and I am calling to settle Evanora Harkness’s estate and finances.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“One moment.”  The woman said before the phone transferred to another person.</p><p>“Hello Ms. Harkness. Your lawyer sent over the death certificates. We are already working on getting everything transferred over to you. Is there something you would like expedited?” The man asked into the phone.</p><p>“No, I just wanted to touch base with you about the home.”</p><p>“It’s yours free and clear. She put it in a trust. If you have keys just go right on in. You can sell it, if you’d like.” The man offered.</p><p>“I’m intending to do something very special with it. Thank you. I’m sure Pepper Potts left you all my contact information.” Agatha assumed.</p><p>“She did.” The man answered her.</p><p>“Perfect. Alright. I’ll be in contact with you later this week. Thank you for your time.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Have a wonderful day Ms. Harkness.” The man told her before hanging up.  Agatha sighed loudly before she set the phone down on the receiver.</p><p>“I need my own financial advisor. Maybe I should just use the one Pepper and Tony use.” Agatha mused to herself.</p><p>‘Good afternoon my love.’ Rio said popping into her mind.</p><p>‘Good afternoon. Has Lilia left yet?’ Agatha asked softly.</p><p>‘She just did. I was wondering how you were doing?’</p><p>‘Fantastic. We have a ton to talk about tonight, do you want me to meet you after work?’ Agatha asked.</p><p>‘Sure, I set up two job postings already and Lilia told me who would be the best fit for the store.’ Rio explained before she quickly changed the subject  ‘I’ve got a customer. Sorry.’</p><p>‘Take your time my love.’ Agatha reassured before she went back to work.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll look at houses… or property.” Agatha said to herself as she opened up Zillow.</p>

<p>A few hours later Agatha had finished her meetings and found a couple places she liked that she wanted to check out next week while she was off and some land as a back up plan. But she wanted to talk to Rio first. So she tabbed the locations before packing up her brief case and heading out the door.</p><p>“Have a good night Tricia.” Agatha said to her secretary before heading toward the elevator.</p><p>“You as well Agatha.” Tricia replied back before Agatha had made it too far.</p><p>Agatha made her way down to the main lobby and exited the building. She still had Evanora’s keys in her possession so she decided to try and find her car in the parking lot. She held the keys up and hit the panic button.  A dark blue car started alarming in the far corner of the parking lot. She sighed loudly to herself before walking over to the car to look at it.</p><p>“I’ll admit she did have nice taste. I am going to hate transferring this over to myself though. Oh well. I’ll have Rio help me get it home later.” Agatha said as she pulled out her phone and took a photo of the car and it’s license plate.</p><p>Agatha 5:10 p.m: attachment image. Please don’t have this one towed. It’s Evanora’s, I have to get it to my place somehow.</p><p>Pepper 5:11 p.m: I’ll forward it to security and let them know. Thank you.</p><p>Agatha stuck her phone back in her pocket and headed over to her own car. She got in and decided to head toward the bookstore. She wanted to talk to Rio about a few things after she finished working.</p><p>The drive to the bookstore was fairly short, Agatha pulled around back and parked next to Rio’s car. The idea struck her that she could easily trade in Evanora’s car for something different so her and Rio would always have two vehicles at their place’s and they could go back and forth without using a portal all the time. She mentally added it to the list of things she wanted to talk to Rio about. She got out of her car and made her way into the store through the back door.</p><p>She was quiet enough that she was able to sneak up behind Rio and wrap her arms around her lover. “Got you.” Agatha whispered softly as she pulled Rio close.</p><p>“Maybe I just let you think you were being sneaky.” Rio teased as she leaned her head back against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Probably, but a girl can dream.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“My wards told on you.” Rio said as she shook her head.</p><p>“Of course they did. How has your day been?” Agatha asked as she let Rio go so the woman could turn around and give her a proper greeting. Rio placed a soft kiss on Agatha’s lips before she stepped away.</p><p>“The store was actually quite busy. Seems every parent in the area wants to check out the place their kid’s school is getting their books from.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s a very good thing my love. Do you need me to restock shelves for half an hour?” Agatha asked looking around the store.</p><p>“It would be a great help honestly.” Rio said as the front door opened again pulling her focus from Agatha to her job. “Welcome to Vidal Books!”</p><p>“Thank you, what a lovely store!” A random woman said as she walked deeper into the building. Rio looked at Agatha longingly before heading toward the front of the store.  Agatha smiled softly before she crouched down and opened a box near by. She started shelving books trying to be as helpful as possible.</p><p>Time seemed to fly by quickly because before even Agatha had realized it, it was 6 p.m. and Rio was locking up the store. She made her way over to Agatha with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“So what did you want to talk about my love?” Rio asked as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Well… this might be a hard pill to swallow, but I just became a millionaire? billionaire? I’m unsure at this moment in time... My mother, set up a final will and testament that she couldn’t edit until I was 50 years of age shortly after my first birthday. I have inherited everything. I just don’t know what everything is yet.”</p><p>“How financially well off was your mother?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Let’s just say… I’m in the same tax bracket as Tony Stark now according to Pepper.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“So what will you do with your new found wealth?” Rio asked as she pulled Agatha closer.</p><p>“I’m thinking about moving. I want to be closer to the book store and work. That way it’s easier on the both of us.” Agatha explained before she leaned forward and kissed Rio.</p><p>“Who said I was moving in with you?” Rio teased, speaking softly against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“You don’t have to if you don’t want to… but I found a few places that might just be exactly what you want. Or alternatively we can build something, anything you could want I can make happen.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Where ever you are is exactly where I want to be.” Rio said with a smile, before her face fell. “What will Wanda do without you living next door?”</p><p>“I’m sure we will figure out all of that eventually. But there are other things I need to talk to you about.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“What would that be?”</p><p>“Pepper is forcing me to take next week off so I can deal with my childhood home. I really just want to burn it to the ground but I should probably head over there and see if there’s any documentation I need to collect. Will you go with me?” Agatha asked in a nervous tone. She knew Rio would say yes, but she was more worried about having to go at all.</p><p>“Of course. We can bring Wanda as well if that will make you feel better.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I fear she will be busy testing her new harness out for the foreseeable future.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“How about we invite Lily, then Wanda has to come.” Rio suggested with a chuckle.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. If we see them any time soon I’ll ask.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Now what else did you want to talk about?” Rio asked, Agatha pulled her closer and kissed the side of her neck softly.</p><p>“What are your plans for the evening?”</p><p>“Spending time with you. What did you have planned?”</p><p>“Go home, eat left over Chinese. Look at the houses I have tabbed on my laptop. Maybe have sex?” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“Let me lock up. I’ll go drop my car off at my place and meet you at yours through the portal door.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Sounds great.”</p><p>~Meanwhile at Wanda’s place~</p><p>Wanda had gotten home and was walking around the large house trying to decide what she was going to do with her evening when her phone started ringing.</p><p>“Hello?” Wanda said into the phone without looking at the contact.</p><p>“Hey, I’ll be there in twenty. I just finished picking a few things up from the store.” Lily said into the phone.</p><p>“Oh really? What did you get?” Wanda asked curiously.</p><p>“That’s for me to know and you to find out. Are we hanging out with Agatha and Rio tonight?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Not that I’m aware of. Agatha’s not even home yet. I think she went to the book store after work.” Wanda said as she plopped down on her couch.</p><p>“How are you feeling magically? I know last night you were pretty handsy in your sleep.” Lily teased.</p><p>“I still feel like I could run the Boston Marathon with no prep. It’s so strange, I didn’t realize how much magical energy I was using. I do wonder how long my hexes would’ve kept that bitch alive.”  Wanda said to Lily.</p><p>“Ask Rio to ask Death?” Lily suggested.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. I have other things I’d like to be thinking about right now though.” Wanda husked into the phone.</p><p>“Oh? And what might that be?” Lily said in a playful tone, knowing exactly what Wanda wanted.</p><p>“Who gets to be the guinea pig first.” Wanda said excitedly.</p><p>“I’ll let you test your best friend’s magical abilities first.” Lily told Wanda, unsure if she wanted to be the crash test dummy.</p><p>“That’s fine. How close are you?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Not as close as you want me to be. Sorry. I’ll be there soon though. I talked to my parents today.” Lily offered changing the subject to distract Wanda.</p><p>“How did that go?”</p><p>“Well mom’s super proud I got a job, dad’s on the fence about you though.” Lily said into the phone.</p><p>“Why? Because I’m a chaos witch?” Wanda joked.</p><p>“No, because he wanted a son in law to force into taking over the farm. He will live. Maybe we can give him grandsons eventually so he’ll shut up about it.” Lily joked.</p><p>“Oh, sorry to disappoint you Mr. Grey. Magical soulmates don’t come customized to their partners parents preferences.” Wanda joked. Lily laughed at her girlfriend’s antics before asking. “So you want kids?”</p><p>“I mean eventually. But my dad wants grandchildren in the next 5 years.” Lily said with a sigh.</p><p>“Is he not a witch?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Unfortunately he’s not. Neither is my mother. I don’t know where my powers came from.” Lily explained.</p><p>“I think I can be okay with kids in the next five years. I’d like them to meet their grandparents.” Wanda told her.</p><p>“Thanks. But we can worry about that at a later date.”</p><p>“Agreed. I’m here.” Lily said as she pulled into the driveway. “I’ll be in, in a second.”</p><p>“I’ll meet you at the door.” Wanda said before she hung up. Wanda got up and headed for the front door. She opened it and leaned against the door frame while she waited for Lily who was carrying a large black plastic bag.</p><p>“Hey babe… that’s a big bag.” Wanda said eyeing the bag suspiciously.</p><p>“I got a few things. You can snoop in a little bit.” Lily said as she walked past Wanda into the house and toward her bedroom.</p><p>“A little bit? You think I have patience?” Wanda asked the blonde woman as she shut the door and followed her.</p><p>“Do me a favor and text Agatha before we start anything. See if she needs you tonight before we start messing around? I don’t want any interruptions.” Lily told Wanda who sighed and pulled her phone out of her back pocket.</p><p>Wanda 6:15 p.m: Do you need me tonight?</p><p>“She might be driving, and she never texts and drives.” Wanda said as she stuffed the phone in her back pocket.</p><p>“Well let’s get something to eat while we wait for her to get home. I have a feeling you are going to keep me up fairly late.” Lily said with a smile as she put the bag on the bed and headed toward the kitchen.</p><p>“By the way… do you happen to know how to cook?” Wanda asked curiously.</p><p>“Babe, I grew up on a farm. Growing my own food in the summer and processing it so we had food through the winter. I know how to cook.” Lily said in a mirth filled tone.</p><p>“You and Agatha really are going to get along great. Don’t steal my best friend from me.” Wanda said seriously.</p><p>“It seems like I should be competing with her for your attention more. Maybe I will steal her so I can get you all to myself more often.” Lily teased.</p><p>“I… look… I’m sorry. It’s just we were all we had for a long time. It was us three against the world for a long time. I don’t even like that I have to share her with Rio sometimes.” Wanda said honestly. She was being vulnerable and Lily realized it quickly.</p><p>“I’m kidding. You’ve got me now so she’s gunna have to learn how to share you with me. Just like you have to learn how to share her with Rio. I know she needs you right now, I’m not arguing with it. I promise you, it’s okay. If she needs you I know she takes top priority.” Lily reassured.</p><p>“Thank you for being so understanding Lily. I really appreciate it.” Wanda said as she pulled Lily into her arms. She leaned down a little and kissed her softly. Lily slid her hands around Wanda’s back and down to her ass to grab it. Her hand collided with the phone in Wanda’s back pocket. Right when it vibrated. She grabbed the phone out of Wanda’s pocket and leaned back to look at it.</p><p>Agatha 6:30 p.m:  No, enjoy your night. See you two for breakfast.</p><p>“Perfect. I get you to my self. Take me to bed and fuck me.” Lily demanded as she let Wanda read the phone. They were teleported to the bedroom a moment later. “Still not used to that.” Lily said with her head spinning.</p><p>“Sorry, I forget potion witches can’t teleport, just fly.” Wanda apologized.</p><p>“It’s okay, I’m adjusting. I got a few options… one I feel like I’d enjoy and then two other options, lube, cleaner, and a vibrator.” Lily explained as she dumped the bag onto the bed.</p><p>“Holy shit babe.” Wanda said in a shocked tone.</p><p>“Don’t judge.” Lily said with a sigh.</p><p>“Not judging, just worried about how much this all cost.” Wanda said as she picked up a red toy that seemed to be the middle size. She looked it over before turning to Lily.</p><p>“It’s fine. That’s the one I thought I’d like the most. Plus it will match the harness. Let’s take care of everything and get into bed.” Lily offered as she started cleaning everything up besides the vibrator, lube and toy cleaner. She handed Wanda the bottle of cleaner and the woman took the hint, she made her way to her bathroom to wash it. When she came back from the bathroom with the toy in her hand Lily was already naked on the bed.</p><p>Wanda almost dropped the toy that was in her hand but realized quickly that she would have to wash it again if she did. She set it on the night stand and stripped out of her clothing before opening the drawer and pulling out her red harness Agatha made her. She put the toy in the harness then slipped it on. Settling the harness comfortably at her hips, once it was locked into place she felt her magic connect with the toy. This deep tug pulled hard at her core as she looked down at the dildo.</p><p>“Woah. That is strange.” Wanda said as she climbed onto the bed and settled next to Lily.</p><p>“What is?” Lily asked as she reached over and slid her hand up Wanda’s side tickling the sensitive flesh as she went.</p><p>“It’s hard to explain, you’ll see when it’s your turn to wear yours.” Wanda explained as she leaned down to capture Lily’s lips in a kiss as a hand slid between Lily’s legs. A soft moan left Lily as Wanda’s fingers dipped between her legs and found her clit.</p><p>“I can’t wait. Ah! Wanda!” Lily gasped out as Wanda started circling her clit faster.</p><p>“Have you been thinking about this all day?” Wanda asked as she dipped her fingers lower and found out exactly how wet Lily was. She groaned loudly at the sensation as she dipped her fingers into the women and started curling her fingers.</p><p>“Fuck. Wanda.” Lily hissed out.</p><p>“That was the plan babe.” Wanda teased as she curled her fingers into Lily.</p><p>“I think I’m wet enough.” Lily groaned out as she clenched down on Wanda’s fingers.</p><p>“You think? I think I want you to cum first. Then I’ll use this on you.” Wanda offered as she continued to thrust into Lily with two fingers.</p><p>“Goddesses, please!” Lilly begged as she rolled her hips. Wanda leaned forward and captured her lips in a kiss. Wanda curled her fingers roughly, finding Lily’s g-spot and forcing her hips to rocket off the bed. “Yes! Baby! Fuck!” Lily screamed as she came.</p><p>A soft satisfied chuckle left Wanda as she moved so she could settle better between Lily’s legs. She magicked the lube into her hands and poured some onto the toy and rubbed it in with her hand. She moaned softly at the feeling of her hand stroking the toy.</p><p>“Can you feel it when you touch yourself?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Yes. I can. Are you sure you want to do this?” Wanda checked in again, she magicked a towel onto the bed and wiped her hand off.</p><p>“Yes, please. If I change my mind I’ll tell you.” Lily reassured, Wanda waved her hand and propped her up on a pillow. Before sliding the toy into Lily. Wanda moaned loudly at the feeling of Lilly enveloping her, her wet heat felt like a dream.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Wanda whispered as she sunk into Lily.</p><p>“Wait, I expect it to be cold.” Lily said in a confused tone.</p><p>“It’s magically connected to me. So it’s like it’s actually mine.” Wanda explained, grunting at the feeling of Lily’s heat around her. “You ready?”</p><p>“Yes.” Lily answered firmly, Wanda took a deep breath before she started thrusting her hips slowly.</p><p>“Comfortable?” Wanda asked trying to keep her composure, she wanted to start moving faster but she restrained herself.</p><p>“Yes, you can go faster.” Lily told the redhead above her. Wanda moaned as she pulled Lily closer by her thighs and started thrusting into her faster. “Goddesses above!”</p><p>“I can feel everything. How hot you are, how you clench down on me, how wet you are, all of it. Fuck.” Wanda said with a lust filled tone. Lily was moaning softly as she bit her lip. Wanda felt a rush of arousal flood her whole body as she kept her pace.</p><p>“Goddesses!” Lily screamed, she felt so full. Wanda leaned forward and kissed along her chest before she took a nipple into her mouth and swirled her tongue around it.  Lily’s hand wove into Wanda’s hair and held her there.</p><p>Wanda moaned softly at the sensation of Lily clenching down on her. Her magic felt like it was flaring to life under her skin with each thrust into Lily. Wanda removed her mouth and kissed up Lily’s chest.</p><p>“Goddesses you feel so good.” Wanda said with a lust filled tone. Then she felt something tug hard on her magic. Lily was smirking up at her as she tugged hard again. Wanda’s hips started moving faster, of her own accord.</p><p>“That’s not fair.” Wanda groaned out as she angled her hips and hit a spot in Lily that made her scream.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Yes! Right there!” Lily screamed out as she dug her nails into Wanda’s back. Wanda took the hint and didn’t change her pace or location. A few strokes later Lily was tumbling over the edge as she came, she felt herself gush as she fell apart.</p><p>Wanda continued to fuck her though her orgasm. Lily’s body was shaking as she felt herself climb toward another orgasm. She felt herself cum much faster the second time. “Ah fuck!” Lily screamed as she came again. Clenching down hard on the toy inside of her.</p><p>“Two?” Wanda asked in a dazed tone, she was so close herself. Lily shook her head yes as a blush creeped up on her cheeks, Wanda felt a fire light inside of her. “Give me one more and I will cum with you.” Wanda said lustfully, as she started thrusting into Lily. Lily moaned as she felt Wanda continue to fuck her into the mattress.</p><p>“I’m so close.” Lily whispered out brokenly through moans and whimpers.</p><p>“Come on baby, you feel so good. I’m so close!” Wanda begged softly. Lily grabbed her by her soft red hair and pulled her mouth up to her own. A deep passionate kiss filled with lust and magical energy. Wanda’s hips settled deeply against Lily’s as they came undone. Their orgasm’s flashing magical energy behind their eyes as they settled against each other.</p><p>They broke apart for air, both of them panting heavily as Wanda collapsed heavily on Lily.</p><p>“Fuck! That was intense!” Lily said after catching her breath.</p><p>“Wait until you’re in my position. I have no idea how I held on so long.” Wanda said with a mirth filled tone.</p><p>“Oh I absolutely cannot wait, but I need an energy potion to keep up with you.” Lily said as she magicked a potion into her hand.</p><p>“I love that if we own it we can call it.” Wanda said with a smile.</p><p>“It’s convenient. I’m still in awe of Agatha’s ability to manifest from nothing.” Lily said honestly, before she drank the potion Jen had made for her.</p><p>“Wait tell you put yours on. I owe my best friend something awesome. I just need to figure out what that is.” Wanda said as she magicked her harness onto the bathroom countertop.</p><p>“Pick the toy you want me to use and wash it while this potion works?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Of course. One moment.” Wanda got up and opened the drawer, she picked up the soft bubble gum pink toy and carried it to the bathroom with her. A couple minutes later Wanda walked back out with her harness and the two toys. She put her harness and toy in the drawer and handed the thick pink toy to Lily. Lily grabbed the harness out of the drawer and slipped the toy into the o ring and then pulled the harness on before tightening it.</p><p>She felt her magical energy snap into place once the toy was settled at her hips. “Fuck… that’s intense.” Lily said as she looked down at the toy settled between her legs.</p><p>“I warned you.” Wanda said smugly.</p><p>“Don’t tease me, I’ll put you in your place shortly.” Lily said as she pointed at the bed. “Now get your ass over here.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Wanda said with a smile. She climbed onto the bed and settled on the pillow. Lily grabbed the vibrator off the nightstand and the lube. She squeezed a generous amount into her hand and rubbed it over the toy.</p><p>“Oh. I see.” Lily said softly as she stroked the toy.</p><p>“Told you.” Wanda teased which caused Lily to glare at her softly before she dipped her fingers into Wanda.</p><p>“Oh, I think you are plenty wet enough. Do you want an orgasm first or…?” Lily asked trailing off.</p><p>“If you don’t put that in me soon. I may actually combust.” Wanda said with a whimper as Lily curled her fingers, she pulled them out of Wanda slowly and grasped the toy so she could line it up with Wanda’s entrance.</p><p>“Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen babe.” Lily said softly as she slid the toy into Wanda, a moan falling from her lips as her body shook at the sensation. “A better warning would’ve been nice. Fuck.” Lily said with a sigh as she sunk into Wanda.</p><p>“Oh! Fuck! God you are so warm, it feels real! You didn’t give me a warning at all!” Wanda said with wide eyes.</p><p>“I’ve never slept with a man, so I didn’t know! Goddess, did I feel this hot?” Lily asked and Wanda got a sinister look on her face. She clenched down hard on the toy inside of her. “Oh!” Lily said in shock before she started moving her hips.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that response.” Wanda said with a smirk. Lily looked down at her and smiled softly, as she started moving her hips faster.</p><p>“What response were you looking for Wanda?” Lily asked as she grabbed the vibrator. She had a plan and she was ready to execute it.</p><p>“You to be composed… ah! What are you planning?” Wanda asked as Lily leaned back slightly and placed the vibrator on Wanda’s clit. She didn’t turn it on she just let it sit there while she grabbed the remote.</p><p>“I want you to cum, that’s more important to me right now. No matter how good you feel.” Lily explained as she started moving her hips faster. She turned the vibrator on and pressed it softly against Wanda’s clit with her free hand.</p><p>Moans and whimpers fell from Wanda’s lips as Lily continued to thrust into her. The vibrator causing Wanda to clench down hard on the toy as her hips spasmed. She was overwhelmed and chaos magic started to spark wildly at her finger tips. Lily reached forward and took Wanda’s free hand in her own. Pink magic mingling with red as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Goddesses! Fuck!” Wanda screamed as her hips locked in the air and she came. Lily decided to keep thrusting into Wanda as she used her magic to tug and pull on the connection between them.</p><p>“You feel so good baby. Come on Wanda. I can feel you clenching down on me. Cum. Give me what I want!” Lily demanded and Wanda tumbled over the edge again.</p><p>“Perfect. Now give me another.” Lily demanded as she let go of the vibrator and turned it up on the remote before she pressed it against Wanda’s clit and started thrusting into Wanda again. Moans and gasps fell from Wanda as Lily stole her breath from her lungs with each thrust.</p><p>Soon a third orgasm washed over Wanda as she screamed loudly into the pillow. Wanda was breathing heavily as she felt her body start to ache. Lily’s sunk her hips deeply into Wanda so she could give the woman a moment to breathe.</p><p>“You know, I think I’m going to love this thing.” Lily said smugly. Wanda’s breath finally returned to her lungs.</p><p>“How are you not a mess right now?” Wanda said as she blinked slowly. Her whole body felt like it was on fire.</p><p>“Because I hyper fixated on you. I could do this all night just enjoying how beautiful you look when you cum.” She said as she started moving her hips, long drawn out thrusts that quickly slammed back into Wanda at a rapid rate.</p><p>“I think I’m in trouble.” Wanda said with a chuckle that turned into a loud moan as Lily leaned forward and captured her breast. She may be in trouble but it was the best kind of trouble to be in. Lily was going to be the death of her and she was gladly embracing that.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning came much sooner for the four women than any of them wanted. Agatha and Rio got up early and showered together before getting dressed. Rio was dressed in a loose fitting tank top that showed off her tattoos and sigils, and a pair of cargo pants. Agatha was in a black suit, a deep purple button up, and a soft gray tie. Once they were both dressed Agatha started making breakfast sleepily while Rio dragged herself out into the kitchen looking absolutely exhausted.</p><p>Ten minutes later Wanda and Lily walked into the house looking exhausted together. Agatha looked over at the two women and smiled softly as they made their way into the kitchen.</p><p>“Good morning you two.” Agatha said softly as she continued to cook breakfast.</p><p>“G’morning.” Wanda said as she sat down at the island and put her head in her arms on the counter.</p><p>“Do we all need something stronger than coffee today?” Rio asked looking at the three women in the room.</p><p>“Yes.” All three of them answered in unison. Rio chuckled softly but she also felt the exhaustion in her own bones. The last week or so had felt like a year. She magicked 4 glowing green vials onto the countertop.</p><p>“This is called Vidal Vitality. It’s an energy potion that was created by the first iteration of Death. She was human while doing her job unfortunately so she had to survive off this stuff until she died. It’s safe, and won’t hurt you. But it’s only for when we are this exhausted or worse.” Rio said as she grabbed a vial and popped the cork off before downing it. “But it’s very bitter!” Her disgusted face told the group of women everything they needed to know.</p><p>“I don’t care about bitter, give me that.” Wanda said desperately. Rio handed Lily and Wanda their vials before offering one to Agatha. Agatha grabbed a vial and downed it before making a disgusted face.</p><p>“Yuck.” Agatha said before handing the vial back to Rio. Then she felt a rush of energy. “That works fast!”</p><p>Wanda and Lily both take the corks off and drink the vials quickly before making disgusted faces. “Yuck! Why’s it so bad?” Wanda said in a disgusted tone, like she was hissing at the potion.</p><p>“Surely there must be a better way.” Lily said looking at the vial.</p><p>“I’ll ask my mother if she wants to share the recipe with you Lily, it feels like an initiation at this point though. Everyone has to experience the bad before they get the good.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Fair, but… maybe it doesn’t have to taste so bad.” Lily offered before she handed the vial back to Rio. Wanda handed her’s over as well. All four of them settled comfortably into their places in the kitchen while they waited for Agatha to finish cooking.</p><p>“Hey Wanda, are you busy Sunday?” Agatha asked a moment later.</p><p>“No, why?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I need to go back to that hell hole and collect whatever I need from it. Evanora Harkness left me everything because she set up her will and testament when I was 1 and couldn’t make any changes until I turned 50.” Agatha explained.</p><p>A barely contained laugh left Wanda’s lips before she quickly composed herself. “I’m free, but maybe we should bring the whole coven along. Jen and Alice will be a great help just in case your mother’s coven shows up.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“I’ll call them today at some point and ask them. Nothing better than a police escort, that will be a good deterrent.”</p><p>“Police escort?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Alice is a protection witch. She’s a police officer. She’s also Lorna Wu’s daughter.” Agatha explained as she started getting pancakes onto a plate. She pulled the bacon out of the oven and set it on the counter top before she finished working on the eggs while they talked.</p><p>“You two are friends with Lorna Wu’s daughter?” Lily asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“I told you, Agatha has a habit of being exactly where she needs to be all the time.”</p><p>“Where did you two meet?” Rio asked only slightly confused.</p><p>“The police station. I was hired as an intern at Stark Law and interns take criminal cases. I met up with her while she was working, we started talking and realized we were both witches and just hit it off. She’s great, then she introduced me to Jen. Both are fantastic people and great friends.” Agatha explained before she magicked everything onto the table.</p><p>“I don’t think we need coffee today right?” Rio asked the group.</p><p>“No, we don’t. That potion did more than enough.” Agatha answered. Wanda opened her mouth to object but was silenced by Lily looking at her like she was crazy if she wanted to drink coffee on top of the potion.</p><p>“I’ll grab the orange juice.” Rio said as she opened the fridge and magicked 4 glasses onto the table. She then went and sat down next to Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll call them on the way to work.” Agatha told Wanda.</p><p>“Maybe we should all get together on Friday so they can meet these two.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“I’ll field it with Jen. But you know I have family dinner with Rio’s parents on Saturday right?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Is that every week?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Yes. My mom is adamant about that. I can ask if we can have it here on Friday instead of at the cabin. That way we can all just meet up together? I know my mother is going to want to come the second she finds out that Agatha has to go back into her childhood home.” Rio offered.</p><p>“That works. I’ll take a half day Friday and make a big meal, that’s only if Jen and Alice want to come. Otherwise we will have dinner at the cabin on Saturday.” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“Why not have it at the cabin?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Lily, you always ask the heaviest questions.” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“Let’s just say if the cabin doesn’t want you there, you no longer exist.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Got it, protection spells up to hell and back. We can all meet here. On neutral ground.” Wanda said with a sigh, she liked living.</p><p>“Okay trepidatiously, we will have family dinner here on Friday. Unless Rita Vidal has any objections?” Agatha asked as she started making herself a plate of food.</p><p>“Sounds good. Let’s eat. I’ll call her when I get to the book store.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you my love.” Agatha said appreciatively.</p><p>“Thank you my love.” Wanda mocked softly in a teasing tone.</p><p>“Behave Wanda.” Lily threatened her girlfriend. Who sat up straighter and started eating her breakfast.</p><p>“Wow… no sass from Wanda this morning? What did you do to my best friend Lily?” Agatha asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Put her in her place with your gift last night. Thank you by the way. Best thing ever.” Lily said with a smile as she poured herself a drink.</p><p>“Oh really? So your the reason you two were so tired this morning?” Rio teased as she pointed a fork at Lily.</p><p>“I think I’m going to be the one needing energy potions.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“I didn’t expect the tiny blonde botanist potions witch to be a dom.” Agatha said with a chuckle as she looked over at the two of them.</p><p>“Pleasure Dom. Apparently. I didn’t realize how she’d be until after the 6th orgasm.” Wanda said in an exasperated tone. “So if it’s all the same, I’ll listen to my girlfriend and behave because I don’t think I’ve ever been that tired before.”</p><p>“I knew I liked you Lily! Good job.” Agatha complimented. “Now finish your breakfast I have like seven meetings today.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am” Rio sassed before she started eating.</p><p>“Behave Rio or I’ll put you in your place like Lily did Wanda.” Agatha told the woman next to her, who looked at her with a challenging look.</p><p>‘Do it, put me in my place.’ Rio challenged in her mind.</p><p>‘Oh I will. Just you wait.’ Agatha teased before she went back to eating.</p><p>They finished breakfast quickly and cleaned the kitchen up before they all headed out the door for the day.</p><p>“Thank you for the energy potion Rio.” Lily said appreciatively as she hugged her.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Have a good first day.” Rio told her as she let her go.</p><p>“Thank you for making those harnesses for us Agatha, but I hate you a little.” Wanda said as she nudged Agatha with her shoulder.</p><p>“You love me and you know it. You’re welcome. Have a good day at work.” Agatha said as she shoved her toward Lily and both of them out the door.</p><p>“Now for you. You are going to go to work. And I’ll see you tonight.” Agatha promised before she kissed Rio passionately and pushed her against the wall.  Rio was flushed and panting after the kiss. “Have a good day at work.” Agatha said with a smirk as she opened her hall closet and softly pushed Rio through the portal to her apartment, before shutting the door.</p><p>‘That was mean!’ Rio scolded loudly in her mind as Agatha collected her things and headed out the door.</p><p>She got in her car and called Jen. The phone rang twice before Jen picked up.<br/>“Good morning Agatha! You never call me this early. Everything okay?”</p><p>“Everything is fine. Would you and Alice like to come to dinner on Friday? Rio, her parents, Wanda, and her girlfriend Lily will be there.”</p><p>“And why would I want to socialize with that many people I’ve never met before?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Because I’m going to need you two on Sunday when I have to go to my mother’s home and collect the things I need. She died on Monday shortly after her hearing. And I know for a fact that Rita is going to want to come at the very least.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I’m going to need all of the explanations on the planet.” Jen said. Her head reeling from that reveal.</p><p>“You ready for the wildest summary on the planet?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I guess…” Jen trailed off.</p><p>“Is Alice with you? I don’t want to say this twice.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Yes, she’s here. One second.” Then she heard a click. “Okay you’re on speaker.”</p><p>“What I’m about to tell you is going to be the most unbelievable thing you’ve ever heard so I’m sorry in advance. But hold on tight because it’s gunna be a ride.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Listening!” Alice said into the phone distantly.</p><p>“I met Rio two ish weeks ago. We shook hands after meeting and realized we had a magical connection. It has been deepening  every day. We are magically intertwined at this point. Now onto Rio, she’s part of the green witch bloodline and the next embodiment of Death. When she dies she will take her great grandmother’s place as Death. I will effectively be her bride but it’s way more complicated than that. Anyway, so Death is now a constant in our lives. She pops in to talk to us every once in a while.<br/>So when my mother was arrested for getting into Stark Law Firm; Death dropped by the facility that was holding her and decided to take her powers away from her completely.” Agatha explained then waited for a long moment.</p><p>“Okay…. So how did Evanora die?” Jen asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Part of her plea deal was for Wanda to remove her hexes. By removing the hexes it removed the magical energy keeping her alive. So by the time she made it to the prison the little energy she had left keeping her alive ran out. So now I need my coven to go with me to the last place on earth I ever want to visit again.”</p><p>“Okay…. I think I’m caught up. What time Friday?” Jen asked.</p><p>“I’m not one hundred percent sure. I’ll let you know after I talk to Rio and Rita tonight.”</p><p>“Sounds good, you okay with that babe?” Jen asked Alice.</p><p>“Sounds good. I’m there for Agatha no matter what.” Alice said into the phone.</p><p>“Alright, we will be there. Send me details. I still have like a million questions. So I may text you through out the day.” Jen said to Agatha.</p><p>“That’s fine whatever you think of I’ll try to answer between meetings. But I’m pulling into the parking lot so I’ll talk to you later.” Agatha explained as she parked her car.</p><p>“Have a good day!” Jen and Alice said in unison.</p><p>“You as well!” Agatha said before she hung up the phone and turned off the car.</p><p>~Vidal Books~</p><p>Rio was frustrated but she needed to talk to her mother first. So she picked her phone up and called her mom. It rang once before Rita picked up the phone.</p><p>“Baby, why are you calling me on a Wednesday morning? Is everything okay?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Agatha’s mother died and left everything to her including the home she grew up in. Agatha wants to go collect what she needs from it Sunday. Which is fine but we figured you’d want to be there.” Rio explained to her mother.</p><p>“You are correct, I would like to be there. One second I’m getting a text.” There was a pause on the line. “Apparently so would your Aunt Lilia.”</p><p>“I’m sure that will be fine. Let me ask Agatha.” Rio told her mother.</p><p>‘Lilia would like to also come on Sunday, am I extending the invite for Friday?’ Rio asked softly in her mind.</p><p>‘The more the merrier my love.’ Agatha answered back quickly.</p><p>“She is also invited to dinner at Agatha’s. I have no idea where we are going to put everyone but we will figure it out.” Rio said with a soft chuckle.</p><p>“How many people will be there?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Well, if dad comes also. I think nine in total. Unless I’m missing someone.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Nine? Where are we getting nine from?” Rita asked.</p><p>“You, Dad, Lilia, Wanda, her girlfriend Lily, Agatha’s friends Jennifer and Alice, and us. Jenifer and Alice are a couple and part of Agatha’s coven. We figured Agatha’s place was the safest place for everyone to meet.” Rio explained to her mother.</p><p>“Good idea. That’s fine, what time Friday?” Rita asked.</p><p>“No idea yet. Let me ask Agatha if she knows.”</p><p>‘Dinner time on Friday?’ Rio asked softly. She didn’t actually want to bother Agatha while she was working.</p><p>‘7:30. Which gives everyone time to arrive. And you time to collect your parents and aunt.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“7:30, we will be using the portal door to bring you over. I have one established at Agatha’s place for the cabin. Sound good?” Rio asked her mother.</p><p>“Sounds perfect. Now, how did Evanora Harkness die?” Rita asked her daughter right as the bookstores front door opened.</p><p>“Ask Aunt Lilia, I’ve got a customer. Love you  Momma.” Rio said softly into the phone.</p><p>“Have a good day, love you too.” Rita said before she hung up.</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books!” Rio said politely before she looked over at the door to see a gorgeous black woman wearing a soft pink sundress standing next to an Asian woman wearing a black leather jacket, ripped jeans and a band tee.</p><p>“Hey, so… this is gunna be weird. But are you Rio?” The Asian woman asked.</p><p>“Depends on who’s asking.” Rio said with a hint of curiosity. The black woman swatted at the shorter woman next to her.</p><p>“Ten years together and still as uncouth as the day I met you.” She scolded before she turned to Rio. “Hi! I’m Jennifer Kale, this is my girlfriend Alice Wu. You are dating our coven head and friend Agatha Harkness. We both had today off and figured we’d come check out your store, and you in the process.” Jen explained to Rio.</p><p>“Ahh, I see. How much has Agatha told you?” Rio asked as the two women looked at her.</p><p>“Enough. Holy shit, that’s a love binding spell.” Jen said as she looked at the small piece of spell peaking out from between Rio’s cleavage and the heart on her chest.</p><p>“Much more than that but yes. I assume you know about me then.” Rio said vaguely just in case another customer came in.</p><p>“She called us this morning to invite us to dinner. She just didn’t realize we had today off and planned on coming down here to check things out anyway.” Alice said before she stepped closer to Rio.</p><p>“I’m noticing a pattern in Agatha’s life.” Rio said with a smile at the realization.</p><p>“What’s that?” Jen asked with her eyes still glued to the heart sigil on Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Everyone in it is super protective of her. Don’t worry about little old me. I promise. I’d never do anything to jeopardize her or our relationship.”</p><p>“Oh that’s abundantly clear. I’ve never seen any spell like this. Do you mind?” Alice said as she pointed at the ring on Rio’s hand. Rio lifted her hand and let Alice take it.</p><p>‘What is Alice doing at the book store and why is she touching you?’ Agatha asked in her mind in a confused tone.</p><p>‘Apparently you have nosey friends. They had plans to visit today before you called them this morning. How did you know Alice was touching my ring?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘I know hers and Jen’s magic very well. Don’t let them touch the sigil.’ Agatha said in a possessive tone in her mind.</p><p>“Fascinating, that’s almost etherial magic.” Alice said.</p><p>“Well… that would track.” Rio said vaguely again as she let go of Alice’s hand.</p><p>“That sigil is also fascinating.” Jen said pointing at her chest.</p><p>“Agatha just specifically requested that neither of you touch that. She didn’t seem to like Alice touching the ring at all.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“How?” Jen asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“I haven’t even told my mother about this… but we can communicate telekinetically. She felt Alice touch our connection and got possessive.” Rio explained as she scratched the back of her neck.</p><p>“How did you two figure this all out?” Alice asked as she waved her hand vaguely over Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Oh… our magic just interacted with each other. Like she came in here, found my spell book, tucked it into her arms and I let her borrow it. Figuring that it would be a great way to get to see her again. We chatted, shook hands, it felt strange like our magic was reaching out to each other. Then the rest is history.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Why was your spell book just sitting in plain sight?” Jen asked.</p><p>“It’s here in the spell book section. Go see if you can find it.” Rio said as she pointed to the back corner. Jen huffed and walked away.</p><p>“Don’t mind my girlfriend, I feel like she’s more protective of Agatha than me. You seem quite nice though, and this bond is the magical equivalent of a marriage. I’ve never seen something like this, but my mother has.” Alice said as she looked at the sigils and ring. “Well mostly. I don’t remember her ever mentioning hearts with crowns on them.”</p><p>“That’s something I need to talk to Death about… Wanda and Lily know what they mean… But they are a special situation also.” Rio said honestly. Jen walked back to the front of the store a moment later.</p><p>“I give up! Not a single spell book that would belong to a green witch in sight. Common spell books galore, but I have no idea where yours is.” Jen said honestly as she walked over to Alice and Rio.</p><p>“That’s because it has a spell on it so no one can see it. My magic decided Agatha was worthy of seeing it.” Rio said as she waved her hand and held the invisible tomb up for the women. They still couldn’t see it until she willed it, both women looked at her incredulously and then she decided to stop messing with them. The glamor over the book disappeared and it became visible.</p><p>“Wow, impressive!” Alice said as she looked at the tomb. Rio put the glamor back in place and magicked the book back to its home on the shelf.</p><p>“Any other questions?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Still have about a hundred or so. But I fear our coven head is going to kill us for bothering you at work.” Jen told Rio.</p><p>“I’ll tell her that you two were perfect little angels. Don’t worry about her too much.” Rio reassured as another set of customers walked in the store.</p><p>“Why don’t you two go check out the store.” Rio said waving them off slightly because she knew her customers were human so she greeted them politely. “Welcome to Vidal Books!”</p><p>“There were some potion books I don’t own let’s go look babe.” Jen said as she dragged Alice off.</p><p>‘If they touch you again…’ Agatha said possessively, her feral desire flooding Rio.</p><p>‘What babe? Jealous of your friends?’ Rio asked softly, she knew Agatha was on edge.</p><p>‘No… no. It’s just no one has touched your ring… I’m sorry for reacting this way.’ Agatha told Rio.</p><p>‘What way are you reacting? To me you seem angry about the fact Alice touched it.’</p><p>‘Not angry. Possessive, like I want to claim you. You belong to me.’ Agatha said lustfully in her mind.</p><p>The customers that had walked in were coming up to the counter a moment later. “Did you two find everything okay?” Rio asked</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” The young man said with a smile, as he put the books on the counter. Rio started checking them out.</p><p>“Your total is $42.50.” Rio told them. The young man took his card out and put it in the card reader and paid for their books. “Thank you for shopping with us, have a wonderful day.” Rio said as she bagged the books and handed them to him.</p><p>“Thank you! It’s a beautiful store!” He told her before they made their way out the door. Jen and Alice walked over to the counter a moment later.</p><p>“So….” Jen trailed off.</p><p>“Yes Jen?” Rio asked the woman.</p><p>“Do we know why we can’t touch the sigils?” She asked curiously. She wanted to feel the magical energy they were exuding.</p><p>“I’m figuring that out still. If you want to look at it better you can. But unless you want an angry Agatha up your ass on Friday, I don’t suggest touching it.” Rio said as she held out her hand to show the ring.</p><p>“It’s a beautiful spell. I’ve never seen something like it before. It’s fascinating. I really want to feel the magical energy off it but I fear Agatha more.” Jen said honestly as she held Rio’s finger tips and looked over the ring.</p><p>“Honestly. She will live. If you want to touch it you can.” Rio offered, her own curiosity getting the better of her as well.</p><p>“No, I choose life.” Jen said as she let her hand go.</p><p>“Honestly wise choice babe. I’m afraid of what she’s going to do to me.” Alice said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Nothing, I promise. But she might have some choice words for me later.” Rio said with an eye roll.</p><p>“I hope I didn’t get you in trouble.” Alice said apologetically.</p><p>“You won’t, let’s get you two checked out so you don’t waste your whole day in my store.” Rio said as she held her hands out to take the books from Jen.</p><p>“Oh she’s kicking us out babe.” Jen joked as she handed Rio the books.</p><p>“You’re more than welcome to stay. But who wants to spend a whole day in the book store when they can spend it doing other fun things.” Rio offered as she started ringing up her their books. “I’ll even give you the friends and family discount because Agatha wouldn’t let me give her one.”</p><p>“I don’t think Agatha would ever let anyone give her a discount if that makes you feel better.” Alice said honestly as she pulled her card out of her wallet.</p><p>“Your total is $40.60.” Rio told them as she packed the potion books into the bag and handed them to Jen. Unwittingly Jen’s fingers grazed the ring on Rio’s left hand as she looked over at Alice.</p><p>“Thanks babe.” Jen said with a smile directed at Alice.</p><p>‘Why is Jen touching the ring?’ Agatha said possessively.</p><p>‘She didn’t mean to, she grazed it when she grabbed the bag from me. I don’t think she even realized.’ Rio soothed. ‘I belong to you.’</p><p>“Thanks for stopping in ladies. I’ll see you both Friday! I have to call Agatha.” Rio said in a concerned tone as she waved goodbye to the women.</p><p>“Sorry if we caused trouble.” Alice apologized again as she grabbed Jen by the arm and dragged her out of the store. Rio sighed as she walked away from the countertop and made her way to the back so she could restock books.</p><p>‘I’m sorry if I’ve upset you my love.’ Rio whispered softly in her mind as she started opening boxes.</p><p>‘Not upset, but I have plans for you tonight.’ Agatha said cryptically in her mind. Rio shook her head at Agatha and went back to working.</p><p>~Stark Law Firm~</p><p>Agatha was pacing her office, she felt absolutely feral. She wanted to leave work and go to the book store and claim Rio. She took a long deep breath as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“Oh witchlett, calm down.” Gaia said to her daughter. Agatha looked over at her mother with pupils blown and she was breathing heavy.</p><p>“I am normally more composed than this…” Agatha said to Gaia before she tried to calm down.</p><p>“You’ve never had a reason to not be. Someone who isn’t you touched your connection. You are having a very normal response. But you are at work. Calm down sweetie. Breathe.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“I don’t want to be at work.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’m well aware of that. But you’ve always been a planner, plan what you want to do when you get out of work. Now, take a deep breath.” Gaia instructed her daughter. Agatha took a deep breath and closed her eyes trying to calm down.</p><p>“How do I deal with this? I know what I want to do. But it’s only 11 a.m.” Agatha said as she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“Good, figure out your plan. Now, my sweet little witchlett, do you need me to sit here with time stopped so you can compose yourself?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“I’m okay. Thank you though. I don’t need you to take time away from things that are more important.” Agatha said honestly as she tried to compose herself.</p><p>“Nothing is more important than you right now, and If Pepper were to see you like this…” Gaia trailed off.</p><p>“I’d be kicked out of the building for a week.”</p><p>“See you are a clever girl. Now, you drink some water, take a deep breath, and make a plan.” Gaia told Agatha as she handed her a bottle of water.</p><p>“Oh I have a plan. I just need the patience that goes along with it.” Agatha said as she took a drink of water and leaned against her desk.</p><p>“Well even I can’t grant you that.” Gaia said with a laugh.</p><p>“Geee thanks Mom. I appreciate it.” Agatha joked. Gaia walked over to Agatha and smiled down at her.</p><p>“Give your Mom a hug, and I’ll see you later. You seem calmer now, have a good day. I love you.” Gaia said as she held her arms out for Agatha. Agatha stood up straight and gave Gaia a hug. She felt a wave of calm flood over her as she hugged the goddess.</p><p>“Next time I’m like this just hug me. I feel way better already.” Agatha said into her shoulder.</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind witchlett. Now you have work to do today. I’ll pop in before dinner on Friday and say hi to you girls. Love you.” Gaia said as she kissed the side of Agatha’s head then let her go.</p><p>“Love you too Momma.” Agatha said as Gaia disappeared, she then used her magic to put herself back together.</p><p>“Breathe Agatha. You have 6 hours. Plan then execute.” Agatha said with a sigh. Then she walked out to the main office to speak to Tricia.</p><p>“How many more meetings do I have today?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“5 unfortunately. I did order you lunch and I was about to go fetch it. Do you have any requests?” Tricia said as she stood up.</p><p>“No, thank you Tricia I appreciate you.” Agatha said honestly before she made her way back into her office.</p><p>The rest of the day went by in a blur. Agatha’s meetings seemed to go quickly and now she just needed to be patient a little longer. She stayed in her office until 5:30 p.m. then collected her things and made her way to her car.</p><p>‘You are usually here by now.’ Rio said softly in her mind by the time she made it to her car.</p><p>‘Had a few more meetings than usual, leaving now. I’ll be there right before close.’ Agatha told Rio in her mind.</p><p>‘Are you sure you aren’t angry with me?’ Rio asked as Agatha pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>‘I promise you, I’m not angry my love.’ Agatha reassured before she started driving.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Agatha parked behind the store and made her way in the back door. She found her place on the couch in the spell book section to wait the extra ten minutes she had before she could execute her plan.</p><p>Ten minutes later the doors were locked and all the customers were gone. Rio walked toward the back of the store and peaked around the corner.</p><p>“For someone who said they aren’t mad at me… you seem pretty mad.” Rio said softly as she looked at Agatha. Agatha shook her head and stood up.</p><p>“Not angry, I promise. Now come here.” Agatha said as she walked past Rio toward the front of the store. She magicked the curtains shut and took Rio’s hand.</p><p>“You have no idea how feral I felt earlier. Like all I could think of was ravaging you. The thought of having another witch touch our connection.” Agatha said as she magicked Rio onto the counter, leaving her naked in the process.</p><p>“I… uh. What?” Rio asked as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m officially breaking your rule. I have ran out of patience. I’m fucking you on this counter.” Agatha said as she kneeled down and spread Rio’s legs before diving in and running her tongue up her slit collecting the sweet nectar between them.</p><p>“Oh! Fuck!” Rio hissed out as she felt Agatha wrap her lips around Rio’s clit and swirl her tongue around the sensitive bud.</p><p>‘You belong to me. You are mine.’ Agatha thought loudly in Rio’s mind as she continued to swirl her tongue around the bud.</p><p>“Oh goddess! Fuck! It wasn’t on purpose!” Rio moaned out.</p><p>‘Don’t care. Mine.’ Agatha said as she brought two fingers up under her chin and thrust into Rio, her other hand came up to press flatly against the sigil between her breasts. The feral desire Agatha was feeling flooded Rio. Rio’s clit throbbed between her legs as Agatha continued to swirl and flick at the sensitive pearl. Agatha’s hand moved to the right and softly tweaked at Rio’s nipple.</p><p>“Oh, fuck.” Rio said as she leaned back on both hands, trying to support herself against the counter. “You…” Rio started to ask but couldn’t find the words.</p><p>‘ALL DAY.’ Agatha told Rio loudly in her mind as she started curling her fingers. Rio felt herself being dragged toward the edge faster than she expected.</p><p>“Agatha! Fuck baby.” Rio screamed as she felt herself clench down on her fingers as she came. Agatha pulled her mouth away before she stood up and started kissing up Rio’s stomach. She took a moment to kiss the poppy flowers on her hip before kissing up the sigil. The feral desire Agatha felt all day flooding through Rio again causing her hips to twitch. Agatha took her other nipple into her mouth and swirled her tongue around it as she continued to thrust into Rio.</p><p>“You have no idea how badly I’ve wanted to take you like this.” Agatha said in a lust filled tone after she pulled her mouth away. Agatha started curling her fingers and thrusting into Rio again. Moans and whimpers fell from Rio’s lips as she tried to form a coherent thought.</p><p>“Agatha… “ Rio groaned out, all she could think about was her lovers fingers slamming into her.</p><p>“Yes my love?” Agatha asked smugly as she continued to thrust into Rio. Rio tried to sit up but was softly pushed down by Agatha.</p><p>“I want to kiss you.” Rio whined out as Agatha curled her fingers into her.</p><p>“After you cum for me.” Agatha demanded as she thrust into Rio. Moans spilling from Rio’s lips as Agatha continued to fuck her.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Agatha! Fuck!” Rio moaned out with each thrust and curl of Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“Do you have any clue how tempting it was to teleport you into my office and just fuck you on my desk?” Agatha husked out as she leaned forward and captured Rio’s lips with hers. Rio moaned loudly into the kiss as she grabbed Agatha by the neck and softly pulled her closer.</p><p>‘Cum for me Rio.’ Agatha demanded in her mind. Rio felt herself clench down hard as her orgasm wracked her body. A gush of liquid coated Agatha’s hand as her orgasm crashed around her. Rio’s arousal coating her hand and dripping onto the floor as Agatha continued to thrust into her as she kissed her.</p><p>Rio broke the kiss a moment later and breathed heavily as she felt Agatha pull her fingers out of her. “My love…” Rio whimpered out as Agatha magicked a towel into her hands. She dried her hands before she dropped it on the floor to clean the mess they made.</p><p>“Yes Rio?” Agatha asked as she stepped between Rio’s legs and pulled her close. Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck, and rubbed her nose along Agatha’s softly before kissing her.</p><p>“I am yours. No one else’s. I belong to you, mind, body, and soul.” Rio answered softly.</p><p>“Sorry, I kind of lost control…” Agatha said as she trailed her hand up Rio’s body.</p><p>“Not complaining. But can I put some clothing on and we head back to my apartment and continue this?” Rio requested.</p><p>“Oh, you don’t want to just take it to the couch?” Agatha teased with a sparkle in her eye.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio warned.</p><p>“Maybe I should have Lily touch my ring next time I see her so you can feel what I felt.” Agatha mused to herself.</p><p>“Please, every time I’m standing at this counter I’m going to think about this moment. Don’t taint the couch as well.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Can you say no to me right now?” Agatha asked as she pulled Rio closer and kissed along her chin and neck.</p><p>“I don’t think I can.” Rio groaned out as Agatha rubbed her hands along her thighs. Agatha sighed and magicked Rio’s outfit back on but didn’t move.</p><p>“Fine. I won’t take advantage of that. Even if I want to. Do you want to go to your place?” Agatha asked before she sucked softly on Rio’s collar bone.</p><p>“Well it’s closer…” Rio husked out as she played with the baby hairs at the base of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Yes, but can I cook breakfast or dinner there?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“No… I will admit I haven’t gone grocery shopping since I met you.” Rio huffed out.</p><p>“I know.” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>“Hey, someone’s kept me very busy.” Rio jabbed as she pulled away and looked down at Agatha.</p><p>“Are you complaining?” Agatha asked with a smirk on her face.</p><p>“Fine. We will go to your place….” Rio huffed out.</p><p>“Or we can go to our own places for the night?” Agatha offered knowing Rio would object.</p><p>“If you think for one second you get to fuck me senseless in my book store then go home and relax like nothing happened you are so unbelievably delusional it’s not even funny.” Rio said before she pulled Agatha in again for another kiss, one so full of passion and need that it even made Agatha’s head spin.</p><p>They made out like that for a few minutes before Agatha pulled away and smiled brightly at her. “Ready to head home?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m starting to think my apartment is just a place to keep my plants.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“I’m still looking for a place for just us. But if you want, you are more than welcome to move in. When is your lease up?” Agatha offered as she stepped back and headed toward the back door.</p><p>“It’s month to month, I did like that cute little house you showed me with a green house attached in the back…” Rio told Agatha as she hopped off the countertop and followed her.</p><p>“I’ll call the realtor and ask them for a showing, and then put an offer in if we want it...” Agatha told Rio as she let her lead the way to the back door.</p><p>“I want to be where ever you are my love.” Rio said softly before she punched in the security code and they headed out the door.</p>

<p>Agatha made her way to her car before she paused at the vehicle. Rio met her at the car and gave her a small kiss. “I’m going back to my apartment and I’ll meet you through the portal door.”</p><p>“Sounds good. I’m going to call Jen and Alice on the way home. I’ll see you soon.” Agatha said with a smile. She got into her car and pulled out of the parking lot and headed home before she dialed Jen. The phone rang once before she picked up.</p><p>“Please don’t kill me.” Jen said into the phone.</p><p>“Why would I kill you?” Agatha asked with a laugh.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to touch the ring. I felt the energy though. I was hoping you wouldn’t notice.” Jen explained.</p><p>“I’m more curious as to why you decided to go creep on my partner while she was at work.” Agatha asked the potions witch.</p><p>“Hey, for the record. Alice and I had this planned after you called me Monday, when we found out you were dating her. Today was just the first day we had off together.” Jen clarified.</p><p>“Doesn’t help your case Jen.”</p><p>“What my girlfriend is trying to say Agatha is, we just wanted to know she was a good fit for you. We didn’t realize you had been magically bound together with a love binding spell.”</p><p>“That neither of us had any control over.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Yeah, I called my mom. That’s normal.” Alice explained. “She also explained that we shouldn’t have touched the rings at all. Sorry about that.”</p><p>“It’s fine. But I’m about to give Rio a taste of her own medicine and let someone touch my ring.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“What kind of reaction did you have?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Feral unbridled desire to claim what belongs to me.” Agatha said with an unwavering tone.</p><p>“Oh…” Jen said coming to a realization.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m almost home. Dinner is at 7:30, Lilia Calderu will also be in attendance. Be on your best behavior.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Since when do we associate with the best divinations witch in the United States?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Since I started dating her niece.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Only you! Only you would manage to make connections like that without even trying.” Alice said with a laugh.</p><p>“I made friends with you. I just have a habit of...” Agatha started to say but was cut off.</p><p>“Being in the right place at the right time. We know.” Alice and Jen said in unison.</p><p>“Well, we can’t wait to meet your future in-laws and I personally cannot wait to meet Lily. An employee actually gave her, her order at the shop so I didn’t get a chance to chat with her.” Jen said honestly.</p><p>“I’ll see you two Friday. Have a good night.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“You as well Agatha.” They said together before Jen hung up the phone. Agatha pulled into her driveway and pulled out her phone to text Wanda.</p><p>Agatha 7:01 p.m: Jen and Alice know about Rio being next in line and can see the heart sigils. We learned something new today.</p><p>Wanda 7:02 p.m: what did we learn?</p><p>Agatha 7:02 p.m: the rings shouldn’t be touched by anyone but your partner unless you want to feel some feral lust.</p><p>Agatha sighed and got out of her car and headed inside. She was making a mental checklist of all the things she needed to do tomorrow. Call the financial advisor, call the bank, tell Pepper she was taking a half day Friday.</p><p>“I should just text Pepper now.” Agatha said to herself as she opened the fridge to see what she had to cook.</p><p>“Why are you texting Pepper?” Rio asked her as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>“To tell her I’m going to take a half day off on Friday. If you want you can grab my phone and text her for me while I make dinner.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“What are we having tonight?” Rio asked as she magicked Agatha’s phone into her hand and sent Pepper a text.</p><p>Agatha 7:10 p.m: taking a half day Friday for a family dinner with Rio’s parents and a Coven meeting.</p><p>“I don’t know yet. I have a frozen pizza, some ground beef, chicken, and french fries. Burgers and fries sound good?” Agatha asked</p><p>“Sounds perfect. Were you serious about the house thing?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’m debating on it, I’m caught between that and building a house.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“What’s wrong with this house?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Too far away from work for you and me. Your commute is much shorter than mine. Hell mine is shorter when I stay at your apartment. If someone had groceries we would already be there.” Agatha teased as her phone buzzed on the counter top.</p><p>Pepper 7:15 p.m: sounds good. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.</p><p>“Pepper said that was fine. She wants to talk tomorrow. You know I could just open a portal to the bookstore here and commute that way. You can keep this place. We could leave a car at the bookstore. ” Rio offered to Agatha.</p><p>“She’s probably learned more things about my mother’s estate. That’s not actually a bad idea for now. But I’d like a bigger place eventually.”  Agatha explained.</p><p>“Oh? And why is that?” Rio asked with a soft smile as she watched Agatha mill about the kitchen.</p><p>“I’d like a couple copies of you running around in my life at some point. But right now I just want to focus on getting through next week. Oh! I also need to call the local fire department and talk to them about burning the house down. That needs to go on the list.” Agatha said as she made more than enough burger patty’s for the two of them. The oven beeped and she put the fries in.</p><p>“Why are we burning it down? Why not sell it?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No child deserves to be raised in those walls.” Agatha said in a slightly bitter tone that told Rio not to question it.</p><p>“Homes hold memories.” Rio lamented.</p><p>“Exactly and there are no good memories there. She built it before I was born. Not like it’s a historical monument. Plus it could be seen as charity. Let the local department get much needed practice to protect the community.” Agatha explained spinning her desire to destroy the home into something giving and noble.</p><p>“You terrify me a little. Now I see why the last case you lost was 5 years ago.” Rio said with a shake of her head, if Agatha had something to say about it she kept it to herself as her phone buzzed.</p><p>Wanda 7:25 p.m: what’s for dinner?</p><p>“Someone’s hungry.” Rio joked as she read Agatha’s text.</p><p>“I planned for that.” Agatha said with a sigh as she flipped the burgers and put the lid on the pan.</p><p>Agatha 7:26 p.m: burgers and fries. Doors unlocked.</p><p>“They will be here in a second I’m sure.” Rio grumbled.</p><p>“Are you angry?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“No… I like Wanda, it’s just I want you to myself, and I know that’s greedy and selfish. But.” Rio started to complain.</p><p>“I get it babe, believe me. I get it. Once this week is over you’ll only have to deal with her for breakfast.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Speak for yourself Harkness.” Wanda joked as she and Lily walked in.</p><p>“I’ll start cooking for her next week. Promise.” Lily reassured as she walked over to Rio.</p><p>“Lily, come here for a second.” Agatha requested and Rio’s hand shot out to grab the shorter blonde by the wrist.</p><p>“No. Please.” Rio begged softly, Lily looked between the two women.</p><p>“I made it 6 hours, you can make it 45 minutes.” Agatha told Rio who sighed and let Lily go.</p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda warned, unsure of what her best friend had planned.</p><p>“It will affect Rio, not me. I promise I won’t do anything to Lily.” Agatha reassured Wanda who relaxed.</p><p>“Fine.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“I’m not going to do anything inappropriate, Lily would you like to help me with an experiment?” Agatha reassured before politely asking Lily.</p><p>“What is the experiment?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Just touch the ring. Rio let Jen and Alice touch her ring today. It only seems fair. I’d ask Wanda… but I feel like you are the more threatening choice here.”</p><p>“How is Lily more threatening?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Because Rio know’s I’d never fuck you in a million years.” Agatha explained flatly. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to Lily.” Agatha reassured. Lily reached out and touched the ring softly. Rio instantly felt a wave of possessiveness rush over her. Lily spun the ring softly and looked it over before she let Agatha’s hand go as the oven beeped. Each twist and turn of the ring made Rio’s soul scream. Something deep and possessive bubbled up that she had to stamp down.</p><p>“It’s stunning.” Lily said before walking over to Wanda and Rio. Agatha opened the oven and pulled the fries out before turning off the burgers.</p><p>“I understand now and honestly… your reaction at the book store was mild. I’m sorry.” Rio said softly as she took a deep breath to calm herself. She felt wild and felt the desire run rampant as she watched Agatha with lust filled eyes.</p><p>‘Your ass is mine, the second they leave.’ Rio whispered possessively. She wanted nothing more than to claim Agatha in this moment. She didn’t care that Wanda and Lily were right there. Wanda looked over at the woman and noticed how dark her eyes were and decided to ask a question.</p><p>“What was Agatha’s reaction at the bookstore?” Wanda pried as Agatha started pulling condiments out of the fridge and some cheese. Before grabbing some buns from the bread box.</p><p>“I broke the rule. Come make your own burgers the way you want them.” Agatha said as she magicked her burger onto her plate made the way she liked it. Wanda got up and started making her food along with Rio and Lily.</p><p>“You let her?” Wanda whispered dragging Rio from her desire slightly.</p><p>“Oh Wanda…. I had no clue what was happening until it was too late. When your rings show up… you’ll understand. Because the first thing I’m doing is making sure you don’t have work that day then touching them, or asking someone to.” Rio said as she assembled her burger, got fries and ketchup.</p><p>“Okay…” Wanda said trailing off, slightly afraid.</p><p>“At least she’s being nice and making sure you don’t have to work.” Agatha said as she sat down at the table and started eating.</p><p>‘I’m sorry you had to suffer like this for 6 hours my love.’ Rio whispered in her mind. ‘But really, you couldn’t have waited tell the end of the evening?’</p><p>‘No.’ Agatha stated simply which caused Rio to groan audibly.</p><p>“I feel like a conversation is being had and we aren’t apart of it.”  Wanda said honestly as she sat down at the table. Agatha waved her hand and drinks appeared for them.</p><p>“Because there is. These little heart sigils allow us to speak telepathically and share memories.” Agatha explained to her best friend.</p><p>“Fascinating. How far does it reach?” Lily asked as she sat down at the table.</p><p>‘Nooooooo Lily is going to ask a million questions now.’ Rio whined in Agatha’s mind.</p><p>‘Suffer.’ Agatha husked out in Rio’s mind. Rio glared at her before picking up her burger and taking a bite.</p><p>“Haven’t tested that yet, but I can communicate with her while I’m at the firm and she’s at the book store.” Agatha explained after she finished chewing.</p><p>“Interesting. Maybe we should put you in a car and drive and see how far it reaches.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“No, we won’t be doing that.” Rio said in a tone that left no room for argument. Wanda looked at her with a raised eyebrow and Rio scowled slightly.</p><p>“Not like it would matter, the second she got out of range I’d freak out and she’d be in my lap in a second flat. So it’s not worth testing. Now please eat.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“But I have so many questions.” Lily lamented before she picked up her burger and started eating.</p><p>“Later when Rio isn’t as on edge babe.” Wanda said softly to her girlfriend who took the hint and started eating.</p><p>“Give her our numbers later so she can text us any questions she has. She’s officially my  future sister in law. Oh! Have you talked to Pietro? Does he know you are dating someone?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’ll call him later, and give her your numbers later as well.” Wanda clarified before she went back to eating.</p><p>‘Maybe you should call him now so they get out of our hair.’ Rio thought.</p><p>‘Rio, if I call him right now we won’t be having sex tonight. Because he will be here asking where’s his dinner.’ Agatha reassured as the women settled into a comfortable silence and ate their dinner.</p><p>“Rio… I’m sorry if I upset you.” Lily said honestly after they finished eating. They were standing in the entry way after Agatha used her magic to clean the kitchen.</p><p>“You didn’t. Honestly, I don’t know how she had as much patience as she did. So please leave.” Rio pleaded.</p><p>“Yes ma’am. Come along Wanda. I have something I wanted to try out tonight anyway.” Lily said as she grabbed Wanda who was hugging Agatha goodbye.</p><p>“Hey! I was hugging my friend!” Wanda complained as Lily dragged her out the door. The second the door was shut Rio had Agatha pinned against the front door.</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me? How did you not have me in your lap the second Alice touched it?” Rio said as she pinned Agatha’s hands above her head and slid her leg between Agatha’s.</p><p>“Restraint. Lots of restraint.” Agatha huffed out.</p><p>“Fuck restraint. Agatha Harkness if anyone touches your ring ever again I will not behave.” Rio reassured as she used her magic to create vines to secure Agatha to the door. “Is this okay?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“Yes. Green light.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Good, now you’re mine.” Rio said softly as she magicked Agatha’s clothing off.</p><p>“Oh, someone is feeling extra possessive.” Agatha teased as Rio kissed along her clavicle and then softly bit down on it.</p><p>“You know exactly what you did Agatha.” Rio told her as she kissed down Agatha’s chest. Her tongue swirling over the sigil between her breast before she kissed over to a nipple and captured it in her mouth.</p><p>“I’m innocent.” Agatha teased, knowing full well she was anything but. Rio scoffed at her as she slid her hand between her legs and found a pool of wetness between them. A soft moan leaving Agatha’s lips as Rio circled her clit.</p><p>“Oh really? You didn’t do this just to get me to ravage you? You don’t want me to pin you to this door and fuck you against it?” Rio questioned as she softly kicked Agatha’s feet apart so she had better access.</p><p>“Against the door? Wasn’t the plan. Ravage me? Yes.” Agatha told Rio with a smirk. Rio groaned as she slammed two fingers into Agatha.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha screamed as the woman’s started curling her fingers into her. A soft satisfied sound left Rio as she kissed the heart sigil on her chest. “I want to touch you.” Agatha whined.</p><p>“Too fucking bad.” Rio hissed out as she angled herself better and started thrusting into Agatha. “You are mine. You belong to me. Do you understand that? That only I get to touch our connection no one else. Do you understand?”</p><p>Moans and whimpers fell from Agatha’s lips and her hips rolled into Rio’s hand. Agatha’s vision was blurring as Rio continued to thrust into her. “My love, I asked you a question.” Rio said as she stopped moving her fingers.</p><p>“Rio! No, please. Don’t stop.” Agatha begged as she tried to roll her hips.</p><p>“Answer the question and I’ll continue Agatha.” Rio drawled out as she curled her fingers. A whine left Agatha before she composed herself enough to answer Rio.</p><p>“Yes I understand! I belong to you!” Agatha groaned out as she thrashed against the restraints weakly. “Please Rio!”</p><p>Rio started thrusting into Agatha faster and curling her fingers toward her g-spot. She could feel how close Agatha was. “Now, be a good girl and cum for me.” Rio demanded as she brought her thumb up to graze her clit.</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha screamed out, her body shaking as she came. Agatha struggled against the soft vines holding her hands above her head.</p><p>“I know you can get out Agatha, tell me do you enjoy letting someone else take control?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Only you.” Agatha said with a sigh as she magicked the restraints away and let her arms fall onto Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>“Only me?” Rio asked softly as she leaned in to kiss along Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I only trust you enough to let you take control. I only trust you to put me into these situations.” Agatha told Rio sincerely as she leaned her head back against the door and let her lavish attention on her neck.</p><p>“Bed now.” Rio softly demanded before biting down softly on her clavicle. With a flourish of purple magic they were lying in bed together. Rio started kissing down Agatha’s body before she settled between Agatha’s legs. A soft satisfied sound leaving Rio as she brought her mouth to Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Goddesses above I never knew how much I’d crave your tongue.” Agatha said as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair.</p><p>‘I love how you taste.’ Rio’s voice resounded in Agatha’s mind before she started swirling her tongue over Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Fuck Rio.” Agatha moaned out as she softly rolled her hips.</p><p>‘Only I get you like this. I’m the only one that will ever know what you taste like.’ Rio said possessively.</p><p>“Yes! Only you! I belong to you!” Agatha moaned out as Rio drank her in, curling her tongue over her clit.</p><p>‘MINE.’ Rio growled possessively in Agatha’s mind.</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha screamed as she came. Her body curling around Rio’s head as she gripped her hair. Rio continued to flick and curl her tongue over her clit with a satisfied moan. “Oh fuck! Rio!”</p><p>‘Again.’ Rio demanded, she wanted another orgasm.</p><p>“Rio! I’m getting sensitive.” Agatha groaned out as Rio started moving her tongue faster as her hand reached up to lay flatly against the sigil on her chest.</p><p>‘Too bad, give me what I want.’ Rio demanded. Agatha’s moans started to pitch up as she became more sensitive. One hand was removed from Rio’s hair as she reached up to grab a pillow to muffle herself. Her face turned to scream into the pillow as she came.</p><p>Rio pulled her mouth away and smiled softly as she kissed Agatha’s thigh. “I love you.” Rio said with admiration, before a cold wave of panic rushed over her.</p><p>Agatha’s hand shot down to stop Rio from running, wrapping around her hand that was clinging to her thigh. “Come here.” Agatha requested softly.</p><p>“No, I’ve embarrassed myself already.” Rio said with downcast eyes. Agatha teleported her to eye level and grabbed her face softly.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, I love you. I thought that was obvious but apparently I need to be more clear. I love you. This heart beating in my chest beats only for you. My magic chose you and I could never be more thankful for every blessing that has come into my life because of you.” Agatha said as she held Rio’s face. Then she leaned down and kissed her lips softly. Tears welling up in Rio’s eyes as she pulled Agatha close.</p><p>“Not the reaction I was expecting.” Rio said in a watery tone.</p><p>“What were you expecting My Love?” Agatha asked while emphasizing the ‘my love’ part of the sentence.</p><p>“I don’t know… I kinda forgot about us being magically bound and just realized I said that way too soon.” Rio answered Agatha.</p><p>“The rules don’t apply to us, none of this was meant to go this fast but it did and here we are. I love you Rio, I think my soul and magic have always loved you, my brain just took forever to catch up.” Agatha said with a soft kiss.</p><p>“I love you Agatha Harkness.” Rio said with a sigh of relief as she settled against the woman.</p>

<p>Thursday morning came and went with out much event, the women got ready for work, Agatha made breakfast. Lily and Wanda showed up right on time.</p><p>“Good morning ladies. How did your night go?” Rio asked the two women as they walked in the door looking absolutely exhausted.</p><p>“Got any more Vidal Vitality?” Wanda asked in an exhausted tone. With a wave of her hand there were 2 vials on the countertop in front of Wanda and Lily.</p><p>“I love your girlfriend.” Wanda said excitedly as she popped open the vial then downed the liquid. Lily was silently doing the same but with a grimace.</p><p>“Fiancé.” Agatha corrected without thinking.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Wanda asked her best friend in a confused tone.</p><p>“I… uh… Rings?” Agatha started to backtrack.</p><p>“Oh… yeah.” Wanda said softly coming to a realization.</p><p>“So did you call Pietro?” Rio asked Wanda in an attempt to change the subject.</p><p>“No…” Wanda answered begrudgingly.</p><p>“Coward.” Agatha grumbled out at her best friend who was looking at her sheepishly.</p><p>“I wanted to have sex with my girlfriend. I’m so sorry.” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“You could call him tomorrow… after dinner. He can come eat the left overs. Also, I’m going grocery shopping after work tonight. Any requests babe?” Agatha told Wanda before she turned her question to Rio.</p><p>“No?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“That’s fine. I’ll just text your mother and see what staples I should keep in the house for you.” Agatha said with a wink as she got breakfast on the table.</p><p>“Why don’t I go with you?” Rio asked, she really just wanted to spend as much time with Agatha as she could.</p><p>“Because the bookstore is open until 6 and I’d like to be home by the time you get here, but if you want to go with me that’s fine.” Agatha said to Rio as she started eating her breakfast, Rio decided to start eating as well.</p><p>“Awe man, that means it’s fend for yourself night.” Wanda said sadly as she poked at her pancakes, as Lily dove into hers.</p><p>“Or you could meet me at my place after work and I can cook you dinner.” Lily offered which seemed to peak Wanda’s interest.</p><p>“I like that idea way more.” Wanda said excitedly to her girlfriend.</p><p>“I’m so glad the universe sent you someone who can cook. I can worry less about my future nieces and nephews.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Nephews if my future father in law has anything to say about it.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“I mean I know a lady, I’m sure I could ask for some confirmation.” Agatha teased, knowing Wanda was curious as hell.</p><p>“Technically you know two. But I’m pretty sure you were talking about Gaia.” Rio pointed out before shoving another bite into her mouth.</p><p>“Oh yes, Lilia is quite skilled. I was talking about Gaia though.” Agatha clarified as she took a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“If you are gunna ask Gaia, might as well guarantee it’s a boy first for us. That way we don’t have to listen to my father lament about no grandsons.” Lily joked as she took a bite of bacon.</p><p>“I know you are joking, but I would actually ask her if you are serious.” Agatha told them sincerely.</p><p>“I’m not too worried about kids right now. Let’s just enjoy us.” Wanda said to Lily as she took her hand.</p><p>“Awwwww, lame.” Agatha teased her best friend.</p><p>“Fuck you Harkness.”</p><p>“Love you!” Agatha said in a sing song tone before she finished the last of her food and got up to clean the kitchen a little.</p><p>“Alright, we’ve all got big days ahead of us. Finish eating and let’s get to work.” Lily said as she went back to eating.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later they were all rushing out the door to their cars except Rio who took the portal door home to her apartment. She looked around the apartment at all her plants, their lush green hues painting bringing life to the place.</p><p>“Maybe I should start bringing you guys over to Agatha’s so you don’t feel so neglected… or to the book store.” Rio mused to herself before she grabbed her keys and headed to work.</p><p>~Stark Law Firm~</p><p>Agatha walked into her office ten minutes early and was greeted with Tricia standing up and meeting her half way. “Mrs. Potts is in your office.” Tricia said calmly as she walked back over to her desk with Agatha in stride.</p><p>“Thank you. How many meetings do we have on the docket today?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Four.” Tricia answered.</p><p>“Perfect thank you.” Agatha said as she opened the door to her office and cast a few sound dampening spells as she did so. Pepper was leaning against her desk with her arms crossed.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha asked as she walked around her desk and made her way over to the other side so she could sit in her office chair.</p><p>“You’ve managed to almost give my husband a heart attack.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry? What did I do?” Agatha asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Became a major stock holder in Stark Industry’s overnight, along with several sister companies, you should get a mirror because if you look in it… You will see one of the richest women in the world.” Pepper told her.</p><p>“How?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Well on top of Evanora Harkness having money stashed everywhere… she also had a plethora of life insurance on herself because most of these company’s never thought they’d have to pay out due to her witch life span. She had several million dollar policies on herself with you as the sole inheritor. As your lawyer, I’ve already taken the liberty of sending death certificates in Stark Law Firm embossed sealed envelopes.</p><p>“Am I richer than your husband?” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Close. You two are about even now. But I know you’ll invest it well.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“That’s not even ‘fuck you’ money anymore, that’s… ‘stupid insane’ money. And I know exactly what I’m going to do with some of it. Build a house.” Agatha said with a soft smile.</p><p>“Only you would have the smallest of ambitions with that kind of money.” Pepper teased.</p><p>“I mean I could give Tricia a bonus, build Lily and Wanda a house, help kids in need. Whatever I want. Besides quit my job. You are stuck with me. Forever.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“Good, I was slightly worried about losing you still. So care to tell me what’s going on tomorrow?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Jen and Alice need to meet Lily, Rita and Lilia want to come with us on Sunday. That’s a lot of people to cook for so I’m taking a half day tomorrow so I can cook. Plus I thought you’d be thrilled that I’m taking my bereavement early?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“I was worried something bad might be happening is all. So… you and Rio are good?” Pepper asked looking over Agatha, who looked a little tired but no worse for wear.</p><p>“Fantastic. Best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Agatha said with a bright smile.</p><p>“So those slight bags under your eyes are from…” Pepper trailed off.</p><p>“A healthy sex life. My apologies. I don’t like using glamor before 9 a.m. but let me fix that real quick.” Agatha told Pepper before her glamor snapped into place. “Now… do you have anything to do today besides harass me about my under eye bags?”</p><p>“Nothing nearly as fun.” Pepper teased as she headed for the door. She paused as she held the handle. “Iron man and his gaggle of friends are one call away if you need them Sunday. Keep that in mind.”</p><p>“I will. Thank you Pepper.” Agatha said appreciatively.</p><p>~Meanwhile at Lilia’s~</p><p>The elder witch woke up and did her morning ritual of checking for spreadable disease’s coming through US ports and on planes. She wrote down every detail the CDC would need and sent it off to her corresponder. She then got up from her crystal ball to make herself some tea. Her phone rang halfway through the process.</p><p>“Good Morning Rita.” Lilia said casually into the phone.</p><p>“Morning Lilia…” Rita said into the phone in a confused tone.</p><p>“I have a plan today, don’t throw a monkey wrench in it.” Lilia scolded her best friend.</p><p>“What’s your plan? Because I’m worried about Evanora Harkness’s coven freaking the fuck out on Sunday.” Rita told her friend.</p><p>“Oh ye of little faith. I plan on making exactly 6 phone calls today. If you think a single one of those women won’t listen to me you are dead wrong. But this is all precautionary, the odds of them showing their faces is slim, but I want it in the zero percentile. Now, why are you worried? I have everything under control.” Lilia said reassuringly into the phone as she poured herself some tea.</p><p>“She’s been through enough…” Rita lamented.</p><p>“And now she’s got an entire coven standing behind her. Don’t stress so much dear. She’s the safest woman on the planet right now. So if you don’t mind I have phone calls to make and the fear of Gaia to place in these women’s hearts.” Lilia said with a smile into the phone.</p><p>“Fine, be at the Cabin by 7 tomorrow night. Love you Lilia.” Rita said into the phone with a sigh.</p><p>“Love you too, see you tomorrow.” Rita said before hanging up the phone. Lilia sighed loudly into her kitchen as she took a sip of her tea. She opened her notebook and dialed the first phone number. It rang several times before it went to voicemail.</p><p>“Hello, My name is Lilia Calderu, I’m calling as a kindness more than anything really. This Sunday Agatha Harkness will be visiting her mother’s home to collect some thing’s. If you have any sense about you, you’d better leave her and her coven alone while they are there. Thank you for your time.” Lilia said into the phone.</p><p>The next four phone calls went the same, straight to voicemail, on the last one someone decided to pick up.</p><p>“Why are you threatening our coven?” A woman asked in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Threats? Is that what you think this is? The greatest divination which in the world calls you up in secession on a Thursday morning and you don’t have the sense to look at it for the blessing it is?” Lilia asked into the phone.</p><p>“You must be joking right? I doubt it’s actually THE Lilia Calderu calling us.” The woman spat into the phone.</p><p>“I have verified caller ID you dumb bitch.” Lilia said flatly into the phone. “Now listen, and listen closely. If you, or any of your coven show up, it won’t end well for you.”</p><p>“Why should we listen to you? That woman is evil. She’s gotten away with too much.”</p><p>“Your coven has gotten away with too much. Just because it happened twenty years ago doesn’t mean it wasn’t an attempted murder. I’ve seen your faces, I know your names. If you thought I was threatening you before you were wrong. Now I’m threatening you, if any of you step out of line and cause anymore harm to Agatha Harkness, you won’t just be dealing with me, you’ll be dealing with half the avengers, her entire coven, and a police force.” Lilia threatened before continuing indignantly, digging the barbs of insult to add to the injury. “You couldn’t even handle 3 teenagers 20 years ago, what makes you think you can handle all that?”</p><p>The line was quiet for a long moment before she spoke up. “You can’t be fucking serious.” Her tone angry and bitter.</p><p>“Oh but I am. Now be a good witch and listen to the wisest woman who will ever speak to you.” Lilia snarked.</p><p>“I’ll consider it.” The woman said before Lilia hung up the phone.</p><p>“Sunday is going to be fun.” Lilia said flatly. There’s one of two ways this can go, and she hopes the ‘smoothly and without event’ part is the way this turns out. The odds were in her favor now, she knew she had done everything she could to have the best outcome.</p><p>~Vidal Books~</p><p>Rio was in the book store milling about getting things done that she had neglected over the past week or so when Agatha’s voice chimed in. It was around 5:30.</p><p>‘How would you feel about me buying some land and building a house? I’m much richer than I thought I’d ever be and I want us to have the perfect home.’ Agatha said softly.</p><p>‘I’d love nothing more. But again for now I’m thinking about just moving my plants into the book store.’</p><p>‘Or my place…’ Agatha offered meekly.</p><p>‘You already used your magic to teleport them there didn’t you?’</p><p>‘What? Noooo I would never!’ Agatha said in mock innocence that sounded very much like a confirmation. ‘Green Witchery is much easier now… I do see what you mean about the peace lily…’</p><p>‘Very upset she’s been moved?’ Rio asked with an audible chuckle.</p><p>‘Egregiously so, how do you handle this around you all the time?’ Agatha asked in a confused tone the sound of the peace lily’s whines coming through Agatha’s thoughts.</p><p>‘She’ll calm down. Put her next to the big window in the living room, let her get some sun and I’ll move her tonight. I assume you are home already?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘Yes. I left after my last meeting. Been home moving the plants for a couple hours, I teleported them here but I’ve been finding places for them on my own. I was going to talk to you about everything else when you got home… I hope I didn’t overstep?’ Agatha asked slightly afraid she may have upset Rio.</p><p>‘Never. I appreciate it. I have nothing to hide from you Agatha. I’ll be home soon. Then we will talk about canceling my lease and me moving in.’ Rio told Agatha, before the bell rang at the front of the store. ‘I’ve got a customer. See you in 30 ish minutes.’</p><p>“Welcome to Vidal Books!” Rio yelled loudly from the back of the store. She started walking toward the front of the store when she seen someone walking around looking lost. It was a young woman standing at the counter holding a piece of paper.</p><p>“Hello, how can I help you today?”</p><p>“Are you Rio Vidal? I wanted to put my application in to work here.” The woman said softly. She was a witch and looked to be about 20, young and green.</p><p>“Why didn’t you fill out an application online?” Rio asked as she walked over to the woman.</p><p>“I find that it’s nicer to check the place out, speak to someone personally, show initiative.” The woman told Rio.</p><p>“Ah, I see. Is that your resume?” Rio asked the young girl as she pointed at the paper in her hand.</p><p>“Yes.” She said as she offered Rio the thick card-stock with a bright smile.</p><p>“I don’t have any paper applications but I will look over your resume and give you a call tomorrow if I feel like you are a good fit.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Thank you.” The young woman said as she turned to walk away. Rio looked down at the resume and read the name Sage Deveron.</p><p>Rio desperately wanted to stop the young woman but she told her she’d call her tomorrow. Which would give her plenty of time to have a real interview with the woman after reviewing her resume. Rio sighed and pulled her phone out to look at the time  5:45 p.m. she could handle waiting 15 more minutes. She just had to be patient.</p><p>‘How much magical energy did you use moving my plants?’ Rio asked Agatha as she went back to putting books on the shelves.</p><p>‘Not much. Most of them came willingly. The peace lily on the other hand… she put up a fight.’ Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>‘Oh really?’ Rio asked in a knowing tone.</p><p>‘I’ve noticed it’s easier to summon your things than others. I think that has a lot to do with our magical connection. What’s mine is yours and yours is mine.’ Agatha explained.</p><p>‘I’ve noticed it’s easier summoning things in general. So I guess that has to do with your ease of doing so?’ Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>‘I find most things come naturally to me…’ Agatha answered Rio before she continued. ‘It’s 6 o’clock my love.’</p><p>‘I’ll be home in ten.’ Rio said as she locked the bookstore up and headed to her car. A short drive back to her apartment and then up the flight of stairs to the apartment. Rio walked into her apartment to find every single plant missing. She chuckled and shook her head at Agatha. She turned around and grabbed the door handle and activated the portal before walking through it.</p><p>“Honey I’m home!’ Rio joked as she stepped through the door.</p><p>“In the spare bedroom!” Agatha yelled back, Rio made her way toward the spare room and noticed her plants were dotted around the house. Every single one of them happy and content to be where they were except for the peace lily.</p><p>‘Shifted. Don’t like. Rude.’ Seemed to be said over and over in an annoying high pitched frequency. Rio sighed and walked over to the plant and placed her hand softly on the dirt it was growing in.</p><p>“Stop, you are fine. Do you want me to give you back to your original owner?” Rio softly threatened the plant.</p><p>‘No!’ The plant seemed to respond. A soft chuckle leaving Rio as she used her magic to fertilize the plant before getting up and heading toward the guest room.</p><p>“I talked to the destroyer of peace lily. I think she’ll chill the fuck out soon.” Rio reassured as she opened the door and found Agatha putting her plants on shelves in the room.</p><p>‘Thank the goddesses above. Why is that one the loudest out of all of them?”</p><p>“Because she used to belong to Lilia and was severely neglected. So now she knows we can hear her and she’s going to be obnoxious about it.” Rio told her as she walked over to Agatha and took the woman in her arms. Agatha smiled softly and gave Rio a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“Welcome home my love.” Agatha said as she melted into Rio’s arms.</p><p>“So, you want to build a house? What happened to the cute little one with the green house in the back?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“We can build one that will have an atrium for all your plants, places for them and our future children to grow, and it will be away from people. I found a 20 acre lot today and I just wanted to get the ‘let’s build a house’ approval from my favorite person.”</p><p>“I didn’t know Wanda was here? Where is she? I wanna know if I’m allowed to move in.” Rio teased Agatha who looked at her with an unamused expression.</p><p>“Really? If you don’t stop being sassy I will build two houses and she will still be our neighbor.” Agatha said flatly.  Rio raised her hands in surrender.</p><p>“Let’s build a house.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you my love. I’ll put a bid on the property tomorrow. Then we can start talking to builders next week. Whatever you dream up. We can make happen.” Agatha said as she pressed her forehead to Rio’s.</p><p>“Perfect, are you ready to go grocery shopping? I had something I wanted to do with you after.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Not quite yet. I’m still trying to find homes for all your plants. Sorry I thought I’d be done by now.”</p><p>“Wait until we have to find homes for all my books.”</p><p>“There’s plenty of room in my office for those, and I’ve moved all my things to one side of the closet in the bedroom.”</p><p>“You’ve been efficient today!” Rio teased before she gave Agatha another kiss. “Don’t worry about the plants they will be fine until we get back. Come on, let’s go get what we need for tomorrow.” Rio said encouragingly.</p><p>“Fine. Only because I need a break from the peace lily.” Agatha said she let Rio go and rubbed her temples.</p><p>“Sorry, she will calm down to a soft hum here soon just like the rest of them.” Rio reassured her.</p><p>“I’m gunna go change out of my suit into something more comfortable. I’ll be with you soon, if you want to keep tending to your babies.”</p><p>“Why don’t you just magic something different on?” Rio asked, wondering why Agatha was doing things the normal and mundane way.</p><p>“The peace lily put up more of a fight than I thought. Just feeling a little drained. I’ll be right back.” Agatha reassured before she made her way through the door.</p><p>A few minutes later Agatha walked back into the guest room where Rio was taking care of her plants. Rio turned around and looked at Agatha. She was wearing a pair of yoga pants and a baggy off the shoulder sweater that showed her bra strap. Rio’s eyes darted across Agatha’s outfit.</p><p>“You are going to be the death of me. How does everything make you look so good?” Rio asked as hungry eyes looked over Agatha’s form.</p><p>“Nuh uh! Let’s go babe.” Agatha said as she turned around and headed out of the room. Rio’s eyes instantly fell to take in the perfect shape of Agatha’s ass in those yoga pants. A groan resounded from Rio as she followed Agatha out of the room and toward the front door.</p><p>Twenty minutes later they were at the grocery store and Agatha was putting everything she would need for tomorrow in the cart. Rio was three steps behind her at all times admiring the view.</p><p>“Rio Darling, what are you doing back there?” Agatha teased as she continued to fill the cart with items.</p><p>“Just admiring the view. Did you need something?” Rio asked as she watched Agatha’s hips sway. Agatha rolled her eyes as she continued to walk down the aisle.</p><p>‘What are you thinking about?’ Agatha wondered in her mind.</p><p>‘You don’t want to know.’ Rio answered honestly.</p><p>‘Horny witch.’ Agatha teased as she put a few more things in the cart.</p><p>“Alright that’s everything for tomorrow now we gotta do regular grocery shopping. Do you have anything you can’t live without?” Agatha asked as she started navigating down the aisle.</p><p>“You.” Rio said without thinking, causing Agatha to roll her eyes.</p><p>“Insufferable. I meant life sustaining food that nourish’s your body.” Agatha clarified in a way that gave Rio no wiggle room.</p><p>“I like real sugar sodas like Mexican sodas. And I was living off microwave meals and left overs from family dinner before I met you. Honestly anything you make I will eat.” Rio told Agatha which caused the woman to shake her head.</p><p>“Fine but if you think of anything or see anything you want put it in the cart.” Agatha said as she continued to walk down the aisles.</p><p>An hour later they finished shopping, paid and made it out to Agatha’s car. “So what else did you want to talk about?” Rio asked as she buckled into the passenger seat.</p><p>“My mothers car is still parked at the firm. I have to go get it, would you be willing to help me with that? Like if we stop there can you drive it home?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course. We can do that now.”</p><p>“Thank you my love. Let’s go do that and then head home.” Agatha said with an appreciative smile as she turned the car toward the law firm.</p>

<p>Friday morning brought two meetings to Agatha’s attention where she was less than keen on even being present for. With a sigh she listened to her client ask for the best way to “legally” do something. She rubbed her temples and looked at the man. He wanted to embezzle funds, the stupidest of crimes in her opinion and the easiest to get caught at. She would never take this case.</p><p>“There is no best way to ‘legally’ do this. As your counsel I recommend not doing it at all.” Agatha told the man sitting across from her.</p><p>“But what if it needs done?” The man asked.</p><p>“Then I recommend you find a better lawyer than me.” Agatha said with an exasperated sigh.</p><p>“But you’re the best on the east coast…”</p><p>“Now you get the picture don’t ya? Look I don’t even touch embezzlement cases with a ten foot pole unless I’m helping the person who lost the money. Now. Unless you have a real problem I can fix, this meeting is over. I don’t recommend doing this, and I don’t recommend leaving a paper trail following in your wake before your actions of visiting multiple lawyers asking them these questions either. Have a good day.” Agatha said dismissing the floundering man. He flushed in embarrassment and quickly collected his things and stormed out of her office.</p><p>“Goddesses above how stupid can one person be?” Agatha asked herself after she rubbed the bridge of her nose. A soft knock on her door stirred her from her thoughts. She looked up to see Tricia standing there with an amused look. Agatha waved her into the room.</p><p>“Why did we even take that meeting?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“He didn’t disclose what the meeting was about. He just wanted legal counsel on something extremely important. What was it about?” Tricia asked Agatha.</p><p>“He wanted to embezzle funds as ‘legally’ as possible. Like embezzlement is something you play around with.” Agatha said as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“He probably seen that you have several cases under your belt with wins and assumed you won for the people embezzling funds instead of the people who lost their money.” Tricia said honestly as she leaned against the door frame.</p><p>“I have something for you, come here. Shut the door behind you.” Agatha told Tricia who turned and shut the door before she walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“This is a gift. The most I can give you as a friend without you getting taxed on it. Now, I want you to do whatever it is you need to with it. Take your husband and kids on vacation, pay off some bills, keep it for yourself and don’t tell a soul. I don’t care. This is a thank you for being so amazing and such a great secretary.” Agatha said as she handed Tricia a cashiers check. The woman looked down at the check and her eyes widened.</p><p>“Agatha, no… this is too much!” Tricia said as she looked at the amount on the check.</p><p>“Tricia… I mean this in the nicest way I possibly can say. That is like me giving you a quarter for the vending machine. That’s how much money I’ve come into in the last week. Now, say thank you and go back to your desk. I have one more meeting before I leave for the day correct?” Agatha asked the woman.</p><p>“Correct, and Thank You. I appreciate it so much. More than you will ever know. I’d hug you if your office wasn’t a fishbowl.” Tricia said honestly.</p><p>“Sorry, plus you know how much they like to gossip.” Agatha said as she tilted her head in the direction of the main office.</p><p>“That as well. Thank you again. I appreciate it. Your next meeting will be here in 10 minutes.”</p><p>“Good, I want to be done so I can go home and cook for my coven and future in-laws.” Agatha said without thinking again.</p><p>“Oh so the great Agatha Harkness is serious about this woman?” Tricia joked.</p><p>“Very. One day when you no longer work for me. We will sit down and I’ll tell you everything.” Agatha promised.</p><p>“I don’t think I can wait that long. Maybe at your wedding instead?” Tricia asked.</p><p>“Maybe, now get back to work. No more slacking off for either of us.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“After next week.” Tricia reminded Agatha.</p><p>“After next week.” Agatha said remembering she had to take her bereavement. Tricia nodded curtly and headed back to her desk where Agatha watched her put the check into her wallet then tuck it into her purse purposefully and slide it under her desk.</p><p>~Meanwhile at Vidal Books~</p><p>Rio was reading over Sage’s resume when her phone rang. She answered it with out even looking.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Hello baby, just hire her. She’s the perfect fit.” Lilia said into the phone.</p><p>“I’d like to interview her first.” Rio told the woman as she continued to read over the resume.</p><p>“Must you be so difficult.” Lilia said with a scoff.</p><p>“Yes, as a matter of fact I must. Just to be a pain in your ass!” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“You are so stubborn!” Lilia scolded into the phone.</p><p>“Oh, I have a question? Can you do me a favor tonight?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Depends… are you going to listen to me?”</p><p>“I was about to call her in for an interview when you called me Lilia.” Rio told her.</p><p>“Interview, no interview she’s the perfect fit.” Lilia said into the phone and Rio could just imagine her waving her free hand passively.</p><p>“She’s young, she deserves to know what a real interview is like. Make her feel like she’s earned it, ya know?” Rio told Lilia.</p><p>“Fine I suppose that confidence boost will benefit her. Now what’s your request?” Lilia asked Rio.</p><p>“Tonight when you meet Wanda and Lily officially, I know you’ve technically met Wanda. Can you please look and see if they will ever have boys? They are magically bound together like Agatha and I. Their connection isn’t as strong but they are definitely made for each other.” Rio asked her aunt.</p><p>“Oh! I get to tell you about future nieces or nephews?” Lilia said excitedly into the phone.</p><p>“That depends on if Wanda wants to know.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“She will. She’s a chaos witch. Alright, go call the girl and I’ll see you tonight.”</p><p>“Love you. See you tonight.” Rio told Lilia as she pulled her phone away.</p><p>“Love you too.”  Lilia said before she hung up.</p><p>Rio pulled the resume out and dialed the number. It rang 3 times before Sage picked it up.</p><p>“Hello?” The woman said into the phone.</p><p>“Hello, this is Rio Vidal, would you be interested in coming in for an interview on Tuesday?” Rio asked the girl.</p><p>“Of course! What time would you like me to arrive?” Sage said into the phone.</p><p>“Would 2 p.m. work for you?” Rio asked.</p><p>“2 p.m. on Tuesday is perfect! Thank you so much for this opportunity!” The woman said cheerfully into the phone.</p><p>“See you then. Have a wonderful weekend.” Rio said into the phone.</p><p>“You as well, thank you again.” The woman said before disconnecting the phone. Rio opened her phone and sent a text to Agatha.</p><p>Rio 11:45 a.m: I have an Interview with Sage Deveron 2 p.m. Tuesday.</p><p>Agatha 11:46 a.m: Perfect I’m leaving work now. I love you.</p><p>‘Am I to assume you texted me so you wouldn’t forget?’ Agatha teased causing Rio to roll her eyes at Agatha.</p><p>‘Yes my love. I’ll see you tonight.’ Rio said softly before she went back to work.</p><p>Agatha’s drive home was uneventful and once she made it into the house changed her clothing, and took a moment to decompress. The peace lily had settled down like the rest of the plants into a subtle hum. It was soothing now to be surrounded by so many things that were inherently Rio.</p><p>She settled down and relaxed into the couch for a long moment before she felt the room shift. “Hello Momma.” Agatha said with her eyes still closed.</p><p>“Hello witchlett. I have a gift for you.” Gaia said as she sat down next to Agatha who still had her eyes closed.</p><p>“Really? What’s the occasion?” Agatha asked as she cracked one eye open to look at the goddess.</p><p>“Well it occurred to me that yes you can call me whenever you need. But I feel like it would be more reassuring for you to have something you could use to call me. But also something you could wear to remind you that you are loved.”  Gaia explained as she set a dark purple box with a lavender ribbon on it. Agatha finally opened both eyes and sat up straighter. She pulled the ribbon and took the lid off the box. Inside the box on white satin sat a purple broach with three ivory white figures carved and inlayed into the amethyst.</p><p>“Maiden, Mother, Crone, the three goddesses of woman hood?”  Agatha asked as she softly picked the broach up with delicate fingers.</p><p>“Yes.” Gaia said to Agatha as she watched the young woman observe and fiddle with it. The chain still sitting in the box. Agatha realized it was a locket as well very quickly.</p><p>“A locket?” Agatha asked in a very confused tone.</p><p>“Yes. It will have many uses as time goes on. But right now its use is just as a reassurance you are loved. Would you like a photo of Rio in it?” Gaia asked her daughter.</p><p>“If you wouldn’t mind?” Agatha asked unsure of how to feel about such a meaningful gift. A moment later there was a photo of Rio in the locket. “Thank you.” Agatha said with tear filled eyes as she looked up at Gaia.</p><p>“You are most welcome witchlett, now. It can be worn as a necklace, broach, or bracelet. Now once you put it on, you should be able to feel my presence. Tap it 3 times in quick secession if you need me. Even if it’s just for a hug.” Gaia explained as she magicked the necklace onto Agatha.</p><p>“Am I going to need this Sunday? Is that why you are giving it to me?” Agatha’s asked skeptically as she held the broach in her hand.</p><p>“No, that should go fairly smooth. But anything can happen. If you want I can guarantee they will leave you alone.” Gaia offered softly, Agatha looked up at the goddess with a pained look on her face that told her everything she needed to know. “Got it, divine intervention it is then.”</p><p>“Thank you. I really don’t want them trying to pull anything and I end up accidentally killing them.” Agatha said in a watery tone, like she was trying her best to not cry.</p><p>“Anyone stupid enough to attack a spirit witch a second time after surviving the first encounter deserves to meet Violet.” Gaia said honestly. “Now let’s cuddle for a little bit before you start cooking. I feel like you need some extra love today.” Gaia said as she pulled Agatha into her arms and placed a soft kiss on the crown of her head.</p><p>‘How’s it going babe?’ Rio asked softly in her mind as Gaia pulled her into her arms.</p><p>‘Momma Gaia is here, she gave me a gift. Now we are cuddling before I start cooking dinner.’ Agatha told Rio in her mind.</p><p>“That little mind link is very convenient isn’t it witchlett?” Gaia asked Agatha.</p><p>“Very, can you hear what we are thinking?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No but I know you are using it. It’s like I can feel Rio’s presence. That’s all.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Good to know.” Agatha said softly before Rio popped back into her mind.</p><p>‘What’s the gift? Something nice I hope.’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘It’s a brooch. I’ll show you when you get home.’ Agatha explained to her.</p><p>“What are you planning on making for dinner tonight?” Gaia asked Agatha.</p><p>“Two different lasagnas and some garlic bread along with strawberry chocolate tiramisu for dessert.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“That sounds delightful. Maybe after everyone leaves I’ll pop in and steal a slice of the tiramisu.”</p><p>“I’ll set one aside for you just in case Pietro shows up after. He will eat everything if I don’t.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t fault him for it. But I appreciate it. Now. I have to go check on a few things. Give this 3 taps after everyone leaves, and I’ll pop back in. I love you Agatha, have a good night.” Gaia said as she squeezed the woman tightly before she kissed her softly on the head once more.</p><p>Agatha sighed softly before she pushed herself off the couch and headed into the kitchen. It was time to start cooking anyway and she needed everything to be perfect. She first started by getting a pot of water on the stove and bringing it to a boil with a heavy amount of salt so she could cook the noodles. Then she started making the red and white sauces for the lasagna’s.</p><p>Once the main components were cooked and set aside Agatha started assembling everything. She got both lasagna’s made and then started working on the tiramisu.</p><p>She made the cream with strawberry wine and added fresh cut strawberries to it before she soaked her lady fingers in a chocolate infused coffee. She then assembled the dessert and dusted it with coco powder and stuck it in the fridge while the lasagnas baked. Right as she got the tiramisu in the fridge the portal door to Rio’s apartment opened.</p><p>“It smells amazing in here babe!” Rio said as she rushed into the kitchen.</p><p>“Thank you. How was work?” Agatha asked Rio as the woman walked up to her and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“Great, just started getting orders from the schools and library’s today. I’m surprised Wanda isn’t here yet.” Rio said honestly as she looked around the house.</p><p>“She knows better than to be in the way on coven meeting nights.” Agatha told Rio as she took off her apron so she could give her a hug and another kiss.</p><p>“Oh so she has some sense about her.” Rio joked.</p><p>“Sometimes. Oh, here’s the gift Gaia gave me.” Agatha said as she leaned back and showed Rio the necklace hanging around her neck. Rio picked it up and looked at the brooch pensively.</p><p>“It suits you.” Rio said softly as she let it fall against Agatha’s chest. “Do you need any help with anything?” Rio asked as she pulled away.</p><p>“There are table extenders in the closet in the dining room and extra chairs. Could you work on that before you go get your parents and Lilia?” Agatha requested.</p><p>“Of course.” Rio said as she pulled away from Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you my love.” Agatha said appreciatively before she turned back around and started working on the garlic bread.  She got it set up and on sheet trays quickly before she placed it on the oven. She would bake it off right before everyone started arriving.</p><p>Ten minutes later Rio came back into the kitchen with a smile on her face. “All set up! Do you need anything else done before I head to the cabin and collect them? It’s 6:45.”</p><p>“No, I need to get changed and I can use my magic to set the table while you get them. Thank you for your help.” Agatha said appreciatively before she walked over to Rio and gave her another kiss.</p><p>“You’re welcome. I’ll be back soon.” Rio said as she took Agatha’s hand and squeezed it.</p><p>“Do you want me to change your outfit before you leave?” Agatha asked as she looked at the outfit Rio was wearing. It wasn’t a terrible choice honestly but she wanted to dress Rio up.</p><p>“Go for it.” Rio said with a shrug. Then her outfit was changed into a sage green button up with the sleeves rolled 3/4ths of the way up, a deep green vest that had Ivy leaves embroidered in gold, black slacks and shoes. The shirt had the top two buttons unbuttoned and her hair was done up in a neat bun.</p><p>“Stunning.” Agatha said appreciatively as she looked over Rio with hungry eyes.</p><p>“You did this to your self my love.” Rio teased before she stepped toward the bedroom door. “I’m going to get my family now. You better look magificent when I get back.” Rio said with a smile before disappearing out of sight.</p><p>“I am my own worst enemy.” Agatha said to herself as she magicked an outfit on herself.  A deep purple knee length dress, with corset back settled against her skin, black heels and her jewelry added accents to the outfit before she put her apron back on to finish taking care of dinner.</p><p>Ten minutes later there was a knock on her front door. Agatha made her way to the entry way and opened it to find Jen and Alice looking well dressed with smiles gracing their faces.</p><p>“We brought wine.” Jen said with a smile as Agatha stepped aside and let them in.</p><p>“Perfect thank you. Dinner is almost done and you are the first to arrive. Rio is collecting her parents and Lilia now. Head toward the dining room.” Agatha said as she guided the women toward the kitchen.</p><p>“You look great Agatha.” Alice said with a smile before she followed Jen into the house. Jen was wearing a soft pink sweater and black slacks, Alice was wearing a blue button up and black slacks as well.</p><p>“So do you two. Wanda and Lily will be here last I’m sure.” Agatha told the women as they walked deeper into the home. A moment later she heard her bedroom door open.</p><p>“Babe I’m back, it’s just Momma and Lilia though. Papa’s in Nevada dealing with an emergency.” Rio said loudly into the house as the three of them walked though the portal.</p><p>“Well that sucks.” Agatha said mostly to herself. Rio guided Lilia and Rita toward the entryway but not before hearing a panicked scream from the peace lily that was still in the living room. “Rio! Reassure the damn plant!”</p><p>“I’m going! I’m going! Momma, Lilia go down that hall into the kitchen.” Rio said loudly before she headed toward the plant.</p><p>“What was that about?” Jen asked as she looked at Agatha.</p><p>“The peace lily in the living room used to belong to Lilia and is traumatized.” Rita said with a laugh as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>“Oh! So you can hear it too?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Loud and clear.” Rita said as Lilia swatted at her.</p><p>“Well I’m sorry that someone gave me a plant that I didn’t know how to care for! Get over it you dramatic greenery!” Lilia yelled down the hall.</p><p>“I feel like I missed something.” Alice said in a confused tone.</p><p>“Most green witches can ‘hear’ plants. But because we are from the original line we can actually hear them. The peace lily in the living room felt Lilia’s presence and decided to scream something along the lines of ‘no! Not her! I’ll be good! I’m sorry I was dramatic about the purple one moving me.’ When we walked in the room.” Rita explained.</p><p>“I’m the purple one now?” Agatha asked with a laugh as she put oven mitts on and pulled the lasagnas out of the oven and put the garlic bread in. There was a knock on the front door right as Rio was walking past.</p><p>“I’ve got it babe!” Rio yelled as she opened the door. Wanda and Lily stood there with a smile. “You never knock.” Rio teased as she stepped aside and let the women in.</p><p>“I thought I’d use my manners for once.” Wanda said with a huff as she walked into the house.</p><p>“She has those?” Rio whispered to Lily.</p><p>“Nope. Not touching that one right now.” Lily said with a blush as she followed Wanda into the house.</p><p>“Alright you all go sit down at the table. I’ll get everything taken care of.” Agatha told the group as she magicked the table and its place settings down. Then with a flourish the candles were lit, the lasagna’s were on casserole mats and the wine Jen had brought was opened and breathing along with a few more bottles.</p><p>The women filed into the dining room and Agatha took her apron off, pulled the garlic bread out of the oven and cut it before getting it into a basket on the table as well. She then made her way into the dining room.</p><p>Everyone was seated at the table and waiting patiently for Agatha. “Have we all been introduced?” Agatha asked as she sat down next to Rio.</p><p>“Not yet, we were just settling in and looking at everything you made. Two different types of lasagna?” Lilia asked the young witch.</p><p>“White lasagna with spinach, ricotta, sausage, onion, and peppers. A more ‘traditional’ lasagna with red sauce, ground beef, sausage, ricotta and blended cheeses. Garlic bread and for dessert I made strawberry chocolate tiramisu. I hope I don’t offend your Sicilian roots too much with my cooking Lilia.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“A home cooked meal is appreciated no matter what form it comes in.” Lilia reassured.</p><p>“Alright do we want to go around and introduce ourselves or do you guys just want me to tell everyone who everyone is?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I think it would just be easier to introduce ourselves, name, craft, affiliation to Agatha or myself.” Rio suggested.</p><p>“I’ll go first. I’m Lilia Calderu, I’m a divinations witch, and I’m Rio’s adoptive Aunt.”</p><p>“I’m Rita Vidal, I’m a green witch and if it wasn’t obvious I’m Rio’s Momma.”</p><p>“I’m Wanda Maximoff, I’m a chaos witch, I’m Agatha’s best friend and adoptive sister.”</p><p>“I’m Lilian Grey, I’m a potions witch and I am Wanda’s girlfriend.”</p><p>“You are much more than that, you are also my future sister-in-law and our friend. Okay, Kale your turn.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“I’m Jennifer Kale, I am also a potions witch, Alice is my life partner, and I’m Agatha’s friend.”</p><p>“I’m Alice Wu-Guliver, I’m a protections witch, Jen is my life partner and I’m also Agatha’s friend.” Alice explained.</p><p>“And my father is MIA but his name is Daniel and would’ve loved to have been here.” Rio said finishing the conversation off.</p><p>“Alright it’s hopefully cooled down enough to serve let’s get some food on plates and wine  in glasses.” Agatha told the group of women.  Everyone was served their meals and they started eating.</p><p>“Thank you for going to all this trouble Agatha.” Jen said before she took a sip of wine.</p><p>“Thank you for coming. I know how much you actually hate people.” Agatha said with a smirk before she started eating her dinner.</p><p>“Oh is that the standard we are setting for the evening?” Wanda asked in a gleeful tone.</p><p>“No.” Jen, Alice, Lily and Agatha said in unison, shutting Wanda down quickly, who just huffed and picked up a piece of garlic bread and bit into it aggressively.</p><p>“You guys never let me have any fun.” Wanda said with a huff.</p><p>“How long have you two been dating?” Lilia asked Wanda and Lily.</p><p>“A week, but we are like they are.” Lily answered as she pointed at Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“Fascinating. I’ve never seen it happen outside our family.” Rita said to the two women.</p><p>“My mother mentioned she’s seen it a few times but she’s been around the world a few hundred times.” Alice said with a shrug.</p><p>“So it’s rare but not unheard of.” Rita mused to herself as she took a bite of food. “This is delightful Agatha!”</p><p>“Have you two tested it?” Agatha asked Jen and Alice. “Thank you Rita.”</p><p>“In what sense?” Alice asked looking over at Agatha.</p><p>“Have you two used your magic with each other in anyway in the last ten years? A good example is touching magical energy together.” Agatha explained, Jen and Alice pause for a long moment before they looked at each other.</p><p>“Have we?” Alice asks in a confused tone as she looked over Jen, trying to remember.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t think we have.” Jen said to Alice.</p><p>“Before you two do that. Let’s pause for moment.” Rita said to the group, which caused all of them to look at her. “Magical energy is typically dormant. Maybe that’s why you two have never discovered this. It has to be a conscious choice. Agatha and Rio are so powerful that their magic is always thrumming through them. They can’t turn it on and off like the rest of us. I have no doubt you two will be magically compatible especially if you’ve been together a long time. Daniel and I dated for 5 years before we tested to see if we were compatible.”</p><p>“We’ve been together ten years. But honestly using magic on a partner is seen as tabu in my culture so we never thought to try it out.” Alice explained.</p><p>“Ah, that explains a lot.” Lilia said with a shrug before she went back to eating.</p><p>“Well what are you waiting for?” Agatha encouraged the two women. Alice’s orange magic sparked to life as she held her hand out for Jen who had her pink magic sparking softly at her finger tips. They reached for each other and then the sparks arced out to one another. With a flash two rings settled on their left hands.  Alice’s ring was gold with soft pink spires and Jen’s was almost black with orange lightening bolts shooting across it.</p><p>“Woah! Wait a second that’s not my esthetic.” Jen said sassily as she looked at the almost obsidian ring on her left hand.</p><p>“Like I want your girly shit stuck to me for the rest of our lives Jen.” Alice joked as she admired the soft gold ring.</p><p>“Welcome to carrying a small part of your partner with you wherever you go.” Agatha said before she took a bite of her food.</p><p>“Well this isn’t how I expected this evening to go.” Lilia said in a shocked tone as she looked over at the two women.</p><p>“How was this evening supposed to go?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Are you actually asking me for once?” Lilia said in an excited tone.</p><p>“If she’s not, I am.”  Lily requested.</p><p>“I didn’t expect their connection to be as deep as it is already. Maybe the sigils on their chests but not the rings.” Lilia told them before taking a bite of her food.</p><p>“Does that bode well or not for us?” Wanda asked thinking ahead, worried about Sunday.</p><p>“It doesn’t change anything for Agatha or Rio. Alice and Jen on the other hand it does. Now if they want to know they can ask but other than that nothing important changes.”</p><p>“I’m good.” Alice said before she went back to eating.</p><p>“Honestly, same. Although I am afraid of Lorna’s reaction the next time she sees us.” Jen said with a shudder at the thought of Lorna being angry.</p><p>“She will be ecstatic, don’t worry.” Lilia reassured.</p><p>“You’ll be hearing from my lawyer if she isn’t.” Jen joked which caused Lilia to raise an eyebrow at the women.</p><p>“She’s talking about me Lilia.” Agatha told the divination witch who just scoffed at the group before she went back to eating.</p><p>“This is quite good Agatha, I don’t know if Rio told you but the breakfast sandwich you sent with her was also delicious.” Lilia complimented.</p><p>“Thank you for the compliment Lilia.” Agatha said appreciatively before they all started eating again. Once everyone was finished eating Agatha used her magic to clear the plates away and then got up to get the tiramisu out of the fridge.</p><p>“So what’s the plan for Sunday?” Rita asked.</p><p>“I don’t really have one. Honestly I don’t even want to step foot inside the damn place ever again. If I could take a gas can and a box of matches with me and light it on fire I would.” Agatha said honestly as she set the dessert on the table.</p><p>“Yeah let’s not do that.” Alice said nervously, knowing that she would have to report it.</p><p>“I’m donating it to the fire department for them to practice with. Then specifically requesting when they want to burn it down to call me when they plan to so I can watch it go up in flames.” Agatha told them.</p><p>“Good idea” Rita and Lilia said in unison.</p><p>“I vote for just lighting it on fire on Sunday.” Wanda said with a smirk.</p><p>“No, we won’t be doing that.” Lily said in a tone that left no room for argument.</p><p>“Yes dear.” Wanda said sadly.</p><p>“I like her. I’ve never seen Wanda so well behaved.” Jen said with a chuckle.</p><p>“You don’t want to get into that right now Jen.” Rio told her as she shook her head.</p><p>“Maybe I do. You don’t know Rio.” Jen said curiously.</p><p>“Please not with my Mother and Aunt here.” Rio requested.</p><p>“We aren’t prudes dear.” Lilia scolded Rio,</p><p>“I understand that but we are getting off topic. Do we want to meet here around noon on Sunday then head over there and get everything sorted out?” Rio requested as Agatha started serving up dessert for everyone.</p><p>“Thank you witchlett.” Rita said as Agatha handed her a plate. “I can handle that. Pick us up at the cabin like you did tonight?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Sounds good to us. I’m closed on Sunday’s and Alice took the day off.” Jen agreed.</p><p>“I’ll be here.” Wanda said with a shrug.</p><p>“So will I.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Okay now that we’ve established that. You can ask your personal questions.” Agatha said with a sigh as she sat down.</p><p>“Why is Wanda so well behaved all of a sudden.” Jen asked.</p><p>“Lily is a pleasure dom and put me in my place more than once this week.” Wanda answered before she took a bite of the tiramisu.</p><p>“Oh. Not the answer I was expecting.”  Jen said honestly.</p><p>“Oh that reminds me! I owe you two something before you leave.” Agatha said with a grin that told Alice and Jen they should be very afraid.</p><p>“Why am I suddenly afraid for my life?” Alice said as she scooted closer to Jen.</p><p>“I don’t know babe, but same.”  Jen answered.</p><p>‘I don’t know if I support this idea or not.’ Rio said in her mind.</p><p>‘I think they deserve a taste of their own medicine.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“Don’t worry, she’s not going to harm you.” Lilia said as she shook her head at the vision she just got.</p><p>“Lilia… what did you see?” Rita asked her best friend.</p><p>“Nope. Some things are better left unsaid.” Lilia told Rita which was speak for ‘we will gossip about this while getting wine drunk on the cabins couch.’</p><p>“I just realized something… but I’m afraid to ask.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“The cabin accepted me because your mother and I are best friends. Just like it would’ve accepted Wanda if you ever bring her because she’s Agatha’s best friend, and Lily in turn.” Lilia explained. “Now let’s enjoy this dessert Agatha worked so hard on.”</p><p>They all started eating their desserts at the same time and looked over at Agatha in unison, and for the first time that evening everyone spoke over one another. A chorus of “This is so good”, “Delightful”, “magnificent” and several other words that got lost before all the women burst out laughing.</p><p>“Can we try that again, one at a time?” Agatha requested after the laughter settled down.</p><p>“It’s delightful Agatha.” Lilia complimented.</p><p>“This is so good, I need to take some to Daniel.” Rita told Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll make sure he gets a healthy portion. I was a little sad he couldn’t come.” Agatha told Rita.</p><p>“Papa would’ve felt so overwhelmed by this many women.” Rio reassured Agatha.</p><p>“I don’t know why you don’t bake more, this is delicious.” Jen complimented.</p><p>“Honestly one of the best desserts I’ve ever had.” Lily told Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t inflate her ego.” Wanda scolded Lily softly before looking at her best friend. “But it really is good. We need to hide this from Pietro.”</p><p>“Oh is your brother scheduled to visit as well?” Alice asked, she liked him even if the was a zippy pain in the ass.</p><p>“After dinner I’m gunna call him because he hasn’t met Lily yet.”</p><p>“Ah, okay. Well anyway. It’s magnificent Agatha. I’ve had quite a few different types and this one is made very well.” Alice complimented.</p><p>“Stop, you guys are too much.” Agatha said with a blush. “But thank you, I appreciate it. I’m glad you all love it.”</p><p>They all finished eating their desserts quickly and then Wanda and Lily got up and started cleaning the kitchen leaving Lilia, Rita, Jen, and Alice sitting at the table.</p><p>“I still have to open the green house tomorrow, can you take us home Rio?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Let me get a to go container for some food for Daniel and the dessert.” Agatha said as she stood up. She walked into the kitchen and opened a cabinet and grabbed a couple containers out of the cabinet. “Thank you for helping clean up I appreciate you two.” Agatha said to the two women before she headed back into the dining room.</p><p>Agatha served up a portion of each lasagna  before putting a lid on and handing it to Rita then scooping a large portion of the dessert into the container and putting the lid on before handing it to Rita. “Thank you witchlett. I’ll send your cake container home with Rio. I forgot to grab it before we left.”</p><p>“Wait there was cake at some point?” Alice asked in an indignant tone.</p><p>“Last week. Been gone for a minute.” Agatha answered as Rita, Rio and Lilia got up.</p><p>“Thank you for dinner and the delightful conversation.” Rita said as she hugged Agatha before letting her go.</p><p>“I need to speak to Wanda before we leave but I appreciate dinner it was delightful. Dessert was also splendid. I’m so glad my niece has found someone who can cook so well.” Lilia said as she hugged Agatha.</p><p>“What did you need to talk to me about?” Wanda asked as she walked back into the dining room with Lily.</p><p>“Rio mentioned something about wanting to know if your first child will be a boy?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“It would be nice to know.” Lily told Lilia.</p><p>“Give me your hands. Let’s look.” Lilia said as she held her hands out for the two women to take. A vision of twin boys flashed before her eyes being held in Wanda’s arms in a hospital bed. She looked exhausted but absolutely on the moon. Then a vision of twin girls being held in Lily’s arms and two young boys about 4 years old peaking over the edge of the bed looking up at Lily holding the two girls.</p><p>“Do you want to know everything or just the minor details?” Lilia asked as she let their hands go.</p><p>“Minor details.”</p><p>“You’ll have boys first.” Lilia said honestly before she stepped back with a smile.</p><p>“Lilia…” Rio trailed off as a warning.</p><p>“Fine. Twin boys first. Wanda has to be the one to get pregnant.” Lilia clarified.</p><p>“Not shocked by that in the least.” Agatha said with a laugh.</p><p>“Alright let’s head out before you start talking about my grandchildren.” Rita said dragging Lilia along by the arm toward the living room.</p><p>“I’ll be back soon.” Rio said as she gave Agatha a kiss before she rushed off to send her Mother and Aunt home.</p><p>“Now, are we hanging around and getting wine drunk?” Jen asked the other women in the dining room.</p><p>“No, Rio has to work tomorrow and I think you do too don’t you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“You’re right. Alright. Come one Alice, let’s get ready to head out.” Jen said as she stood up, Alice followed suit and they both made their way toward the door.</p><p>“Hands before you leave.” Agatha said holding her hand out for them to give them to her.</p><p>“No.” Jen said defiantly Alice sighed and just put her left hand out for Agatha to touch.</p><p>“You don’t get to say no Jen.” Agatha told her sternly.</p><p>“But I’m scared.” Jen said with a nervous tone.</p><p>“You only have to suffer for the 45 minute drive home. I had to suffer for over 7 hours. Suck it up Kale.” Agatha scolded the woman who huffed and put her hand out. Agatha took Alice’s first and softly ran her thumb over the ring. She seen Jennifer bristle out of the corner of her eye before letting Alice’s hand go. Then Agatha grabbed Jen’s hand and did the same motion.</p><p>“Nope! Leaving now! Sorry about doing that! Bye!” Alice said as she grabbed Jen by the arm and dragged the taller woman out the door.</p><p>“That was mean Agatha.” Rio said as she walked up behind Agatha and placed a soft kiss on her shoulder as she watched the two women get in the car and speed off.</p><p>“I think it was plenty fair.” Agatha said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Depends on who you ask.” Rio said as she pulled away and headed into the kitchen with the cake container. Agatha reached up and tapped the necklace Gaia gave her three times.</p><p>“Hello witchlett! How did dinner go?” Gaia asked as she appeared next to Agatha.</p><p>“Great. There’s plenty of left overs if you want some before we call Pietro.” Agatha told Gaia before she walked back into the kitchen. Rio was serving up a slice of dessert for Gaia as they walked in.</p><p>“I’m mostly interested in dessert, but I’d be willing to try the lasagna.” Gaia said as she followed Agatha before sitting down at the island.</p><p>“You don’t eat often do you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Not really. Ambrosia is pretty sustaining.” Gaia said as she magicked a fork into her hand before taking a bite of the dessert. “Absolutely Marvelous.”</p><p>“Tell me, am I gunna get fat?” Rio asked the goddess.</p><p>“No you aren’t going to get fat. Your nightly activities are going to keep you two skinny.”  Gaia told Rio.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say to that.” Agatha said before she walked over to Wanda and Lily who were leaning against the counter talking softly with each other. “Are you two okay?”</p><p>“Yeah. We are just trying to figure out how big of a house we are going to need in the future.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“I was contemplating building you two one as well so our kids could grow up together and we could still be close. I found a decent sized property that I could split and we could be neighbors. That way Lily and Rio can have a huge garden and green house.” Agatha told the two.</p><p>“No. That’s not something you need to burden yourself with Agatha.” Lily said in a distressed tone.</p><p>“You haven’t told them yet have you?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I’ve been busy.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“What haven’t you told us?” Wanda asked</p><p>“I’m just as rich as Tony Stark. Evanora fucked herself and made it so that I was the sole inheritor of her finances, estate and assets and couldn’t edit it until I turned 50.” Agatha explained to them.</p><p>“Oh.” Lily said softly.</p><p>“So if I want to build my best friend and her future wife a house I can and will… If Wanda will let me.”</p><p>“Have I ever been able to stop you before?” Wanda asked with a laugh. “Also that’s the best fucking thing I’ve ever heard! The irony! It keeps getting better and better.”</p><p>“Dessert was delicious. But I must be going so Pietro isn’t here all night. Have a good night girls. Agatha come give your mother one more hug.” Gaia requested, Agatha walked over to the goddess and gave her another hug before letting her go and the woman disappeared.</p><p>“Do I have to call him?” Wanda asked in a sad tone.</p><p>“I’ll make sure he goes home after feeding him all the left overs.” Agatha promised as she magicked her phone into her hand and dialed Pietro. It rang once before he picked up the phone.</p><p>“Aggie! Everything okay?” Pietro asked into the phone.</p><p>“Everything’s fine, I just have a ton of left over lasagna from the coven meeting tonight and a surprise standing in my kitchen for you.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Heck Yeah! Be there in a minute!” Pietro said as he hung up the phone. A literal minute later Pietro rushed into the house and skidded to a stop in the kitchen.</p><p>“Is she the surprise?” Pietro asked looking at the small blonde standing in Wanda’s arms.</p><p>“Pietro, meet my girlfriend Lily.” Wanda said nervously to her brother.</p><p>“Hello Lily, you are quite the cutie! I can’t believe my sister had kept you a secret from me.” Pietro said in a slight scolding tone directed at his sister.</p><p>“Oh it’s about to get much heavier. But how about you sit down and eat something first and we will explain everything.” Agatha told him as she shoved the pan of lasagna toward him.</p><p>“Sure, I haven’t eaten enough today anyway.” Pietro said as he sat down at the countertop. He quickly scarfed down half the pan before looking up at the four women.</p><p>“Okay spill. What’s going on.” Pietro said requesting an explanation. Agatha sighed and decided to just start talking while he ate.</p><p>Thirty minutes later everything had been covered and he was fully caught up. He looked over at his two sisters with a bright smile on his face. “In less than two weeks you two have finally found your soulmates. That makes me so happy! I don’t have to worry as much about dying before you two now.”</p><p>“Really? That was a concern?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah. Just because you two get to live for a thousand years doesn’t mean I get to. I know my lifespan is much shorter than yours. At least when I go I know you two will have each other and your partners. Which by the way are very beautiful women who seem to care deeply about you.” Pietro explained.</p><p>“Sometimes you are sweeter than honey… it makes me forget how much of a little shit you can be.” Agatha said with a smile:</p><p>“So am I getting nieces and nephews before I die?” Pietro jabbed.</p><p>“Yes, Jeeze! You are fucking ridiculous!” Wanda scolded.</p><p>“Language Wanda.” Pietro scolded.</p><p>“I’m not a teacher, I can swear all I want!” Wanda said with a huff.</p><p>“The real reason you could never work for Charles Xavier.” Pietro said with a laugh.</p><p>“Like Logan doesn’t swear at the children.” Wanda said flippantly.</p><p>“Okay, time for dessert then you get to go back home. I have things I have to finish. Rio has to work tomorrow. Wanda and Lily have to go home at some point.” Agatha said as she slid a plate of the tiramisu over to him.  He took a bite and looked at Agatha skeptically.</p><p>“I only get this much?” He asked her with a pout.</p><p>“Yes because I actually like it and wanted some for myself.” Agatha told him with a pointed look.</p><p>“Fine. I guess I should just be grateful for basically a whole pan of lasagna. Thanks for dinner sis.” He said as he quickly ate the dessert before he got up and gave Agatha a hug after washing his plate and fork.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Now get outta my house. I wanna cuddle with my fiancé.” Agatha told him playfully as she shoved him toward the door. He stopped Agatha and turned to give Wanda a hug before looking at Lily.</p><p>“Nice meeting you Lily. Welcome to the family.” Pietro said as he gave her a hug and then dashed out the door.</p><p>“If you put him in a line up with several men I would’ve never picked him as your twin brother.” Lily told Wanda.</p><p>“I know. Now let’s head home. It’s been a long day.” Wanda said to Lily as she started to pull her toward the door.</p><p>“Goodnight ladies!” Agatha said as she watched the two women leave.</p><p>“That went way smoother than I expected.” Rio said honestly after the front door shut.</p><p>“I know right. Now let’s go cuddle and get some rest.” Agatha said as she grabbed Rio’s hand and headed toward the bedroom.</p>

<p>~Back at the Cabin~</p><p>Lilia and Rita were settled on the couch drinking wine. The hearth in the middle of the room was burning keeping the room a nice temperature.</p><p>“One of those two is getting pregnant tonight aren’t they?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Which two?” Lilia asked before she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“Jen and Alice.” Rita stated clearly.</p><p>“Oh yes. Right after we left Agatha made a very clear point to touch their rings. Because Alice had to be nosey on Wednesday and touch Rio’s ring.”</p><p>“Oh no! Why would someone do such a thing?” Rita said with an eye roll.</p><p>“Uneducated I suppose. I’m shocked yours and Daniel’s never showed up.” Lilia said honestly.</p><p>“Every magical connection is different. You know that. I’m just happy the cabin didn’t kill him.” Rita told Lilia before taking a sip of wine.</p><p>“I’m also happy about that, he’s a good man, husband, and father. Now. Do you want to know who’s actually getting pregnant tonight?” Lilia asked</p><p>“Neither of them seem very maternal…. But I’d assume Jen.”</p><p>“That’s correct. Alice’s job is too dangerous for her to be carrying a child… ever. But Lorna Wu will be over the moon about her first and only grandchild.” Lilia said with a bright smile.</p><p>“You are just happy to be talking about baby’s in general.” Rita said with an eye roll as she took another drink of wine.</p><p>“Hey, life long friends and playmates for your grandchildren are always a bonus.”</p><p>“If they have kids.” Rita clarified.</p><p>“They will. Don’t stress too much. You’ll be a grandma before you know it, then all that gray hair will finally be justified.” Lilia said as she pointed at the two gray streaks framing Rita’s face.</p><p>“She was worth them. Plus it’s a nice indicator and warning to know you are carrying the next one in line.” Rita said with a sigh as she looked at the hearth, focusing on the fire for a moment while the memory of her hair turning gray sent her into a mild panic while she was carrying Rio.</p><p>“Still quite a shock to see happen over 9 months.” Lilia said as she placed her hand on Rita’s knee. “But she was worth it, wasn’t she?”</p><p>“Yes, she was. I’m so glad she’s finally met Agatha. That witchlett truly is a gift. I’ve never seen my daughter smile so brightly!” Rita said cheerfully.</p><p>“I am so mad that she was even a blind spot to me until they met! That was so frustrating.” Lilia said in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Was she worth it?” Rita asked with a laugh.</p><p>“Of course she was! She’s brilliant, gorgeous, and most importantly she loves Rio.” Lilia said with a smile then the front door opened.</p><p>“Rita I’m home! Oh, Hi Lilia!” Daniel said as he walked in the door.</p><p>“Agatha packed up dinner for you, it’s in the fridge. Dessert as well.” Rita said from her seat on the couch.</p><p>“I knew I loved that girl. Thank you darling. I’m starving.” Daniel said as he walked over to Rita and bent over the couch to give her a kiss before standing up straight and heading into the kitchen.  A few minutes later Daniel came out of the kitchen holding the lasagna container and a fork.</p><p>“So how did it go?” He asked as he sat down in his chair.</p><p>“Great, Agatha and Rio have already started moving in together.” Rita said with a smile.</p><p>“Good, maybe I’ll get grandchildren before my 150th birthday.” Daniel said with a smile before he took a bite of the lasagna. He looked up at both women as he chewed slowly.</p><p>“I know. She’s an amazing cook. Wait until you get to dessert.” Lilia said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I’m just glad I don’t have to worry about making a week’s worth of food for Rio every Saturday now.” Rita joked.</p><p>“You are still going to make too much food and you know it.” Daniel said as he shoved a bite of lasagna into his mouth.</p><p>“I can send it with you and ship some off to Lilia. I’ll adapt eventually.” Rita told the group.</p><p>“I’ll never complain about a home cooked meal.” Lilia said honestly as she took a sip of wine, while Daniel finished off his meal.</p><p>“I’m gunna go get dessert. Do you two want refills?” Daniel asked as he stood up.</p><p>“No I think I’ve had enough wine tonight, thank you Daniel.” Lilia said honestly as she handed him her glass.</p><p>“I’ll take a bottle of water dear, thank you.” Rita said as she handed her husband the wine glass.</p><p>“Got it, be right back.” Daniel said as he walked toward the kitchen.</p><p>“An entire love bound coven seems to be a good omen. Don’t you think?” Lilia said with a smile.</p><p>“I’d argue that you need to find yours for that to count.” Rita said before she got more comfortable on the couch.</p><p>“I’m much too old for all that flimflam.” Lilia said with a scoff.</p><p>~Meanwhile in Salem~</p><p>Gaia was busy deciding how to handle the coven that was collected at their new coven heads house. The six women were sitting at a table arguing about how to handle Agatha Harkness’s arrival on Sunday.</p><p>“Fucking morons.” Gaia said as she walked up to the window and watched them for a long moment; they all seemed to be bickering about how to handle the situation. She sighed and walked around to the front door and knocked on it. Figuring that politeness might get her farther. All the noise in the house stopped and a chair slid across the floor before footsteps made their way to the door.</p><p>“What do you want!?” A woman yelled as she opened the door, she looked up at Gaia and instantly froze in fear at the realization.</p><p>“A conversation about my adoptive Daughter Agatha Harkness would be nice.” Gaia said as she stood in the doorway.</p><p>“How… are you.. uh.” The woman started to say but Gaia cut her off.</p><p>“Your goddess? Yes. And I am only here because Agatha asked me to be. Now kindly step aside. You won’t like it if I have to touch you.” Gaia said to the woman who had the decency to step aside and let Gaia walk into the house. She made her way into the dining room where the 5 other women were sitting. They all stood up instantly when they realized who was in the room with them.</p><p>“What do we owe this delightful surprise?” One of the women asked in a sickly sweet tone.</p><p>“Sit down you fucking suck-ups. I’m here because Agatha asked me to be. Not because I like any of you. You have a grand opportunity to make your goddess very happy. It’s up to you if you have any sense to listen.” Gaia said to the group. Who all had the sense to sit down, even the woman who had opened the door for her took her seat.</p><p>“If any of you step out of your houses on Sunday, if any of you decide you want to bother MY Daughter ever again. I will intervene in a less than kind way. Lilia’s threats will seem like child’s play compared to what Death and I will do to your souls after you die. Do you understand?” Gaia asked the women.</p><p>All the women at the table shook their head yes. “Good, now educate yourselves on how spirit witches are created and never bother Agatha Harkness or her coven ever again.”  Gaia said as she dropped a thick stack of information on the table and left. Leaving all the woman paralyzed with fear.</p><p>~Saturday Morning~</p><p>Rio woke up Saturday morning and smiled brightly at the woman in her arms. Agatha had her head resting on her chest, soft raven curls falling over her face as she slept. Nothing could ruin this moment with her, Agatha was so peaceful in her arms and Rio didn’t want to disturb that.</p><p>“You have to work today my love.” Agatha mumbled sleepily as she nuzzled into Rio’s arms even more.</p><p>“You make that difficult.” Rio said with a smile gracing her face.</p><p>“I’ll go with you and help out.” Agatha said with a yawn.</p><p>“Or you could stay in bed and relax.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Why would I do that when I could spend my day in my favorite book store admiring the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met?” Agatha asked as she scooted up and kissed Rio on the lips.</p><p>“Ridiculous. You know that? You are absolutely ridiculous.” Rio told Agatha with an eye roll before she kissed her again.</p><p>“Yeah, and you love me anyway. Now come on. Let’s get showered and ready for the day.” Agatha said before she contradicted herself and snuggled in closer to Rio. Rio huffed and magicked her phone into her hand and checked the time. It was only 7:30 a.m. they had a little time. Then she noticed a text message.</p><p>Daniel Vidal (ICE) 10:45 p.m: Pepita tell Agatha everything was amazing! Love you both.</p><p>“Papa has something he’d like to say to you ma’am.” Rio said in a joking tone as she handed Agatha the phone. Agatha read it and smiled softly at the message.</p><p>“I’m glad he liked it. I didn’t realize it was that late. Let’s get up.” Agatha said seriously this time as she pulled away from Rio.</p><p>“Are we driving or taking the portal?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Probably taking the portal. Maybe you should establish one at the book store with the front door? And teach me how to use it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“We can work on that on Monday. I mean I can establish one today but we can work on teaching you how to use it on Monday.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Okay, sounds good. That means I have time to pay attention to you in the shower.” Agatha said with a smile as she got out of bed and magicked her night clothes off. Rio groaned as she watched Agatha’s bare ass disappear into the bathroom. She quickly threw off the blanket and ran into the bathroom.</p><p>~Across Town at Alice and Jen’s place~</p><p>“We owe Agatha the biggest apology on the planet.” Jen said as she poured herself a cup of coffee before pouring one for Alice.</p><p>“Understatement of the century. Though I also think we owe her a thank you? For reigniting our sex life.” Alice said as she walked over to Jen and took the coffee cup before kissing the sigil on her chest.</p><p>“Behave, you have to work today and I have a store to open in an hour.” Jen scolded lightly as she wove her free hand into Alice’s hair and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>“I feel like we are just starting out again. I’d call off and take you back to bed if we didn’t have tomorrow off.” Alice said between  kisses on the orange sigil on Jen’s chest.</p><p>“Sweetie, stop. I can feel how much you want me and it’s not helping.” Jen said as she massaged Alice’s scalp.</p><p>“Honestly, this little sigil right here is a blessing. Sometimes I can’t tell what you are feeling, now I don’t have to stress so much.” Alice said with a small laugh.</p><p>“I always enjoy my time with you. It’s just hard showing my emotions.” Jen clarified.</p><p>“I know. Now let me go. I gotta drink my coffee and get to work.” Alice said as she tried to untangle from Jen.</p><p>“Just a couple more minutes, let me bask in this.” Jen said as she kissed the top of Alice’s head a few times.</p><p>“I love you.” Alice said full of love and conviction before she placed another soft kiss on the orange sigil and Jen’s chest. Jen huffed and pushed Alice away softly.</p><p>“I love you too, now go to work. I can’t stand how much you are making me feel right now.” Jen said with a laugh.</p><p>“Fine! Thank you for making me coffee. Have a good day.” Alice said as she stood up on her tiptoes and gave Jen a kiss on the lips.</p><p>“You as well. Be safe. Please.” Jen requested softly before giving Alice another kiss.</p><p>“I always am.” Alice said with a smile before she grabbed her keys, badge, and coffee before heading out the door. Leaving Jen alone in their house. She took a sip of her coffee and smiled fondly and the memory of how possessive they both were last night.</p><p>“Focus Kale. You have shit you have to do today.” She said to herself before she shook her head and grabbed a yogurt out of the fridge to eat before she headed into work.<br/>She grabbed her phone off the countertop and sent Agatha a text.</p><p>Jennifer Kale 8:05 a.m: I’m sorry for touching Rio’s ring, so is Alice. Also Fuck you and thank you.</p><p>She hit send and set her phone down so she could eat her breakfast in peace.</p><p>~Wanda’s Place~</p><p>Lily woke up before Wanda and decided she wanted to spend some time this morning pampering her girlfriend after she was so well behaved the night before. Fortunately for her Wanda and her fell asleep naked from the previous nights activities. So she slid down the bed and buried her face between Wanda’s thighs.</p><p>“Lilyyyy” Wanda moaned out as she wove her fingers into soft blonde hair and looked down between her legs to see piercing green eyes looking up at her. Lily moaned softly at the taste of Wanda on her lips.</p><p>“Really, you are insatiable.” Wanda said before another moan slipped from her lips as Lily started sucking on her clit. “Fuck!”</p><p>A satisfied moan left Lily as Wanda’s fingers twitched softly against her scalp. Lily was determined and motivated to make Wanda cum, she slid her right hand under her chin and thrust two fingers into the redheaded woman below her and started curling them into her. Wanda’s moans and gasps spilled from her lips like a symphony to Lily’s ears as she continued to flick her clit with her tongue. Swirling and curling the muscle over the sensitive bud as she thrust into her.</p><p>Lily could feel Wanda’s walls starting to clench down on her fingers so she started moving her tongue faster.  Wanda closed her eyes and found the pink thread that connected Lily’s magic to hers and tugged on it hard. A loud moan erupted from Lily, as she felt her own clit throb. She slid her left hand between her legs and started rubbing her own clit. Wanda kept tugging and toying with their connection until she couldn’t focus any longer and she came hard, clenching down on Lily’s fingers.</p><p>“Fuck.” Wanda said through ragged breaths as she threw her arm over her eyes.</p><p>“Good morning.” Lily husked out with a smile as she laid her head on Wanda’s thigh.</p><p>“Good morning.” Wanda finally said a few moments later. “Come up here babe.”</p><p>“But I wasn’t done paying attention to you.” Lily said with a pout as she slid up Wanda’s body and kissed her softly on the lips. Wanda rolled her eyes at the blonde and magicked her harness on.</p><p>“Yeah well I want to give you some attention for once.” Wanda said with a smile as she rolled them both over and magicked a pillow under Lily’s hips.</p><p>“I suppose I’ve been a little too greedy lately.” Lily said with a smirk.</p><p>“I think I’m going to spend all day right here fucking you until YOU can’t think straight.” Wanda said as she magicked the bottle of lube into her hand.</p><p>“I don’t think we need that.” Lily said with a blush, which caused Wanda to raise an eyebrow at Lily and dip her fingers into the shorter woman. A soft moan left Wanda as she felt how wet Lily was.</p><p>“Fuck. Maybe not but I don’t want you uncomfortable. So I’m going to put some on the toy anyway.” Wanda said as she pulled her fingers out and opened the lube so she could put it on the toy.</p><p>“Maybe we can come together for once little miss hyper-focused.” Wanda teased her girlfriend as she slid the toy into her.</p><p>“Be nice.” Lily scolded.</p><p>“I’m the one in control right now Lily. Not you. I don’t have to be nice.” Wanda said as she slowly started rocking her hips. Lily’s wet heat felt almost overwhelming but Wanda was determined to make Lily cum, over and over again.</p><p>“Are you going to be agonizingly slow about it?” Lily teased, which lit a fire in Wanda but she kept the same slow pace.</p><p>“Yes.” Wanda said with a smirk as she leaned down and kissed along Lily’s neck and chest before settling on her collarbone and sucking on it.</p><p>“Wanda, please.” Lilly begged as she wove her fingers into Wanda’s hair. Wanda removed her mouth and whispered against her neck as she adjusted herself.</p><p>“No, have patience.” Wanda said with a grin as she slowly started moving a little faster.</p><p>“Please, I need more.” Lily whined out. Which caused Wanda to sigh and start moving faster.</p><p>“Tell me what you want. Exactly what you want.” Wanda demanded.</p><p>“You to move faster, I want you to pin me down and take what you want.” Lily begged as she pulled Wanda closer.</p><p>“And what if I want to take my time with you?” Wanda asked in a teasing tone.</p><p>“Fuck. Please just a little more. This is torture.” Lily begged, Wanda instantly changed her pace. She reached down and grabbed both of Lily’s arms and bound them to the headboard above her head and started thrusting into her quickly.</p><p>“Fuck yes!” Lily screamed as Wanda magicked the vibrator into her hand and turned it on before slipping it between them.</p><p>“I want you to cum, over and over again. I want to feel you unravel under me.” Wanda husked out as she pounded into Lily who had wrapped her legs around Wanda’s waist in an attempt to hold her closer. Whimpers and moans spilled from Lily’s lips as Wanda kissed down her neck.</p><p>“Tell me when you are close Lily.” Wanda demanded before she sunk her teeth into Lily’s neck softly biting at the tender flesh.</p><p>“Oh! Fuck! Wanda!” Lily screamed as her body shook, Wanda could feel her clench down hard on the toy as she came.</p><p>“Lily…” Wanda husked out in a threatening tone as she felt her partner cum. Wanda groaned as she pulled way from the woman and adjusted herself so that she was able to lean and look down at Lilly. Who was biting her lip trying to hide her orgasm from Wanda. “You were supposed to tell me when you were close.”</p><p>“Sorry… I didn’t have a chance.” Lily said meekly with a blush painting her cheeks again.</p><p>“Don’t be greedy dear. Listen and you’ll be rewarded. Now. Next time you are close tell me or I’ll stop.” Wanda threatened.</p><p>“You wouldn’t.” Lily said in a disbelieving tone.</p><p>“I will.” Wanda said seriously as she leaned back and started thrusting into Lily at a rapid pace. She reached down and adjusted the vibrator so that it was pressed against the toy and turned the vibrations up.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Not fair!” Lily screamed as she tried to thrash against the restraints.</p><p>“I think it’s plenty fair. Are you close babe?” Wanda teased.</p><p>“Yes!” Lily screamed as she tried to roll her hips, Wanda stopped moving and turned off the vibrator before she used her hands to hold Lily’s hips still. “No! Please! Wanda, I’m sorry!” Lily whined out.</p><p>“I want to cum with you. Are you going to actually give me what I want? Or are you going to keep being a brat?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I’ll be good. Please. I want you.” Lily begged as she clenched down hard on the toy which made Wanda moan.</p><p>“Good because I wanna cum with you. Now, hold on for me.” Wanda said as she started thrusting into Lily again. Lily started clenching down hard on the toy as she thrust into Lily.</p><p>“Baby, please. I need more.” Lily begged.</p><p>“Let me get there first and then I’ll bring us both over the edge baby. Can you do that for me?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Yes. If you let me go I can help you. I know how sensitive your nipples are. Please let me touch you.” Lily begged. Wanda lifted her restraints and Lily’s hands instantly slid up her body and tweaked her nipples. Wanda started thrusting faster into Lily. “Yes! Come on Wanda. Please baby.”</p><p>“Are you close?” Wanda asked in a shaky tone, she was close.</p><p>“Yes, please tell me I can cum.”</p><p>“Come on baby, cum with me!” Wanda begged. She felt Lily clench down hard as she came.</p><p>“Oh fuck yes!” Lily screamed as she came undone. Red and pink sparks flashed behind their eyes as they fell apart before Wanda continued to thrust into Lily. A bright red sigil flashed as it etched itself into Lily’s chest, Wanda’s pink sigil quickly followed suit.</p><p>“Oh! Wow! I wasn’t expecting that.” Wanda said as she ran her thumb up the sigil on Lilies chest.</p><p>“Fuck, that is intense. I can feel how shocked you are.”  Lily said with a huff.</p><p>“Your not?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“No, I’m still horny. I want more.” Lily said as she reached out and touched the sigil.</p><p>“Fuck, I think I can take care of that.” Wanda said in a tone full of lust as she started thrusting into Lily again.</p><p>“Oh no, I think this sigil means you are going to have just as much drive as me now.” Lily said in a concerned tone as Wanda started moving her hips faster.</p><p>“If you keep touching it I’ll never stop.” Wanda hissed out.</p><p>“What a shame.” Lily said in a cheeky tone as she pulled Wanda down for a kiss.</p><p>~Later that evening at Agatha’s place~</p><p>“Rio my love, let’s move the peace lily out of the living room so it doesn’t freak out again tomorrow when Lilia walks back through that portal door.” Agatha suggested as she cooked them dinner.</p><p>“Good idea, I’ll go put her in your office by the window.” Rio said as she got up from the island and made her way toward the living room. She bent over to pick the plant up and it complained.</p><p>“No! I like it here!”</p><p>“Your original owner is coming over again tomorrow. I was trying to be nice to you.” Rio huffed as she lifted the plant.</p><p>“Okay…. But I go back in my spot after?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll put you right back tomorrow night or Monday morning.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Okay. I don’t want to see the scary lady.” The peace lily told Rio as she carried it into Agatha’s office and set it next to the window there.</p><p>“There. You will be just fine right here. Promise. Now don’t irritate the purple one. This is her house.” Rio told the plant before she walked back out of the room and toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Is the peace lily happy?” Agatha asked with a smile.</p><p>“She likes where you put her but I explained why I was moving her and she seems fine now.”</p><p>“Good, I wouldn’t want the needy little thing thinking we were neglecting her.” Agatha said with a chuckle as she served up their salads with crispy chicken.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio said randomly.</p><p>“I love you too but why?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Because you have a sense of humor about how dramatic the plant is. I appreciate you being so understanding.” Rio told her.</p><p>“Hey, sometimes we need someone to understand that our first home wasn’t the best but that doesn’t mean our second home can’t be full of love and understanding.” Agatha said before she gave Rio a kiss and sat down next to her at the island. “Now eat your dinner my love. I want to cuddle and not think about tomorrow as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Of course my love. We can cuddle on the couch all night and just relax.” Rio reassured before she started eating her dinner.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Sunday morning brought its own set of challenges. Agatha was anxious as hell, she was nervously pacing around the living room waiting for everyone to arrive. Rio had left her alone to collect Lilia and Rita and she was chewing her nail’s down to the quick.</p><p>“Witchlett. I spoke to them. Well, threatened them really.” Gaia said softly as she pulled Agatha into her arms. The woman didn’t even realize she was being pulled into Gaia’s embrace until she was already being held.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“They were having a coven meeting and I popped in and told them if they left their houses today, they’d have to answer to me.” Gaia said as she placed a soft kiss on Agatha’s brow. “Now stop stressing. I have century’s posted ready to alert me if they step out of line. Momma is here to take care of you baby, don’t you worry about those witches.”</p><p>“I just don’t want to hurt anyone ever again.” Agatha said with tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>“You won’t. Also, you didn’t hurt them. Tell me, do you blame the fire when you get burned?” Gaia asked Agatha.</p><p>“No, I blame myself for being dumb enough to stick my hand in the flame…” Agatha answered, a sudden realization hitting her. “Oh.”</p><p>“Yeah baby, You’re the flame. Never feel bad about people dumb enough to get burned by you. Now, what are you going into the house for?” Gaia requested.</p><p>“Just going in and seeing if there’s anything Pietro might have missed when he stole my social security card and birth certificate.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I’d find all the bank information you can, and get whatever you need from your room. Then call a company to clean the house out. But get every scrap of information that has your name on it out of that house. Even if you have to summon it.” Gaia instructed.</p><p>“I think I can do that.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“You’ve got this. Also, you are allowed to destroy things. Keep that in mind, it belongs to you now.” Gaia reminded Agatha as Rita, Lilia and Rio walked through the portal door.</p><p>“Oh Hello Gaia, how are you?” Rio said as she shut the bedroom door behind her. Lilia and Rita stood in the living room absolutely gobsmacked.</p><p>“Why is our goddess hugging Agatha?” Lilia asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Because I adopted her. She’s my daughter now.” Gaia stated simply.</p><p>“Ah okay. Cool. My future daughter in law is the child of a goddess now.” Rita said as she sat down on a chair and ran her hand through her hair.</p><p>“Momma… you gave birth to the future embodiment of Death. Are you really shocked?” Rio asked softly as she walked over to her mother.</p><p>“Shocked? No. Just taking a minute to absorb this new information.” Rita said.</p><p>“Are you the reason Agatha was a blind spot?” Lilia asked in a slightly annoyed tone.</p><p>“Technically…. No. You can blame the first entity of Death for that one. She didn’t want any of her predecessors using divinations witches to find their brides before it was time to.” Gaia explained as she hugged Agatha tightly. “But I must be going. Call me if you need me sweetheart.”</p><p>“I will Momma. Thank you.” Agatha said before Gaia disappeared. A moment later the front door opened and Wanda and Lily walked in the door.</p><p>“Sorry, I know we are running behind.” Wanda said rushing into the living room before she paused and looked around. “Wait, where are Jen and Alice?”</p><p>“Not here yet.” Agatha said with a sigh as she collapsed into the couch.</p><p>“I’ll call them.” Wanda said as she pulled her phone out of her back pocket and dialed Jen. The phone rang 4 times before Jen picked up.</p><p>“For once it’s my fault we are late. I don’t want to hear it. We will be there in 5 minutes.” Jen said into the phone.</p><p>“Why is it your fault?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I’d rather not say. Just don’t ask. We will be there soon. Who’s driving?”</p><p>“I’m driving my car. You two will ride with me and Lily. Agatha will drive her car and Rio, Lilia and Rita will ride with them I assume.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Okay sounds good. Be there soon. Bye.” Jen said before hanging up. Wanda just stuck her phone back in her back pocket.</p><p>“Jen’s the reason they are late.” Wanda said in a confused tone.</p><p>“Probably not used to feeling her feelings out loud.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Is that a thing?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I don’t know you tell me Wanda, seems like you two got your sigils at some point yesterday. How does it feel to have your partner know everything you are feeling when they touch it?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“How did you… You can’t even see them! How did you know?”</p><p>“I can feel them. Well not them, but your magic is more unified now. You’re less separate than you were yesterday.”</p><p>“Wait. Wait. Wait. You can feel our magic?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Yes? You can’t tell what kind of witch someone is by looking at their magic?”</p><p>“You can look at someone’s magic?!” Rita asked.</p><p>“Again yes. You can’t?” Agatha asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“No babe. That’s not normal. I can tell if someones a witch. But even I can’t tell what kind of witch they are, I just make educated guesses.” Rio told Agatha. Every woman in the room was looking at Agatha like she’d grown a second head.</p><p>“What? I thought everyone could see magical energy coursing through someone. Lilia’s is yellow, Jen’s and Lily’s is pink, Rita and Rio’s is green, Wanda’s is Red, Alice’s is orange… you can’t see that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Wait is that why you said you knew their magic the other day when they touched my ring?” Rio asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said softly, coming to a realization.</p><p>“I wonder if it’s all spirit witches that can see that or just you.” Lilia pondered.</p><p>“Well we have their phone numbers….” Rita clarified.</p><p>“Leave them alone, we can just bother Violet. She hasn’t popped in, in a while to bother us.” Agatha started to say then time froze.</p><p>“Rude. I’m a very busy woman.” Violet said with a huff.</p><p>“I was half joking ma’am.” Agatha sassed.</p><p>“Yes spirit witches are the only ones that can do what you do. I don’t know why. I can speculate, but I don’t have an exact reason we can do it.” Violet told Rio and Agatha.</p><p>“Well. Speculate away.” Rio requested.</p><p>“Just in case we wanted to steal a powerful witches energy, we have the ability to see it and take it. Sometimes witches are undeserving of their powers. We are the judge, jury, and executioner. I know you’ve been busy Agatha but you really should read my spell book when you get the chance.” Violet clarified.</p><p>“Maybe that’s why you became a lawyer babe.” Rio joked.</p><p>“We can give it to someone more deserving as well. Magical transfer of power is a thing. It’s even possible to do without killing any of the parties involved. But that’s for a later discussion. Now stop being sassy I have body’s to collect. Love you both! Bye!” Violet said before she disappeared and time restarted.</p><p>“Yeah all spirit witches can do that.” Rio said with a shake of her head.</p><p>“That…. Is scary as fuck.” Lilia said honestly.</p><p>“Oh it gets scarier… Spirit witches can literally take peoples powers away and give them to someone else.” Rio clarified right as the front door opened.</p><p>“Sorry we are late. You can blame me. It’s been an interesting 48 hours.” Jen said looking a little frazzled and tired.</p><p>“You are forgiven. Not like I actually wanted to do this today.” Agatha said as she stood up. “Let’s get this over with. Everyone go to the bathroom if you need it’s an hour and a half drive.”</p><p>Ten minutes later they were all piled into two cars and headed to their destination. Rio kept her hand on Agatha in some way the whole ride. Be it her hand on her thigh, or holding her hand physically when she could. They pulled up to the grand house an hour and a half later and Agatha felt her stomach drop at the sight of her childhood home. Rio made Agatha take her left hand again and feel the calming aura she was trying to share.</p><p>“Thanks babe.” Agatha said with a sigh as she looked over at Rio. Lilia and Rita were already out of the car and standing next to Wanda, Lily, Jen and Alice.</p><p>“Come on. The sooner we get this done the sooner we can go home.” Rio reassured Agatha. Agatha sighed and turned off the car before she got out and found the house key. Wanda walked up next to her and placed her hand on her shoulder. Agatha swallowed audibly before she walked up to the front door and unlocked it. Rio took her hand and they stepped through the threshold together with Wanda one step behind her.</p><p>Unsurprisingly nothing happened. The house was silent. Only the hum of the refrigerator could be heard in the kitchen. Agatha felt like she was going to vomit at any moment as the rest of the women filed into the house.</p><p>“I mean… the bitch had some nice taste.” Jen said as she looked around the house.</p><p>“Appearances meant everything to her. So she had to have the nicest of things.” Agatha said as she felt bile climb up in her throat as Wanda took her other hand and started guiding them toward Evanora’s study.</p><p>“What are we looking for exactly?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Anything with my name on it. Financial information, court documentation, etc. I don’t have anything I’m attached to sentimental wise so a lot of this is going to be left here.” Agatha explained as the women walked into the study. Lilia noticed the large display case with trophy’s from Evanora’s accolades and awards for being a great illusionist.</p><p>“How about these? Do you want to take a baseball bat to them?” Lilia asked with a smile.</p><p>“Actually…. I kind of do.” Agatha said with a grin, the idea of destroying Evanora’s pride and joy instantly making Agatha feel better.</p><p>“Well girls you know what to do, help me load these into the trunk of Wanda’s car.” Lilia said as she opened the display case and started handing the trophy’s to Alice and Jen while Rita was digging through the desk looking for anything with Agatha’s name on it.</p><p>“Gladly.” Alice said while grabbing the larger trophy’s from Lilia.</p><p>“I’m gunna see if I can find a box to put the smaller ones in.” Jen said as she stepped away.</p><p>“There’s a foldable crate in the trunk. Here’s the keys.” Wanda said as she handed Jen the keys.</p><p>“Thanks.” Jen said as she left the room.</p><p>“I think using a summoning spell might be the most efficient method to finding everything with your name on it sweetie.” Rita said with a sigh as she sat down in the office chair.</p><p>“Probably. I’ll do one in a moment. Let me walk around the house and see if I can find anything else I might want to keep or deem important.” Agatha said in a strange tone that told them she didn’t want to do it at all.</p><p>“Hey, listen. I know how hard this is for you. If you want to come sit outside with me while they handle things you can.” Lily offered. Knowing the rest of their coven would undoubtably handle it.</p><p>“That’s not a bad idea actually. I can stay in here with Wanda and use our connection to communicate with you if I find anything I think might be worth bothering you over.” Rio said as she took Agatha’s hand again and brought the ring up to her lips to kiss it softly.</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asked hopefully, but she didn’t want to burden Rio or the coven.</p><p>“Yeah, I promise we’ve got this. You and Lily go get some fresh air.” Wanda reassured as well, both women looking at Agatha with nothing but love and care. Lily took Agatha’s hand and guided her back toward the front door</p><p>“Come on, you don’t need to relive this all alone. You can take it in chunks. You’ve done so well already.” Lily told her softly before they walked out the door. Agatha sat down on the steps and rubbed her eyes with one hand while Lily kept the other in her grasp.</p><p>“I can’t claim to know how you are feeling. But I do know that Wanda and Rio love you. They will handle the hard parts for you, and I’ll be right here to help. Just like the rest of the coven.” Lily reassured.</p><p>“Thanks Lily. Honestly, I’m very glad you tried hitting on Rio. Wanda deserves to be loved by someone like you.”  Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“I know you’re deflecting with humor, but same. I know I’ve been quiet the last few days but you guys have made me feel welcome and safe. I never thought I’d have a coven, let alone one as amazing as this. So thank you Agatha. You, Rio, and Wanda have all been a blessing. I was born to magic-less parents so I’ve never had a coven or a sense of community. Thank you for giving me that Agatha.” Lily told Agatha honestly as she squeezed her hand.</p><p>Jen walks back up the steps and paused in front of the two women. She looked down at them and smiled softly at them. “You okay Agatha?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m okay. Rio and Wanda kicked me out for a minute. Thank you.” Agatha told Jen with a smile.</p><p>“Okay, just know we are here for you.” Jen said as she leaned down a softly squeezed Agatha’s shoulder before walking back into the house.</p><p>‘Lilia wants permission to use your name in a spell to help us find everything we will need.’</p><p>‘Go for it.’ Agatha said in her mind then audibly sighed. She wanted this to be over with.</p><p>“Maybe that makes us kindred spirits Lily, minus the emotional trauma. Neither of us  had a community that understood us, now we have this whole group of people who care and understand. Thank you Lily, you’ve given me prospective and I really appreciate that.” Agatha said as she leaned her head on Lily’s shoulder.</p><p>“Thanks for being so welcoming. You didn’t have to be.”</p><p>“I knew Wanda was head over heels for you before the first date. All that’s ever mattered to me is that she found someone to love. She’s been my bestfriend, sister, and rock for so long that I wanted her to find someone who would love her just as deeply as she’s loved me. It’s not the same kind of love, yours will be much deeper and extraordinarily passionate. She deserves someone like you, after taking care of me for so long.” Agatha said in a watery tone that told Lily she was being extra vulnerable.</p><p>“Stop feeling like a burden. Not once has Wanda even remotely expressed that you are one to her. She loves you so much, you two have been each other’s lifelines for so long that I understand how deep the tether goes. You know the other day, after you gave us those harnesses? I made her text you, just in case you’d need her. Because I know how important it is to have someone on standby. You aren’t a burden to her, or even me. You are our friend.” Lily reassured as she squeezed Agatha’s hand and let her have a moment.</p><p>“Thank you Lily. You really are a blessing.” Agatha said with a sigh. A moment later Rio walked out the front door carrying a box.</p><p>“I think we found everything.” Rio said honestly before she looked down at the two. “But you should do a summoning spell just in case my love.”</p><p>“I can do that. Lily has made me feel a lot better about being here.” Agatha said as she let go of Lily’s hand. “Thank you Lily.”</p><p>Agatha walked back into the house and made her way into the living room and took a deep breath. She held her hands out and started the incantation. “id quod meum nomen et consilium voco. id quod meum nomen et consilium voco. id quod meum nomen et consilium voco.” Then a long moment passed and nothing happened.  Agatha sighed. Then with a flash of purple magic a singular envelope settled on the coffee table with her name on it. Agatha picked it up and looked at it incredulously.</p><p>“What is that?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I have no clue. It’s not in Evanora’s handwriting.” Agatha said as she flipped it over and opened it.</p><p>Agatha Lynn Harkness,</p><p>Did you know you were named after me? I’m sad I’ll never get to meet you. Your mother had you far too late in my life for me to be present. I wish I would’ve gotten to meet you. I wonder what you’ll look like. Grandparents always wonder what their grandchildren will look like. Honestly I’m not sure you will ever exist. I’m writing this letter to make myself feel better about my own mortality.</p><p>I’m giving it to your mother on my death bed. I told her she could read it any time she missed me. Will you have raven hair like Evanora and I or will you be something completely different? I hope my piercing blue eyes manage to make it though. They were the one thing I was happiest about giving Evanora. I’ve always prided myself in having them.</p><p>Will you be a great illusionist like your mother? Or something even more outstanding? Our family’s magic is so strong and deep rooted I have no doubt you’ll be an amazing witch. Just know, that no matter what you become I would be proud of you. Even if that meant you had no magic at all. Non magic users run in this family, I would’ve loved to have been your grandmother. I’m sorry I couldn’t hold out for you. Just know that I would’ve loved you more than anything on this planet.</p><p>Love, your grandmother Agatha Lynn Harkness.</p><p>Agatha felt tears well up and a lump form in her throat. Her mother knew she could’ve been magic-less. Her body started to shake with anger as she felt Rio place a soft hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“It’s okay, what does it say.” Rio said softly. Agatha handed Rio the letter and let her read it. Rio folded the letter up and handed it back to Agatha.</p><p>“We will talk to Violet about that later. Now…. Did she value anything other than her trophy’s? Fine China? A favorite item of hers?” Rio asked.</p><p>“She loved her wardrobe.” Agatha said with a huff.</p><p>“Good. Let’s go get some and burn them. Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Why are we burning clothing?” Jen asked in a concerned tone.</p><p>“To make Agatha feel better.”</p><p>“I hope her wardrobe is atrocious then. Or I might cry.” Jen said honestly, before she carried another box over to the front door.</p><p>“Oh yeah, it’s not your asthetic at all Jen. Don’t worry.” Agatha joked as she took Rio’s hand and made her way toward Evanora’s bedroom. Agatha walked in and looked at the room. It was immaculate and tidy, the woman never left her bed unmade. So Agatha wasn’t shocked. The last time she was allowed in this room she was 2 and honestly she felt like she could vomit. She walked over to the walk in closet and turned on the light. Proudly displayed in a case was her illusionist costume she used for competitions.</p><p>“Oh yeah, we are burning that.” Rio said with a grin as she walked over to the cabinet and  opened it. Agatha rolled her eyes softly at Rio before smiling at the woman.</p><p>“Careful she might have some protection spells on it.” Agatha said as she waved her hand and eliminated the protection spells.</p><p>“I wasn’t worried about an illusionist witch’s protection spells. The worst they would’ve done is give me frizzy hair for a week.” Rio joked as she grabbed the outfit and turned toward Agatha. “Donating the rest of this to the fire department to see how each clothing item burns?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. I need to call them still. Did Lilia find the deed?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yep. It’s in a folder in the passenger seat.” Rio answered as she walked toward Agatha and they exited the closet.</p><p>“Maybe we will go over there and talk to them in person.” Agatha suggested as they  left the bedroom.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. We can talk to the coven and see what they want to do.” Rio suggested as they made their way toward the living room where everyone was waiting.</p><p>“Got the trophy’s, and all the paperwork with your name on it packed up into my car.” Wanda said with a smile.</p><p>“You guys go on and head home. I think we are going to stop at the fire department and get that sorted out.” Agatha said with a smile. “ I appreciate you guys.”</p><p>“We can go with you if you need us to?” Alice offered knowing they’d be more inclined to listen if a police officer was with Agatha.</p><p>“Nah, I’m just going to have a conversation with them to see if it’s something they’d want. If not I’m calling a demolition team and having it tore down after having someone deal with the estate. Like selling all the items in the house or donating them.” Agatha reassured Alice.</p><p>“Alright sounds good. We will see you in a couple hours.” Wanda said as she ushered Lily, Jen and Alice out the door.</p><p>“Are you two okay with us going to the fire department?” Agatha asked Lilia and Rita.</p><p>“That’s fine. Lets go.” Lilia answered.</p><p>“I’ve got all day sweetie. No rush.” Rita agreed.  Agatha smiled and they all headed for the door. Once everyone was out of the house they locked the door and headed to the fire department.</p><p>Agatha and Rio got out of the car and headed into the fire department and asked for their chief. “Hello, my name is Agatha Harkness, and I’d like to donate a property to you once I have completed taking care of items inside.”</p><p>“Are you sure? We will most likely be destroying the home?” The chief asked.</p><p>“That would be ideal. I’d love to see it go up in flames. So once you are done training I want to be there when you burn it to the ground.” Agatha told him, he had the decency to not look shocked.</p><p>“We can do that, come back once everything is out and we will start using it for training purposes. Just give us a call or stop in once everything is taken care of. Are you sure you don’t want to sell the property instead? Make some money off it? Not that I wouldn’t complain about a chance to train my crew.”</p><p>“I never want a child raised in those walls ever again. If I knew I could get away with it I’d burn it down myself. But I know I can’t. So I’m doing the next best thing, giving it to someone who can use it to help save countless lives.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll get you my card and you can call me whenever you are ready for it to change hands.” The chief said as he pulled a card from the desk next to him and handed it over to her.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll be in contact with you over the next week or so.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you Ma’am have a lovely day.”  The man said to her before they turned around and walked out. They got in the car and Agatha sighed.</p><p>“How did it go?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Well they will take it but we gotta call a service to clean everything out first. I’ll call places through out the week and have things donated and cleared out. Once it’s taken care of we can donate the house and I can close this chapter of my life.” Agatha said as she started the car.</p><p>“Sounds wonderful. Now let’s head home. I think Wanda said something about buying baseball bats on her way back to your place.” Lilia said as Agatha pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>“Hopefully she gets more than one.” Agatha said as she started driving.</p><p>An hour and forty minutes later they pulled into Agatha’s driveway and she sighed loudly as she parked the car.</p><p>“Are you okay sweetheart?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine. I’m just glad I never have to set foot in that hell hole ever again.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Exactly, now let’s head inside. I think Wanda’s already in the back yard setting things up.” Rio said to the group.</p><p>“She texted you didn’t she?” Agatha asked before getting out of the car.</p><p>“Of course she did.” Rio answered before Agatha shut the door. The rest of the women got out of the car and headed through the house and out the back door. Wanda had pulled lawn chairs out onto the patio and had all of Evanora’s trophy’s set up with a couple baseball bats, a broom and the trashcan next to it.</p><p>“At least the chaos which had a plan to clean up as well.” Lilia said with a scoff.</p><p>“Are we having wine as well?” Jen asked the group of women.</p><p>“We can, you can’t.” Lilia said not realizing until it was too late.</p><p>“Last I checked I was an adult and could have wine whenever I wanted Lilia.” Jen snarked causing Rita to look at Lilia with an exasperated face.</p><p>“Yes, you are. But the child you are carrying cannot. Alice got you pregnant Friday night.” Lilia said with a huff as she rolled her eyes. “Not exactly the way the coven was supposed to find out. But I suppose there’s no point in lying about it.”</p><p>“I’m pregnant?! How am I pregnant? That’s not how this works!” Jen said in a confused tone.</p><p>“Did you two use magic while having sex? For example, fingering with magic on their fingertips?” Rita asked.</p><p>“That’s not how this works is it? Is it?!?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Well it’s that and the intention…. Anything sticking out in either of your minds. Maybe a few phrases that might make sense?” Lilia teased causing both women to blush.</p><p>“Exactly. Now. I know you two weren’t exactly raised and educated about these sorts of things but Intention did a lot of the heavy lifting. Someone wanted to get you pregnant, and you wanted someone to get you pregnant. The need to be possessive also didn’t help either of your cases.” Rita said honestly.</p><p>“No wine or sushi for 9 months.” Jen said sadly. Wanda and Agatha had very different reactions to this revelation. Wanda looked over at Lily with a pointed look that said ‘not yet’ and Agatha looked over at Jen with a bright smile.</p><p>“Well that’s so exciting! I’m so happy for you two! If that’s what you want. Otherwise we can head to the clinic tomorrow and get this sorted. Either way. I support you.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Agatha!” Lilia and Rita scolded.</p><p>“What? My friend comes first. I don’t want her having a child she won’t love.” Agatha told the group, the realization of Agatha’s words hitting them all. Every single one of the women in the group realized that she wished her mother had aborted her instead of keeping her. Even if none of them agreed with the idea they would have to support Jen if that’s what she wanted.</p><p>“I’m keeping my child, but thank you for being supportive Agatha. I appreciate it more than you know.” Jen told her friend as she walked over to her and then hugged her. “For the record I’m glad you exist.” Jen whispered softly just to Agatha.</p><p>“Good! I’m so excited to have a little cute witchlett running around!” Agatha said as she let Jen go, completely ignoring her friend’s comment. “Now let’s destroy some shit.”</p><p>“Sounds like a good idea!” Alice said as she handed Agatha a bat. Agatha walked over to the largest trophy and reeled back before she swung as hard as she could. The petal of the trophy dented and a loud clang rang through the air.</p><p>“Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be solid metal.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Neither did I. But that was the heaviest one.” Lilia said pointing at the trophy.</p><p>“Honestly, Wanda grab another bat and help me with this. Let’s both get some anger out.” Agatha told her best friend who giddily grabbed the second baseball bat and took all her energy and swung at the trophy. Another loud clang rang out as Wanda left a decent dent in it.  Both women started swinging together until the cup was a large dented mess on the patio.</p><p>“I feel better.” Agatha said in a winded tone before looking over at Wanda. “Do you feel better?”</p><p>“Fuck yeah I feel better! I’ve wanted to take a bat to this fucking trophy since the day she brought it home!” Wanda said with a smile and equally winded tone.</p><p>“Remind me to never piss off my girlfriend.” Lily said to Rio in a slightly scared yet impressed tone.</p><p>“Remind me to never piss off my fiancé.” Rio said back to Lily in a flat out impressed tone.</p><p>“I’ll remind you both.” Jen said honestly.</p><p>“Thanks.” Lily and Rio said in unison.</p><p>“I kinda want to use the rest of these as magical target practice.” Agatha said as she looked at Wanda.</p><p>“We can do that! That sounds fun!” Wanda said excitedly.</p><p>“Should we get some wine and watch them or…?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Or?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Leave them out here and order some pizza until they are done burning off their anger and energy?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Not a bad idea honestly.” Alice said as she watched the two women set up the trophy’s before they started blasting them with magical pure energy.</p><p>“Yeah let’s get me out of the blast zone.” Jen said as she headed toward the house.</p><p>“Great idea.” Lilia, Alice and Rita said in unison.</p><p>“You two stay here and watch your partners do whatever they are doing and make sure they don’t destroy the neighborhood.” Rita instructed. “We will go inside and order pizza.”</p><p>“Ham and pineapple for Agatha.” Rio told her mother.</p><p>“And Wanda.” Lily added.</p><p>“Those two are peas in a pod.” Lilia said as she guided the women into the house once everyone was inside and settled into the living room Rita looked over at Jen.</p><p>“Sorry my tactless best friend ruined you finding out you are pregnant.” Rita told Jen.</p><p>“I have tact, you bitch.” Lilia said with a huff.</p><p>“It’s fine. I like wine. So I’m glad she said something. I don’t want a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. So I really appreciate knowing as soon as possible. Thank you Lilia.” Jen said appreciatively.</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Lilia said in a smug tone directed at Rita.</p><p>“So… can I ask how my mother is going to react to this information?” Alice asked.</p><p>“She’s going to be ecstatic about finally getting a grandchild from you two.” Lilia answered Alice.</p><p>“Good. I was worried.” Alice said with a sigh.</p><p>“Yeah, don’t stress too much. Now let’s order food… Wait… What pizza place do they order from?” Rita said with a pause.</p><p>“I’ll order. Don’t you two live like 8 hours away?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Yeah we do. Don’t ask me why my daughter moved here. I’ll never know for the life of me! But I am so thankful she did.” Rita told the two women as Jen started ordering pizza.</p><p>“What will you two eat?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Meat lovers.” Lilia and Rita said in unison.</p><p>“You two are also peas in a pod.” Alice said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Order pepperoni for Rio and Lily. They both like that.” Lilia told Jen who gave her a thumbs up before she finished ordering their food.</p><p>“Alright I’m ordering. It should be here in the next hour or so.” Jen said. They all settled comfortably into the couch. They were all just happy to relax after the day they had.</p>

<p>Agatha and Wanda were still busy causing chaos in the backyard with Evanora’s trophy’s when the pizza arrived. Alice popped her head out the back door and yelled for them. “Hey! Food is here! Take a break ladies!”</p><p>Agatha and Wanda looked at each other and then at the mess they had created and sighed realizing they had made a big one. “Let us clean up and we will be in, in a second.” Agatha said as she started picking up the larger pieces of plastic.</p><p>“We can help with that part.” Rio said as she grabbed the broom and dustpan.</p><p>“Give me the broom Rio.” Lily said as she held her hand out. Rio handed her the broom and they started sweeping up bits and pieces of trophy. The large metal one was picked up by Agatha and tossed straight into the trashcan before Rio and Lily started dumping the debris out into the can.</p><p>Ten minutes later the mess was cleaned and  they headed inside. Rita, Lilia, Alice and Jen were chatting.</p><p>“We are not hyphenating this child’s name. Kale-Wu-Gulliver is too much.” Alice said with a laugh.</p><p>“When you say it like that Alice I’m inclined to agree.” Jen said as the other four women walked into the room.</p><p>“I think Alice should take your last name, and so should the baby Jen.” Agatha said as she sat down in the L of the couch.</p><p>“Why’s that?” Jen asked.</p><p>“Only fair that the one growing the child gives it it’s name sake.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Not a bad idea. Honestly no offense to my mother but she didn’t think about how often I’d be racially profiled for my last name anyway. Then how much I’d be harassed bc I was her daughter. So maybe when we get married I’ll just become a Kale as well.” Alice said with a smile as she looked at Jen with so much love and adoration.</p><p>“Gross, get a room.” Wanda joked as she grabbed a paper plate and started opening boxes.</p><p>“I’d tell you to eat a dick Maximoff but it seems you prefer pussy anyway.” Jen jabbed back.</p><p>“Can’t even argue with that. Because that’s always been the preference.” Wanda said before she opened the box of ham and pineapple. “Fuck yeah! Ham and pineapple!” She grabbed two slices and threw them on the plate and handed it to Agatha before grabbing a couple for herself.</p><p>“Thank you Wanda.”</p><p>“Okay how come Agatha gets served?” Lily said with a pout.</p><p>“Because she likes the same thing I do. What do you want babe?” Wanda asked as she handed Lily her plate and grabbed another.</p><p>“Pepperoni is fine.” Lily told Wanda who opened the box of pepperoni and got Lily two slices and handed her the plate.</p><p>“Rio?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I can get my own food.” Rio told Wanda. Who gave her a pointed look.</p><p>“Pepperoni.” Agatha answered, for Rio which caused her to make an indignant sound. Wanda grabbed a couple slices for her and handed the plate to Rio.</p><p>“Anyone else?” Wanda joked as she looked at the other women already eating their pizza.</p><p>“So what did you guys talk about while we destroyed shit?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Mostly how my mother’s going to react to becoming a grandma and baby stuff.” Alice told Agatha.</p><p>“Lorna is gunna be on the moon. I remember an interview she did 3 years ago about wanting to retire and how the only thing stopping her was that she wasn’t a grandma.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Wait… what?!” Alice asked.</p><p>“You don’t watch your mom’s interviews?” Lily asked. “Here one second. Let me get my phone. I think it was a late night talk show. I’m sure there’s a Reddit post or YouTube clip.” Lily said as she summoned her phone and started looking for the video.</p><p>“If I watched all of my mother’s interviews, I’d have no time for a real life.” Alice joked.</p><p>“Found it! Here!” Lily said as she turned the volume up and handed her the phone. Then she picked up her pizza and started eating.</p><p>“Tonight we have with us special guest, pop icon, witch, and everyone’s favorite diva! Lorna Wu!” The host announced.</p><p>“Thank you for having me, it’s such an honor to be here.” Lorna said politely. Alice and Jen were watching the interview but everyone else could hear it.</p><p>“So Lorna, you’ve been touring for the better part of 60 years, which seems like nothing for a witch like you, but retirement has gotta be something that’s been on your mind right?” The host asked her.</p><p>“Oh, starting with the hard questions right off the bat I see! Retirement has been a thought lately, but it’s hard to justify. I took a break when my daughter was born, you all know that. I think I’d officially retire if I were ever given a grandchild. Not that my daughter or her life partner need to have children. But it would be nice!” Lorna explained to the host.</p><p>“I don’t know how witches mature, is your daughter even old enough to have kids?” The host asked politely.</p><p>“Yes. Her and her partner are. We age normally like humans do until around 25 then our body starts slowing down. So she could realistically give me a grandchild at any point. But again no rush. She probably won’t even see this interview. She’s so busy serving and protecting the community. I really am so proud of her for picking such a noble career.” Lorna explained and Alice paused the video.</p><p>“We should just send her this with the message ‘happy retirement Grandma.’ And see what she says.” Alice joked.</p><p>“I’d rather tell her in person.” Jen said with a smile.</p><p>“I can’t believe you two haven’t seen that. Also… what kind of friends do you have that no one sent you this when it happened?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Normal ones who aren’t obsessed with my mom. Plus I don’t tell people I’m her daughter often. So unless you are stalking her or me you’d never know I’m her daughter.” Alice explained.</p><p>“Fair. Well you’ve seen it now. And I’ll keep an eye out for any more interesting interviews that may pop up just for you guys.” Lily said before she went back to eating.</p><p>“Don’t tell us, but do you know the gender Lilia?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“No, only because I haven’t touched Jen yet. If they want to know I can tell them but I’d have to touch one of them. I just know she’s pregnant.”</p><p>“Okay, now I gotta ask. Why were you late this morning?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Ask after Rita and Lilia leave.” Jen said with a blush.</p><p>“We are all adults here, you can say it. I know what my hormones did to me when I was pregnant with Rio.” Rita said with a smile.</p><p>“Fine, I’m sorry Agatha but this is technically your fault. Alice can tell when I’m horny now and took care of me before we left the house this morning.” Jen answered with a huff.</p><p>“Thank you Agatha.” Alice said with a bright smile, causing Jen to sink deeper into her seat in embarrassment. Which caused Agatha to laugh at Jen.</p><p>“I hate you both.” Jen said in an annoyed tone.</p><p>“I love you too.” Agatha said after she finished laughing.</p><p>“Are we burning that bitches outfit tonight?” Lilia asked changing the subject.</p><p>“Yeah at some point, got a hot date Lilia?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No, I was just curious, and I was trying to save Jen.” Lilia said with a laugh.</p><p>“I appreciate it. How about we get you ladies some wine, and me a water and head back outside after eating and we can burn her outfit.” Jen offered.</p><p>“Sounds fantastic. I’ll get you some non alcoholic wine for the next coven meeting Jen.” Wanda said with a smile before the women settled into a comfortable silence to finish eating their pizza.</p><p>Twenty minutes later the women were all sitting around the fire pit with their wine and water. Agatha poured some lighter fluid onto the costume and lit a match before dropping it onto the costume. It went up in flames with a loud ‘whoosh’. Agatha then went over and settled on the ground next to Rio’s chair.</p><p>“You can sit in my lap babe.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I don’t think the chair can hold both our weights. I’m fine right here.” Agatha said as she leaned against Rio’s knee as she watched the outfit burn.</p><p>“How are you feeling after today?” Rio asked softly as she ran her fingers through Agatha’s long hair.</p><p>“Loved.” Agatha answered as she closed her eyes and hummed softly.</p><p>“Gross, you two are adorable.” Jen said with a sneer and a smile.</p><p>“Not justifying that with a response Jen.” Agatha said with a sigh as she just enjoyed this moment of comfort with her partner.</p><p>“Once that’s done burning Rita and I should be headed home. I have a meeting with the CDC in the morning I cannot miss.” Lilia said in a slightly irritated tone.</p><p>“I’ll take you home. Let’s go.” Rita said with a sigh as she stood up.</p><p>“Fine! Thank you for the lovely company ladies. Sorry for ruining the surprise Jen and Alice. Congratulations on the little bundle of joy.” Lilia said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you for telling us, honestly it’s much appreciated. Oh, also you are invited to the baby shower when we get that far.” Jen said to the woman.</p><p>“Have a great night.” Agatha said good bye to the women.</p><p>“You think you are getting away with not giving me a hug?” Rita scolded as she stood in front of Agatha who just smiled and stood up.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll ever get away with that Rita. Thank you for being here today I appreciate you.” Agatha said as she hugged the woman.</p><p>“Thank you for existing. You are one of my greatest blessings.” Rita said honestly before she pulled back and gave Agatha a kiss on the cheek. “Now, keep her out of trouble and I’ll see you two next week for dinner.”</p><p>“She’s been the one keeping me out of trouble. Without Rio and you guys I would’ve done some dumb things today. Especially if it had just been Wanda and I.”  Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“You’re smarter than that witchlett. Goodnight.” Lilia said honesty as Rita let Agatha go and Lilia moved in to give her a hug.</p><p>“You too Lilia?” Agatha asked as she hugged her.</p><p>“Of course! You deserve all the love. Now have a goodnight.” Lilia said as she squeezed Agatha tight before letting her go.  Rita and Lilia made their way back into the house and to the portal.</p><p>“I cannot believe you got me pregnant!” Jen scolded Alice once the women disappeared into the house.</p><p>“Not like you were fucking complaining!” Alice sassed back.</p><p>“There it is!” Wanda said with an excited tone. “So tell me, how does one conceive magically?”</p><p>“Wanda, I don’t know if I want to know right now.” Agatha told her friend.</p><p>“Yeah, don’t give me any ideas babe.” Lily said with a smirk causing Wanda to look at Lily with a panicked face.</p><p>“Nevermind. I’m good, don’t tell us.” Wanda said back tracking, she wasn’t exactly ready for kids.</p><p>“It’s official I love you Lily.” Jen said as she took a drink of her water.</p><p>“I don’t like being ganged up on.” Wanda said sadly, still feeling a little dread.</p><p>“You will live.” Rio promised as Agatha dragged a chair over to Rio and sat down next to her.</p><p>“Wait until it’s your turn Vidal!” Wanda said with a glare.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m safe. I’m well behaved compared to you. But I think I know how they managed to do it.” Rio told the group.</p><p>“Lilia said it was about intention, that’s all I’m going to say.” Jen told the group.</p><p>“Y’all are into some kinky shit aren’t you?” Wanda teased, the chaos witch in her unable to help herself.</p><p>“What? No! Not like that. It was more like ‘I wish I could get you pregnant.’ And ‘well we could always give it the old college try.’  As a joke.” Alice said with a huff.</p><p>“Oh… so this really was but wasn’t intentional.” Lily said with an amused tone.</p><p>“Yeah. Like one of those lesbian jokes. ‘It wasn’t for my lack of trying!’ Because I’m always trying.” Alice explained causing Jen to blush and hide behind her hands.</p><p>“Please stop. I don’t want these women knowing how our child was conceived. They will never let it die.” Jen mumbled into her hands.</p><p>“We literally will never give you shit about it after the child gets here. Promise.” Wanda said honestly.</p><p>“Or until one of us gets pregnant.” Lily said with a smirk.</p><p>“Please, I know you are mostly joking babe. But I am not ready for kids right now. I want to enjoy my time with you for a little while. Maybe a year after we get married?” Wanda offered trying to placate Lily.</p><p>“I just have to put you in your place, I promise I won’t get you pregnant. Yet. But Alice I do want your phone number before you leave.” Lily requested.</p><p>“I think I can do that.” Alice said with a wink.</p><p>“You two have been awfully quiet.” Jen said pointing at Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“I’m just enjoying the commentary.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“And I personally am just trying to figure out how long I need to wait before she doesn’t kill me if I get her pregnant.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“I’d like to be married first.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“I think I can handle that my love.” Rio said softly before she turned and gave Agatha a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>“Thank you, I want kids. I really do. But I also want to enjoy our time together and establish a life together before we take that step. Plus I don’t want to be building a house while pregnant. Sounds like a bad idea.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Sounds perfect. Also do we want to throw a couple logs in the fire pit and have a little bon fire or do we want to go back into the house?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I think it’s time we head home. Alice has to work tomorrow. The shop needs opened tomorrow, and I am kind of emotionally exhausted.” Jen told them honestly.</p><p>“That’s fair. I get it. Thank you for coming with us today.” Agatha said as she stood up and magically snuffed the fire. Alice stood up and helped Jen stand before she started heading toward the house. Wanda and Lily followed suit and they all made their way inside.</p><p>“Take your pizza with you please.” Agatha requested. Alice walked over and picked up the veggie pizza before heading toward the door.</p><p>“Have a goodnight, see you soon. Don’t be a stranger.” Alice said as she hugged Agatha.</p><p>“Thanks for ordering food while I got my anger out.” Agatha said as she let Alice go and then gave Jen a hug. “Go rest you deserve it.”</p><p>“I think we will head home as well. Give you two time to decompress.” Wanda said as she and Lily headed out the door.</p><p>“Thanks I appreciate it.” Agatha said before she shut the door and sighed loudly. Rio was in the living room collecting things and condensing the pizza into one box so she could put it in the fridge. Agatha met her in the hallway and gave her a kiss on the lips before she made her way into the kitchen.</p><p>“I think I need a stronger drink than wine.” Agatha said with a sigh as she followed Rio into the kitchen.</p><p>“Do you have something stronger than wine?” Rio asked as she put the pizza in the fridge.</p><p>“Yeah. Vodka.” Agatha said as she opened the freezer and pulled out the bottle of top shelf vodka and then opened the bottle and set it on the countertop before grabbing orange juice and grenadine out of the fridge.  She then magicked a large glass onto the countertop and made herself a strong drink.</p><p>“Do you want one?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nah. I’m okay I’ll stick to wine.” Rio said with a soft smile as she waited for Agatha to finish making her drink. “Let’s head into the living room and cuddle.” Rio suggested as Agatha put everything away and grabbed her glass.</p><p>“Great idea. Because tomorrow is going to be a day of phone calls I can just feel it.” Agatha said as they made their way to the couch. As soon as they sat down Violet popped into the room.</p><p>“Finally! I thought they’d never leave!” Violet said as she plopped down on the couch.</p><p>“Really? And why are you here?” Agatha asked before she took a long drink of her cocktail.</p><p>“Well… Gaia informed me you found Agatha’s letter to you.” Violet answered.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said flatly. She was running out of emotions.</p><p>“Would you like to meet her?” Violet asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure how to answer that question right now.” Agatha told Violet.</p><p>“That is completely fair. But she would like to meet you, whenever you are ready.” Violet told Agatha.</p><p>“How would that even work?” Agatha asked. Trying to understand how she would meet someone that died long before she was ever born.</p><p>“Well you have proven yourself powerful enough to handle visiting my domain. I’d invite you and her for tea. Rio as well. It’s really not that complicated. Plus you’d get to meet Rosaline.”</p><p>“Do the rules even apply to us anymore?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Have they ever?” Violet asked.</p><p>“I used to think they did.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“You are a spirit witch. They never really applied to you. You are next in line as Death, I can make whatever rules I want for you. Now that Agatha is here at least.” Violet said. Agatha sighed and tapped her necklace three times.</p><p>“Yes witchlett?” Gaia said as she popped into the living room.</p><p>“Is Violet fucking with us?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No? Not that I’m aware of, but I guess I need some clarification.”</p><p>“Can I really meet my grandmother?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes. You can. If that’s what you want. We can’t bring her here, but we can bring you to her if you’d like.” Gaia explained to Agatha as she sat down on the couch next to the young woman.</p><p>“Does she want to see me? Does she want to meet me?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“More than anything Witchlett. She would love to meet you. She’s nothing like your horrible birth giver I promise.”</p><p>“Okay. Today has been a long day. Maybe tomorrow.” Agatha said as she leaned back into the couch and took another sip of her drink.</p><p>“That’s fine, we can get it sorted out tomorrow.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“Yes, absolutely no rush. She’s waited this long. She can wait a little longer.” Violet reassured.</p><p>“Okay. Let me think about it. I still have to deal with Evanora’s estate, and all that mess.” Agatha said with a huff as she took another sip.</p><p>“I’ll be here to help you babe.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Yeah but you have an interview on Tuesday and will hopefully hire her.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Lilia said she’s the one for the job but she’s young and I want her to feel like she’s earned it.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Rowen will show up later this week as well.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Thank you! I am hoping we can get them set up in the next few weeks so I can take Saturdays off with Agatha.” Rio said appreciatively.</p><p>“Everything should settle down soon. Until Jen and Alice have their child at least. Then things might get a little chaotic again but not in a bad way.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“You need a coven to raise a child so I get it.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Can you bless me with the ability to not get pregnant until after Rio and I get married?” Agatha asked Gaia.</p><p>“If that’s what you want.” Gaia offered.</p><p>“Maybe we should ask for the blessing for Wanda also.” Rio suggested.</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” Agatha asked with a chuckle.</p><p>“If you don’t you’ll be an auntie sooner than you want to be.” Gaia.</p><p>“Please bless Wanda as well. I’m not in the mood for all that. A pregnant Wanda sounds unfun.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“Then it shall be. Now, Violet, why don’t you come back over tomorrow around 2:30?” Gaia requested.</p><p>“I can do that, I can feel the body’s piling up again. You know how it is. Nobody waits for death, death waits for you. Alright ladies, have a good night. Love you!” Violet said before disappearing again.</p><p>“Has she always been like that?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Gaia said flatly.</p><p>“Alright do you need anything else Witchlett? You and Wanda have been blessed, so you don’t have to worry about children for a minute. If you change your mind you know how to get ahold of me.” Gaia told the two women. “Now I’m going to go home, you two try to relax. I love you both. Have a great night girls.”</p><p>“Should we text Wanda and let her know?” Rio asked.</p><p>“You can if you want. I just want to get drunk and cuddle with you.” Agatha said honestly as she scooted closer to Rio and threw her legs over Rio’s lap.</p><p>“Sounds like a perfect way to end the night. But first, check in? How are you doing my love?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Fine. It’s finally setting in that she’s dead. That I never have to deal with this ever again if I don’t want to. I could just let that house rot. But I want it to be useful.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“That’s admirable my love, but I want you to take care of your mental health as well. So maybe we hire a company to handle the rest?”</p><p>“Yeah I’ll be doing that in the morning, definitely making a few phone calls first thing. Maybe I’ll text Pepper and ask her for help.” Agatha said as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>Agatha 6:45 p.m: what company do you recommend to clear out Evanora’s house?</p><p>Pepper 6:45 p.m: Depends on if you want things donated or destroyed.</p><p>Agatha 6:46 p.m: Donated.</p><p>Pepper 6:46 p.m: Hire a moving company and have them take it all to Habitat for Humanity.</p><p>Agatha 6:47 p.m: Thank you. Can I borrow a  drone so I can have the key dropped off to the movers tomorrow?</p><p>Pepper 6:48 p.m: Tony is already contacting places for you, a drone will be there to scan the key in 5 minutes and we will make a copy here. Don’t worry about it. The house will be cleared out tonight.</p><p>Agatha sighed and decided to call Pepper. The phone rang once. “You really don’t have to do this.”</p><p>“Oh we insist!” Tony yelled from the background.</p><p>“See, I didn’t do it this time.” Pepper reassured.</p><p>“Fine. Honestly I don’t want to go back to that place until it’s time to burn it down.” Agatha said honestly</p><p>“Good the drone is at the front door.” Pepper said with a smile. Agatha sighed and got up and grabbed the key and walked to the front door to see an iron man suit standing on her front porch. She held the key out and it took it and scanned it before handing it back to her and flying off.</p><p>“Anything else?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah, how did it go?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Went in, got all the documentation with my name on it, took her trophy’s from the house and her fucking show outfit and destroyed them. Then went and talked to the fire department. They will take the house once it’s empty.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Perfect! The movers will be there in the next hour to start clearing things out, then they will drop everything off at habitat for humanity first thing in the morning.” Tony explained into the phone.</p><p>“You know I could’ve done this…” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Yeah but just because you could’ve doesn’t mean you have to! Let us help!” Tony said with an excited tone.</p><p>“Thank you. I appreciate you two so much.” Agatha said into the phone as she walked back over to the couch and settled against Rio’s side.</p><p>“Besides, I want you to go do something for you instead of stressing about this. Relax this week Agatha. It’s handled.” Pepper said into the phone.</p><p>“You two are ridiculous but I feel very loved and cared for.” Agatha told Pepper and Tony.</p><p>“Good! Because you are!” Tony told her.</p><p>“Yeah, what my husband said. Now go relax! I’ll call you if there’s any problems.” Pepper told Agatha.</p><p>“Yes boss lady, thank you.” Agatha joked. “Goodnight, I’ll call you two later this week.” Agatha told them.</p><p>“Goodnight Agatha.” Pepper and Tony said in unison before hanging up.</p><p>“You are so loved.” Rio said softly before she took Agatha’s phone out of her hand and took her face into her hands. She then brought her lips to Agatha’s and kissed her softly.</p><p>“I know. I never thought I’d be this loved but I don’t know what I would be doing right now if I wasn’t.” Agatha told Rio after the kiss.</p><p>“I guess it’s a good thing you’ll never have to find out.” Rio said before she kissed her again. Everything was going to be just fine, Agatha knew it and she was so happy with how her life was going. She just had to work on the next step which was buying that land and building a home for her and Rio.</p><p>“I’m buying that property tomorrow.” Agatha said with a smile before she rubbed her nose along Rio’s.</p><p>“If that’s what you want my love.” Rio said with a soft smile.</p>

<p>Rio and Agatha spent all morning together in bed on Monday. They were content to just comfortably drift in and out of sleep until it was well past noon when Agatha finally stirred from her slumber. Rio was still sleeping peacefully next to her. Agatha kissed her cheek softly before placing a gentle hand on her face as well.</p><p>“Rio, my love. Violet will be here soon to harass us.” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Nooo.” Rio whined as she wrapped her arms around Agatha and snuggled closer to her.</p><p>“My love. If you don’t get up soon there won’t be time for food before we travel.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“I’d rather have you for breakfast anyway.” Rio said in an aroused tone.</p><p>“We have even less time for that darling.” Agatha said with a laugh.</p><p>“Unfair.” Rio grumbled out.</p><p>“After Violet shows up we can do whatever you want.” Agatha suggests.</p><p>“After we meet your grandmother.” Rio clarified before yawning.</p><p>“If she wants to meet me today.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“She’s waited forever. She wants to meet you. Do you want to shower?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Yeah, I do. Let’s go take one together. I think we have time for that at least.” Agatha said before she magicked her phone into her hand. It was past 1 p.m.</p><p>“What time is it?” Rio asked as Agatha tried to untangle herself from Rio.</p><p>“It’s half past one. Come on, let’s get up.” Agatha said as she finally managed to wiggle out of Rio’s grasp and head toward the bathroom. She magicked her pajama’s off before she made it through the doorway giving Rio a view of her figure on the way. Agatha could hear the exasperated groan come from Rio as she leaned over to turn on the shower.</p><p>“Come on Rio, we don’t have all day oh!” Agatha said before she was startled by Rio pressing her body into hers.</p><p>“Teleportation magic is much easier when you are motivated.” Rio whispered as she palmed Agatha’s ass. Agatha groaned as she started the shower and let it run before stepping into it.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha softly scolded, they didn’t have time for this.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio husked out full of desire and want as she watched Agatha step under the shower stream.</p><p>“If you are good, I’ll actually let you use the strap first tonight.” Agatha said as she wet her hair.</p><p>“And if I’m bad?” Rio asked stepping closer and palming Agatha’s breast softly, a barely audible moan leaving Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll tie you up and pin you to the bed and torture you. I’ll deny orgasms. I’ll kiss and touch you everywhere but where you want me.” Agatha explained in a tone that told Rio she wasn’t kidding. Rio stepped forward and gave Agatha a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“I’ll behave.” Rio lamented before stepping away.</p><p>Thirty minutes later both women were out of the shower and drying off. “You didn’t mean that did you?” Rio asked Agatha as she admired her body. Still damp from the shower. She could see beads of water in her hair that softly dripped onto her skin.</p><p>“Oh, I meant it my love. Don’t test me.” Agatha told Rio who had the sense to listen to Agatha. She sighed and walked into the closet to find an outfit for the day. She grabbed a pair of black jeans and a soft forest green t-shirt. She quickly threw a bra and under wear on before getting dressed the rest of the way. Agatha was already dressed when she walked back out of the closet.</p><p>“What would you like for breakfast my love?” Agatha asked as she magicked her phone into her hand and looked at the time before she sighed softly. “It’s almost two.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Let’s just have cold pizza?” Rio asked. She wasn’t sure Agatha would agree to that but it was better than nothing at this point.</p><p>“Better than cereal I suppose.” Agatha mentioned before they made their way to the kitchen.</p><p>“Should we just call her early and get this over with?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Might as well.” Agatha mentioned as she pulled the pizza box out of the fridge and handed Rio a slice of pepperoni while she grabbed a slice of ham and pineapple pizza. Rio magicked her phone into her hand and found Death’s contact. There was a long pause and then they felt something shift in the room.</p><p>“Good morning sleepy heads.” Violet said with a smile as she propped herself up on the countertop.</p><p>“Good afternoon Violet.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Hi grandma.” Rio said in a slightly disgruntled tone.</p><p>“Oh, don’t be like that Rio. You cause your own misery. You knew I was going to be popping in today. Don’t take your frustrations out on an old lady like me.” Violet told Rio.</p><p>“So how does this work?” Agatha asked Violet before taking a bite of her cold pizza.</p><p>“I spoke to Aggie, She’s at the cabin with Rosaline right now if you want to meet her. She is over the moon about you already. I just have to take your hands and we will go. But I really do recommend not moving much. It can be a little nauseating the first time. Which is why Rosaline has made some spearmint tea for you both. Just in case.” Violet explained to the two women. Rio stopped eating her pizza and set it back in the box before standing up.</p><p>“No point in eating if I’m going to want to throw it up.” Rio said honestly as she walked over to Violet. Agatha then set her pizza in the box and put it back in the fridge before she walked over to Violet and Rio.</p><p>“Fuck it. Let’s just go.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s hand. Violet put one hand on each woman’s shoulder and smiled at them.</p><p>“Hold on ladies. Try to not move much, and relax. The least resistance the better.” Violet said before she transported all three of them to her domain. Agatha and Rio felt the shift but the nausea didn’t come. Rio instantly felt an inner peace she had never experienced in her life, like she was finally where she was meant to be. Agatha could feel how calm Rio was, she looked over at Rio and smiled as a giggle bubbled up in her throat.</p><p>“Do you feel that?” Agatha asked with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“Of course I do.” Rio said with a bright smile on her face, this place felt like their bond.</p><p>“Are you two okay?” Violet asked.</p><p>“We are great. Though you could’ve told us it would feel like our connection when we got here. It feels like we settled inside of our bond.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Huh…. Never thought of it that way before.” Violet pondered before she turned around and they finally took in their surroundings. They were standing in a forest that reminded them of the forest the Cabin was in. A soft mist hung in the air that got heavier the farther out you looked; the distance seemed almost pure white. There was a cozy looking cabin settled amongst the trees, that Violet was walking toward. Agatha and Rio started walking toward the cabin, following Violet.</p><p>Once they were inside they could hear two women speaking softly but couldn’t make out what was being said. “Darling I’m home. I brought the girls.” Violet said into the cabin.</p><p>“We are in the dining room!” Rosaline yelled into the house. Agatha felt anxiety bubble up but it was quickly tamped down by Rio bringing her hand up to kiss the back of it softly.  They followed Violet into the room and she stepped aside to give her wife a hug and a kiss which both women thought was endearing and sweet. Sitting at the table looking nothing like either women expected was a raven haired women with piercing blue eyes. Agatha half expected her grandmother to look exactly like her mother but instead was greeted with someone much softer.</p><p>“Hello Agatha, I’m your grandmother. It’s nice to finally meet you.” The woman said as she stood up. She looked young and happy, nothing like what Agatha was expecting.</p><p>“Before you ask, In death you get the body you were healthiest in.” Violet explained.</p><p>“Thank you. I was confused.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“I’ve been informed that my daughter was a wretched mother. I am sorry witchlett. If I had been around she wouldn’t have gotten away with any of that.” Aggie explained.</p><p>“At least I’m stronger for it. It sucked. I hated every moment of it. But it lead me to Rio, Wanda, My Coven, and being adopted by our Goddess Gaia.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Come sit, come sit. No need to have this conversation standing.” Rosaline said with a bright smile, as she guided them over to the table.</p><p>“I’ll be back in a bit to take you girls home. Have a wonderful time.” Violet said before disappearing again.</p><p>“Do you ever get a full hour with her?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Several most of the time. But people like dying.” Rosaline said with a shrug.</p><p>“So, tell grandma everything! You’re a spirit witch and a magnificent one at that from what I can see. But tell me about you sweetie!” Aggie requested.</p><p>“I graduated high school early, went to college and passed the bar at 24, started working hard and now I’m a partner at Stark Law Firm. I met Rio at her bookstore a few weeks ago and my life has been an absolute whirlwind ever since. I think it’s finally starting to calm down though.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I knew you’d be intelligent! Passed the bar at 24! Magnificent! You are such a brilliant young woman. Most importantly you got my stunning blue eyes. I was hoping that wouldn’t get muddled along the line. Evanora’s never quite looked as bright. But yours shine brighter than the sky on a summer day!” Aggie complimented Agatha causing the woman to smile and look away, she was embarrassed by the genuine praise.</p><p>“I think they remind me of a peaceful spring fed lake that’s crystal clear but I’ve spent more time in forests than I should.” Rio told Aggie.</p><p>“I could see that. All I care about is how soft they are when the look at you Rio. That’s a look every grandparent wants to see on their grandchild’s face. One of pure adoration.” Aggie said with a smile.</p><p>“Stop I will actually cry.” Agatha told them as she felt tears well up in her eyes.</p><p>“No need for tear’s witchlett! It’s okay. I’m just happy you are happy.” Aggie told Agatha with a soft smile. “Now tell me all about you. Your favorite color, what you like doing in your free time, what is your best friend like because I’ve heard she’s a chaos witch. Everything you can.”</p><p>“My favorite color is purple, I love reading and cooking in my free time, and my best friend is a chaos witch. Her name is Wanda and she was until recently the best thing that had ever happened to me. That new honor goes to Rio. Because ever since she came into my life it’s been nothing but blessings.”</p><p>“I want to know how a chaos witch and a spirit witch become best friends.” Rosaline said with a smile.</p><p>“You scrape your knee in the middle of the school yard and she uses her magic to fix your boo-boo after her brother picks you up off the ground with his super speed. Then they convince you to come hang out at their house with their parents and you find out what love actually is at the age of 6.” Agatha explains. “She’s been my best friend ever since. Her and Pietro have been the best siblings a woman could ask for over the years. Their parents were also a blessing until we lost them.”</p><p>“Violet still feels bad about having to take them. She argued with Gaia on that one, but it was past their time. I’m sorry you three had to go through that.” Rosaline explained.</p><p>“Does she argue with my mother often?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, not at all. But she felt like leaving you three alone at the ages of seventeen and eighteen was utterly unfair.”</p><p>“It wasn’t exactly fair. But we managed. Life had never been fair for me though. I will tell Wanda that Death tried to fight Gaia for them though. She will appreciate it.” Agatha told Rosaline.</p><p>“I really didn’t want to take them. Even before I knew you were Rio’s bride. It hurt so much to see you three so broken. It’s the one thing I hate about this job.” Violet said popping back into the kitchen.</p><p>“It was a bad night. I don’t want to think about right now. It still hurts a little.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Understandable. Now. I hate to be this person but I have to take you girls back home. Sorry Aggie. But I will definitely be giving you life updates whenever possible.” Violet told Agatha’s grandmother.</p><p>“Thats fine. Thank you for letting me meet her. It’s one of the greatest gifts I’ve ever received. Now I’m going to hug my granddaughter.” Aggie said as she stood up. Agatha stood up and walked over to the woman. Who pulled her into a tight embrace and held her for a long moment. “You are even more amazing than I could’ve ever imagined. I am so proud of you witchlett. Now go live your life and have a good time. I love you and I’ll see you here at the end.”</p><p>“I’m glad I finally got to meet someone in my family that would’ve actually loved me. Thank you.” Agatha said as she let the woman go. Rio walked over to Agatha and took her hand before Violet placed her hands on the girls shoulders and took them home.</p><p>“Wait! I didn’t get to say goodbye to Rosaline.” Rio said sadly.</p><p>“She knows you had to leave. If I had kept you any longer you two might have been stuck. I was really pushing it.” Violet said honestly.</p><p>“Gaia wouldn’t have let that happen.” Agatha said with a scoff.</p><p>“Probably not, but I don’t want to test her patience.” Violet said honestly. “Now, have a good rest of your day. I’ve got more bodies to collect.”</p><p>“You as well.” Agatha and Rio said in unison before Violet disappeared.</p><p>“I’m going to call the realtor and purchase that property. Then I’m going to call Tony and Pepper and ask them who they used to build their cabin.” Agatha said as she let Rio’s hand go and headed toward her office.</p><p>“Sounds good. Do you want company? I can grab a book and hang out on the couch in there.” Rio offered.</p><p>“Sounds wonderful, want to grab the pizza and a couple sodas for us as well? I also have to call the financial advisor.” Agatha said as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>“Of course, I’ll be right with you once I get everything.” Rio said with a smile before she gave Agatha a soft kiss on the cheek.  Agatha went into her office and called the financial advisor first, the phone rang once before someone picked up.</p><p>“Thank you for Calling Wicca and Co Financial advisors, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?” A woman asked.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.” Agatha answered into the phone.</p><p>“One moment Ms. Harkness, let me transfer you to your advisor.” The woman said politely before the phone rang once and she was transferred over to another line.</p><p>“Agatha, wonderful to hear from you. I have almost got everything transferred over to your name. The Bank has been calling us all week, those life insurance policy’s have made you an even richer woman. How can I help you today?” The man asked.</p><p>“I’m buying a small piece of property, about twenty acres near me. I want to build a house. So don’t be alarmed by large purchases in the next few months. I was just calling to let you know that money was going to be moving.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Thank you for the warning. Do you plan to stay on with us as your financial advisors or are you thinking about finding someone new to handle your assets?” The man asked.</p><p>“That I haven’t decided on yet. I have to speak to a friend about who they use, and I may possibly be using their team depending on if they are a good fit.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Understandable, but we will try our best to keep you happy while you are with us. Thank you for the call and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.” The man said into the phone.</p><p>“Thank you, you as well.” Agatha said with a smile before she hung up.</p><p>“Now the realtor.” Agatha said with a sigh as Rio walked into the room carrying two sodas and the box of pizza with a book on top. She walked over to Agatha’s desk and set the soda and pizza on the corner of the desk before she took a slice for herself and went over to the couch with her book. She sat down and waited while Agatha made her next phone call. The phone rang a couple times before someone picked up.</p><p>“Hello, this is David with Home Again Realty. How may I assist you today?” The man said into the phone.</p><p>“Hello David, my name is Agatha Harkness and I wanted to purchase the twenty acre lot you have up for sale.” Agatha told the man.</p><p>“Wonderful, have you spoken to your bank about a loan?” The man asked.</p><p>“Oh, I’m paying cash.” Agatha told the man.</p><p>“Oh. I will let the land owners know they have a cash offer on the table. Can I give you a call back in an hour?” The man asked.</p><p>“Of course. Thank you for your time.” Agatha told the man before he hung up.</p><p>“That was much easier than I expected.” Rio said honestly as she finished her slice of pizza and opened the bottle of soda.</p><p>“Money talks babe.” Agatha said with a chuckle. “Now I gotta call Pepper.” Agatha said with a sigh as she looked at the time. It was almost 5. She opted to call her cellphone, it rang a couple times before Pepper picked up.</p><p>“Hey, I was going to call you the second I got in the car. What’s up?” Pepper asked, it sounded like she was packing up for the day.</p><p>“I need to know who built the cabin for you and Tony and how long it took.” Agatha told Pepper.</p><p>“I’ll send you their information once I get in the car. Decided you are going to build a house?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yep, probably going to the bank and buying the property tomorrow. Then I want to talk to a contractor and designer and get the ball rolling on the house this week.” Agatha explained to Pepper.</p><p>“There’s the woman I know. Glad she’s back.” Pepper said into the phone, Agatha could hear the smile in Pepper’s words.</p><p>“What exactly does that mean?” Agatha said with a laugh.</p><p>“The go getter that wants things done quickly and efficiently. Plan then execute the plan. That’s the Agatha Harkness I know.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“Thanks Pepper. How’s everything going with the thing I don’t want to deal with?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Taken care of, the house is empty. Habitat for Humanity took everything but the clothing. So that got incinerated. But other than that, everything is taken care of. All you have to do is cancel the insurance on the home and give the fire department the title and keys.” Pepper explained.</p><p>“I’ll make that trip next Sunday.” Agatha explained to Pepper.</p><p>“Rio still hasn’t found staff?” Pepper asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“She’s got an interview tomorrow. I’ll work the counter while she interviews the young woman but other than that no, not yet. Though Lilia said she would be a perfect fit so I have a feeling she will be fine but she’s going to be training for the next couple weeks.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Ah I see. Makes sense. Okay. Well if you want I can go with you on Saturday instead.”  Pepper offered.</p><p>“I’ll consider it. But won’t Tony be upset I’m taking time away from him?”</p><p>“He may want to come.” Pepper offered.</p><p>“Ew, 3 hours in a car with you and your husband. I’m good.” Agatha said sarcastically.</p><p>“Yeah…. Now that I’ve heard it out loud. I get it.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“It can wait. Unless I feel like doing it sooner.”</p><p>“We could have a carrier deliver the deed and everything after you get it signed off.” Pepper suggested. “Sending you the company we used now.”</p><p>“Thanks I appreciate it, I’m going to call them once I’m done purchasing the property. I appreciate it Pepper have a good night.”</p><p>“You as well Agatha.” Pepper told her before she hung up the phone.</p><p>“Now we just have to wait for the realtor to call me back.” Agatha said as she picked up her slice of pizza she was eating earlier and opened her soda. She started eating before Rio looked up at her.</p><p>“You are quite productive my love.” Rio praised.</p><p>“When I want to be.” Agatha said with a smile while she ate. Rio was still reading her book but paying attention to Agatha.  Agatha took a moment and really looked at Rio, who looked so very comfortable on her office couch as she read her book.</p><p>“You are the most beautiful woman I have ever met.” Agatha complimented as she finished eating and took a drink of her soda.</p><p>“Could still argue that, that title goes to you my love.” Rio said honestly as she flipped a page. Before Agatha got the chance to say another word her phone rang again. She picked it up and answered</p><p>“Hello. Agatha Harkness Speaking.”</p><p>“The owners would like to meet at the bank tomorrow to close the deal if you don’t mind?” The realtor told Agatha.</p><p>“Tell me what bank and what time and I’ll be there with a cashiers check or if we used the same bank we can get it sorted there.”</p><p>“American Union Bank Westview branch.”  The realtor answered.</p><p>“Perfect and a time?” Agatha requested</p><p>“How does 11 a.m. sound?” The man asked.</p><p>“Perfect. I’ll meet you there. Thank you.”</p><p>“See you tomorrow with my clients Ma’am, have a wonderful night.” The realtor said politely.</p><p>“You as well.” Agatha said before hanging up.</p><p>“Done making phone calls?” Rio asked as she tucked her book mark into her book and looked up at Agatha.</p><p>“I think so. What would you like to do with the rest of our day?” Agatha asked Rio.</p><p>“First I want you to eat something, then we can do whatever you want.” Rio said passively as she picked up her soda and took a drink.</p><p>“And here I thought you wanted to have sex.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“I was told I had to behave. So I’m being have.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“I think everything that needs to be handled has been handled so you don’t have to behave anymore my love.” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“Yeah well maybe I don’t want anything now.” Rio said in a sassy tone.  Agatha raised an eyebrow at her as if to say ‘oh really?’</p><p>“Oh well if you don’t want to have sex with me I understand.” Agatha said as she stood up and walked over to Rio who was still sitting comfortably on the couch. She settled next to Rio and slid her hand up her thigh. “Are you mad at me because I told you no this morning?”</p><p>“No… I’m not mad you told me no. I just don’t know how I feel right now.” Rio told Agatha honestly.</p><p>“We can just cuddle, or if you need space I can hang out somewhere else in the house.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“No, I don’t want space. I just feel like someone’s going to come barging in that door at any moment.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“Oh that’s an easy fix.” Agatha said as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>Agatha 5:39 p.m: kerfuffle.</p><p>Wanda 5:40 p.m: heard loud and clear. Have a good night.</p><p>“There, Wanda won’t bother us until I text her again.” Agatha said with a smile as she handed Rio her phone.</p><p>“Kerfuffle?” Rio asked.</p><p>“We lived in a one bedroom apartment for years. We have a code word so we never walked in on each other.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“And I’m just now learning about this?!” Rio asked in an indignant tone.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I just remembered. But hey, you know it now so you can use it whenever you want.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“I’ll be using it often. Especially if you build them a house on our property and have them move next door.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Only if you are okay with my best friend living next door still.” Agatha reassured.</p><p>“If you don’t build a house she will practically live with us. Build her a house. Please for the love of the gods and goddesses.” Rio told her.</p><p>“I gotta consult with her and see what she wants. But right now I don’t want to talk about Wanda. I want to focus on you.” Agatha said as she softly tugged on Rio’s shirt before she placed her hand on her chest.</p><p>“We better put the food away before you start anything. Don’t want to waste the pizza that we could eat after we tire each other out.” Rio offered, Agatha waved her hand and everything was put away, before she straddled Rio’s lap. “Really on your office couch?”</p><p>“No let’s take this to bed.” Agatha said before she teleported them to bed.</p>

<p>Rio looked up at Agatha and blushed slightly. “So earlier when you said you’d pin me down and tie me to the bed… that sounded nice. The orgasm denial not so much. But I love for you to tie me up Agatha.” Rio said honestly.</p><p>“What if I want to make you cum over and over again until you can’t handle it?” Agatha asked as she magicked their clothing off.</p><p>“If that’s what you want my love.” Rio offered.</p><p>“I want to know what you want. I want you to use your words Rio. If I tie you up you have to communicate with me the whole time. Or else I stop. Do you understand?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes. My love.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Now tell me what you want.” Agatha said as she pushed Rio’s hands above her head and magicked some restraints.</p><p>“ I want you to touch me. I want your mouth on me. I want you to give me anything you want. I want you.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Where do you want my mouth?” Agatha asked as she leaned down and kissed along her collar bones and down her sigil.</p><p>“On my clit. I want your mouth on my pussy.” Rio requested.</p><p>“Is that the only thing you want?” Agatha asked as she swirled her tongue around the sigil as she dragged her mouth down her chest. Rio spread her legs and allowed Agatha to settle between them.</p><p>“I want your mouth on me right now Agatha.” Rio whined. Agatha leaned forward and took her clit into her mouth before she started swirling her tongue around the sensitive bud. A soft moan fell from Rio before she hissed out a “yes!”</p><p>‘Good girl. Keep using that mouth of yours to tell me what you want and I’ll keep using mine.’ Agatha praised.</p><p>“Oh fuck. Yes Agatha! I love your mouth.” Rio praised as she tried to roll her hips.</p><p>‘Do you want something my love? You have to tell me Rio.’ Agatha told her in her mind.</p><p>“Fuck! Please, I want your tongue to move faster. I want your fingers inside of me! Please Agatha I need them, I need your mouth and fingers.” Rio begged. Agatha moaned happily before she slid her fingers under her chin and dipped them into Rio.</p><p>“Goddesses yes!” Rio moaned out as she tried to roll her hips again. Agatha curled her fingers and started moving her tongue faster. “Ah! Agatha!” Rio moaned out</p><p>‘Seeing as I can’t get you pregnant. Let’s try something.’ Agatha said as she used her magic to warm her fingers.</p><p>“Oh fuck!” Rio moaned out as Agatha started to curl her fingers into Rio a little faster before she started to flick her clit with her tongue. “Yes! Yes! Fuck yes! Agatha!”</p><p>‘Are you close?’ Agatha asked in her mind.</p><p>“Yes! I’m so fucking close, please Agatha. Don’t stop! Please!” Rio begged. Agatha picked up the pace and started curling her fingers and moving her tongue at the same rate. She felt Rio clench down on her fingers and she pulled her mouth away so she could look up at Rio as she came.</p><p>“Ah fuck! Yes!” Rio moaned out as Agatha sat up and curled her fingers thrusting into Rio roughly. “Oh! Fuck! Agatha!” Rio moaned out as her legs started to shake as she felt herself squirt. The flood of warm liquid coating Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Fuck. Rio.” Agatha husked out, arousal and desire painting her tone.</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio groaned out as Agatha stoped moving her fingers, which caused Rio to whine.</p><p>“You gotta start talking Rio. Remember the rules.” Agatha told her love.</p><p>“Please don’t stop! I want more. I need your fingers.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Do you want my fingers or do you want the toy?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Don’t make me choose.” Rio moaned out as she rolled her hips. Agatha’s fingers still unmoving inside of her.</p><p>“Pick one dear. Toy or fingers.” Agatha demanded softly.</p><p>“Fuck, fingers please!” Rio begged and Agatha started curling her fingers, and thrusting into Rio before she kissed up her stomach. “Mouth, nipple, please.” Rio asked trying to be clear but Agatha’s fingers were making it hard to think.</p><p>“Is that all you want? Do you want my thumb on your clit?” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“Goddesses please Agatha.” Rio begged again.</p><p>“Use your words babe.” Agatha said with a smile knowing she was torturing Rio.</p><p>“I want your thumb on my clit. I want your mouth on my breasts, I want you to fuck me with your fingers! Please Agatha I need you.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Good girl, that’s exactly what I wanted from you Rio.” Agatha praised before she took her nipple in her mouth and started sucking on the sensitive bud and swirling her tongue around it while thrusting into Rio. Her thumb tapping softly against her clit with every thrust.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Rio moaned out as she rolled her hips. She thrashed softly against the restraints holding her in place. As Agatha softly bit her nipple and then soothed it with her tongue.</p><p>‘Be a good girl and give me one more orgasm.’ Agatha demanded and started curling her fingers and hooked them inside Rio and did a jerking motion to slam into her g-spot over and over. Rio’s hips locked as she squirted again, arousal coating Agatha’s hand as she moaned against her breast. A loud moan fell from Rio’s lips as Agatha made her cum.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha said as she pulled her mouth away from Rio’s breast. Rio was breathing heavily as her hips collapsed against the bed. “Do you want out of your restraints yet?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No. But I do want you to fuck me into the mattress with your strap.” Rio said confidently.</p><p>“Gladly my love.” Agatha said as she magicked her harness on and then a bottle of lube as well. She poured a generous amount onto the toy and moaned softly at the sensation of the cold lube on it. Before she took her wet fingers and dipped them into Rio. Agatha then used her magic to prop Rio up with a pillow and clean her hands before she slid the toy into her. “Goddesses. You always feel so warm.” Agatha moaned out as she sunk her hips into Rio’s.</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio hissed out.</p><p>“Should I make you hold out for me?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Noooo, please don’t. I was so good today.” Rio whined out.</p><p>“You were good, but what if I want to cum with you?” Agatha asked as she started thrusting into Rio. She leaned back on her knees and slipped a thumb between them and started rolling Rio’s clit softly.</p><p>“I can cum multiple times.” Rio whimpered out.</p><p>“Let’s test that theory.” Agatha said with a grin as she started moving her hips faster. Moans and whimpers falling from both women’s lips from the feeling of the toy sliding in and out of Rio.</p><p>“Goddesses above you feel so good Agatha.” Rio moaned out as she felt herself start to climb.</p><p>“Tell me when you are close Rio.” Agatha requested already feeling dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>“I am. Just a little faster, please.” Rio requested, Agatha listened and started moving a little faster. “Yes fuck! I want to touch you.” Rio moaned out as she thrashed against her restraints.</p><p>“Give me one more, then we can get rid of these and I can give you some after care.” Agatha told Rio. Rio could feel herself teetering on the edge but she needed something.</p><p>“Rougher on my clit, please. I need more.” Rio asked softly. Agatha pressed harder on Rio’s clit and kept the same pace. “Oh fuck! Yes!” Rio moaned out as she clenched down hard and came. She rolled her hips wildly as she fell apart. Agatha collapsed on top of Rio and magicked the restraints away before she started massaging Rio’s arms and wrists.</p><p>Agatha sat up and pulled Rio’s arms down and started massaging them along with her hands and fingers. Before she spoke a small incantation to help soothe the aches. “Thank you for the aftercare my love.” Rio said appreciatively.</p><p>“I’d do more but I haven’t came yet, and I’d really like to.” Agatha said with a groan as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“Use me babe. Do whatever you need to cum for me.” Rio requested as she clenched down on the toy. Agatha groaned again as she started thrusting into Rio slowly.</p><p>“Fuck, you always feel so good.” Agatha groaned out as she started moving faster.</p><p>“Come on baby. Please. I want you to cum.” Rio begged as she slid her hands up Agatha’s body and softly tweaked both of her nipples.</p><p>“Oh! Fuck. I want you to come with me!” Agatha moaned out as she felt herself inching closer and closer to the edge. Rio clenched down hard on her and Agatha felt her body start to shake.</p><p>“Come on Agatha. Cum for me. I’m close.” Rio begged and Agatha felt herself fall over the edge as she came her hips sinking deep into Rio. “Fuck.” Rio whispered as she felt a small orgasm flood over her, as she felt Agatha’s body shake. Agatha pulled out a moment later and magicked the toy away before she collapsed on the bed next to Rio.</p><p>Rio rolled over and slid her hand between Agatha’s legs before she got a chance to say anything and curled her finger around her clit. “Wha?” Agatha started to say but was quickly cut off by Rio thrusting into her.</p><p>“It’s my turn babe.” Rio husked out as she thrust into Agatha, curling her fingers just right so that every single drag out hit her g-spot.</p><p>“Goddesses Rio.” Agatha moaned out as she felt herself clench down hard on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>“Agatha, my love. I want you to cum for me. Please baby, I need to feel you cum.” Rio begged.</p><p>“Ah! Rio! Fuck!” Agatha moaned out before she turned her head and buried it into the pillow as she moaned loudly. The pillow did nothing to muffle the moan as Agatha came hard. Her orgasm washing over her before she could catch up with the fact that Rio was touching her.  Rio quickly slid down the bed and settled between Agatha’s legs before she brought her mouth down to Agatha’s clit. She curled her tongue around the soft sensitive bud.</p><p>“Fuck Rio!” Agatha screamed out breathlessly as she pulled her face away from the pillow.</p><p>‘yes my love?’ Rio husked out in her mind as she continued to flick her tongue over Agatha’s clit. Agatha’s fingers wove into Rio’s soft brown hair as she held the woman in place.</p><p>“More.” Agatha begged, and Rio listened. She started moving her tongue faster.</p><p>‘Cum for me Agatha.’ Rio demanded and Agatha rolled her hips as she clung to Rio’s head. Her orgasm rolled over her, sparks of purple and green flashing behind her eyes. She felt all the air leave her lungs as a silent scream fell from her lips.</p><p>“Goddesses above!” Agatha finally said after she was able to breathe again. Rio pulled her mouth away from Agatha’s clit and kissed her thigh.</p><p>“Sensitive?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“My clit is.” Agatha groaned out as she stretched. “Come up here and kiss me.” Agatha requested as she lifted her hands and did a grabbing motion with them. Rio softly laughed at Agatha and climbed up her body to settle against her side.</p><p>“I love you so much.” Rio said softly as she kissed the side of Agatha’s breast.</p><p>“I love you the most.” Agatha answered as she pulled Rio close. They settled into each other comfortably for a long moment. Just enjoying each other. Then Agatha’s stomach growled</p><p>“Are you hungry?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>“Kinda.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“I don’t want you to cook. Do you want to go out to eat?” Rio asked.</p><p>“What sounds good?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Burgers?” Rio asked trying to be simple and easy about it.</p><p>“I think I know a place.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“You do?” Rio asked waiting for Agatha to elaborate.</p><p>“Yeah. But it’s a surprise. Come on let’s go eat.” Agatha said with a sigh as she tried to get up but Rio held her in place.</p><p>“Not yet. Let me enjoy this for a moment longer.” Rio said as she slid a hand up to cup Agatha’s breast.</p><p>“Behave. Or you won’t be getting anything to eat.”</p><p>“Not even you?” Rio teased.</p><p>“After dinner I might not be as sensitive.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“I guess I can agree to those terms.” Rio said as she let Agatha go. Agatha got up and went to the bathroom before magicking her clothing back on. Rio got up a few minutes later and did the same thing.</p><p>“Ready babe?” Agatha asked as she looked over Rio as she bit her lip.</p><p>“Yeah. Stop I can practically hear your thoughts.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? What am I thinking then?” Agatha teased. Instead of saying anything Rio walked over to Agatha and placed her hand on the heart sigil on her chest and let the memories of Agatha eating her out flood the woman.</p><p>“Close. I was thinking about sitting on your face. Seeing as I haven’t gotten to do that yet. Maybe after dinner.” Agatha said with a smile before she kissed Rio softly. Rio groaned loudly as Agatha took her hand and lead her out of the bedroom.</p><p>“Unfair.” Rio grumbled as Agatha magicked her purse, keys and phone into her hand and then guided them out the front door.</p><p>“You shall survive my love.” Agatha said as she let Rio’s hand go and went to the driver-side and got into the car.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Rio asked as she got in and buckled up. Agatha turned the car on and smiled softly at Rio.</p><p>“A 24 hour diner that Wanda, Pietro and I used to hang out at in college. Best burgers and fries, and a guilty indulgence of mine that I haven’t had in a few years.” Agatha explained as she pulled out of the driveway and started down the street.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s where all the college kids hang out?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Not at all. It’s just a place we found that let us camp as long as we wanted and work on homework while eating. I think the head waitress just felt like she had to take care of 3 kids who had no parents. But I’m grateful for her.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Good to know. I can’t wait.” Rio said with a smile before she pulled out her phone to check her emails. “I need to finish moving my stuff in this week so I can cancel my lease.” Rio said as she opened an email.</p><p>“I can do that, all that’s left is some clothing and your books right?” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Yeah, but I want to help. You moved the plants all by yourself…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“After dinner, teach me how to use the portal to your apartment. Then it will be easy to get everything into my place.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“After dinner we should go to the bookstore and establish a portal to the house before and I’ll teach you how to use that one.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Sounds good.” Agatha said as she continued to drive. “Do I need to look over your lease agreement?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“If you want, but as long as there’s no damage I should get my deposit back.” Rio explained.</p><p>“I’ll look over it anyway just in case the complex wants to try and pull something.” Agatha explained to Rio before she pulled into a parking spot.</p><p>“This place looks older than dirt.” Rio’s joked.</p><p>“It probably is, but it passes it’s health department inspections and has good food.” Agatha said as she turned off the car and got out. Rio followed suit and they headed into the diner.</p><p>The second they walked into the diner Agatha heard a woman talking to one of her servers before she heard a loud “Aggie!” Being yelled across the diner. Agatha smiled and made her way over to the booth Wanda, Pietro and her used to sit at. As soon as they sat down the woman rushed over.</p><p>“Hey Cassie!” Agatha said with a smile as she looked up at the older woman.</p><p>“Wands was in here last week on a date with a cute blonde. How did that go? This must be the girlfriend she mentioned.” Cassie said taking Rio in.</p><p>“Hi, I’m Rio.” Rio said with a smile as she offered her hand to Cassie to shake.</p><p>“She’s a cutie Aggie, where ever did you find her?” Cassie said as she set a menu down in front of Rio.</p><p>“At her bookstore. She owns Vidal Books.”</p><p>“Wonderful, I’m glad you found you a girl that can keep up with you. A well read woman is exactly what you need. What would you like to drink Rio? We got coke products.” Cassie complimented before she asked Rio.</p><p>“A coke is fine, thank you.” Rio said politely.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be back in a second to harass you two some more. Look over the menu. I already know what she wants.” Cassie said jabbing a thumb in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>“How come she gets to call you Aggie?” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Because she gives all her regulars she actually likes nicknames. She calls Pietro, Zippy.” Agatha explained before continuing “and honestly, it doesn’t make me want to vomit when she calls me that.”</p><p>“Fair, what do you usually get?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Double bacon cheese burger, with pickles, onion, lettuce, ketchup, and mustard. Or a chicken strip basket. She’ll ask me if I want chicken or beef when she gets back.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Ah, makes sense.”</p><p>“She’ll let you order the first 8-10 times and see if there’s a pattern and then it’s like clock work for her. I swear she’s a witch sometimes but she’s just a normal human who has the memory of a crow. Never forgets who crosses her and who takes care of her.” Agatha explained to Rio.</p><p>“I’ll be sure not to cross her.” Rio told Agatha with a smile.</p><p>“Wise.” Agatha said as Cassie walked over and put down two cokes.</p><p>“Had enough time Rio?” Cassie asked.</p><p>“Yeah I think so. Can I get a double cheese burger with onion, pickle, ketchup, and mustard please.” Rio requested.</p><p>“Of course, you want fries?” Cassie asked and Rio looked over at Agatha.</p><p>“We want fries.” Agatha answered</p><p>“Beef or chicken?” Cassie asked as she pointed her pen at Agatha.</p><p>“Beef. Please.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll go harass my cook while you two chat.” Cassie said before she walked off.</p><p>“You weren’t kidding.” Rio said in a disbelieving tone.</p><p>“She’s a no nonsense woman. Kinda why I like her.” Agatha said with a smile. A few minutes later Cassie came back over to their booth and swatted Agatha’s arm softly with her ticket book.</p><p>“Scooch.” Cassie demanded. Agatha sighed and scooted over. “Tell me about this one.” Aggie demanded softly as she pointed at Rio.</p><p>“She’s my partner, we met a few weeks ago. It’s really complicated Cass.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Like I’ve never heard that before. Come on kid, I know you. You never bring girls in here.” Cassie said as she shoved her shoulder against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Oh so you must be serious about me?” Rio joked.</p><p>“Don’t encourage her Rio.” Agatha said with a groan.</p><p>“Extra serious. Tell me, how did you charm one of my kids so easily.” Cassie said with a smile as she observed Rio.</p><p>“Cass.” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Not gunna work Aggie. I gotta know.”</p><p>“We have a magical connection. Deep magical compatibility. I’m basically Agatha’s magical soulmate and she’s mine.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Ahhh there it is! I could sense there was something different about ya. But I wasn’t sure what it was. Same with Wanda and the cute blonde. Never did get her name.” Cassie mused to herself.</p><p>“You knew they had a connection?” Rio asked.</p><p>“I could tell they were going to end up together if that’s what you are asking. Wands was smitten and the girl seemed like she was extra interested.” Cassie explained.</p><p>“Her name’s Lily, she’s a botanist and she is also Wanda’s magical soulmate.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“So I’m two for two. Maybe Pietro will find himself a nice person to date too. Then 3 of my kids will be happy.” Cassie explained before a bell rang loudly. “That will be your food, be right back.”</p><p>“She’s not a witch but she’s definitely something.” Rio said after Cassie got up and walked away.</p><p>“Probably an eldritch being.” Agatha joked.</p><p>“Maybe.” Rio joked back before Cassie slid two wrapped burgers onto the table and a large basket of fries.</p><p>“If you want more fries let me know half way through. This one always eats a handful of them then quits so I figured you two could share.” Cassie said pointing at Agatha.</p><p>“Way to call me out.” Agatha complained before she stole two straws from Cassie’s apron. “You forgot straws.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“I don’t forget anything. I just like to make you work for things Aggie.” Cassie said as she turned around and headed off toward the kitchen again.</p><p>“I feel like you thrive in chaos.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Sometimes. But that happens when your the calm in your best friends storm for a long time. Now eat, they taste better when hot.” Agatha explained as she unwrapped her burger and took a bite. Happily humming as she chewed her burger, Rio unwrapped her burger and picked it up and took a bite before she looked up at Agatha.</p><p>‘It’s so good!’ Rio thought as she chewed.</p><p>‘I know.’ Agatha answered back before she grabbed a bottle of ketchup and squeezed it on her paper from her burger. She grabbed a French fry and dipped into the ketchup and popped it into her mouth. ‘Try a fry.’</p><p>Rio finished chewing and grabbed a French fry before reaching over and getting some ketchup off Agatha’s wrapper before popping one in her mouth. She moaned softly as she chewed on the fry.</p><p>“I told you the food was good.” Agatha explained as Cassie walked over to the table and put the bill next to Agatha.</p><p>“Whenever you get a chance Aggie. Nice to meet you Rio, take care of Aggie for me.” Cassie said with a smile before she walked away. Agatha and Rio finished their meals and Rio scarfed down the rest of the french fries. Agatha got up and paid for their meal then walked over to Cassie and gave her a huge tip.</p><p>“Aggie no.” Cassie scolded.</p><p>“Cass, Evanora died last week and had her will set up so that she couldn’t change it until I was 50 years old. I inherited everything. I’m just as rich as Tony Stark now. Take it. I’d give you more if I had more.” Agatha told the woman trying to shove the money into her hand.</p><p>“Fine. Only because I love ya kid. Now get outta my diner.” Cassie said as she shoved Agatha toward Rio and the door.</p><p>“I’m going! I’m going!” Agatha said with a sigh as she walked toward Rio. Agatha took her hand and they headed outside and toward Agatha’s car.</p><p>“To the bookstore?” Rio asked.</p><p>“To the bookstore. Let’s go make a portal home.” Agatha suggested as they got in the car. Ten minutes later they were parked behind the bookstore and getting out of the car. Rio unlocked the door and they headed inside.</p><p>“I’m going to set up this closet as the portal. Which door do you want me to use in the house?” Rio asked.</p><p>“My office door?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“That works alright let me set it up real quick and then I’ll teach you how to use it.”  Rio said as she grabbed the door handle and created the portal with her intention and then opened the door to see Agatha’s living room swirling in the green. She then shut the door and opened it again to see the storage closet.</p><p>“Alright grab the door and imagine you are opening it into our living room.” Rio explained. Agatha grabbed the door handle and imagined opening the door into her living room and then opened the door to see her living room swirling in a green portal door.</p><p>“Good job babe! Step through!” Rio encouraged and Agatha did then she turned around and walked back into the book store.</p><p>“That was surprisingly easy.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“For you maybe. It took me three weeks to be able to get the portal to open for me the first time I learned. Momma had to do it for me for a long time.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Sorry my love.” Agatha said as she walked over to Rio and placed a soft kiss on her lips.</p><p>“It’s fine. Close the portal and we will drive home. Unless you want a car here tomorrow just in case we need to leave?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Probably should leave a car here eventually but no we can drive home tonight. I don’t think I’ll need to go anywhere.” Agatha explained. “Plus the portal is here so we can always get a car at any point.”</p><p>“True. Alright let’s head home and cuddle on the couch until we get tired. I have an interview tomorrow with Sage.” Rio said softly before she kissed Agatha again.</p><p>“Sounds like a wonderful idea.” Agatha said after the kiss. “Maybe we can fool around some more.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Rio said softly before she headed toward the back door and they made their way back to the car after arming the security system and locking the door.</p>

<p>Six months later Agatha was in the middle of setting up for a case when her phone rang. She grabbed it and answered. “Agatha Harkness, how may I assist you?” Agatha asked into the phone.</p><p>“Hello Miss Harkness, it’s the chief down at the fire station in Salem. We are ready to burn down the house. Would you like to be there for it?” The chief asked.</p><p>“Yes I would.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“I heard why we are burning the home down from a friend. I wanna schedule this. How about Saturday Morning?” The man offered to Agatha.</p><p>“Saturday is perfect. Do you have a time you think your team will be starting?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“10 a.m. ma’am.”</p><p>“I’ll be there at 9:45 just to make sure I get a good seat.” Agatha told the man.</p><p>“Sounds good. See you then.” The man said into the phone.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said appreciatively before hanging up.</p><p>‘They wanna burn it down Saturday.’ Agatha thought softly to Rio.</p><p>‘Let me see if Sage or Rowen wants to work on Saturday.’ Rio thought back before going quiet.</p><p>“I better get this case wrapped up soon because I’m not missing this.” Agatha said out loud before she walked over to her office door and opened it. “Tricia. Call Pepper for me please. See if she’s got time for me.”</p><p>“Yes Ms. Harkness.” Tricia said before she pressed a couple buttons on her phone and it rang.</p><p>“Timothy, is Mrs. Potts available to speak with Ms. Harkness?” Tricia asked into the phone and then there was a long pause. “Thank you.” Tricia said into the phone before hanging up.</p><p>“Yes you can go on up and speak to her.” Tricia said to Agatha who smiled at her appreciatively.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll be back down soon.” Agatha said before walking off toward the elevator. Agatha stepped onto the elevator and hit the button for Peppers floor and then waited. She stepped off the elevator and Timothy nodded at her before she walked into Peppers office.</p><p>“I’d stand but someone has other plans.” Pepper said as she spun around. Her pregnant belly showing through her suit.</p><p>“Little lady giving you hell today?” Agatha asked as she walked over to Pepper.</p><p>“Morgan is just as stubborn as her parents unfortunately and she’s decided to take a nap right on my hip. What did you want to speak about?”</p><p>“They are finally ready to burn the place down. Saturday 10 a.m.” Agatha said with a sigh as she sat down.</p><p>“Great! Fantastic even. I’m glad.” Pepper said with a bright smile, she was ecstatic about the fact that Agatha was about to close this chapter on her life for good.</p><p>“How are you feeling? Need anything from me?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nope, go win your case tomorrow then go watch that place get turned to nothing but a distant memory.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“I meant do you need any potions or help standing up.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“Maybe help standing up. I need to pee.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“No problem. Let’s get you up.” Agatha said as she walked over to Pepper and helped her out of the office chair. “I can’t believe you and Jen are both having girls.” Agatha said with a soft chuckle.</p><p>“I knew Morgan was going to be a girl. Lilia made sure of that by telling us to try every day the month after Evanora’s trial. And honestly did you expect two women to create a boy?”</p><p>“It’s happened millions of times before. Wanda and Lily’s first kid is supposed to be according to Lilia.” Agatha clarified as she guided Pepper over to her private bathroom.</p><p>“Oh. I just assumed no Y chromosome no boy.” Pepper said in a confused tone.</p><p>“I’ll explain that one later. Want me to wait for you to finish?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Nah, enjoy your weekend. Call me if you need anything.” Pepper said as she walked into the room.</p><p>“You as well! See you later.” Agatha said before she walked out of Peppers office. She made her way back down to her own office and took a deep breath before stepping off the elevator.</p><p>‘Rowen is going to work. But you owe them a mini chocolate cake.’ Rio said in an amused tone.</p><p>‘I think I can handle that.’ Agatha responded.</p><p>‘Good because they are adamant about that. Their exact words were ‘only if Agatha makes me a chocolate cake’ you really gotta stop spoiling my staff.’ Rio said with a chuckle in her mind.</p><p>‘Never. I like them. Plus I only bake when I’m happy.’</p><p>‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I make you happy I know. I love you too.’ Rio answered.</p><p>‘I gotta finish up a few things at work. I’ll see you at home. Love you.’ Agatha told her before she made her way into her office.</p><p>“The contractor called while you were up talking to Pepper. It sounded important. I’d call him back when you get a chance.” Tricia said to Agatha as she walked up to the desk.</p><p>“I’ll do that now. Thank you.” Agatha said as she walked into her office. She sat down and dialed the contractors number. The phone rang 3 times before he picked up.</p><p>“Agatha! Good news! The houses will be completed next week! We are two weeks ahead of schedule. The boys have already started putting the green house up!” The man said excitedly into the phone.</p><p>“Fantastic! Thank you so much for the update. I think we should keep this hush hush though. Let Rio think we can’t move in until next month. I want to surprise her.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“Of course, that’s why I called your office. I wasn’t sure if she was with you today or not.” The contractor said into the phone.</p><p>“Perfect. Thank you so much. Give me a call when everything is finished. I appreciate all the hard work your team has put in, in the last few months.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“I appreciate how much you are paying us.” He said honestly, Agatha was spending a pretty penny on these houses but she knew they’d be worth it. Tony and Pepper personally recommended this company.</p><p>“I’ll stop by after work to see how everything is going, thank you.” Agatha told the man.</p><p>“See you soon.” He said before hanging up.</p><p>“Thank the goddesses.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Really there is no need for all that sweetheart.” Gaia said with a chuckle as she popped into Agatha’s office.</p><p>“So you had nothing to do with team productivity and things being delivered on time?” Agatha asked her mother.</p><p>“I didn’t say that either…” Gaia said looking anywhere but at Agatha.</p><p>“Momma…” Agatha softly scolded.</p><p>“Hey! I want grandbabies!” Gaia said with a huff.</p><p>“Impatient. Almost as impatient as Rita!” Agatha said with a scoff.</p><p>“Look. I know you want to propose…. We’ll actually propose. Now let me see the ring that’s been hidden in your desk for the last 3 months!” Gaia said as she walked over to Agatha.</p><p>“Horrible, absolutely the worst. Fine, only because I’ve been dying to show you.” Agatha said as she slid the top drawer open and pulled out a black ring box. She opened it to look at the marquise cut emerald set in a black gold band that seemed to twist so that it held the top and bottom of the stone. It was simple but it screamed Rio.</p><p>“Stunning! She’s going to love it.” Gaia said with a bright smile as she looked at the ring.</p><p>“I hope so.” Agatha said nervously.</p><p>“Baby. She’d say yes if you proposed with a ring pop. Stop stressing.” Gaia reassured. “Now you have a job to do. I have a universe to maintain. I love you. Have a good rest of your day. By the way the houses are looking great.” Gaia said before she disappeared, which caused Agatha to roll her eyes.</p><p>“Stop acting like Violet.” Agatha said softly before she went back to work. Her phone buzzed a moment later.</p><p>Momma Gaia 11:45 a.m: I’d stay all day if I didn’t act like Violet. Love you!</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and sighed loudly as she started working on getting this case sorted out. She had court tomorrow and wanted everything to be perfect before she took the weekend off.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later Tricia came into her office and placed a take out container on her desk. “Grilled chicken salad with a raspberry vinaigrette and a large water from the cafe downstairs.” Tricia told her.</p><p>“Thank you, did you order lunch as well?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Tricia told her.</p><p>“Okay. I’m hoping to get everything sorted out for court tomorrow so I can take Friday off. I have to bake a chocolate cake for Rowen. They want one because Rio asked them to work so she could be with me while they burn the house down.” Agatha told Tricia.</p><p>“I’m sure your whole coven will want to be there as well.” Tricia told Agatha reassuringly.</p><p>“I’m not letting Jen come. She’s too pregnant to be in a car for that long let alone breathe in those fumes.” Agatha clarified.</p><p>“True, what did the contractor need?” Tricia asked, being slightly nosy. Agatha smiled and looked up at her from her seat.</p><p>“The house should be done soon. I’m going to take Rio over there and propose once it’s finished.” Agatha told Tricia with a bright smile as she slid the ring over to Tricia to look at.</p><p>“Stunning. She will love it.” Tricia said with a smile as she looked at the ring.</p><p>“I hope so.” Agatha said as she tucked it into her pocket before she went back to work. Her day seemed to drag on but eventually 5 p.m. rolled around and she was able to leave the office.</p><p>‘Gotta go check on the house before I meet you at the bookstore my love.’ Agatha told Rio.</p><p>‘Of course take your time. Hopefully everything is okay.’ Rio reassured softly.</p><p>‘I think so.’ Agatha reassured before she made her way down to her car and drove to the property the houses were being built on. Twenty minutes later she was pulling up to the property and smiled brightly at the houses. The contractors truck was sitting in the driveway when she pulled up and got out of the car. He got out of his truck at the same time.</p><p>“Agatha! So the houses are done actually, but the green house is going to take some time, a week tops. So if you want you can start moving in tomorrow.” He explained as he walked up to her and handed her the keys.</p><p>“Rio will be over the moon about that.” Agatha said with a smile as she took the keys from him.</p><p>“The red ones are for the house next door.” He explained.</p><p>“I appreciate the color coding. Thank you.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“Well come on! I want you to see the place.” He said as he walked toward the house. Agatha followed him and unlocked the door before heading inside. The main floor had a large open concept floor plan. The kitchen was huge and it was right off a large dining room. There was a massive family room that connected to her office. Then she made her way upstairs and found 4 bedrooms, a large library for Rio and a large playroom above the garage.</p><p>She walked into the massive bedroom and into the large walk in closet and smiled brightly at how big everything was. She was over the moon with how the house turned out. She then made her way back downstairs to where the contractor was waiting.</p><p>“Well? Are you happy with it?” He asked.</p><p>“Ecstatic! I love it. Your crew did a wonderful job!” Agatha complimented.</p><p>“Perfect, let’s go check the second house out.” He suggested as he turned and opened the other door.</p><p>“I’ll bring Wanda over later and let her look at it. It’s her place anyway. But thank you. I’ll call you if I ever need anything done in the future.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you for your business Agatha it’s much appreciated.” He said with a smile.</p><p>“I think I’ll stick around for a minute: I have something I want to do before I head out.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“It’s your house ma’am, have a good day.” He said before he walked out the door.</p><p>‘I have a surprise for you my love.’ Agatha whispered softly in Rio’s mind.</p><p>‘Oh and what is that?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘I’ll be there soon to pick you up after your shift so I can show you.’ Agatha told Rio.</p><p>‘I’ll be waiting.’ Rio told her. Agatha decided  that she would establish a portal door to their house they were currently living in to make it easier to move. Then she locked up and headed to the bookstore. Ten minutes later she was parked in back and headed into the store.</p><p>“What are you hiding from me Agatha?” Rio asked as she wrapped her arms around her from behind after she made it into the store.</p><p>“I’m not hiding anything, I said I had a surprise for you. Lock up and I’ll take you to it.” Agatha told Rio who huffed and smiled knowing it was probably something good.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll let you keep me in the dark a little longer.” Rio told Agatha as she locked the store up and they headed back out to Agatha’s car. Agatha started it and headed toward the property. Five minutes into the drive Rio looked over at Agatha.</p><p>“I thought it wasn’t going to be done until next month?” Rio asked.</p><p>“They finished today.” Agatha told her as she pulled onto the street the property was on.</p><p>“Really?!” Rio said excitedly.</p><p>“Yep! I already set up a portal door so we could start moving the second we get inside.” Agatha told her with a smile.</p><p>“You set up your own portal door?” Rio asked with a smile.</p><p>“Yes but you should double check it, now come on my love. Let’s go look at our first home.” Agatha said with a smile as she parked the car and handed Rio the keys. Rio took the keys and bolted out the car before rushing into the house excitedly. Agatha smiled brightly as she watched Rio from the driver seat. She got out and slowly walked into the house and let Rio zip from room to room looking around.</p><p>“It’s beautiful! I love it!” Rio said as she kept looking around. Agatha let her for a long moment.</p><p>“Come with me, I want to show you something.” Agatha said with a smile as she took Rio’s hand and guided her upstairs to her library. She opened the door and let Rio go in first, Rio walked in and her jaw hit the floor at the size of the library. Agatha took this moment to kneel down behind Rio and pull the ring out of her pocket. Right as Rio turned around Agatha opened the box.</p><p>“Rio, I have loved you with my entire being for the last 6 months. I know your magic already asked and mine already said yes, but Rio Rene Vidal Will You Marry Me?” Agatha asked. Rio’s hand flew up to her mouth as she felt tears spring to her eyes.</p><p>“Yes! Yes! A million times yes! In every universe yes!” Rio said as Agatha took the ring out of the box and slid it onto Rio’s ring finger. Her other ring morphing around the ring and glowing brightly as the two merged into one stunning ring. The silver with purple clouds seeming to cross the ring making it an infinity symbol on Rio’s finger.</p><p>“I love you.” Agatha said with a smile as she stood up and Rio practically tackled her with a hug.</p><p>“I love you!” Rio said excitedly as she kissed Agatha all over her face before landing on her lips. Rio tried to deepen the kiss and Agatha was more than willing to let her but she pulled away before it got too deep.</p><p>“Really, in your library?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“You’ve already tainted the bookstore.” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>“Let’s head home. I established a door, let’s see if it worked.” Agatha offered as she grabbed Rio’s hand and guided her downstairs to the closet she had used to establish a door to their other home. She opened it and showed Rio who smiled and whistled lowly.</p><p>“Impressive my love. On your first try too. I’d be jealous if I wasn’t about to be your wife.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Safe to say you already are in every sense of the word except for legally.” Agatha clarified before she stepped through the door. She made it through unscathed and Rio followed suit.</p><p>“Does that mean Wanda’s place is done as well?” Rio asked as she followed Agatha.</p><p>“Yep, it’s ready for her and Lily. I can call them and we can give them the keys or we can wait and celebrate our engagement.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“I’m posting a photo tomorrow on the stores Instagram page and my private one.” Rio told her.</p><p>“I have court tomorrow.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“So you need to be rested. Okay. Fair. Let’s figure out dinner my love.” Rio said with a smile before she shut the door and dragged Agatha toward the kitchen.</p><p>“How about some marry me chicken?” Agatha asked with a smirk.</p><p>“That sounds amazing. I’ll be right back. I have to go to the cabin real quick and grab something from my old bedroom.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“What’s that my love?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“It’s a surprise. I’ll be quick, unless Momma’s there. But I’ll be right back.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“I’ll start cooking. Love you.” Agatha said softly before she pulled Rio in for a kiss. Rio kissed her softly before she let Agatha go and bolted off toward the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha started cooking dinner and ten minutes later Rio came back into the kitchen holding both hands behind her back. “What do you have Rio?” Agatha asked softly as she turned to her.</p><p>“Something that I’ve been holding onto for a few months.” Rio said as she walked over to Agatha and brought her hand around to show Agatha a purple ring box. She opened it and presented it to Agatha with a nervous smile.</p><p>Nestled in the purple velvet was a silver band with leaves made from white sapphires curling around an oval amethyst. “I was going to propose to you after the house was burned down at family dinner on Saturday but you beat me to it.” Rio said with a small laugh.</p><p>“It’s gorgeous Rio.” Agatha told her with tears in her eyes as she looked her in the eyes. Agatha held her left hand up for Rio and Rio quickly slipped the ring out of the box and onto her finger. The black and green band started to glow and morph on her finger. It’s shape changed, the band thinned before settling against the ring.</p><p>“Perfect.” Rio said with a smile as she brought both rings up to her lips and softly kissed them.</p><p>“Did Rita see your ring?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, she wasn’t home yet.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“That explains why there’s not an angry Latino woman on my kitchen.” Agatha said with a small laugh.</p><p>“She wouldn’t be mad.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“Mad that I didn’t have a photographer there.” Agatha clarified. “I gotta finish dinner, let me go.” Agatha said as she pulled away and went back to cooking. A panicked look spread across Rio’s face and for a long moment she actually looked scared.</p><p>“That’s what Lilia’s memory spell is for.” Rio said with wide eyes, remembering that was an option. Agatha went back to cooking.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Agatha had a thought.  “Better call her.” Agatha told Rio as she got the chicken back in the pan after making the cream sauce.</p><p>“I’ll do that..” Rio started to say but then her phone started to ring on the countertop. She quickly grabbed it and answered putting it on speaker.</p><p>“Hey Aunt Lilia.” Rio said into the phone while Agatha listened and continued cooking.</p><p>“Hey? Hey! That’s how you answer the phone?” Lilia scolds.</p><p>“How am I supposed to answer the phone?” Rio asked as she looked over at Agatha with a confused look.</p><p>“Am I off by a day again? Didn’t something happen like an hour ago?” Lilia asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“You are never off by a day.” Rio told Lilia with a smirk.</p><p>“Then why aren’t you telling me what I want to hear?” Lilia said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Because it’s fun, and you don’t want to slip up just incase you seen the wrong vision.” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Listen here you little shit!” Lilia scolded.</p><p>“I’m listening.” Rio said in a sassy tone.</p><p>“If you don’t tell me, I’ll call Rita this instant!” Lilia said in a frustrated tone, forcing Rio to sigh before she looked over at Agatha.</p><p>“I proposed to Rio tonight.” Agatha told Lilia.</p><p>“I was on speaker?! Rio, we need to have a talk about phone etiquette.” Lilia scolded.</p><p>“I know your on speaker as well Lilia, I can hear it. The echo, that is.” Rio explained, before continuing. “And I know you have Wednesday wine nights with momma…” Rio trailed off.</p><p>“Damn it Lilia!” Rita scolded the woman.</p><p>“I was hoping she forgot.” Lilia whisper yelled back at Rita.</p><p>“What do you want to hear?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Tell momma everything!” Rita said excitedly into the phone.</p><p>“Well tonight after work Agatha came and picked me up to show me a surprise. The surprise was that the houses are done! So she took me upstairs, showed me my new library. Then got down on one knee and proposed when I turned around. Our rings kind of merged together though. We can send you a photo after dinner. Agatha just finished cooking.” Rio explained to her Mother and Aunt.</p><p>“Oooo what are you having?” Rita asked.</p><p>“Marry me chicken with rice and steamed broccoli.” Agatha explained as she set a plate of food in front of Rio.</p><p>“Okay this looks fantastic. Sorry momma, sorry Lilia. I love you, Bye.” Rio said before disconnecting the phone.</p><p>“You know they are going to call you right back.” Agatha said flatly as she made her own plate of food.</p><p>“Don’t care, they can wait. I’m starving.” Rio said as she dug into her food. Her phone started to ring a moment later.</p><p>“I’m glad you still like my cooking.” Agatha said with a smile as she walked over and sat down next to Rio and started eating. A moment later Agatha’s phone started to ring. She magicked it up herself and looked at the caller ID to see that it was Daniel.</p><p>“You dirty. Fine.” Agatha said in an irritated tone directed at Rita and Lilia before sighing and answering the phone. “Hey Papa, how are you doing?” Agatha asked into the phone.</p><p>“Púrpura! Rita tells me you have some news to share?” Daniel said to Agatha, using the nickname he gave her four months ago.</p><p>“Papa! Leave Agatha alone.” Rio whined.</p><p>“Pepita! I just wanted to check in on my future daughter in law, is that a crime?” Daniel said to his daughter.</p><p>‘Low blow using my father against you.’ Rio thought in an irritated tone.</p><p>‘Straight kidney shots, really.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“I am well Daniel. Was just about to sit down and eat dinner when you called. Do you want some? You’re more than welcome to come have a plate.” Agatha told the man, returning the low blow from Lilia and Rita with equal kindness.</p><p>“What is it?” He whispers into the phone.</p><p>“Marry me chicken, rice and broccoli.”Agatha answered.</p><p>“Be there in two minutes.” Daniel said before he hung up.</p><p>“You know they are both going to be upset.” Rio said with an eye roll before she continued to eat. A moment later Daniel walked into the kitchen and grabbed himself a plate and then proceeded to make himself one.</p><p>“You better call your Mother and Lilia back before they have aneurysms.” Daniel told Rio before he grabbed a fork and started eating while standing next to the sink.</p><p>“I’m surprised they didn’t follow you.” Rio told her father as she watched the man eat.</p><p>“They think I’m getting more wine from the kitchen.” Daniel told his daughter.</p><p>“You climbed out a window for my cooking?” Agatha asked knowing there wasn’t an exit door on that side of the cabin.</p><p>“Yes. Yes I did.” Daniel said unashamed as he took another bite.</p><p>“Oh. Okay. I’ll just call Momma right back and let her know you are here.” Rio told her father.</p><p>“Or you could be a great daughter and not.” Daniel said with a grimace.</p><p>“Rita having you call me was a low blow.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“It was, I know. Sorry púrpura. I didn’t want to, she made me.” Daniel explained. Agatha just shrugged and went back to eating her meal. Rio finished her plate and then called her mother back, it rang once before Rita answered.</p><p>“Really Rio?” Rita scolded.</p><p>“Low blow having Papa call Agatha Momma. You know she never ignores him.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“To be fair… you would’ve made her hang up on me.” Rita clarified.</p><p>“She’s not wrong.” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“It’s fine, where is Papa anyway?” Rio asked looking at her father pointedly.</p><p>“Agatha bribed him with dinner so he’s not even here anymore.” Lilia told Rita in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“Rio! You knew where he was.” Rita scolded.</p><p>“Hi honey.” Daniel said meekly.</p><p>“I’ll accept my loss gracefully. Well played Agatha. Only fair that you exploited his weakness after I did the same to you.” Rita said in surrender.</p><p>“If you want to see the ring that bad just come over.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“Really?!” Lilia and Rita ask in unison.</p><p>“Yes, really.” Rio said with a groan and then the phone was disconnected..a few moments later Lilia and Rita stumble through the bedroom door into the living room. Both women rolled their eyes and then a moment later Rita was standing next to her husband and Lilia was next to Rio.</p><p>“Sell out.” Rita scolded her husband who just shoved a bite of food into her mouth to shut her up and prove it was worth selling out for.</p><p>“Fuck. That’s good. Fine, I can’t be mad at you for that.” Rita said after she finished chewing.</p><p>“I should’ve made more.” Agatha said with a sigh before she went back to eating.</p><p>“We will be fine. Now show us the rings!” Lilia said excitedly and Rio rolled her eyes as she stuck her hand out for her mother and Lilia to gawk at.</p><p>“Hope that spell will make the ring grow and shrink because it seems like it’s morphed around your engagement ring.” Rita mused as she looked at the ring. “I don’t want to touch it but I do.”</p><p>“Things I didn’t think of until now.” Agatha said with a sigh. “Go ahead. I’ll mentally prepare myself. Not sure what kind of reaction I’m going to have.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>Rita reached out and tentatively touched the ring while eyeing Agatha who didn’t even seem to flinch.</p><p>“It’s fine. Apparently you are not a threat to our bond. I assume Lilia and Daniel will be the same.” Agatha told the group, then the three adults rushed over to Rio and started gushing over the ring and complimenting Agatha’s taste in unison. Once Agatha was finished eating she got up and headed over to the sink with hers and Rio’s plate before she turned around and watched the family.</p><p>“Have they seen mine?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yours?” Lilia asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“I used the vanishing spell on the box. So no. They haven’t seen it.” Rio explained as Lilia and Rita turned around to look at Agatha’s left hand that was now presented to her. Lilia and Rita both instantly took Agatha’s hand and started complimenting the ring. After a barrage of compliments both women finally settled down.</p><p>“Are you two done?” Daniel asked.</p><p>“Yes. I think we are. Now we have a wedding to plan!” Rita said excitedly.</p><p>“Woah, cool your jets there turbo.” Daniel told Rita.</p><p>“Excuse me? She’s the only daughter I have. I’m helping.” Rita told Daniel, who grabbed her by the arms softly and turned her toward him.</p><p>“Only if they ask. And I have not heard a single ‘Momma, will you help plan my wedding.’ Yet. So cool your jets. I love you. But I have been your life partner for over fifty years. Chill.” Daniel told Rita softly, she then begun to grumble lightly before shaking her head yes.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Alright. Thank you for dinner girls. I’m taking them home now. Come on Lilia. You can get wine drunk on the couch with Rita while looking at bridal magazines or something.” Daniel said as he wrapped an arm around each womens shoulders and guided them back to the portal door.</p><p>“I’m not wearing a white dress!” Rio yelled before her family disappeared bank though the portal.</p><p>“Neither am I. Ew.” Agatha said with a scrunched face.</p><p>“But.” Rio started to say sadly then changed her mind.</p><p>“I was thinking a light lavender, like the color of the sundress I wore on our first date.” Agatha suggested.</p><p>“Oh, okay I do like the sound of that.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Problems for a later date. We still have so much more to do before we get that far. Like move.” Agatha explained as she started taking care of the leftovers.</p><p>“That is a bigger priority. I wonder if the moving company Tony and Pepper used for your mother’s house would be opposed to using a portal door.”</p><p>“I doubt they would be. But it won’t hurt to ask. I’ll ask after court tomorrow. I’m taking Friday off so if they don’t object I can be home all day while they move. Gotta make Rowen their chocolate cake.”</p><p>“Stop spoiling them.” Rio huffed out softly. Not really meaning her words.</p><p>“I like Sage and Rowen. They are good kids. They just need to get their heads out of their asses.” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“It’s like watching the longest slow burn in the history of slow burns!” Rio lamented.</p><p>“Do you think Lilia did this on purpose? Sent you these two? Because goddesses above they are so dense.” Agatha said as she finished cleaning up the kitchen.</p><p>“Probably. She’s always loved playing match maker.” Rio said with a shrug. “Now come on let’s go cuddle and watch our show before bed.”</p><p>“Sounds perfect my love.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s hand and guided her to the living room where they settled on the couch and cuddled into each other.</p><p>~Thursday~</p><p>Agatha and Rio woke up and showered together before getting dressed. Agatha put on a deep purple suit, with a light lavender button up underneath, along with a black tie. Rio was dressed in a pair of comfortable jeans and a soft black band tee. They both made their way out into the kitchen where Agatha started making breakfast while Rio checked her emails to see if she had any online orders overnight.</p><p>Ten minutes later Lily and Wanda walked in the door. “Good morning Ladies.” Wanda said cheerfully before she walked over to the counter and leaned against it while Lily took a seat at the counter with Rio.</p><p>“Good morning. How are you two doing today?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Good morning. Tired. I’ve been working late trying to get my team on track. I might have to fire someone soon.” Lily said as she rubbed her temples.</p><p>“I’m surprised you haven’t yet. Tony gave you permission to clean house.” Agatha said as she finished making breakfast then waved her hand and breakfast was in the table. “Let’s eat, I have court today. So I have to leave early but I wanted to talk to you two.“ Agatha explained as she walked over to the table. Everyone followed suit and sat down in their chairs.</p><p>“About the engagement rings or something else?” Wanda asked as she looked over at her best friend pointedly.</p><p>“I forget that she’s observant when she wants to be.” Rio said with a groan as she started eating breakfast.</p><p>“Yes those, but also these.” Agatha said with a flourish as she presented the red house keys to Wanda.</p><p>“They are done?!” Wanda said in an excited tone.</p><p>“Just finished last night. I took Rio to look at our place and proposed in the library.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“That doesn’t explain the stunning ring on your finger.” Lily said pointing to the ring on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I was planning on proposing after they burn the house down on Saturday at family dinner. I had the ring in my dresser in the cabin.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Agatha beat you to it.” Wanda said with a smirk.</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>“Wait they are burning the house down Saturday?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Yeah the chief called me yesterday. Saturday 10 a.m. be here by 8 a.m. Don’t tell Jen and Alice. I don’t want Jen breathing in all those fumes.” Agatha told them.</p><p>“We will be here. I’ll make sure of it.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you Lily.” Agatha said appreciatively.</p><p>“I’m going to talk to Pepper today about moving services and we are going to start moving stuff tomorrow hopefully.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Is the green house up yet?” Lily asked excitedly.</p><p>“They are still working on that, should be finished by next week but the houses are ready.” Agatha explained as she went back to eating.</p><p>“Sounds good. Rio and I are going to live in that thing.” Lily said with a chuckle.</p><p>“That or my library. I can’t wait to get all my books in there! It’s massive.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright we can daydream at work. Eat your breakfast please.” Agatha requested, and all the women went back to eating. Ten minutes later they were done eating breakfast and all of them were helping clean up before they headed out the door.</p><p>Lily’s phone started ringing and she pulled it out of her pocket to look at it. With a sigh she answered it.</p><p>“Yes?” Lily asked into the phone, then there was a long pause. “I’ll be there as soon as possible. Don’t blow up my lab.” Another long pause. “Put him in a conference room. I’ll deal with it when I arrive. Bye.” Lily said before she hung up.</p><p>“I have to go deal with this. I’m sorry. I love you.” Lily said to the group, before she gave Wanda a kiss and rushed out the door.</p><p>“Bye! Love you!” Wanda said as Lily ran out the door. “Oh he’s totally getting fired today.”</p><p>“Same guy that’s been giving her trouble?” Agatha asked as she finished cleaning the kitchen.</p><p>“Yeah. This is his final one she might just write him up and instantly fire him. He’s been nothing but neglectful; accident after neglectful accident. Fortunately he hasn’t hurt anyone yet. But that might have changed.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“Okay. Well let’s go. I have court. Then I have to talk to Pepper after. I’m not even going into the office, just straight to the court house. Now get out of my house.” Agatha told Wanda as she shoved her toward the door.</p><p>“Okay! I’m going! I’m gunna check the house out tonight with Lily, want to meet us there?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Text the group chat. We will figure something out.” Agatha said before she hugged her best friend then grabbed her briefcase. Before realizing her car was at the other house. “I actually have to use a portal door today. Bye Wanda!” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Bye! I’ll text you guys later.” Wanda said as she rushed out the door and shut it. Rio grabbed Agatha and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“I love you. Have a good day and good luck.” Rio said before she grabbed the closet door that she had established as the bookstore door after she moved out of her apartment.</p><p>“I love you too, have a good day.” Agatha said before she went over to the spare bedroom door and opened it to the new house before heading into the new house and out the door to her car.</p><p>Twenty minutes later Agatha was pulling up in front of the courthouse and parked before heading in. She knew she had today in the bag, she wasn’t worried but she was just ready for this case to be over with. This one kept dragging on for her. She got out of the car and headed into the courthouse.</p><p>She made her way into the courtroom and waited for her client to arrive. She pulled her phone out and looked at the group chat just in case Lily or Wanda had texted.</p><p>Lily 8:40 a.m: I fired him.</p><p>Wanda 8:45 a.m: thank the goddesses.</p><p>Agatha 8:52 a.m: are we meeting at the houses around 6?</p><p>Agatha sent the text and then silenced her phone and tucked it into her briefcase.  Her client walked into the courtroom and took his seat a moment later before the opposition walked into the room. Agatha took a deep calming breath and steeled herself before the judge and jury walked into the courtroom.</p><p>A few hours later the jury had finished their contemplation and they came out and read the verdict. Agatha had won another case and with a bright smile and a breath of relief she turned to look over at her client.</p><p>“Thank you Ms.Harkness.” The man said to her.</p><p>“No problem. Stay away from people like him. All they do is suck you dry.” Agatha said with an irritated tone before she started packing up her stuff.  Once she was finished she headed out of the courtroom and toward the exit.</p><p>Once she was in her car and headed back to the office, she pulled her phone out and called Pepper. It rang once before Pepper picked up. “Congratulations on another win!” Pepper said proudly into the phone.</p><p>“Thanks Pepper. Got time for lunch?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Of course. Got something you wanna talk about?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I proposed to Rio last night.”</p><p>“You better get a photo of the ring from her before you get into the office.” Pepper demanded softly.</p><p>“Yes ma’am. I’ll call her right now. Bye.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Bye.”</p><p>Agatha called Rio and she picked up on the second ring. “Everything alright my love?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Pepper is politely demanding a photo of your ring.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Look at Instagram when you get a chance.”  Rio said softly.</p><p>“Are we keeping our last names or hyphenating?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I think Harkness-Vidal has a nice ring to it.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Our poor children.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“I think they will survive.” Rio reassured. “I love you, check the group chat when you get to work.”</p><p>“I will. I love you too.” Agatha said with a smile. “Have a good day my love.”</p><p>“You as well. Wait! Did you win your case?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Of course I did.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Okay, have a good day.” Rio said with a smile before they hung up. Agatha smiled softly at the thought of Rio putting her last name first.</p><p>“Vidal-Harkness doesn’t sound too bad either” she mused to herself as she continued to drive. Ten minutes later she pulled into the parking lot. She parked and headed into the building. She pulled her phone out and sent Tricia a text letting her know that she was having lunch with Pepper before she headed up to Pepper’s office.</p><p>Timothy nodded politely as she walked by. Agatha pulled her phone out and pulled up Vidal Books Instagram, the last photo was of Rio’s left hand resting on hers and Agatha’s spell books with the caption. “The love of my life proposed last night.” With Agatha tagged, she liked the post and then headed into the office.</p><p>“Tell me everything!” Pepper said standing up excitedly. Agatha smiled softly at Pepper before she handed her the phone. Pepper took it quickly and looked at the ring. “That is gorgeous, did the rings merge together?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“Yes they did, I got a call from the contractor yesterday after I talked to you and the house is finished so I took her to see it after work and proposed to her in the library. Then we went back to our place and I started cooking dinner. She planned on proposing after Evanora’s house was burned down at family dinner on Saturday.” Agatha explained as she held her hand out for Pepper to look at.</p><p>“Gorgeous, and it suits you so well.” Pepper complimented before continuing. “But I’m not touching your hand.”</p><p>“Good idea.” Agatha said with a smile as Pepper handed Agatha her phone back. Timothy walked in a moment later and set down two take out containers, plastic wear, and two drinks before silently walking out.</p><p>“Thank you!” Agatha said before the door shut.</p><p>“I may have had a pregnancy induced hormonal rage fit this morning and he’s afraid to speak to me.” Pepper said meekly.</p><p>“Yeah not looking forward to that in the future. I’ll talk to Jen about hormone balancing potions. She’s been quite reasonable.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Will you? Tony is terrified of me sometimes. I’d appreciate it.” Pepper said before she opened her food and started eating.</p><p>“Only if you send me the moving company you used for Evanora’s items so I can ask if they’d be okay with helping move things through a magical portal.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I can send you that right now.” Pepper said as she grabbed her phone and searched for a second before typing and hitting send. Agatha’s phone pinged a moment later and she smiled softly at Pepper before she opened her own container and started eating.</p><p>“Oh I’m taking tomorrow off. I want to start moving, and I have to bake Rowen a cake. They said they wanted one as payment for having to work Saturday.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Only if I get a dessert cup.”</p><p>“Of course. Gotta take care of Morgan.” Agatha said with a smile as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>“Thank you. I look forward to some amazing chocolate cake.” Pepper said with a smile.  Agatha and her settled into a comfortable silence as they ate their lunch.</p><p>“Thank you for lunch Pepper, try to be nice to Timothy. Take it out on Tony, he did this to you.” Agatha said with a smirk as she stood up and headed toward the door.</p><p>“Tony is already afraid in his own home.” Pepper said with a laugh.</p><p>“Good, he should be.” Agatha said with a laugh as she walked out the door as soon as it shut she turned and looked at Timothy. “If she becomes too unreasonable or too much call me. I can handle her at her worst.” Agatha reassured the young man who looked sad.</p><p>“Thank you.” He said softly, Agatha smiled softly at him and headed back down to her office to get things ready for next week before she left for the weekend. She made her way to the elevator and pressed the down button. She made her way to her office after stepping off the elevator and Tricia stood up to greet her.</p><p>“Gossip is that the new bookstore owner in town posted on their Instagram that they were engaged.” Tricia said with a smile.</p><p>“I proposed last night.” Agatha said with a smile. “But she also had a ring for me.” Agatha said as she put her left hand out for Tricia to look at.</p><p>“Stunning! You both have immaculate taste and know each other so well.” Tricia complimented.</p><p>“Thank you, I have a few things I need to finish before tonight. Taking tomorrow and the weekend off, to get things sorted out.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Sounds good. Thank you.” Tricia said with a smile. Agatha made her way into her office and started working. Around 3:30 p.m. she realized that she hadn’t checked the group chat.</p><p>Lily 10:05 a.m: 6 works for me. But I’m not having a great day.</p><p>Wanda 10:06 a.m: I’m sorry babe.</p><p>Rio 10:06 a.m: I’m sorry Lily, but he deserved to be fired. Don’t let it bother you much.</p><p>Lily 10:07 a.m: I fired two people, I feel bad is all.</p><p>Rio 10:08 a.m: ope. Okay. Well we will take care of that tonight.</p><p>Agatha 3:40 p.m: Anything I can do to help?</p><p>Lily 3:41 p.m: no :(</p><p>“Oh, she’s really upset.” Agatha said softly before she pulled Wanda’s contact up and hit call. It literally rang once before Wanda answered.</p><p>“I know, she’s upset. She’s been texting me all day.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“You get the spring rolls, I’ll get the snacks. We can have a picnic on the floor in the living room of your new house.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“Crab Rangoons, spring rolls, actual food. You get the soda and chocolate.” Wanda told her.</p><p>“Can do. I’m leaving work at 4:30 so I can set up the living room.” Agatha told Wanda.</p><p>“Got it, thank you! I love you and I appreciate you.” Wanda said before she hung up. Agatha finished her work for the day and collected her things before she walked out of her office.</p><p>“I have something I have to attend to, have a good rest of your day Tricia.” Agatha said to her secretary.</p><p>“You as well Ma’am.” Tricia said politely as Agatha walked past. Agatha made her way to the elevator and down to the lobby before she used her connection to talk to Rio.</p><p>‘I’m going to get a few things set up at the new house for tonight. Wanda’s getting Chinese, I’m getting sodas and chocolate and setting up the living room so we can all cuddle in a pile so Lily can feel better.’ Agatha told her.</p><p>‘Sounds great. Do you need help? Can have Sage watch the store until close. Then pop back in and lock up after.’ Rio offered.</p><p>‘Meet me in our living room in 20?’ Agatha asked</p><p>‘Of course.’ Rio answered</p><p>‘Thank you.’ Agatha said appreciatively. Before she got in her car and headed to the store to buy what she needed. Once she was finished shopping she headed to the property with their houses on it and got out to see the men building the green house still. Agatha made her way into the house and set everything on the counter before walking over to the portal door.</p><p>She opened it to see Rio collecting things in the living room. And putting them in a big pile. Agatha stepped through and smiled at Rio. “Do you think we can shove the guest bed mattress through the door?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Possibly. But I do have an air mattress.” Agatha said as she walked over to the hall closet and grabbed the large box out of it.</p><p>“Perfect. Let’s get it set up in the corner and all of us can pile on that and eat dinner and be in a big cuddle puddle.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“Lily loves her platonic cuddles. So I think that’s a great idea.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“I’ll go collect some more blankets.” Rio said as Agatha dragged the king sized air mattress into the other house and got it out of the box. She set it up and let it inflate while she started moving stuff into the house. Once she was done she pulled her phone out and called the movers Pepper recommended. It rang a couple times before someone answered.</p><p>“Thank you for calling Galactic Movers, how may I assist you today?” A woman asked.</p><p>“I have a question.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Ask away ma’am.”</p><p>“I’m a witch and I have established a portal from my old house to my new place. Would your movers be willing to move things through a portal?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes we can do that, do you have a friend who referred you?” The woman asked.</p><p>“Pepper Potts and Tony Stark.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Do you also want the priority package?” The woman asked.</p><p>“Yes. If we could get everything moved tomorrow for me I’d greatly appreciate it. I actually have two homes that need moved but only one tomorrow.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“What time would you like a team to arrive?”</p><p>“9 a.m. if possible.” Agatha requested.</p><p>“That is entirely doable. The last home we did for them took 6 hours with our team. Is cost an issue?”</p><p>“Not at all.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Perfect can I have your email to send you the quote?” The woman asked.</p><p>“<a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c1d3b3d28343d72143d2e3732392f2f1c2f283d2e37303d2b723f3331" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Thank you, fill out the paper work and accept the quote and a team will be at the house first thing in the morning.” The woman told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll fill it out now.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Seeing as no moving truck is needed it will be less expensive than usual. So we can save you some money.” The woman told Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you so much! Have a good night.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“You as well.” The woman answered before hanging up.</p><p>“Okay, the movers are willing to move things through the portal door.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Great. I don’t want to use magic to teleport everything.” Rio said with a sigh as she plopped down on the couch. Agatha smiled at her and sat down next to her before opening her email and filling everything out. She paid the fee right then and there and then looked at the time.</p><p>“You gotta go lock up and I gotta go greet Lily and Wanda. I’ll see you in a minute.” Agatha said with a smile before she kissed Rio softly.</p><p>“I’m going. I’m going.” Rio said with a sigh as she got up and headed toward the door with the portal for the bookstore. Agatha got up and started making the air mattress up and getting everything taken care of. She heard Wanda’s car pull in the driveway after she finished and she headed outside to get her.</p><p>“We set up a cuddle space in here because I haven’t established a portal in your house yet. Come on in.” Agatha yelled.</p><p>“Perfect, I’ll text her and tell her to come right into the house.” Wanda said as she carried everything into the house. She set the brown bags on the countertop. Wanda then pulled her phone out and sent a text to Lily.</p><p>“I called the movers they are willing to move the houses through the portal door. So once we are moved in I’ll establish a door at your place for your house and have them start moving your stuff.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“I appreciate that, but are you ever going to let me pay for anything?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Nope, it’s funnier to me that I’m buying you this with her money.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“The only reason I agreed to this.” Wanda said with a sigh before Lily opened the front door. She looked over at Wanda and Agatha with tear filled eyes.</p><p>“Oh, that bad?” Agatha asked softly. Lily shook her head yes and then broke down. Wanda scooped the smaller woman into her arms and guided her over to the mattress in the living area before they sat down.</p><p>Rio rushed in through the portal door a moment later and looked over at the women. “Oh, that bad.” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha whispered. “Come on let’s go take care of her.” Agatha told Rio as she took her hand and they all climbed into the bed and pulled Lily into a cuddle puddle. Wanda was leaning against the wall with Lily in her arms, Rio plopped down and threw her legs over Lily’s before Agatha sat next to her and threw her arm over Wanda’s.</p><p>“We are right here.” Rio reassured as she took Lily’s hand, Lily almost instantly stopped crying when she realized she was surrounded.</p><p>“Not the tactical cuddle puddle!” Lily whined before sniffling.</p><p>“Yes. The tactical cuddle puddle.” Agatha said softly before hugging Lily tightly.</p><p>“Rude you trapped me!” Lily scolded.</p><p>“Shhh just accept your fate.” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“Unfair.” Lily complained.</p><p>“Plenty fair. It’s your turn to feel loved.” Agatha reassured. “Now we are going to cuddle and then Wanda got Chinese.” Agatha told the woman. Lily sighed and just let it happen.</p><p>Thirty minutes later Lily started to wiggle. “Okay I’m hungry. I didn’t eat lunch because I was so upset.” Lily said in a frustrated tone. Agatha waved her hand and instantly the food was on the air mattress and unpacked and warmed to perfection.</p><p>The women all started eating their dinner while cuddled up with Lily, and once they were finished the food was packed up and put in the fridge with a little extra magic.</p><p>“Do you want to go check out your new house or do you want to cuddle some more?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Let’s go check it out.” Lily said with a smile.</p>

<p>Friday morning and afternoon came and went with ease, the movers had the house completely boxed up and moved into the new home by 4:30. Fortunately they let Agatha finish baking and decorating the cake before they started packing the kitchen up. As soon as she was finished, Agatha got the cake into the box and delivered it to the bookstore personally to Rowen. Then right after the movers left she magicked a cake parfait to Pepper.</p><p>Her phone rang the second the parfait hit Peppers desk. “Yes Pepper?” Agatha asked as she answered the phone.</p><p>“Morgan says “I love you Agatha.” And I agree with her.” Pepper said as she took a bite of the parfait.</p><p>“Love you too Pepper. Now be nice to Timothy.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“I’ve been nice today!” Pepper said in an exasperated tone.</p><p>“I know, but he looked scared yesterday.” Agatha explained. “The movers are done. So we will be spending our first night in the new house tonight. Then we get to go watch the hellhole burn down tomorrow.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Maybe you should go get portals established in Wanda’s house so the movers can start moving things tonight. Then have them stay the night with you two so you can leave right away in the morning.” Pepper suggested.</p><p>“I gotta call Wanda and ask her.”</p><p>“Well get to it! I’m gunna go eat the rest of this.” Pepper said excitedly.</p><p>“Bye Pepper.” Agatha said into the phone.</p><p>“Bye! Thank you again!” Pepper answered before hanging up. Agatha pulled her phone away and called Wanda. The phone rang once before Wanda picked up.</p><p>“What’s up?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Wanna stay at the new house tonight and I can have the movers start moving your stuff tonight and by morning it will be done or do you want to do it Sunday?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“We can stay there tonight to make leaving easier in the morning but Lily will want to be present for moving all of her things. You know how she is.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Yeah I do. That’s fine we can set up portal doors tomorrow night when we get back. Rio is going to have to make a new one to the cabin.” Agatha explained.</p><p>‘Where am I going tonight?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘Come home then we will go to the new house. I’m still here. On the phone with Wanda at the moment. Talking about them staying the night in the new house with us and we all leave from there in the morning.’</p><p>“Did I lose you?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“No Rio was talking to me in my mind. Sorry. What did you say?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I said that’s fine. Where’s your car?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“At the new house.” Agatha answered her.</p><p>“So Lily and I will walk over and we can take the portal to the new house after work. I’m almost home so I’ll start packing a bag. Do you two want help unpacking?”</p><p>“I had the movers put everything in specific rooms so every thing is where it belongs, just needs unpacked. Which a little magic will help with that.” Agatha explained as she walked around the empty house. There was nothing left.</p><p>“We can help unpack. Don’t need a flare up. You are walking around your place lost aren’t you?” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“Of course I am! It’s so empty. I have nothing to sit on.” Agatha told Wanda.</p><p>“I know I can see you in the window.” Wanda joked.</p><p>“Go pack a bag. I want to go sit on my couch.” Agatha scolded before hanging up.</p><p>Wanda 5:45 p.m: Rude!</p><p>‘Off the phone?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘Yes my love. I think I’m going to grab a kitchen chair so I have something to sit on.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>‘Go wait at the other house? Come here for 15 minutes? Go over to Wanda’s and be annoying to her for once?’ Rio offered.</p><p>‘That last suggestion is a great idea my love.’ Agatha said as she walked out the front door and charged over to Wanda’s house. She swung the door open loudly.</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Wanda yelled.</p><p>“My turn to barge into your house loudly!” Agatha yelled back. Which caused Wanda to burst out laughing.</p><p>“That works!” Wanda finally said from her bedroom. A few minutes later Lily walked through the still open door.</p><p>“Why is the front door open?” Lily asked loudly into the house.</p><p>“Because I decided to pull a Wanda!” Agatha hollered from the living room.</p><p>“That… actually makes sense. No furniture at your house?” Lily asked as she walked into the living room.</p><p>“None.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“Okay, what’s Wanda doing?” Lily asked.</p><p>“I was packing a bag for us so we could stay at Agatha’s place tonight. That way we could all just leave from there in the morning seeing as her car is there.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Let me see the outfit you packed me.” Lily said as she tried to look in the bag.</p><p>“I didn’t pack you one. I know better. You go get yourself clothing for tomorrow.” Wanda said as she handed Lily the bag.</p><p>“You are learning.” Lily complimented before heading upstairs to pack some clothing into the bag.</p><p>“Someone else has trained you.” Agatha said smugly in a sing-song tone.</p><p>“Shut up.” Wanda said flatly, she wasn’t even in the mood to argue.</p><p>“Don’t worry, a little boy will have you trained here soon enough as well.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Don’t remind me. Lily wants kids soon. I get why, but still. I haven’t even looked for an engagement ring yet.” Wanda whispered.</p><p>“We can go shopping later if you want help.” Agatha offered.</p><p>“No, you just got engaged. I’m going to let you enjoy that for a minute.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“No proposing at my wedding.” Agatha told Wanda leaving no room for argument.</p><p>“I can’t wait that long! I just don’t know what kind of ring she’d like.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Ask her? See if she’s got something specific in mind? Or you two could go together? No shame in letting your partner pick out their own ring, especially Lily.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Especially me, what?” Lily asked walking down the stairs. Wanda glared at Agatha for a long moment before she looked over at Lily.</p><p>“Agatha was suggesting I let you pick out your own engagement ring when we get that far.” Wanda admitted honestly.</p><p>“I have like seven links I can send you right now of what I like if it would make it easier on you? I didn’t know you wanted to propose so I’ve just been letting you set the pace. I’m not in a rush though. Or we can go together if you want. But I wouldn’t mind this one thing being a surprise.” Lily explained.</p><p>“Yes, please send me the links. I won’t buy any specific one but I need ideas.” Wanda requested as Agatha got up off the couch and walked over to them.</p><p>“Come on, Rio’s probably waiting for us.” Agatha said before walking out the door. Wanda and Lily followed her out the door before Wanda turned and locked the door. Then they made their way next door.</p><p>‘Just got home.’ Rio said as they walked up the steps. Agatha opened the door and smiled at Rio who was leaning against the closet door she just came out of.</p><p>“Hello my love, ready to spend our first night in our new home?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes. I’m even more ready to see that house burn to the ground tomorrow.” Rio said with a smile as they walked over to the portal door to the new house. Rio opened it for the women and they all filed into the house.</p><p>Moving boxes were stacked up in the kitchen and living room. Agatha sighed because she knew she’d have to unpack everything but thankfully Rio’s books were upstairs already.</p><p>“They are efficient.” Rio said as she looked around the house.</p><p>“Extremely. It was impressive to watch really.” Agatha said as Wanda and Lily walked over to the couch and sat down. Agatha looked at Rio and sighed. “We probably should head upstairs and unpack the bedrooms so we actually have a place to sleep tonight.”</p><p>“Oh we can help, we just didn’t know where you wanted to start.” Lily said as she stood up.</p><p>“You don’t have to. But it would be greatly appreciated.” Rio told them.</p><p>“I’m gunna start with our bedroom, then move to the guest room. If I use magic it’s going to take a lot of energy but I think I can manage it.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Or how about we don’t do magical burn out  this week.” Wanda said in a slightly panicked tone as she stood up.</p><p>“I’ll be fine.” Agatha told Wanda, who walked over and grabbed her by her shoulders and looked her dead in the eyes.</p><p>“No.” Wanda said pointedly. Agatha sighed and rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha huffed out as she wiggled free and headed for the stairs. Wanda was hot on Agatha’s heels, leaving Rio and Lily in the living room.</p><p>“Do you feel like you missed something? Because I feel like I missed something.” Lily asked Rio.</p><p>“We definitely did.” Rio told Lily before she started heading toward the stairs. “Babe! What was that about?” Rio yelled as she walked up the stairs with Lily.</p><p>“That was about the fact that the last time someone used too much magic in one day we had to deal with flare ups.” Wanda scolded loudly as she followed Agatha.</p><p>“Your hair was only green temporarily!” Agatha yelled back as she made her way toward the bedroom. Wanda was following closely along with Lily and Rio.</p><p>“How long is temporarily?” Rio asked in a mirth filled tone. Lily was trying to hold in a scoff of laughter.</p><p>“A week! I had to explain to my ex that ‘no I’m not having a mental breakdown, my bestfriend just decided that she wanted to push herself. And I’m suffering the repercussions of that.’ He broke up with me because he couldn’t stand the electric green hair.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“He sucked! You’re welcome!” Agatha yelled as the rest of the women filed into the bedroom. Agatha was manually unpacking a box onto the bed.</p><p>“Arguably the best thing that ever happened to you if he was your last boyfriend.” Lily chimed in.</p><p>“He was.” Agatha said with a sigh as she took the clothing that was still on hangers and walked into the closet and hung them up.</p><p>“Why electric green?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Who knows, magical flare ups are so weird sometimes. I’m just glad I didn’t end up with animal ears or a tail. For Agatha with her magical flare ups it can manifest in weird ways. I mean it rarely happens to her because she’s so powerful. I don’t even know if it would happen again. But I’m not risking it!” Wanda yelled the last part toward the closet her best friend was in.</p><p>“I’m sorry I turned your hair green on accident. I’m not sorry he dumped you.” Agatha said as she walked back out into the  bedroom.</p><p>“How hard did you push yourself?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Too hard. Honestly much harder than I would by putting everything away.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“What did you do? I can’t even imagine a thing that would cause you to use that much magical energy.” Lily asked.</p><p>“It was when I established the protection spells at work in my office, the entrance’s at Stark Law and at the courthouse. All in one day. The spells worked just fine and are fully established, my punishment was flare ups for a few days. My hair was basically a bad perm from the 80’s, Wanda got too close at one point and ended up with green hair.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Among several other issues.” Wanda clarified in an irritated tone.</p><p>“Agatha will never have a magical flare up like that again Wanda. She’s much too powerful for that nonsense now.” Gaia said popping into the bedroom. Causing Wanda jump and clutch her chest in shock, Lily also jumped in surprise. Agatha and Rio seemed unfazed by Gaia’s arrival.</p><p>“Jeeze! A warning next time!” Wanda said in a shocked tone.</p><p>“I forget that you two aren’t in tune with my arrival’s like Rio and Agatha are.”</p><p>“Yes Goddess! Some of us aren’t deity’s in training.” Wanda said with a laugh before she calmed down.</p><p>“What do you mean I don’t have to worry about magical flare ups?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Give it a shot, if you have a flare up, Momma will be right here to keep it under control.”</p><p>“How ambitious am I allowed to be?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Go big or go home baby. Let’s see how strong you are.” Gaia reassured. Then Agatha took a deep breath and centered herself, she started speaking an incantation under her breath before purple magic flared to life in the house and everything started to move and shift. Boxes started to open and things begun to unpack. Once Agatha was done with her incantation she opened her eyes to see things unpacking and putting themselves away.</p><p>“I hope you know I’m going to be asking you where everything is for the next week and a half.” Rio said in awe of the sheer feat of magic Agatha was displaying.</p><p>“Holy shit.” Wanda said in a shocked tone as she watched boxes unpack and fold up before floating down the hall and into the entry way.</p><p>Gaia clapped her hands together giddily as she watched the whole house start to unpack itself. A giggle bubbled at the pride Gaia was feeling for Agatha. “Astonishing! Magnificent witchlett! And look, not a single flare up!” Gaia said proudly.</p><p>“And I don’t even feel tired. Honestly that felt so easy.” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“Easy!? Easy! Easy this woman says! Like she didn’t just accomplish something impossible to most witches!” Wanda said in disbelief.</p><p>“Honestly I don’t know why you are shocked Wanda.” Rio said in a slightly amused tone.</p><p>“You’ve grown so much in the last 6 months! I can’t wait to see how powerful you’ll be by the time you take your place as a goddess.” Gaia complemented.</p><p>“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’m keeping her as long as possible.” Rio told Gaia.</p><p>“Yes. Yes. She will always be yours Rio. Don’t you worry. Now! While the spell works,  why don’t we discuss dinner?” Gaia said with a smile.</p><p>“What do you want Momma?” Agatha asked Gaia.</p><p>“I’m not picky, anything you cook will be amazing.” Gaia complimented.</p><p>“I vote we order something then.” Lily said with a sly smile knowing Gaia would object to that.</p><p>“Not a bad idea Lily.” Agatha agreed with a knowing smile.</p><p>“Wait. That’s not what I meant.” Gaia said sadly.</p><p>“Well if someone told me what she wanted I’d gladly make it.” Agatha told Gaia before she walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>“Fine. If you are going to force me to ask. Can you please make Chicken Alfredo?” Gaia asked following Agatha out of the bedroom with Rio, Lily, and Wanda following behind quickly.</p><p>“Does that sound good girls?” Agatha asked the women following behind them.</p><p>“Yeah, that sounds good.”  Rio agreed.</p><p>“I’m not cooking, so I’m not complaining.” Lily said as she followed the women.</p><p>“I’ll eat whatever you put in front of me.” Wanda answered.</p><p>“Now I just have to see if I have the ingredients for it.” Agatha said to the group.</p><p>“If you are missing anything, I think Gaia can handle that.” Rio joked as they all made their way down to the kitchen.</p><p>“I should’ve ordered more bar stools. The island has enough room for all of you to sit at it while I cook, but I only ever had room for two.” Agatha said with a sigh as she willed a pot out of the cupboard and started digging in the fridge for items.</p><p>“Looks like I need more chicken, and heavy cream.” Agatha said as she put stuff in the countertop. A moment later a pack of chicken and a quart of heavy cream appeared on the countertop. “Thank you Momma.” Agatha said appreciatively.</p><p>Forty minutes later dinner was served at the table and they were all eating in relative silence before Gaia spoke up. “I hate that I cannot physically be there for you tomorrow witchlett.”</p><p>“It’s fine. No need to cause a ruckus for me.” Agatha told Gaia, who was taking a large bite of the pasta.</p><p>“Plus, I think the Salem Seven… six? Six. Are still terrified of you. So they won’t pull anything tomorrow, I hope.” Wanda mentions before taking a bite of her food.</p><p>“I’ll send them a little reminder to leave my child alone tomorrow, right now.” Gaia said with a smile before she waved her free hand. The other was still holding a fork, that had another bite of food on it.</p><p>“What did you just do?” Lily asked before she took a drink of wine.</p><p>“Send them each a card with a little reminder to leave Agatha alone, if they bother her tomorrow I will know.” Gaia told the group of women, then continued eating.</p><p>“Thank you, that’s very reassuring. I’m just glad I will never have to see that hellhole ever again after tomorrow.” Agatha told Gaia.</p><p>“Tomorrow should be fairly therapeutic for you two.” Gaia explained while pointing at Wanda and Agatha.</p><p>“Why me?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You’ll see tomorrow.” Gaia told Wanda.</p><p>“That’s not ominous, not at all.” Lily said with an eye roll.</p><p>“I forgot how sassy I made you.” Gaia sassed back to Lily. Who jokingly scowled at Gaia before she went back to eating. The rest of the women at the table decided they wanted to eat before their food got cold.</p><p>Once they were finished eating Wanda and Lily shooed Agatha over to a barstool while they cleaned the kitchen for her. “You’ve found an amazing coven and family witchlett. I’m so very proud of you and the witch you are becoming.” Gaia complimented Agatha softly, not saying it loud enough for Wanda and Lily to hear over the running water.</p><p>“Stop, I’ll cry.” Agatha whispered softly as Gaia gave Agatha a hug and a kiss on the crown of her head. Gaia then pulled back and looked down at Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“I never got to see the ring Rio gave you. May I?” Gaia asked while holding her hands out for Agatha to place her hand in. Agatha placed her left hand in Gaia’s. “Oh it’s stunning! Rio you did a fantastic job.”</p><p>“Thank you, I’m just disappointed someone beat me to the punch.” Rio teased Agatha.</p><p>“You will live.” Agatha responded with a soft smile.</p><p>“I love you girls. But it’s time for me to go and you four to go to bed. Or at least start winding down. Have a good night.” Gaia announced after she softly squeezed Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Goodnight Gaia.” Wanda and Lily said in unison.</p><p>“Night Momma. I’ll call if I need you.” Agatha promised.</p><p>“Goodnight Gaia. Thanks for the compliment.” Rio said before Gaia disappeared. Wanda and Lily finished cleaning the kitchen and putting dishes away before they turned around and looked at Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked the two women.</p><p>“Magical check in? How you feeling?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Like I could teleport to Boston and back several times and still have magic left to spare.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Okay good, because if I wake up with funky colored hair tomorrow. I’m fist fighting you.” Wanda told Agatha.</p><p>“I could change it now if you want? How about pink this time?” Agatha joked while wiggling her fingers in Wanda’s direction.</p><p>“Quit antagonizing each other.” Rio scolded them softly, knowing they could and would actually fight about this.</p><p>“It’s all in good fun. Plus we have 16 acres we could fight on now.” Wanda said with a smirk.</p><p>“Nope, nipping that in the butt right now. Behave.” Lily said as she took Wanda’s hand and kept her rooted in place.</p><p>“You two are absolutely no fun.” Wanda said sadly.</p><p>“I think we are plenty fun, and if you want me to keep being fun. You won’t start a fight  with Agatha.” Lily scolded softly, causing Agatha and Rio to go wide eyed.</p><p>“No fair, using our sex life against me. Rude.” Wanda grumbled as she turned and walked toward the living room and plopped herself down on the couch.</p><p>“Thank you Lily.” Rio said appreciatively as she looked over at Wanda sulking on the couch.</p><p>“No problem. Let’s go cuddle and watch tv or something. This week has been exhausting.” Lily suggested, Agatha and Rio got up and they all made their way to the couch and plopped down on and around Wanda. Lily threw herself into Wanda’s lap, Agatha and Rio settled against each other next to the other two women. Agatha willed the remote into her hand and handed it to Wanda.</p><p>“Here you can pick what we are watching.” Agatha offered. Wanda pulled up ‘nailed it.’ And pressed play.</p><p>“God this show is so chaotic.” Rio said before she rolled her eyes and they started watching the baking competition.</p><p>A few shows later the women could feel themselves getting tired. Agatha was trying to hold back yawns. “Alright, time for bed.” Agatha told the three women.</p><p>Wanda shut off the tv and they all got up and headed upstairs after making sure the door was locked and everything was put away. Agatha hugged Wanda in the hall way outside the guest bedroom while Rio hugged Lily. Then they switched with each other, before heading off to bed.</p><p>~Saturday Morning~</p><p>Agatha got up first and started making breakfast for them. The smell of coffee and bacon rousing the rest of the house from their slumber. Rio, Wanda and Lily all came downstairs fully dressed and ready for the day by 7:45. Agatha smiled brightly at the women.</p><p>“Good morning sleepy heads. I made breakfast sandwich’s and to go coffees.” Agatha said with a bright smile.</p><p>“Do we have lawn chairs to sit in while we watch the hell hole burn down?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“No. But if we leave now we can stop and grab some.” Agatha told Wanda.</p><p>“Let me just go run to the cabin and grab some out of the closet. I think we have four.” Rio offered</p><p>“If you go to the cabin your mom’s going to want to come and we don’t have time for all that.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“True. Alright stopping at the store it is.” Rio said as she grabbed her coffee cup and a sandwich. Lily, and Wanda grabbed theirs as well and they headed out the door. They all piled into the car and got rolling toward their destination.</p><p>One quick stop to grab chairs and an hour and a half drive later they pulled up to the house. Two fire trucks and an ambulance were sitting in front of the house and a police barrier was put up to keep people who weren’t meant to be there out. Fortunately the fire chief was standing there talking to the officer when they arrived and they were waved through.</p><p>Agatha parked the car and they all got out and grabbed the chairs and set them up where they could watch the house burn. The chief walked over to Agatha and smiled at her. “We are going to start the fire here soon, but we are going to run a couple training sessions first. I hope that’s okay?”</p><p>“The whole reason I donated the place was for training. Take all the time you need. We’ve got all day.” Agatha told him.</p><p>“Thank you for understanding.” He said politely before he turned around and yelled for the crew. “Alright, let’s get started!”</p><p>The next hour was purely training of putting out small house fires for the crew before they got to the main event. The chief grabbed his microphone and spoke clearly. “Alright lady’s and gents. Time for the main event. Contain the fire. That is your one job. Starting in Three! Two! One!” Then there was a loud woosh and the windows of the home shook as the fire spread through the house.</p><p>“What on earth did they do?” Wanda asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Left the gas valve open and let it leak into the house before shutting it off and igniting a spark box.” Rio explained.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Lily asked.</p><p>“I could hear the crew talking about it. Immaculate hearing remember?” Rio offered.</p><p>“Your kids are going to hate you. They will never get away with anything.” Wanda teased.</p><p>“I can turn it off. I just choose not to. Sometimes my plants tell me things as well, most plants in general just talk constantly.”</p><p>“I’m glad I finally learned how to tune them out.” Agatha said with an eye roll.</p><p>“It took me years, it took you a month. Be grateful.” Rio said with a smile before she leaned over and kissed Agatha on the cheek. Then they all turned to watch as the house started to become engulfed in flames.</p><p>Soon the entire home was burning brightly, and Agatha’s smile that spread across her face was one even Wanda had never seen. It was a genuine smile of pure unadulterated joy. Rio looked over at Agatha and noticed the smile as well, but also it seemed like all the tension she was carrying in her body was disappearing as the home burned down.</p><p>A few hours later the home was nothing but a pile of ash and cinders. Agatha looked more relaxed than any of the women in the group had ever seen. It was like all the burdens she was carrying finally lifted off her shoulders. “That was the best bonfire I’ve ever been to.” Agatha joked as she stood up and folded her chair. The rest of them stood up and folded their chairs  before walking over to put them in the trunk of the car.</p><p>“Now I see what Gaia was talking about.” Wanda whispered to herself. She felt like she could finally relax, seeing Agatha like this. The house as a pile of ash behind them was an added bonus to the moment.</p><p>“What was that?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Later. Let’s head home.” Wanda said as she opened the back door of the car and got in.</p><p>“Let me drive babe.” Rio said as she held her hand out for Agatha to hand her the keys. Agatha didn’t even argue, she just handed her the keys. Which even shocked Rio because Agatha always insisted on driving. Once they got into the car and Rio started driving Agatha leaned her head against the window and sighed softly. Every woman in the car had the same thought as they pulled out of the cul-de-sac ’It’s finally over.’</p>

<p>9 months later</p><p>On a beautiful spring day, Agatha and Rio stood in the clearing in front of the cabin and vowed their undying and eternal love for each other. Surrounded by their friends and family, their union was blessed by the goddess Gaia herself.</p><p>Agatha was wearing a lavender wedding dress with deep purple lace embroidery, Rio was in a dark green wedding dress with ivy leaves embroidered along her side and hip. Both women looked absolutely stunning. The wedding was small, simple, and intimate.</p><p>“I the goddess Gaia, am here today to unite two souls in holy matrimony!” Gaia spoke clearly for everyone to hear. Lilia, Rita, Daniel, Jen, Alice, their daughter Alexandria, Tony, Pepper, their daughter Morgan, Lily, Wanda, Pietro, Tricia, Sage, Rowen, Violet and Rosaline were all in attendance.</p><p>“Agatha, do you promise to cherish, love and care for Rio every day for the rest of eternity?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“I do.” Agatha said with a soft smile, her eyes full of love and tenderness as they peered into Rio’s.</p><p>“Rio, do you promise to cherish, love, and care for Agatha every day for the rest of eternity?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“I do.” Rio said full of conviction and love, she felt her heart swell in her chest at the realization she was Agatha’s and Agatha was hers forever more.</p><p>“Now, the hand fasting ceremony.” Gaia said as she presented green and purple ribbons to the two women. Gaia instructed them to hold each others left hands before she started the ceremony.</p><p>“With this ribbon, I bind your souls together.” Gaia spoke as she tied the ribbons around their hands. “I bless this union, this marriage, and these two souls uniting into one!” Gaia spoke clearly before the ribbons flashed bright green and purple and settled on Agatha’s and Rio’s wrists as bracelets.</p><p>Agatha and Rio smiled brightly at each other before pulling each other into an embrace. Rio’s hand coming up to Agatha’s  face.</p><p>“You may kiss the bride!” Gaia announced, Agatha didn’t hesitate for a second, she pulled Rio into a soft passionate kiss. “I present to you, Mrs &amp; Mrs. Harkness-Vidal!”  Gaia announced after they broke the kiss. Both of them smiling brightly as they held each other close and giggled softly as they pressed their foreheads together.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio said softly as she pulled away slightly.</p><p>“I love you.” Agatha responded before she pulled away and took Rio’s hand in hers. They started walking down the aisle and headed toward the reception tent they had set up. Once everyone was seated, conversations started flowing. Agatha and Rio were dragged off by the one photographer to take photos before they had their reception.</p><p>An hour later they were done taking photos and able to mingle with their friends and family. Agatha and Rio were walking from table to table mingling with their friends. Pepper and Tony playing with Morgan as they sat at the table and talked with Tricia,  Lilia, Rita and Daniel.</p><p>“You two look absolutely stunning!” Tony complimented them.</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio and Agatha said in unison.</p><p>“How’s my niece behaving?” Agatha asked as she held her hands out for Morgan who giggled softly as she was handed to Agatha.</p><p>“Perfect little angel as always.” Pepper answered, as Agatha cooed at the child and held her in her arms for a moment before handing her back to her parents.</p><p>“Of course, she’s made out of cake and other sweets.” Rio joked, knowing the last few months of Pepper’s pregnancy had Agatha baking up a storm.</p><p>“She appreciated every bite.” Pepper answered as she looked at the child in her husband’s arms.</p><p>“So did the rest of the office.” Tricia commented, knowing Agatha’s baking was the only thing that kept half of them employed and the other half alive. Pepper softly glared at Tricia but let it go, knowing she was right.</p><p>“When will you two be giving me my first grandbaby?” Rita asked as she looked over at the adorable child in her father’s arms.</p><p>“Momma! We literally just got married an hour ago.” Rio scolded her mother.</p><p>“You’ve got a whole two week honey moon!” Rita told Rio.</p><p>“And we are moving on. Pepper, keep Gaia away from Rita please.” Agatha requested before they moved onto a different table.</p><p>“I can’t promise that!” Pepper hollered to them as they walked away. They made their way over to the table Wanda, Lily, Jen, Alice, their daughter Alexandria, Pietro, Sage and Rowen were sitting at.</p><p>“Finally. I thought I was going to die before you two got married.” Pietro joked.</p><p>“Oh really? When are you gunna settle down zippy?” Rio joked.</p><p>“Uh. I… I think I’m needed somewhere else.” Pietro said before leaving the table.</p><p>“Chickenshit!” Agatha and Wanda yelled.</p><p>“The wedding was beautiful! Thank you for inviting us.” Rowen told them.</p><p>“Thank you, I’m glad you two could make it.”</p><p>‘Time for the intervention?’ Rio asked in her mind.</p><p>‘Sure.’ Agatha answered.</p><p>“So when were you two going to tell us you’ve been dating?” Agatha asked Rowen and Sage. Both of them paused and looked at each other with wide eyes.</p><p>“Uh. What?” Sage asked, her voice coming out as a high pitched squeak.</p><p>“No point in hiding it anymore babe.” Rowen told their partner. Sage looked at them with a pleading look.</p><p>“We’ve known for months. We just figured we’d let you two decide when you wanted to tell us but it’s been 5 months.” Rio explained.</p><p>“How did you know?” Sage asked.</p><p>“We aren’t blind, and you forget who my Aunt is. She set this whole thing up I’m sure. She knew you two were meant to be together before I even hired you.” Rio said honestly before Lilia walked over to the table.</p><p>“Now Rio, you put too much stock into such things.” Lilia teased, knowing that was exactly what she did.</p><p>“No, I know you. You did this on purpose.” Rio scolded softly.</p><p>“I second that, Lilia you like playing match maker.” Agatha mentioned.</p><p>“Well, you can’t prove anything.” Lilia said with a shrug before walking away from the table, but not before winking at Rio.</p><p>“You aren’t mad we hid it?” Rowen asked Rio, afraid their boss would be angry with them.</p><p>“Mad? No. You two sucked at hiding it though.” Rio clarified.</p><p>“Really sucked.” Wanda added.</p><p>“Like, really really sucked.” Lily tacked on, adding insult to injury.</p><p>“Wait, you knew?!” Sage asked Wanda.</p><p>“I’m a therapist. I know literally all the signs of a new and developing relationship. Also I have eyeballs.” Wanda clarified.</p><p>“Literally the only people you were hiding your relationship from was each other. Because we all knew.” Lily mentioned.</p><p>“I figured it out after the first visit to the book store after Alexandria was born.” Jen mentioned.</p><p>“Speaking of which. Gimmie.” Agatha said as she held her arms out for her other niece. Jen softly chuckled before handing the sleeping six month old to Agatha.</p><p>“She’s so cute.” Agatha said softly as she looked down at the adorable half Asian half black baby in her arms.</p><p>“Honestly. She’s even cuter than I expected. I was an ugly baby.” Alice to the group.</p><p>“You know what you must do for me now Jen, right?” Agatha asked her friend who was already on her phone</p><p>“Oh, I’m texting Lorna right now.”  Jen said as she typed and hit send.</p><p>“Hey! Jennifer, No!” Alice scolded.</p><p>“You opened this can of worms.” Agatha reminded. “And you are an adorable little miracle. I’m so glad I touched your mommies’ rings. You little blessing.” Agatha said softly as she brushed some black hair off Alexandria’s brow.</p><p>“Yes, actually. Thank you for that. Even if she’s an only child, she’ll have plenty of friends to play with.” Jen said with a soft smile as she looked at the infant in Agatha’s arms. Agatha looked so maternal, she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>“Oh my gods and goddesses, why is everyone so pushy about babies today?” Agatha asked before she smiled softly at Alexandria fussing in her arms. “Oh, seems like someone realized I wasn’t her mom. Back to your parents you go.” Agatha said as she handed her back to Jen.</p><p>“Because you’ll be a fantastic mom one day.” Alice said without flinching, not realizing the impact those words even had. Then she continued her assault with her next compliment. “You are so fantastic with Alexandria and Morgan, I have no doubt about it.”</p><p>‘Get me away from my friends before I start crying.’ Agatha pleaded in Rio’s mind.</p><p>“Let’s go talk to Violet and Rosaline before they have to leave. Violet’s getting antsy.” Rio said as she softly before turning to the group. “We will be back around in a bit.”</p><p>Rio dragged Agatha over to the table where Gaia, Violet and Rosaline were sitting at. “I can tell you are getting antsy Vi, go. I’ll watch over Rose.” Gaia said as they walked up.</p><p>“I was waiting for the girls, I didn’t want to be rude.” Violet scolded Gaia before looking up at Agatha and Rio. “Hi! You two look absolutely fantastic!”</p><p>“Go Violet. We will see you soon. You’ve got a job to do.” Rio reassured. Then Violet was gone.</p><p>“You know that tug you feel when you pull on your bond?” Rosaline asked.</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Like that but worse. I was worried she’d split in half for a second there. She never ignores it that long.” Rosaline explained.</p><p>“We would have understood.” Rio reassured.</p><p>“We told her that. She’s just stubborn.” Gaia said as she stood up and pulled both women into a hug.</p><p>“Oh we know.” Rio said with a laugh.</p><p>“So what’s this I hear about grandbabies?” Gaia teased.</p><p>“Go hold Morgan or Alexandria if you want a baby fix. I’m not getting pregnant yet. Let me enjoy being married for a couple months.” Agatha told her mother.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Momma, remember you’ve got all of eternity. You can wait a couple months. I promise, they will be worth the wait.” Agatha told Gaia.</p><p>“I already know that, but they are so ready to be your child.” Gaia told Agatha with a sad sigh.</p><p>“Nope, don’t tell me anything. I don’t need to know about tiny souls anxiously waiting for me to have them. No guilt tripping.” Agatha told her mother.</p><p>“Fine! Where are you two going on your honey moon?” Gaia asked, changing the subject.</p><p>“Hawaii, all inclusive resort for the first week, then we are going to stop at Disneyland in California before we head home to relax and get our marriage stuff sorted out.” Rio answered.</p><p>“Sounds relaxing and fun. When does your flight leave?” Rosaline asked.</p><p>“Tomorrow afternoon.” Agatha answered.</p><p>“I’ll personally take care of your plants while you two are gone Rio.” Gaia offered.</p><p>“I’d appreciate that. I was just going to text Lily and tell her what plants needed watered what days. But you will just know.” Rio told Gaia.</p><p>“No need to stress while on your honey moon.” Gaia reassured as Violet popped back into their space.</p><p>“Jeeze. Even when they are already dead some people are just impatient.” Violet said before looking at the two women. “Sorry lovelies. I’m back now. Let’s get this celebration started.”</p><p>“Yes let’s!” Agatha said and with a snap of her fingers, wine glasses were filled and plates of food appeared. Rio and Agatha walked over to their own private little table and sat down to eat while everyone else did the same.</p><p>“Truly one of the most impressive things I’ve see you do.” Rio complimented.</p><p>“What’s that my love?” Agatha asked Rio as she sat down next to her wife.</p><p>“All of this. Manifest everything from nothing.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“It’s gotten easier and easier. Soon I’ll be able to create things we’ve never imaged I’m sure, as long as I keep practicing.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“No, not like that. I meant manifesting all this love from nothing. Every person here loves you for you, just the way you are. You never had that and you just went out and made it for yourself. It’s the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen my love.” Rio corrected herself before softly kissing Agatha on the cheek.</p><p>“Oh, so you are gunna make me cry today?” Agatha asked with tear filled eyes and a watery tone.</p><p>“Only because I’m in such awe of how amazing you are my love.” Rio complimented before she placed her hand on Agatha’s cheek and gave her a small kiss.</p><p>“I love you so much.” Agatha told Rio softly, her voice cracking as she grabbed the hand on her cheek and turned her head to kiss her palm softly. A couple tears spilled out and Agatha quickly wiped them away.</p><p>“I love you more.” Rio answered before they started eating their meal. Once they were finished the two women were placed in front of a small cake to cut for each other. They lovingly cut the cake together before they fed each other small bites. They were so kind and loving as they fed each other, their first dessert as a married couple.</p><p>An hour later they were all gathered around a large bon fire and the real celebration began. Some of them sitting comfortably in chairs drinking wine and spirits as Agatha and Rio danced together around the fire. Music played loudly as others joined. Wanda and Lily were dancing and laughing loudly as they followed Agatha and Rio around the circle. Soon Rita and Daniel joined in on the festivities.</p><p>Eventually every couple was spinning and laughing joyfully as they danced together. Gaia gladly took Morgan from Pepper so she could dance and Lilia was holding Alexandria. The two women sitting together talking softly while the children slept in their arms. Tricia sat next to them and helped with the girls whenever they needed to get up.</p><p>They danced late into the evening and finally collapsed into chairs after the sun had gone down and the fire had dwindled down to embers.</p><p>“One of the best weddings I’ve ever been to!” Tony said as he walked over to Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“Thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed yourself Tony.” Agatha told the man. Pepper was collecting their daughter from Gaia and Lilia.  She walked over a moment later and smiled at the two.</p><p>“Enjoy your honey moon! Thank you for the fantastic evening.” Pepper told the two.</p><p>“Thank you for hopefully placating my mother’s baby fever.” Agatha told Pepper.</p><p>“I think Morgan and Alexandria might have made it worse. You better give that woman a grandchild soon.” Pepper whispered.</p><p>“Do you really want me going on maternity leave in the next year?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No…. But you and Rio will make the cutest babies so I will accept that I will lose you temporarily. Plus our girls need friends.” Pepper told her.</p><p>“I’m taking you two to the portal door and sending you home.” Rio told the two.</p><p>“That’s fine, I’m exhausted. Thank you for the lovely evening.” Pepper said as Rio stood up and guided them over to the portal door.  She opened the door for them and they walked through it before Rio shut it and headed back over to Agatha.</p><p>“Should we kick the rest of them out and head home ourselves?” Rio asked softly as she sat down in Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“Nah let them have fun. Daniel and Rita can send them home if we need. Wanna sneak out of here and go have sex by the waterfall?” Agatha asked as she trailed her fingers up Rio’s neck softly.</p><p>“I thought you’d never ask.” Rio said with a smile before they were teleported to the waterfall several miles deep into the woods, far away from the festivities and music.</p><p>They were laying on a soft pile of blankets and pillows next to the waterfall that Agatha had fallen in love with when they stumbled upon it a few months into their relationship. It was Agatha’s favorite place. She felt so calm here. A soft glow of magical fairy lights  illuminated the soft bed of blankets.</p><p>“Do you want something specific tonight my love?” Rio asked as she magicked their wedding dresses off and into the cabin.</p><p>“You. I just want you.” Agatha said as she pulled Rio closer to her.</p><p>“Do you want to try tonight? I know you said a few months but I’m asking you what you want.” Rio asked.</p><p>“I haven’t decided.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“Then we wait.” Rio offered as she pressed her body against Agatha’s as the woman bit her lip anxiously.</p><p>“But there’s a tiny little soul waiting for us.” Agatha said honestly.</p><p>“They can be patient and let me have their mother all to myself for a little while longer.” Rio said as she kissed the heart sigil on Agatha’s chest before kissing down the  sigils between her breasts and down her stomach. Arousal and desire flooding Agatha as Rio kissed the sigils.</p><p>“You’re right.” Agatha sighed as she spread her legs for Rio.</p><p>“Good girl. Goddesses above you smell divine.” Rio said before she kissed along Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Rio please. I need your tongue.” Agatha softly begged as she tried to slip her hand into Rio’s hair and pull her closer.</p><p>“Is that all you need?” Rio teased as she flicked out her tongue and dragged it along Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Do you want me to sit on your face? Because this is how that happens. You take too long to give me what I want.” Agatha softly scolded.</p><p>“Maybe later, right now I’ve got you exactly where I want you.” Rio said before leaning in and wrapping her mouth around Agatha’s clit. A soft moan escaped Rio at the taste of Agatha’s arousal, as she flicked her tongue over the sensitive bud. ‘Fuck, you always taste so good.’ Rio thought clearly.</p><p>“Yesss.” Agatha hissed out before she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair and pulled her closer. Rio moaned as she started moving her tongue even faster, curling and twisting around Agatha’s clit in the perfect way to bring her to the edge without forcing her over. This caused Agatha to let out a whimper before rolling her hips softly. “Rio, please. Don’t tease me.”</p><p>‘I want to savor you tonight my love. You may be able to handle my tongue for longer but I really want to drink you in.’ Rio husked out in her mind.</p><p>“Goddesses above! Please just one!” Agatha begged as her hips twitched. Rio exhaled in an amused way, before she picked up the pace slightly and finally started thrashing her tongue against Agatha’s clit the way she wanted. Agatha’s moans sounded like music to Rio’s ears as she felt Agathas body shake as she came under her tongue. Rio pulled away slightly and kissed along Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Are you going to be patient now and let me do what I want?” Rio asked Agatha, hoping the woman would let her continue at her leisurely pace.</p><p>“No.” Agatha said breathlessly defiant, her chest rising and falling as she collected herself.</p><p>“No? What do you mean ‘no’ my love?” Rio asked the woman beneath her. Agatha sighed and grabbed Rio before she teleported the woman’s body over hers so she could eat her out while Rio did the same. She reached up and dragged Rio’s hips down to her mouth; kissing and licking softly around Rio’s pussy before she dragged her tongue through her folds. Softly licking and sucking on the sensitive flesh before wrapping her mouth around her clit and flicking over it with her tongue.</p><p>“Fucking unfair, Agatha.” Rio husked out as she dipped her head down and buried her face between her thighs. Both women tried to focus on the task at hand but it turned into a dance of teasing tongues swirling around sensitive clits.</p><p>‘Rio’ Agatha husked out in her mind, Rio felt her arousal double as Agatha flattened her tongue over her clit before swirling it around.</p><p>‘Agatha.’ Rio thought shakily, she was having a hard time thinking clearly while Agatha’s tongue swirled and laved over her clit. She tried to focus on moving her tongue again in a moment of clarity. Agatha moaned loudly into her pussy as she took control for a moment. Her tongue flicking and swirling softly around Agatha’s clit.  Agatha’s tongue paused as Rio took back control.</p><p>‘Unfair.’ Agatha husked in her mind before she focused again and sucked hard on Rio’s clit. Agatha tried to focus as she swirled her tongue wildly over Rio’s clit and she moaned softly against it. She started moving her tongue faster and faster as she felt Rio give up and lean her head against her thigh.</p><p>‘I win.’ Agatha teased as she felt Rio start to shake against her. ‘Cum for me, my love. Cum.’ Agatha demanded as she swirled her tongue around Rio’s clit the perfect way.</p><p>“Oh fuck!” Rio screamed against her thigh before she softly bit down on the tender flesh as she came undone. Rio pulled herself away from Agatha slowly trying to remove herself from the woman’s mouth. Agatha whined softly before she let Rio go, letting her grip on her hips loosen.</p><p>“I wasn’t done eating my dessert!” Agatha complained as Rio turned around and settled in her lap.</p><p>“Neither was I but someone interrupted me.” Rio told Agatha as she slid her hands up to cup Agatha’s breasts so she could massage them softly and tweak her nipples.</p><p>“Mhmmm. Sorry, not sorry.” Agatha told Rio as she arched into her touch.</p><p>“Are you going to let me do what I wanted now?” Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“Why would I do that when I have you right where I want you my love?” Agatha asked before Rio felt the harness press against her core. The toy wasn’t seated in the harness just yet.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio scolded softly, but she could feel her arousal grow. Knowing that all she had to do was magic the toy into the harness and lift her hips to settle on to it.</p><p>“Come on, you know you want it Rio.” Agatha husked out as she trailed her hands over Rio’s body. Caressing and teasing Rio softly before she brought her hand down between Rio’s legs and used her thumb to caress her clit. Rio slid forward onto Agatha’s stomach, before she sighed and magicked the toy into the harness.</p><p>“Do you need the spell?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Wouldn’t hurt.” Rio told Agatha who reached down and pressed three fingers against Rio’s core and spoke an incantation. Rio felt herself grow even wetter than she was a moment ago.</p><p>“I’m so glad you figured out how to fix that spell.” Rio said in a lust filled tone as she scooted down and sunk herself down onto the toy. “Goddess you feel so good.”</p><p>“So do you my love.” Agatha praised as she felt Rio’s heat envelope the toy. Moans slipped from their lips. Rio leaned forward and kissed Agatha passionately as she started to grind on her lap. Agatha’s hips were rolling softly to meet Rio’s.</p><p>“Agatha. Fuck, I love you.” Rio groaned out as she pressed her hips into Agatha’s, sliding the toy fully into her.</p><p>“I love you so much.” Agatha husked before she teleported them into a different position. Rio was lying flat on her back on the pile of blankets and pillows with Agatha seated between her legs on her knees.</p><p>“You know, it’s really unfair how I was the one giving you attention, and now you are having all the fun.” Rio pouted.</p><p>“Well, I want to make my wife cum, I want to feel my wife’s body under me as I make love to her.” Agatha praised as she ran her hands along Rio’s body before her hands settled on her hips and she started to thrust slowly into her.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Rio said in shock, she didn’t realize the effect Agatha’s words would have on her. “Say it again.” Rio requested.</p><p>“What my love? That you are my wife?” Agatha asked as she started to move her hips faster. The feeling of Rio clenching down on the toy forcing a moan from her as she rolled her hips.</p><p>“Yes!” Rio said excitedly as she grasped at Agatha’s hands, Agatha took both of Rio’s hands and pushed them above her head and held them there as she thrust into her. She locked eyes with Rio and started thrusting faster.</p><p>“You are mine, mind, body, and soul. You are my wife Rio. I belong to you, you belong to me.” Agatha said before she passionately kissed Rio. Rio moaned softly as Agatha continued to thrust into her. Rio threw her legs around Agatha’s hips and pulled her close as she ponded into her wife.</p><p>“My love, My wife.” Rio said in an airy tone as she rolled her hips and clenched down on the toy. A soft moan spilled from Agatha’s lips as she let go of Rio’s hands and slid her own down Rio’s arms before she sat up to admire Rio. Hands roamed over Rio’s body as Agatha felt her warm wet heat clench down on the toy.</p><p>“Are you close my love?” Agatha asked as she ran her hand up the sigil on Rio’s chest, the purple almost glowing as Agatha slid her fingers across the sensitive flesh.</p><p>“Yes! Please! Touch my clit.” Rio begged and Agatha smiled wickedly.</p><p>“Oh is it time for me to give you my gift already?” Agatha asked as she continued to thrust into Rio. Agatha slipped her thumb between them before speaking an incantation.</p><p>“Wha? Oh fuck!” Rio started to ask but was quickly cut off by Agatha’s finger vibrating against her clit. “Agatha! Shit! Fuck!” Rio hissed out as she felt herself cum. A loud moan left both women as Rio locked her hips. Agatha pulled her hand away and sunk her hips deep into Rio. A few moments later Rio’s hips relaxed and her legs fell to the sides.</p><p>“I think I want one more.” Agatha said in a lust filled and greedy tone.</p><p>“Lemon.” Rio said softly and Agatha halted instantly.</p><p>“Too much?” Agatha asked softly, she didn’t want to overwhelm Rio.</p><p>“No, but you aren’t giving me a turn to pleasure you.” Rio explained.</p><p>“I’m enjoying myself. Let me have one more and I’ll be a perfect pillow princess for you.” Agatha requested in a way that didn’t seem like a request.</p><p>“Fine, only because I can’t say no to you.” Rio said with a huff.</p><p>“And you like orgasms.” Agatha teased as she started to thrust into Rio again.</p><p>“Fuck. Yes!” Rio groaned out as Agatha rolled her hips just right, hitting Rio’s g-spot with every thrust. Agatha could feel every clench and how hot Rio was around the toy.</p><p>“Goddesses above you feel so good.” Agatha groaned out as she continued to thrust into Rio. Rio decided she was going to start pulling on their connection hard. “Oh! Fuck!” Agatha screamed as she buried her face into Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Yes, fuck. Agatha please cum with me.” Rio begged as she softly wove her fingers into Agatha’s hair and held her head against her neck. Hips rolling wildly as she felt her orgasm approach, both women moaned loudly as they felt their orgasms crash over them. Agatha collapsed heavily onto Rio, sinking the toy into her.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio said a few moments later after they had caught their breath.</p><p>“I love you too.” Agatha mumbled against Rio’s neck before she kissed along it softly.</p><p>“Stop. It’s your turn.” Rio scolded softly before she slid her hand down Agatha’s back and magicked the harness away.</p><p>“I could make love to you until the sun rises.” Agatha said honestly. Rio turned them over so that Agatha was on her back again.</p><p>“One night on our honey moon you can do that but right now. I want you.” Rio said as she kissed down Agatha’s body. She took a few detours and gave ample attention to each breast before she slid her fingers down between Agatha’s legs. A loud groan left Rio when she felt how slick Agatha was.“Fuck, you are so wet.”</p><p>“That happens when your wife pulls hard on your connection to make you cum with her.” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Well maybe my wife shouldn’t have been so greedy and let me eat her out for a little longer.” Rio teased as she settled between Agatha’s legs and sunk her fingers into the women before she brought her mouth to her clit.</p><p>“Where’s the ah! Rio! Fun in that!” Agatha said as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair and softly gripped and tugged on their scalp.</p><p>‘Behave Agatha.’ Rio scolded in her mind as she flicked her tongue and curled her fingers softly into Agatha, tapping against her g-spot. Moans and sighs left Agatha as she felt herself start to climb closer and closer to orgasm.</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha hissed out as she felt herself barrel rolling toward an orgasm. Her hips were shaking as Rio continued to swirl her tongue around Agatha’s clit and curled her fingers.</p><p>‘Agatha, my love. I can feel how close you are. Be a good girl and cum for me.’ Rio husked out in her mind.</p><p>“Oh! Goddess!” Agatha screamed as she felt her orgasm rush over her. Rio let out a satisfied moan as she continued to drink Agatha in as she flicked her tongue over her clit.</p><p>“Rio. Fuck!” Agatha moaned out as she rolled her hips into Rio’s mouth. Rio continued to thrust her fingers into Agatha as she swirled her tongue rapidly, trying to get another orgasm out of Agatha.</p><p>‘Give me one more. Please my love.’ Rio begged in her mind. She needed Agatha to cum, desperately.</p><p>“Fuck… Rio! Yes!” Agatha screamed out as she felt herself climbing toward another peak. She gripped the back of Rio’s head as she softly curled her fingers into her hair. Rio curled her fingers and hooked them into Agatha, softly massaging her g-spot as she continued to flick her tongue. She could feel Agatha start to shake under her. Agatha screamed loudly as an orgasm washed over Agatha a moment later, she curled her body around Rio’s head.</p><p>Rio slowly pulled her mouth away but kept her fingers hooked inside Agatha. “Goddesses above I love the sounds you make when you cum.” Rio whispered as she kissed Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>“My clit is officially sensitive.” Agatha sighed as she softly played with Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Of course, I guess it’s a good thing I know how to make you cum other ways.” Rio told Agatha as she pulled her fingers out of the woman and brought them up to her mouth to suck them clean.</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“You promised you’d be a perfect little pillow princess my love. I’m holding you to that.” Rio told her as she magicked her harness onto her hips and a pillow under Agatha’s. She settled between her legs, and dragged the toy up and down, collecting the wetness there.</p><p>“I might need the wetness spell as well my love.” Agatha told her. Rio reached down and spoke an incantation as she pressed her fingers to Agatha’s core. Agatha felt a flood of wetness a moment later and Rio collected some on her finger tips so she could rub it on the tip of the toy. Rio slowly slid the toy into Agatha and moaned softly as she settled her hips against Agatha’s, sinking deep into the woman.</p><p>“Fuck, you still feel so divine.” Rio mumbled as she leaned over Agatha and started moving her hips slowly.</p><p>“Goddesses, I love how you feel.” Agatha groaned out as she threw her legs over Rio’s back and locked them together so she could comfortably pull Rio closer. Rio leaned down and placed a soft kiss on the heart sigil on Agatha’s breast. The feeling of tenderness and pure love flooded Agatha as Rio continued to thrust into Agatha.</p><p>Moans and whimpers slipped from Agatha’s lips as Rio kissed up her neck while she rolled her hips. “Goddesses. I feel so close already.” Agatha groaned out as she wove her fingers into Rio’s hair again, grounding her against her neck. Rio softly nipped and sucked at her neck leaving a trail of marks along the sensitive flesh.</p><p>“Cum for me then Agatha.” Rio whispered into her ear before she nipped at her earlobe. She felt Agatha roll her hips, before she locked them and shook.</p><p>“Ah! Fuck! Rio! Yes!” Agatha screamed out as her body shook and she felt another orgasm flood over her.</p><p>“Another.” Rio whispered greedily as she started moving her hips faster. Agatha was still reeling from her previous orgasm as Rio started dragging her toward another. Hands slid up Agatha’s body to softly massage her breasts as she sat up and looked down at the woman below her. Each thrust into her dragging her closer and closer to the edge. Soon Rio felt Agatha clench down hard as her body shook.</p><p>“Rio, my love. Yes!” Agatha screamed out as she felt another flood over her, a gush of wetness coating Rio’s thighs as Agatha’s body arched off the blankets.</p><p>A few moments later she relaxed against the cushions and felt the toy slip out of her as Rio magicked it away. She looked down at Agatha and smiled brightly at the woman before she settled into her arms.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha said softly as she kissed the crown of Rio’s head.</p><p>“For what my love?” Rio asked as she looked up at Agatha. The fairy lights illuminating her face in a way that made her seem even softer in this moment.</p><p>“For loving me, for simply being my other half. For showing up at the perfect time and being everything I ever needed.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“I love you Agatha Lynn Harkness-Vidal. You are the best thing that could’ve ever happened to me.” Rio told Agatha before she scooted up and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p>“I love you Rio Rene Harkness-Vidal.” Agatha mumbled softly against Rio’s lips before she kissed her again.</p><p>“We should head back to the cabin.” Rio said after she broke the kiss.</p><p>“Probably.” Rio said with a sigh, Agatha cleaned the bedding up and teleported them into Rio’s old room. They curled up together in the soft bed and started to drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>Four years later.</p><p>“Nicky! Put that down!” Agatha softly scolded her two and a half year old son as he carried a relatively large plant compared to him through the green house.</p><p>‘It’s helping him. He’s fine.’ Rio whispered softly in Agatha’s mind.</p><p>‘I know that but they won’t help the twins if they want to move big plants let’s set a good example.’ Agatha requested softly.</p><p>“Nicky baby. Let’s put that down. Okay? It’s a little heavy for you.” Rio asked her son who let her take the plant from him.</p><p>“Mommy, I wanted to help Momma!” Nicky said with a huff.</p><p>“I know, but stressing Momma out won’t help her baby. Why don’t we go play with the twins.” Agatha told her son as she bent over and took his hand. Her pregnant belly making it difficult but she managed.</p><p>“When will sis be here Momma?” Nicky asked Agatha.</p><p>“Soon just a couple more weeks baby.” Agatha told Nicky.</p><p>“Okay.” Nicky said with a smile as he guided his mother over to the set of two year old twins sitting next to Wanda. Their soft brown hair and green eyes shining brightly as their mother told them a story.</p><p>“Nicky!” The twins yelled loudly at the older toddler and Agatha walked over.</p><p>“Billy! Tommy!” Nicky yelled as he let go of Agatha’s hand and toddled over to them.</p><p>“How you holding up?” Wanda asked as she stood up to check on Agatha. They were in the corner of the green house Lily and Rio set up as a recreation area in the winter. So they could enjoy a bit of warmth.</p><p>“Fine. She’s on my bladder again though so I have to teleport into the house.” Agatha told Wanda.</p><p>“Well go! I’ve got him.” Wanda encouraged, then Agatha was gone in a flash. Lily and Rio looked over at Wanda with the boys and realized Agatha was gone.</p><p>‘You alright my love?’ Rio asked.</p><p>‘Fine, someone is just dancing on my bladder.’ Agatha told Rio.</p><p>‘Okay. I’m one call away.’ Rio reassured before she went back to her gardening. Lily and Rio had established their own mini garden that Agatha spent most of her free time turning into healthy meals for their families.</p><p>“Jen and Alice are coming over today right?” Wanda asked Rio and Lily from across the green house.</p><p>“Yes!” Rio yelled back. A moment later Agatha popped back into the greenhouse to see the three boys playing with their toy cars on the play-mat.</p><p>“Alex?” Nicky asked softly, he was excited but afraid to get his hopes up.</p><p>“Yes bub. Aunt Jen and Alice are bringing Alexandria over to play. They should be here soon. Want me to call them?” Wanda asked as she magicked her phone into her hand.</p><p>“Yeah!” All three boys yelled in unison. Wanda smiled softly at the three of them and opened the phone and called Jen. It rang a few times before Alice answered Jen’s phone.</p><p>“Someone is being just as stubborn as her mothers’.” Alice told Wanda.</p><p>“Put me on speaker phone.” Wanda requested as she put her own phone on speaker. Alice did the same and a shriek of toddler could be heard in the background before Alice walked over to them and spoke.</p><p>“Alexandrea, your Aunt Wanda called you.” Alice told the four and a half year old who seemed to calm down.</p><p>“What?!” Alexandria said excitedly.</p><p>“Your cousins wanna see you sweet pea! Don’t you boys?” Wanda asked the three boys.</p><p>“Alex! Alex! Alex!” The boys chanted excitedly, Alex was almost a tiny cult leader.</p><p>“Tommy, Billy, and Nicky wanna see you Alexandria.” Wanda told the girl, who seemed like she was throwing a tantrum when she called.</p><p>“Okay!” Alexandria said excitedly.</p><p>“Which means you have to put socks and shoes on Witchlett.” Jen said softly.</p><p>“Socks hurt!” Alexandria yelled at her mother. Wanda could almost hear the eye roll that went with the sigh Jen let out in that moment.</p><p>“Cut the elastic band. See if they still hurt.” Wanda told Alice, who set the phone down and grabbed a pair of scissors to cut the elastic band in the socks and then brought them back over to Jen and Alexandria.</p><p>“Let’s try these on one more time baby. If they hurt you don’t have to wear socks. But you can take the shoes and socks off when we get to Aunt Agatha’s okay?” Jen asked her daughter softly.</p><p>“Okay.” Alexandria said with a sniffle. Wanda heard some rustling on the other end and then Jen spoke again.</p><p>“That okay? Do the socks hurt still?” Jen asked.</p><p>“No Mommy! They don’t!” The little girl giggled.</p><p>“Alright let’s get your shoes on and head to Aunties house!” Jen said excitedly.</p><p>“Thank you Wanda. See you soon.” Alice said into the phone before hanging up.</p><p>“Sensory issues.” Wanda said to herself before she looked at her twin boys and nephew playing together.</p><p>“What about sensory issues?” Lily asked as she walked over to her wife.</p><p>“Alexandria is having sensory issues. Her socks hurt. The elastic was too tight on them.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Who knew out of all of us that you’d be so great at this?” Lily said with a smile as she stood up on her tiptoes and gave Wanda a kiss on the cheek before pressing her hand to her chest affectionately.</p><p>“Agatha is a way better mom.” Wanda said with a chuckle.</p><p>“But we knew she’d be good at this. You were a surprise.” Lily said as she patted Wanda on the chest softly before kissing her again.</p><p>“Is this another back handed compliment?” Wanda asked with a chuckle.</p><p>“No, just the truth. I’m glad you are so good at this. It makes wanting more easy, even if our two are a handful already.” Lily reassured.</p><p>“Really? You want more? Do you not remember bath time last night?” Wanda teased remembering Lily coming out of the bathroom looking like a drowned rat after bathing the twins.</p><p>“Yes, even after last night. Maybe if I get pregnant we will have a girl.” Lily said with a smile.</p><p>“Maybe.. but let’s wait until they are at least three or four.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“Yeah, I’d like them potty trained first.” Lily told her wife.</p><p>“Agreed.” Wanda told Lily. Then a moment later the green house door swung open and Jen, Alice and Alexandria walked in and shut the door quickly to prevent the cold air from getting into the green house.</p><p>“We are here! Finally!” Jen announced before she walked over to Wanda. “How did you fucking know it was the elastic?” Jen whisper yelled at her.</p><p>“I’m a therapist. You think I don’t have clients with sensory issues?” Wanda asked her friend.</p><p>“Uh. I didn’t think about it like that. How do we fix this?” Jen asked her friend as Lily walked over to the four children.</p><p>“No more cute ankle socks for Alexandria, get her the socks that have ribbing like old man socks. They will be much nicer on her feet. Sorry.” Wanda apologized to her friend.</p><p>“If it prevents a melt down like that I’ll gladly let her wear whatever is comfortable. My temper mixed with Alice’s resulted in a tantrum I couldn’t have imagined!” Jen explained.</p><p>“Maybe get her tested? As your friend. She’s perfect and we don’t need labels. As an objective therapist. She might have high functioning autism or just is growing too fast for her clothing.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“Thanks. I appreciate the honesty.” Jen said with a sigh. “We will look into getting her tested.”</p><p>“Don’t stress too much about it. She’s hitting milestones. Worst case senerio you have a gifted kid like Morgan.”</p><p>“Pepper and Tony have their hands full with her. She managed to deconstruct one of Tony’s drones last week that he was working on and reassembled it perfectly.” Jen commented.</p><p>“Sharp as a tack that one. She’s going to surpass her father soon. I swear.” Agatha said as she walked over to the two women.</p><p>“Is Pepper bringing her over for the play date today?” Jen asked.</p><p>“They will be here shortly. I just called Pepper and let her know that Alexandria was here. Morgan didn’t want to be the only girl here.” Agatha explained before she walked over to Alice and the kids.</p><p>“Perfect the kids can play. I can get wine drunk with Pepper, your wives can garden and Agatha and you can play with the kids.” Jen said with a smirk.</p><p>“Wait! Why can’t I get wine drunk?” Wanda asked with a huff.</p><p>“You’re going to leave your pregnant sister alone with five children?” Jen teased.</p><p>“Alice will help. I hope.” Wanda offered as Alice walked over to the group with a twin clinging to each leg.</p><p>“I’ll help with what?” Alice asked slightly winded.</p><p>“Agatha and I with the kids while Rio and Lily garden and Pepper and Jen get wine drunk.” Wanda offered.</p><p>“I can definitely help with the kids. Isn’t that right boys?” Alice asked as the twins wrapped around her legs giggled.</p><p>“Yeah! Aunt Alice! Go!” Billy yelled excitedly.</p><p>“One second I’m talking to your Mom!” Alice said as her legs started moving of her own accord and the boys giggled some more. “I guess I have no control here! Bye!” Alice said as she walked off with the twins. Letting them think they had control over their Aunt.</p><p>“She entertains them almost as much as you do.” Jen complimented Wanda.</p><p>“Thanks! I’m just glad Lily’s father is happy about two grandsons.” Wanda said with a chuckle as she remembered how overjoyed the man was about twin boys.</p><p>“He’s one proud Papa.” Jen said with a smile as she watched Alice stomp around the green house with the twins. Agatha was sitting in a chair as Nicky and Alexandria played together.</p><p>Pepper and Morgan rushed into the green house in a flurry. Quickly shutting the door as she set down the five year old and let her take her own scarf, hat and coat off.</p><p>“Morgan!” Alexandria yelled excitedly as she ran over and hugged her best friend.</p><p>“Alexandria!” Morgan squealed excitedly as she hugged her best friend.</p><p>“Hey Pepper! Thanks for coming. You want red or white wine?” Agatha asked her.</p><p>“Bourbon.” Pepper said as she sat down next to Agatha. Agatha raised both eyebrows but didn’t argue with Pepper and just magicked a strong glass of high quality bourbon into Peppers hand.</p><p>“Oh, okay. That rough of a day?” Agatha asked Pepper who just looked over at Agatha with a very tired look before she took a drink.</p><p>“Thank you. Morgan has figured out nuclear physics. Fortunately Jarvis has protocols to prevent the progeny from killing half the continent.” Pepper said with a sigh.</p><p>“Only child?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’m not risking bringing a second Tony Stark Jr into this world.” Pepper said before she took a long drink.</p><p>“Fair.” Agatha said.</p><p>“I’m sorry Mommy, I didn’t mean to upset you.” Morgan said to her mother.</p><p>“Baby you didn’t upset me. You just don’t realize how dangerously intelligent you are. Let’s keep the nuclear physics to paper instead of attempting to practice its principles. Okay?” Pepper requested.</p><p>“Yes Mommy!” Morgan said with a bright smile before she ran off to play with Alexandria. Pepper took another long drink of her bourbon. Agatha refilled the glass the second she pulled it away from her lips.</p><p>“I should’ve married you.” Pepper said as she took another drink.</p><p>“Back off Potts!” Rio yelled from across the greenhouse.</p><p>“How did she hear that?” Pepper asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“The plants. They are little narcs. Watch.”  Agatha said before she tried to stand up and struggled slightly.</p><p>“Sit down! I’ll come help you up in a second.” Rio scolded before she started rushing over to Agatha.</p><p>“See.” Agatha said with a sigh as Rio walked over and helped her stand. “I can get up on my own darling.”</p><p>“Hell no, we aren’t playing that game. Little lady needs to stop scaring us before I have a heart attack.” Rio told Agatha before she gave her a soft kiss.</p><p>“You know you can’t dote on me constantly.”  Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I can, and will.” Rio told Agatha before she continued. “Where were you headed my love?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No where, I was proving a point to Pepper.” Agatha told Rio as she stretched her back out a little before sitting back down. Nicky walked over to Agatha and climbed into her lap. Rio went back to gardening with Lily after she was satisfied her wife wasn’t moving anytime soon.</p><p>“Momma, I love you.” Nicky said sweetly as he kissed Agatha on the cheek.</p><p>“Momma loves you too baby. Did you want something?”</p><p>“Nope. Just Momma!” Nicky said as he cuddled into Agatha’s side.</p><p>“He’s literally the sweetest little boy on the planet and I am so jealous.” Pepper whispered to Agatha.</p><p>“Another blessing from my mother.” Agatha said as she kissed her son on the head. Alice walked back over with the twins a moment later and they got off her legs. Alice sat down and let out a winded sigh.</p><p>“They are getting heavy.” Alice said to the other two women.</p><p>Morgan and Alexandria were playing with dolls on the mat as the twins walked over to them and sat down next to them. The children began talking and playing together. Nicky cuddled closer to Agatha and placed his hand on her pregnant belly.</p><p>“I take nap with sis.” Nicky said sleepily.</p><p>“You don’t want to play with your cousins?” Agatha asked him.</p><p>“No, nap.” Nicky whispered as his eyes drooped.</p><p>“They will be right here when you wake up baby. Rest.” Pepper reassured, before she looked at Agatha. “This bourbon tastes like a sleep over.”  Which caused Agatha to chuckle at the woman.</p><p>“You two are always welcome here.” Agatha told Pepper as she adjusted Nicky so he was more comfortable in her lap.</p><p>“Thank you.” Pepper said as she finished her drink.</p><p>“I’ll make you another one in a little bit. I should probably get up and make dinner soon.” Agatha said as she looked at her watch.</p><p>“You relax woman, one of us can cook.” Alice said with a smile as she looked over at Agatha who was holding Nicky in her arms.</p><p>“I’ll handle dinner tonight.” Lily said as she walked over to the women. “You relax. I want my niece here in one piece.” Lily scolded Agatha.</p><p>“Goddesses Above you women are bossy!” Agatha joked.</p><p>“We know.” Pepper, Lily, Alice, Jen, and Wanda said in unison.</p><p>“What do the gremlins want for dinner?” Lily asked the group of children.</p><p>“Mac n cheese!” The twins yelled at their mother.</p><p>“Does that sound good Morgan? Alexandria?” Lily asked the two older girls.</p><p>“Yeah! With broccoli?” Morgan asked.</p><p>“Broccoli!” Alexandria said excitedly.</p><p>“Only at Aunties house do we willingly eat vegetables.” Pepper said with an eye roll.</p><p>“They taste better Mom!” Morgan said with an equally sassy eye roll.</p><p>“Tony is so doomed in the future. Two Pepper’s under one roof is going to be an experience.” Jen said to Pepper before she looked at Agatha. “Where’s my wine witch?”</p><p>“Red or white?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Surprise me.” Jen said with a shrug, then there was a glass of white wine in Jen’s hand.</p><p>“Anyone else drinking?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, I’ve got the gremlins.” Wanda answered</p><p>“I’m driving home.” Alice said with a soft smile.</p><p>“No sleep over?” Alexandria said with a pout directed at Alice.</p><p>“Sweetie, that’s not my choice to make. Aunt Agatha and Aunt Rio are already having Aunt Pepper stay the night.”</p><p>“You three can stay the night as well, I don’t care.” Agatha said with a sigh as her daughter started moving in her stomach. Nicky grumbled in her lap as he felt his little sister start to move.</p><p>“Momma sis is kicking me.” Nicky grumbled sleepily.</p><p>“She does that to me all the time baby. Talk to her.”</p><p>“Sis, be nice to Momma.” Nicky whispered against Agatha’s stomach, he received a soft kick to his hand in response. A giggle left Nicky as he felt his sister kick him.</p><p>“She’s hungry baby. So let momma get up so I can go get a snack and go potty.” Agatha said as she tried to help her son down.</p><p>“Okay Momma.” Nicky said as she climbed out of her lap.</p><p>“Lily, help me up.” Agatha requested, Lily quickly walked over and helped Agatha up.</p><p>“You’re going to start cooking the second you get done in the bathroom aren’t you?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Probably.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Who wants to go inside and play games in the living room while Aunt Agatha and I make dinner?” Lily asked the kids.</p><p>“We do!” The twins and Nicky said in unison.</p><p>“We will go with you!” Alexandria said with a bright smile as she stood up. Morgan followed suit as she stood up and took Alexandria’s hand. Billy and Tommy held hands and then grabbed Nicky’s before they joined together in a circle. Agatha walked over to Morgan and Alexandria and took their hands and teleported all of the children into the house.</p><p>“I really wish I could do that.” Alice said with a sigh as she stood up and headed toward the green house door with Lily and Wanda. The three women headed inside leaving Pepper, Jen and Rio in the greenhouse.</p><p>“I’m glad our daughters trust her.” Jen said to Pepper with a chuckle.</p><p>“They are the safest children on the planet when they are with her I’m not worried.” Pepper told Jen.</p><p>“I know. Hey! Rio, you almost done?” Jen asked the woman who was still doing something on the other side of the green house.</p><p>“Just finished! Let’s head inside.” Rio said with a smile. The two women stood up and headed out of the green house and into the house.</p><p>Once everyone was inside the women were seated on the couch chatting happily as Agatha and Lily cooked dinner. Lily was working on making macaroni and cheese and steamed broccoli for the kids while Agatha cooked off some chicken breast and made a salad for the women.</p><p>Twenty minutes later dinner was done and the table was set. Several candles were lit at the dining room table to encourage the children to eat while their mothers helped them.  Billy and Tommy were each being fed individually by Lily and Wanda between bites of their own food. Alexandria and Morgan were eating by themselves while Rio fed Nicky. Agatha quickly ate her meal and traded off with her wife. Once the children were done eating they ran off to play in the living room some more while their mothers finished their meals.</p><p>“No one told me all my grandchildren would be here tonight!” Gaia scolded as she appeared in the dining room.</p><p>“Grandma!” The children yelled excitedly as they all got up and clambered over to Gaia. The woman kneeled down and scooped them into a hug.</p><p>“Hello witchlets! Have you been good for your mothers’?” Gaia asked the gaggle of children. A chorus of affirmatives came from the group of children as they excitedly hugged Gaia.</p><p>“Hello Momma, what do we owe the surprise visit?” Agatha asked Gaia as she tried to stand up. She had to use the table to help herself stand but she finally was able to get on her feet and walk over to the goddess.</p><p>“I wanted to see my grand babies.” Gaia said with a shrug.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.” Agatha said as Gaia stood up straight and pulled her daughter into a soft hug. “Why are you really here.” Agatha whispered softly.</p><p>“I wanted to check on you. I hear someone’s being extra stubborn.” Gaia said as she softly placed her hand on Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>“And where ever did you hear that from?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“The source. She’s very opinionated… I wonder where she could have gotten that from.” Gaia teased before she looked over at Rio. The kids were still wrapped around Gaia’s legs and Nicky had taken to clinging to Agatha’s.</p><p>“Hey! Look at your daughter! She’s the stubborn one.” Rio said with a scoff.</p><p>“You both are equally stubborn.” Lily pointed out.</p><p>“That’s what happens when you mix two independent, hard headed workaholics together. You get an equally stubborn daughter. Look at Morgan and Alexandria.” Pepper said as she looked over at the women and children.</p><p>“Momma, up!” Nicky whisper yelled at Agatha. Gaia bent over and picked Nicky up for Agatha.</p><p>“Nicholas, now Momma can’t be picking you up right now. Sis is coming soon, so we have to be careful. We don’t want her showing up early.” Gaia explained to her grandson.</p><p>“I want Sis here now.” Nicky said with a pout.</p><p>“We all do, but she’s not ready yet. She will be very soon. But she’s got to grow a little more.” Gaia told Nicky.</p><p>“Okay, Grandma.” Nicky said twisting in her arms so that he could reach out to Agatha. Agatha stepped closer and let Nicky grab her face softly. “I love you Momma.” Nicky said softly before he gave her a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>“I love you too baby, why don’t you go play with your cousins while Momma, Mommy and your aunts talk to grandma?” Agatha’s asked her son who let go of her face and smiled brightly. He quickly turned around in Gaia’s arms and hugged her around the neck before she put him down. The children ran off to play.</p><p>“I’m slightly worried she’s not going to make it.” Agatha whispered quiet enough that only Gaia could hear.</p><p>“She will make it. She just had a rough start. Green witch babies never like winter births. And unfortunately, that’s what she is. Now. I’ve blessed her many times, she’s safe. Just cranky. Once she’s here you’ll just have to spend a decent amount of time in the green house. Until spring arrives that is.” Gaia explained as she guided Agatha back over to the table and sat her daughter down.</p><p>“Is there any chance she could be any other kind of witch because Agatha has a whole coven rolled into her magical abilities wise?” Pepper asked.</p><p>“I never thought to look at her’s or Nicky’s. But anything is possible. They could be combination witches like their mothers. We shall see. All I know is this little one right here is just very unhappy with the cold.” Gaia explained as she sat down.</p><p>“All these scares because someone is a little drama queen about not being in the green? Oh you little shit. You are my child.” Rio said with a sigh before she softly placed a hand on Agatha’s stomach. A green glow emanated from Rio’s hand and then something shifted. The child growing inside Agatha reached out and punched her mother’s hand softly.</p><p>“Is that better little one?” Agatha asked the child growing in her stomach.</p><p>“She is much happier, Rio you’ve got a new job to do.” Gaia told her daughter in law.</p><p>“Gladly. Anything to make the woman I love more comfortable.” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>“You know her due date don’t you?” Agatha asked her mother who looked at her with wide eyes and then glanced back at the children behind her.</p><p>“Would you look at that the children need me.” Gaia said as she stood up and tried to rush over to the children. Agatha quickly reached out and grabbed her mother’s hand to stop her.</p><p>“Sit down. They are fine.” Agatha told her mother.</p><p>“I’m just going to text Lilia real quick and see if she knows.” Wanda said with a smirk as she pulled her phone out. It disappeared a moment later.</p><p>“No need to bother Lilia!” Gaia said slightly panicked.</p><p>“What aren’t you telling us?” Jen prodded.</p><p>“I’d love to know as well.” Lily inquired.</p><p>“I think it’s sooner than the doctors projected and she doesn’t want Rio to stress herself into an early grave.” Pepper joked. Then something changed in Gaia’s demeanor.</p><p>“I’m having this baby tonight aren’t I?” Agatha asked her mother with a sigh.</p><p>“No, not tonight. But she will be a little early. You’ve only got two weeks left. So she’s fully formed, just small. I’d personally love for her to stay put the whole time, but again, someone is stubborn like her mothers’.” Gaia pointed out.</p><p>“Thank you. I would also like her to stay put for another two weeks.” Rio told Gaia before she leaned over and placed a glowing green hand on Agatha’s stomach again. This time leaving it there in hopes of appeasing her daughter.</p><p>“We shall see. That is helping change the timeline of her birth already though. So keep it up.</p><p>“You will not be doing that constantly for the next two weeks. I am already getting too hot.” Agatha told Rio.</p><p>“No, but like twenty minutes three times a day isn’t a bad start. Plus my magic may be deeply intertwined with yours but it would still be tiring to do it all day every day for two weeks.” Rio told Agatha.</p><p>“Is it sad I’m tempted to stay for the next two weeks?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“Momma, no. You have a universe to run. Plus I’m going to need you after she’s born. Not before.” Agatha explained.</p><p>“Plus, she’s got all of us already bothering her constantly.” Jen mentioned.</p><p>“Literally, someone is always in her bubble.” Wanda mentioned, directing her stare Lily and Rio.</p><p>“What? We just want to make sure she’s okay.” Lily told the group.</p><p>“I can be as close to my wife as I want.” Rio said flatly.</p><p>“It’s sweet how much they care, really.” Agatha mentioned.</p><p>“But…” Wanda said sadly.</p><p>“Just tell them to get out of the way when you want to be around her. That’s what I do.” Jen told Wanda.</p><p>“I do too. Sometimes I just walk over and grab Agatha by the arm and just take her somewhere else. So they aren’t hovering as much.” Alice mentioned.</p><p>“I’m guilty of hovering at work. So I have nothing to say. I just know how difficult someone has been so I worry.” Pepper said guilty.</p><p>“You are all ridiculous I hope you know that.” Agatha said with a sigh. Pregnancy brain had definitely taken its toll because she hadn’t even noticed that they were handing her off to each other constantly.</p><p>“We just want to make sure she’s healthy and so are you.” Gaia told her daughter.</p><p>“I appreciate that. Rio, I’m getting too warm. Sorry, my love.” Agatha said as she took Rio’s glowing hand off her stomach.</p><p>“That’s fine. Now let’s go hang out in the living room for a while. Before we start getting kids ready for bed.” Rio told the women.</p><p>“I’m getting myself another drink.” Pepper said as she got up and walked into the kitchen to get herself some more bourbon.</p><p>“I’m good, one glass of wine was plenty for me.” Jen said as she made her way over to the group of children with her wife. Alice sat down on the floor next to the girls who were drawing together on a large pad of paper, while the boys continued to play with each other and their toy cars.</p><p>“Who wants to watch Bluey?” Rio asked the children as she turned the tv on.</p><p>“Me!” All the children yelled in unison. The women settled down on the couches and cuddled up with their partners. Gaia was seated next to Agatha with Rio on the opposite side of her.</p><p>“Let’s just relax for the night. We can worry about this later.” Agatha said as she hit play. Her life was perfect, a home filled with laughter and joy, friends that loved her like sisters, family that loved her so deeply it brought her to tears, and a little boy so excited to be a big brother that it warmed her heart. Every single person in her life was so worth all the torment she had been through. She leaned softly against Rio as she settled comfortably into the couch.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio whispered softly as she kissed Agatha’s temple.</p><p>“I love you.” Agatha responded as she lifted Rio’s hand to her lips and kissed the back of it softly. A soft smile graced Agatha’s lips as she realized everything was exactly as it should be.</p><p>~10 Days Later~</p><p>In the wee hours of the morning Agatha’s water broke. She woke Rio softly before she went to take a shower. Rio hovered nervously in the bathroom as Agatha finished showering.</p><p>“I really don’t like how casual you’re being about this right now.” Rio said as she bit her thumbnail nervously.</p><p>“My water broke an hour ago, my contractions aren’t close together. I wanted to get the amniotic fluid off me, and most importantly, my mother hasn’t shown up yet.” Agatha said as she turned off the water and got out of the shower.</p><p>“That’s because you’re naked and she respects your privacy.” Rio scolded.</p><p>“No, because she was present during Nicky’s birth and she’s seen it all. She’s not here, I’m not worried. Did you call Pepper?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“She’s on her way. Wanda is in the living room. Alice and Jen are here already with Alexandria. Lily is collecting the twins and bringing them over here.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Who’s taking care of the kids?”</p><p>“Alice, Pepper, Jen, Lilia and Lily are going to watch the kids. Wanda, Gaia, and My Mother and I are going with you to the hospital.” Rio explained.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha said then waved her hand and got dressed. “Let’s go my love.” Agatha requested. Rio quickly followed Agatha out of the bathroom and into their bedroom. Once they made it downstairs the group of women in the living room had expanded. Gaia was standing by the front door holding two bags. Rita was next to her holding a set of car keys and the car seat. Pepper was in the kitchen making coffee. Lilia was sitting on the couch with Morgan and Alexandria tucked into her sides as they drifted in and out of sleep. Wanda was talking with Alice and Jen.</p><p>“Nicky is still sleeping, if Lily isn’t over here in an hour one of you go get Nicky up and the other go over and see if Lily needs help with the boys. Call me if you have any problems.” Wanda instructed.</p><p>“We’ve got this. Chill. It’s fine.” Alice reassured.</p><p>“Yeah, not like we haven’t raised our own. Now go.” Jen said while shoving Wanda toward the door. Agatha walked over to her Mother, Sister, and Mother-In-law with Rio following close behind.</p><p>“I’m just carrying things. I’ll meet you at the hospital when you arrive.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“Oh I’m driving my own car, don’t need all of us stuck at the hospital the whole time. Plus the car seat has to be installed.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“Which you can do when we get there and Agatha’s in the room. Right?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Of course, now let’s go.” Wanda said with a smile. The women headed out the door after a chorus of goodbyes and good lucks were said to Agatha.</p><p>Once Agatha and Rio were in the car with Rita they headed toward the hospital. “Are you going to tell me my granddaughters name yet?” Rita pried from the back seat.</p><p>“You know the rule. Just like with Nicky, not until it’s on the birth certificate.” Rio reminded her mother.</p><p>“I hate that rule.” Rita grumbled out as her daughter drove them to the hospital.</p><p>“You’ll live.” Agatha told Rita before another contraction rolled through her. She breathed through it and then relaxed. “How far apart are we now?” Agatha asked her mother in law.</p><p>“Fifteen minutes apart. Someone’s in a rush.” Rita said as she reset the stopwatch on her phone. Rio pulled up to the front entrance of the labor and delivery ward and parked.</p><p>“Right now she is. Let’s get you into the hospital. Momma can you park the car?” Rio asked as she unbuckled.</p><p>“Got it.” Rita said as she got out of the back seat. Rio got out and rushed around to the other side of the car to help Agatha out and into the building. Gaia was standing next to the trunk of the car after Rita was parked. Rita popped the trunk open and Gaia grabbed the bags out before they headed into the hospital.</p><p>“Let’s go meet our granddaughter.” Gaia said with a bright smile on her face as Rita followed her into the hospital.</p><p>~6 hours later~</p><p>A loud cry rang through out the hospital room. Wanda was holding Agatha’s right hand, Rio was holding her left, both their rings touching. Rio trying to sooth Agatha as much as she could with their connection as she brought their daughter into this world. Gaia was sitting behind Agatha allowing the woman to brace against her. Rita was on standby, ready to switch with Wanda or Rio if they needed her to step in for them.</p><p>“Oh good, she’s loud.” Agatha said with a sigh as she let go of her wife’s and best friend’s hand. She reached out for her daughter and was instantly handed the crying infant.</p><p>“Don’t cut the cord.” Rio instructed the doctor that seemed to be ready to cut it.</p><p>“Whatever you say.” The doctor said before setting the forceps and scissors down.</p><p>“Rio, time to switch with me sweetie.” Gaia said as she got off the bed but held Agatha up with one hand easily. Rio climbed into bed and settled behind Agatha.</p><p>“You did great my love.” Rio said softly before pressing a kiss to the side of Agatha’s head before she looked down at the infant in her arms. Curly black hair and a soft pink face with closed eyes was the view Rio was presented with.</p><p>“Oh goddesses…. I’m in trouble.” Rio said softly as she looked down at her daughter.</p><p>“Why’s that my love?” Agatha asked as she looked at her daughter, a soft smile gracing her face at the realization she might have her own mini me this time around.</p><p>“If those eyes are blue, I’m never going to be able to say no to her.” Rio said softly as she reached around and softly brushed her daughter’s hair out of her face. Gaia made a soft noise like she had been caught doing something she shouldn’t.</p><p>“I’m gunna go grab Nicky, I’ll be right back.” Gaia said before disappearing from the room.</p><p>“Seems like you are screwed Rio. Gaia definitely made sure that baby had blue eyes.” Wanda said as she walked over to the bed so she could get a good look at her niece. “Oh no. We are all doomed.” Wanda whispered softly before melting at the sight of the infant in Agatha’s arms. Agatha started nursing the infant right away.</p><p>“Once she is finished. I gotta check her vitals and get a weight and my partner needs momma’s vitals as well.” The nurse told the two women. A few minutes later the baby stopped nursing and Agatha softly patted her back to get the tiniest of burps from her.</p><p>“Rio, get up and carry her where ever the nurse wants to go. I want you to hold her before anyone else.” Agatha told Rio, Rio quickly got up and took her daughter from Agatha and then carried her over to where the nurse took her vitals, weight, and measurements. While the other nurse attended to Agatha.</p><p>The infant was swaddled up in a blanket and handed back to Rio who quickly brought her daughter and the placenta back over to Agatha. “Here you go my love.” Rio whispered softly.</p><p>“I need to get up and pee, I need food, I need clothing before our entire coven is packed into this room along with the children.” Agatha said with a sigh as she looked down at her now sleeping daughter.</p><p>“Momma do you want to hold your grand baby while I help Agatha?” Rio asked her mother, Rita perked up and quickly held her arms for Agatha to place the infant in. The second Rita had the child she was speaking softly to her.</p><p>Rio helped Agatha out of bed and into the bathroom where she helped her get changed and take care of things. Once Agatha was finished in the bathroom Rio guided her back to the now clean bed. Wanda was holding the baby in her arms and cooing to her softly.</p><p>“She’s perfect. Lily and I are so screwed aren’t we sweetie? Going to spoil you so much. Especially since you look just like your Momma.” Wanda said as she wrinkled her nose at the child in her arms.</p><p>“Alright give me back my daughter.” Agatha said with a huff as she climbed back into the bed and got comfortable. Wanda walked over and placed the child into Agatha’s arms before Gaia popped back into the room with Nicky.</p><p>“Mommy! Momma! Is she here!?” Nicky asked excitedly as he ran over to the edge of the bed.</p><p>“Yes baby. She’s finally here. Wanna meet her?” Rio asked her son.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky said excitedly. Rio bent down and took her son’s shoes off and helped him onto the bed. Nicky climbed closer to Agatha and looked at the infant in her arms.</p><p>“Nicky, meet your little sister. Violet Adelaide.” Agatha told her son.</p><p>“Hello Violet.” Nicky whispered quietly.</p><p>“Violet?” Gaia asked slightly insulted.</p><p>“First goddess to arrive gets dibs.” Violet joked as she appeared in the room and elbowed Gaia in the ribs softly.</p><p>“No, that’s not why. Her name is Violet because you were the only reason Agatha didn’t have a mental break during Evanora’s trial because you took her powers away. Sorry Gaia.” Rio said to Gaia and Violet.</p><p>“It’s fine, the next one can be named after me.” Gaia joked, knowing they probably wouldn’t have a third child.</p><p>“I think I’m done after two. Rio can carry one if we decide to have a third.” Agatha said before she looked down at Nicky who was marveling at his sleeping sister in his mother’s arms.</p><p>“Two is plenty.” Rio said with a grimace before she looked down at her son.</p><p>“Chickenshit.” Wanda jabbed.</p><p>“Sorry I gotta go, she’s beautiful. But duty calls!” Violet said before she clipped out of the room. Gaia rolled her eyes at Death’s antics.</p><p>“We will re-evaluate this subject in a year or so.” Agatha said with a sigh before she looked at Nicky. “Do you wanna hold her?”</p><p>“Can I momma?” Nicky whispered softly.</p><p>“Yeah one second, Rio take her for a second.” Agatha requested, Rio took the child. “Come here baby, sit between Momma’s legs.” Agatha instructed her son. Nicky climbed into her lap. Rio then placed Violet in Nicky’s lap. Supporting her head as he looked down at his little sister.</p><p>“She’s so small.” Nicky whispered softly.</p><p>“Yeah baby, you were this small as well.” Rio told him.</p><p>“I was this small? Wow.” Nicky said in disbelief. “Hello Violet. I’m Nicky.” Nicky then whispered quietly as he looked down at his little sister who was wide awake and looking at her brother.</p><p>“Those are definitely blue eyes.” Rita said as she leaned over and looked at her grandchildren.</p><p>“Alright, sorry to interrupt Rita, but I’m starving.” Agatha told the woman.</p><p>“Momma has that solution ready to go! But first let’s get Nicky and Violet out of your lap so you can eat.” Gaia told her daughter.  Rio took Violet from Agatha while Wanda scooped Nicky up into her arms. The little hospital table was rolled in front of Agatha before two burgers and french fries from Agatha’s favorite diner and a large root beer float next to it.</p><p>“I love you Momma, thank you.” Agatha said appreciatively as she dug into the food in front of her.</p><p>“You’re welcome sweetheart. Now, can grandma hold her granddaughter?” Gaia requested.</p><p>“Yes, you can.” Rio said as she walked over and handed the sleeping baby to Gaia.</p><p>“Violet Adelaide Vidal-Harkness. I bless you  with all the love a goddess can give. You are even more perfect than I expected.” Gaia said as she softly soothed her thumb over Violet’s brow.</p><p>“I’m going to go fetch Daniel. You enjoy your baby time before we get back.” Rita said before she walked over to Rio and gave her a hug before she gave one to Agatha as well. “You did fantastic. Thank you so much for another perfect grandchild.” Rita whispered before kissing Agatha’s temple.</p><p>“Thank you for being so supportive and helpful. I appreciate it.” Agatha said as she hugged Rita back before the woman let her go and headed out of the hospital room.</p><p>“Do you want everyone here or are you wanting to have them meet her at home?” Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“Might as well have them meet her here. But can I take a nap first? I’m very tired.” Agatha said with a yawn after she finished eating her second burger. Half the float was gone and most of the french fries were also gone.</p><p>“You can take a nap, I’ll handle the children. Rest my love.” Rio reassured. Agatha quickly finished eating her food and magicked the mess away before she leaned the bed back into a more comfortable position.</p><p>“Nicky come snuggle with Momma.” Agatha requested. Nicky was quickly hoisted back up onto the bed and Agatha snuggled up with her son before she started to drift off to sleep.</p><p>“I love you Momma” Nicky whispered softly before he placed his tiny hand on her face.</p><p>“I love you more Nicky.” Agatha mumbled sleepily as she drifted off.</p><p>Violet was nestled onto Rio’s arms comfortably as Gaia and Wanda started getting things out of bags to dress the child properly. Nicky and Agatha were both passed out, and Wanda was smiling softly at the baby girl in the bassinet while Rio and Gaia got things around.</p><p>The three women quickly got Violet into a diaper and a set of clothing before swaddling her up comfortably. “There you go witchlett.” Rio whispered softly before she scooped her daughter up into her arms and cradling her protectively.</p><p>A moment later there was a soft knock on the door before it opened. Daniel and Rita walked into the room quietly so they didn’t disturb the women inside. Nicky sat up groggily before he looked over at his grandparents. Daniel held a finger up to his lips to tell him to be quiet. He paused before he looked back at his mother sleeping next to him. Nicky raised his arms up as if to ask his grandfather to pick him up.</p><p>Daniel walked over to Nicky and picked him up off the bed.  Nicky excitedly hugged his grandfather before Daniel squeezed Nicky tightly. “Papa. Sis is here.” Nicky whispered quietly to Daniel.</p><p>“I heard, but I can say hello to you first. Can I not?” Daniel asked Nicky.</p><p>“You can. But she’s very cute and small.” Nicky said pointing to his mother who was holding the small infant in her arms. Rio smiled brightly at her father as he walked over. Violet was sleeping peacefully in Rio’s arms as he and Nicky looked down at the baby.</p><p>“Look at all that hair! Goodness she’s going to be Agatha’s mini me. Rita my dear you were not joking.” Daniel said in an excited whisper as he looked down at the adorable baby in his daughter’s arms.</p><p>“I’m doomed and I know it.” Rio said as she smiled softly at the infant in her arms. She was already a push over when it came to Agatha and anything the woman wanted. A mini version of her wife was a death sentence she’d gladly take.</p><p>“Everyone will be here shortly, should we wake her?” Rita asked.</p><p>“No need, I started to wake up when Daniel took Nicky.” Agatha said as she sat up. “Someone give me a child.” Agatha demanded as she put her arms out. Violet was placed into her arms a moment later before Rio gave her a soft kiss.</p><p>“Sorry, Lily is losing her marbles at the thought of a mini you. Jen, Alice, Pepper and Lilia are trying to keep the four kids in check now that their tiny leader has left.” Wanda told the group before sighing loudly as she put her phone back in her pocket.</p><p>“It’s fine. Someone go get them.” Agatha told the group of women.</p><p>“I’ll get them. Be right back.” Gaia said with a smile before she walked out of the room and headed toward the lobby.</p><p>“Are they already in the hospital?” Agatha asked in a confused tone.</p><p>“Yes. In the lobby.” Wanda said with a sigh.</p><p>“You brought toys right?” Agatha asked her best friend.</p><p>“Lily has them in her play-mat bag so we can just lay it out in the corner.” Wanda explained.</p><p>“I love your wife.” Agatha said with a smile before she looked down at Violet. The child was starting to stir. So she decided to start nursing her again. A knock resounded through the room before women started peaking in the door.</p><p>“Come on in. I’m nursing her but I hear my nieces and nephews are being antsy.” Agatha said with a smile. Lilia,Lily, Alice, Jen, Pepper, Gaia and the children filed into the room. Lily rushed over to the corner and set the bag down and opened it, letting all the toys scatter about the mat.</p><p>“Papa! Down!” Nicky said excitedly. Daniel let Nicky down and he rushed over to the corner to play with his cousins. Morgan, Alexandria, Tommy, and Billy all rushed behind him to play with him.</p><p>“Everything went smoothly I assume?” Lilia asked as they walked over to the bed.</p><p>“I don’t think it could’ve gone smoother if we tried. But we can thank Gaia for that.” Rio said with a smile at her mother in law.</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Gaia said as she leaned against a wall.</p><p>“Thank you Momma, I appreciate it.” Agatha said as Violet let go of her nipple. Agatha adjusted the child and her shirt before she burped her softly. “Who wants to hold her first?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Dibs!” Lilia and Daniel say in unison, they both turned to glare at each other for a moment before playing a game of rock, paper, scissors that Lilia won.</p><p>“That never works for you Daniel.” Rita said with a chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah but it’s fun. I may win one day. When she takes pity on me.” Daniel said with a shrug as Lilia walked over to Agatha and took the child from the woman.</p><p>“Oh, she’s perfect.” Lilia said with tears welling up in her eyes. “What is her name?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“Violet Adelaide Vidal-Harkness.”</p><p>“Well hello Violet, what a delight to meet you.” Lilia said with a smile before she handed the child off to Daniel. “I won’t hog her, everyone wants to meet you.”</p><p>“Thank you. Hello Violet. Papa loves you so much already. You are about to be the most spoiled little girl on the planet.”</p><p>“With in reason!” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Did you guys hear something?” Daniel asked the women.</p><p>“Watch it or I’m withholding baked goods.” Agatha scolded.</p><p>“Oh, Momma’s threatening me, I better not spoil you too much.” Daniel said before he placed a soft kiss to the infants head. “Who would like to hold her?”</p><p>“Me! Give me my niece!” Lily said as she rushed over to the man. Agatha and Daniel chuckled at Lily before she was given the baby.</p><p>“Oh no, she’s so cute!” Lily whispered as she melted, her heart felt so full.</p><p>“The cutest, and her eyes are blue.” Rio whispered which caused Lily to look up at her in shock.</p><p>“Oh no, not a mini Agatha.” Lily lamented, knowing they were all doomed the second she pouted.</p><p>“Quit hogging! Visiting hours will be over soon.” Jen said as she walked over to Lily.</p><p>“Fine! If I must share!” Lily complained as she handed Violet off to Jen.</p><p>“Thank you.” Jen said as she took the infant into her arms and then made a noise that none of the women in the room beside Alice had ever heard before. It was soft and barely audible but it was surprising to everyone in the room beside her wife.</p><p>“What noise was that.” Rio asked.</p><p>“That was the ‘that’s so cute I can’t contain it.’ Noise. She makes it often at home. Especially when Alexandria is doing something particularly adorable.” Alice said as she stood on her tip toes so she could get a better look. “And now I see why.”</p><p>“She’s so cute. Oh my goddesses. I’m so glad we kept Alexandria’s baby clothes. She’s gunna be so cute in all of it.” Jen said excitedly.</p><p>“And all of Morgan’s. I was waiting to see how smart she would be before I got rid of anything. I’m not making another super genius.” Pepper said honestly.</p><p>“We will gladly take all the baby girl clothing.” Rio said with a smile, knowing that their daughter is about to be the pinkest girliest little girl on the planet. She remembered some of the outfits Morgan and Alexandria wore.</p><p>“Alice do you want to hold her?” Jen asked.</p><p>“I can wait, Pepper can hold her if she wants.”</p><p>“Of course I want to hold her!” Pepper said excitedly as she walked over to the two women and took Violet from Jen. The second she had the child in her arms she made her way back over to Agatha and sat down on the bed next to her.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha whispered as she reached out and brushed a black curl away from Violets forehead.</p><p>“She’s perfect, just like her mother. You did fantastic.” Pepper said with a bright smile as she looked down at the child before she handed her back to Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you. But I’m not perfect.” Agatha told Pepper, which caused every woman plus Daniel in the room to grumble and want to argue with her.</p><p>“We aren’t starting this so don’t argue. You are perfect my love. Because you are perfect for us. Without you our lives would be incomplete.” Rio told Agatha as she walked over to her wife and softly ran her fingers through her hair before she pressed a soft kiss to her head. “And you are perfect for me.”</p><p>A loud and resounding ‘awe’ came from every adult in the room. Then Violet begun to cry softly in her mother’s arms.</p><p>“Shhh witchlett, let’s check your diaper and feed you again if you need. Then Momma can probably eat again as well.” Rio soothed as she took her daughter from Agatha and took her over to the bassinet to change her.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get you ladies and the children home. So my daughter can rest and take care of my grand daughter.” Gaia instructed.</p><p>“Grandma, are you coming home with us?” Nicky asked Gaia.</p><p>“For a little while but I wanna be here with Momma just in case she needs anything.” Gaia explained.</p><p>“Daniel and I will stay until you get back. Then we will switch and help Lily and Wanda with Nicky.” Rita offered to Gaia.</p><p>“That would be a great help.” Wanda said appreciatively before she looked over at Agatha. “I love you, call if you need me.”</p><p>“Love you too, I’ll call Pietro once you all leave.” Agatha told her.</p><p>“Good idea. Maybe he can come help burn some of the kid’s energy off once he’s done saying hello.” Lily said as she collected the kids. Wanda walked over and helped her wife collect the kids.  Ten minutes later the women wrangled the children and got them out of the hospital room. After Nicky got to say goodbye to his Mothers’ and new little sister.</p><p>Rio pulled her phone out and texted Pietro before she settled in the chair next to the bed. Rita and Daniel were hovering slightly but still giving Agatha space.</p><p>“I am starving again.” Agatha said right as the door to the hospital room opened slowly.</p><p>“I hear my one and only niece is now in the world?” Pietro asked.</p><p>“Come meet Violet Adelaide Vidal-Harkness.” Agatha told her brother, Pietro rushed into the room and was next to Agatha a moment later.</p><p>“Oh. no. She looks just like you.” Pietro said in a jokingly disappointed tone.</p><p>“Oh were you hoping for another Nicky?” Agatha jabbed as Pietro sat down on the edge of the bed. Agatha leaned over and placed the sleeping infant in his arms.</p><p>“Woah. This feels different.” Pietro said mostly to himself than anyone else.</p><p>“What feels different?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Like I’d burn the world down if anyone ever hurt her.” Pietro explained.</p><p>“You didn’t feel that way with Nicky?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“No I did, but I was also excited to be the cool uncle and hand him the matches. With her, it’s different. I think her looking exactly like you is doing the heavy lifting. Always had a soft spot for my favorite sister.” Pietro said with a soft smile, he looked at her with just as much love and admiration that he did Nicky.</p><p>“They are both perfect.” Rio chimed in.</p><p>“No arguments here. I agree. Do you need anything to eat?” Pietro told Rio then asked Agatha.</p><p>“Gaia is coming back after you leave. You got time to play with your nephews? And possibly Morgan and Alexandria?”</p><p>“Xavier gave me tomorrow off then told me if I was needed he had a sub on standby. He’s big on family leave. So I’ll head on out. Love you Aggie. She’s perfect. Seriously.”  Pietro told her before handing her back to Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you. Love you too.” Agatha told her brother as she took her daughter back and leaned against the raised back of the bed. Pietro and Gaia almost collided with each other when he went to leave.</p><p>“Sorry, goddess.” Pietro said softly before zipping past her.</p><p>“In a rush to go play with the boys?” Gaia asked.</p><p>“Probably.” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p>“Our turn to leave as well. Love you both so much.” Rita said as she waked over and hugged Rio, before she leaned down and hugged Agatha. “And you, I expect you to keep up with the mini heart attacks you’ve been giving your Mommy. She deserves them after everything she put me through.” Rita joked as she brushed the soft black curls on Violets head. A soft groan left Violet after Rita pulled her hand away.</p><p>“Please no. She can’t raise hell while looking exactly like her mother. I will implode.” Rio begged while looking between Rita and Gaia.</p><p>“It’s all in how you raise them.” Gaia said with a shrug as she watched Rita walk out of the room.</p><p>“Love you girls.” Daniel said before ducking out the door as well leaving Gaia, Agatha and Rio alone with Violet.</p><p>“Can I bring Rosaline?” Death asked as she popped back into the room.</p><p>“Yes. I’ll get her.” Gaia told Death before she clipped out then back into the room with Rosaline standing next to her.</p><p>“I hear there’s a witchlett named after my wife?” Rosaline asked.</p><p>“Over here, but she needs a diaper change.” Agatha said as she handed her daughter off to Rio. Rio quickly changed Violet’s diaper before reswaddling the infant and bringing her over for Rosaline to see.</p><p>“She’s adorable.” Rosaline said as she looked at the child. Violet leaned over to look at the infant with her name as well. She took a long look at the baby before she smiled softly.</p><p>“Hello Violet. Nice to meet you.” Violet said with a soft chuckle.</p><p>“I’m just glad she’s here. Now. You have work to do. I can feel you getting antsy.” Rio told Death.</p><p>“Hospitals have a tendency to be full of dead people. Sorry. Gaia? Will you send Rosaline home when she’s done?” Violet asked as she shifted into her Death form.</p><p>“Of course, have fun at work.” Gaia answered but Violet was gone. Gaia rolled her eyes at Violets antics.</p><p>“As much as I’d like to hold her, I will get baby fever and Violet will kill me for bringing home lost baby animal souls. When Nicky was born I brought home so many. So I shall refrain. Send me home before my wife figuratively kills me.” Rosaline requested.</p><p>“Can do, have a great night.” Gaia said with a wave and then Rosaline was gone.</p><p>“Momma I’m hungry again. Sorry.” Agatha told Gaia.</p><p>“What do you want sweetheart?”</p><p>“A big ass salad, with chicken strips.” Agatha told Gaia then a moment later the table was pushed back in front of Agatha and a large salad with chicken strips, ranch dressing, and a large cup of water was place in front of her.</p><p>“Thank you!” Agatha said appreciatively as she picked up the fork and started to eat.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Now, Rio are you hungry? Give me my grand baby and I’ll conjure you up some food as well.”</p><p>“I am, can I have a burger?” Rio answered as she handed her daughter off to Gaia. She walked over to the chair next to the bed and sat down. Gaia magicked a brown pepper bag into Rio’s lap. Then started softly rocking Violet in her arms.</p><p>“What color were her eyes supposed to be?” Agatha asked after she finished her salad. Rio was half way through her burger and fries.</p><p>“Blue. That wasn’t something I personally did. But I was hoping Rio wouldn’t figure it out so fast. But it is what it is.” Gaia said with a shrug.</p><p>“Well she would’ve been perfect no matter what color her eyes were.” Agatha said with a smile before she put her hands out for Gaia to give her daughter back to her. Gaia magicked the table out of the way then handed Violet back to her mother.</p><p>“Hello little one. Momma is so happy you are finally here.” Agatha whispered softly before kissing her on the head.</p><p>“I’m glad she’s healthy, got all her fingers and toes, and it was a relatively smooth labor.” Rio said as she finished her food and put everything back in the bag.</p><p>“We all are.” Agatha said with a smile before she laid the baby down between her legs and relaxed into the bed. “I’m exhausted.” Agatha said with a sigh as she closed her eyes.</p><p>“You rest my love. I’ve got her.” Rio whispered as she got up then pressed a kiss against her temple. She then leaned over and scooped Violet up and carried her back over to the chair and sat down.</p><p>Rio rocked her daughter in the chair as she listened to Agatha’s breathing deepen until she knew her wife was asleep. Gaia walked over to Agatha and placed a kiss on her brow before turning to Rio.</p><p>“How do you feel?” Gaia whispered.</p><p>“Alive. Like I’m actually living my life.” Rio said with tear filled eyes.</p><p>“Good. Keep living it, they may test you. Mind you, all children do. But I’m glad you finally feel like you are living.” Gaia said as she crouched down and stroked Violets black curls.</p><p>“When I met Agatha, it felt like I had taken my first breath. Now, I’ve got two beautiful children, a wife who loves me, and a place for my bones to rest. I never thought I’d feel like this.” Rio explained, her voice barely audible as she looked down at the child in her arms. “You and your brother are the greatest things I’ve ever had the privilege of being a part of creating.” Rio told Violet before she softly kissed her forehead again.</p><p>“Life is exactly as it should be sweetheart.” Gaia reassured.</p><p>“Yeah, it is, and it’s absolutely perfect.” Rio said with a smile as she held her daughter close and looked over at her sleeping wife. Life was perfect and she was so happy she got to experience it.</p>
