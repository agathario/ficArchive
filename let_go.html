     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha Harkness is married (unhappily) to her husband Ralph. Her son needs a father, and Agatha has to provide for him, even if that means sacrificing her own happiness.
     </p>
<p>
      Rio Vidal is the drummer in a band. She is unashamedly herself and has a unique way of getting under Agatha’s skin.
     </p>
<p>
      She would be exactly Agatha’s type. If Agatha wasn’t straight, and married.
     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>

     Chapter 1
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     Agatha’s morning—which had started out peacefully with the promise of a quiet day at home enabled by her husband having the day off work—had quickly derailed into chaos.
    </p>
<p>
     Said husband had awoken her at 7:55AM, asking where she had put their son’s packed lunch. She had groggily replied that she made it each morning and so it wasn’t prepared yet.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon checking the time, she had leaped out of bed so fast that her head rushed. There were 5 minutes until her son was supposed to be at school, his packed lunch wasn’t ready, he was wearing two different shoes, and the drive to the school was 10 minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now that you’re up, you may as well take Nicky.” Her husband, Ralph, had said before collapsing back into bed.
    </p>
<p>
     He had insisted that Agatha was ‘better at this stuff’ and she had to agree. That, and she didn’t have time to argue back.
    </p>
<p>
     She made a ham and cheese sandwich in record time, but not without cutting her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     “You said a bad word.” Nicky had giggled while Agatha made sure there was no blood in his sandwich before wrapping a plaster around her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, they hit every red light on the drive to school. Agatha had to fight the strong urge to teach her son some new ‘bad words’ he hadn’t yet heard.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon dropping him off at the school office half an hour late, Agatha hugged Nicky goodbye and watched him walk away in his two different shoes that she had forgotten to correct.
    </p>
<p>
     She decided she needed to collect her thoughts before storming home and starting a screaming match with Ralph. She pulled into the parking lot of a quaint cafe that she had passed regularly on the way to school, but had never found the time to check it out.
    </p>
<p>
     A delightful bell jingled over head as she pushed open the door, the strong smell of coffee and cinnamon filling her lungs as a breath of warm, cozy air enveloped her.
    </p>
<p>
     The person behind the desk had a lovely smiling face and a friendly demeanour, making easy small talk with Agatha, a calming conversation about the snow outside and how cold it had been lately. Agatha felt better already.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, upon turning around with her coffee in hand, Agatha ran directly into the person behind her, spilling boiling hot coffee all over herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, I’m so sorry!” The person squeaked, leaning around Agatha to grab a huge handful of tissues and roughly dabbing at Agatha’s torso.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha remained rigid, silently seething and trying to compose herself. Summoning all the strength within herself to not offload all of her pent-up stress upon this stranger.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, after multiple deep breaths, Agatha placed her hands over the strangers and pushed them away.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine.” She said, in a sharper tone than she had intended.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not! Let me buy you a new one. What did you order?” The other woman insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Least you could do.” Agatha muttered under her breath before supplying her order.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood silently to the side as the woman re-ordered her coffee. The woman was slightly taller than Agatha and she had long dark hair. She wore a green hoodie over black cargo pants and a pair of battered converse. Despite being incredibly annoyed, Agatha found the sound of the woman’s voice to be strangely soothing as she responded to something the cashier had said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here, I’m sorry again.” She apologised as she handed over the coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay.” Agatha said, and she meant it this time.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman offered her an unconvinced smile, before raising her hand in a small wave and walking over to sit at a table in the corner of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     It was then that Agatha noticed there were no unoccupied tables in the cafe. It was a rather small cafe, she assumed it was a family-owned business or something of the sort. It didn’t take a lot to fill the seats, she supposed.
    </p>
<p>
     She briefly considered going home but putting off the conversation she had to have with her husband seemed more appealing. She walked over to the table the woman who had bought her coffee was currently sitting at.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, would you mind if I sit with you? There’s no other seats.” Agatha asked when she arrived at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman simply nodded her head and gestured to the seat opposite her, offering Agatha a warm smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in amicable silence for a while, Agatha quietly nursing her coffee while Rio tapped away at the keyboard of her laptop. Agatha found herself watching Rio in the reflection on the window. She watched Rio furrowing her brow and nibbling her bottom lip. Every now and then, she would see Rio’s eyes dart up to peer at Agatha over her laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’re you working on?” Agatha asked eventually.
    </p>
<p>
     Hazel eyes snapped up to meet her gaze, looking caught off guard. She must have been deeply focussed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh,” Rio replied, “I’m working on a song for my band.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re in a band?” When Rio nodded, Agatha continued, “Would I know you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably not,” Rio laughed, “We only play in bars and stuff at the moment. We’re working on our first EP though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply hummed in response, the pair falling silent again, Agatha turning her head to look back at the window. She watched Rio studying her face for a while before she looked back to her laptop.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to focus on something other than Rio, tried to actually look through the window rather than the reflection. But nothing outside the cafe shop was interesting her, and there was something captivating about the other woman. Agatha found herself unable to look away.
    </p>
<p>
     But eventually her coffee was finished and she could find no further reason to carry on staring at this stranger. She cleared her throat and moved to get up.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could stand fully, a hand shot out to grab her wrist. Rio was staring up at her with panicked eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should come watch me.” She blurted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, watch my band.” Rio shook her head, clearing the panicked look from her eyes, “We’re playing next weekend at a bar near here, the Witches Road.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still holding her wrist, something in Agatha fluttering at the realisation. The woman must have noticed Agatha staring at their connected hands as she slowly pulled away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Um, no pressure. I just— anyway,” Rio rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly, “We go on at 8pm on Saturday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, staring at Rio who was watching her with bated breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe.” She offered with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     That seemed to satisfy Rio whose face lit up as though Agatha had actually confirmed she would be there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled quietly, shaking her head before walking away and exiting the cafe. Just before she climbed into her car, she glanced over her shoulder at the window she had just spent an hour watching Rio through. The dark haired woman, who was already watching her when she turned, gave her a bright smile and a wave.
    </p>
<p>
     A matching grin forced its way onto Agatha’s face as she waved back before finally stepping into her car.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft smile remained on her face for the entire car ride home and she found that her cheeks ached slightly as she pulled into her driveway.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Screaming children running this way and that surrounded Agatha as she waited for Nicky’s class to be released. She stood with her friend, Wanda, whose son was also in Nicky’s class.
    </p>
<p>
     “Long week?” Wanda asked as a particularly loud young girl ran past them screaming.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha shouted.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said, long week?” Wanda repeated louder.
    </p>
<p>
     “You could say that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ralph again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply shot Wanda a look that conveyed ‘
     <em>
      what else
     </em>
     ?’
    </p>
<p>
     “You should come with me to Billy’s concert tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have anyone to watch Nicky.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You have Ralph.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Please.” Agatha scoffed, “You think he’d sacrifice his precious after-work beers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure he can manage one night. They’re only playing for an hour anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed noncommittally, craning to see if she could spot Nicky. She hated school pickup, thank god for the weekend.
    </p>
<p>
     “Y’know what? You can bring Nicky to mine, I’m sure my sitter won’t mind. He and Tommy haven’t had a sleepover in a while anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely. You need a night off.”
    </p>
<p>
     That had been all the convincing Agatha had needed. The next night, she and Wanda arrived at a bar after leaving their sons with Wanda’s babysitter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have we been here before?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think so, why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, “The name seems familiar.”
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced once more at the sign that read ‘
     <em>
      The Witches Road
     </em>
     ’ before pushing open the door and ushering Wanda through.
    </p>
<p>
     They had arrived an hour before Billy’s band was due to go on stage so they could get a drink and catch up.
    </p>
<p>
     They chatted happily, consciously avoiding all husband-talk as so not to ruin the mood. They made a promise to ‘
     <em>
      do this more often
     </em>
     ’, as they did every time they went out together.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually the screech of a microphone interrupted their conversation as a man stepped onto the stage.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot Wanda a questioning look, her friend laughing at her reaction. She quietly explained that this was a gay bar, which stirred something in Agatha that she couldn’t place.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please welcome to the stage, Green Wiccan!”
    </p>
<p>
     Upon raising her hands to join the crowd in applause, Agatha immediately froze. Walking onto the stage, followed by Billy, was the woman who had spilled coffee on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Amidst her stressful week, she had forgotten all about the invitation the woman had given her to see her band perform.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Wanda nudged her, noticing that Agatha had frozen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The drummer? Rio, she’s Billy’s friend.“
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda had wanted to sit close to the stage so Billy could see them. But this meant Rio could also see them, and she was currently directing a huge grin towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman standing at the microphone turned to hiss something at Rio who startled and finally drew her attention away from Agatha. She counted the band in with a few taps of her drumsticks and then they were playing their music.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you know her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember I told you about the person who spilled coffee on me?” Wanda nodded, “That’s her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda burst out laughing, only laughing louder when Agatha slapped her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     Their music was good, Agatha found herself tapping her foot along to the beat. Wanda knew every word, mouthing the lyrics behind her phone as she filmed her son proudly.
    </p>
<p>
     Similar to that day in the cafe, Rio would peek up at Agatha every so often. Agatha found herself yet again entranced by the other woman, almost forgetting there were other people on stage.
    </p>
<p>
     During one particular song, Rio seemed to lose herself to the music. She mouthed along to the lyrics, her eyes shut for the whole song, hair whipping wildly as she played her drums aggressively, struggling to remain sat down. Agatha noticed the woman’s arms were littered with tattoos, a vine of leaves trailing up under the sleeve of her vest, muscles twitching as she played. Agatha couldn’t look away.
    </p>
<p>
     As their set neared the end, Rio’s hair had fallen entirely out of the loose ponytail she had began the set with, strands of hair sticking to her face from the sweat and exertion that came from her enthusiastic performance.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was amazing, I think that was their best one yet!” Wanda gushed while they waited for Billy to meet them. He and the band had disappeared to pack their instruments away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded absentmindedly, anxiously searching the crowd for any sign of Rio. She didn’t know what she was going to say to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom!” Billy appeared, throwing his arms around Wanda’s neck, “Agatha, you finally came!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Teen.” Agatha greeted, laughing as she was pulled into a hug by the boy, “You did good.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Billy released her, Agatha noticed Rio had come with him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Rio smirked, “What did you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That was—“ Agatha trailed off, her mind blank, “You were really good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned proudly as if that was the upmost compliment, “Glad you liked it! And glad you came.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, you know Agatha?” Billy asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened and she leaned over to whisper something in Billy’s ear, upon which he immediately started cackling.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ?” He said between laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      What
     </em>
     was Agatha?” Agatha asked, narrowing her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were the—“ Rio slapped a hand over Billy’s mouth before he could finish his reply.
    </p>
<p>
     “The person I spilled coffee over.” Rio finished, shooting Billy a look before removing her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned, looking between Rio who was smiling sheepishly and Billy who was doing his best to hold in his laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s get a drink!” Wanda clapped her hands, distilling the weird tension.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the band joined them. They introduced themselves as Alice, who Agatha recognised as the singer, and Jen who was the bassist.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio had all but removed themselves from the table. Rio had her elbow resting on the table and her head resting in her hand, her knee up on the sofa so her body could be angled directly at Agatha. In contrast, Agatha laid her arm on the back of the sofa, her fingers grazing Rio’s shoulder every time one of them shifted. They were in their own little bubble.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, did you play the song you were writing tonight?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it’s not done yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s it about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know.” Rio groaned, “Our manager says we need a ballad-y song for the EP, but we don’t really have one. We’re all trying to come up with one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have someone you could write about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not yet.” Rio smiled lazily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, “You have your eye on someone?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes flickered across her face, “Yeah, I met someone pretty recently.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s he like?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio threw her head back and laughed loudly, stopping abruptly when she noticed Agatha frowning at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re serious. Uh, I don’t like men.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, that’s okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snorted, “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence fell over them for the first time since they’d sat down together. Rio reached for her drink, slipping her leg off the sofa so she wasn’t facing Agatha directly anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, who sat across from them, said something to Rio which caused the woman to lean forward and join the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha studied the side of Rio’s face as she interacted with her friends, the tug at the corner of her lips before a smirk graced her face, the way she raised an eyebrow at something Billy had said. The way her nose scrunched when a full-bodied laugh took over her, the hand that glided past her face to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Having a good time?” Wanda nudged her in the side.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally looked away from Rio to turn to Wanda who sat on the other side of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah. I might go home soon though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why, because Rio’s not talking to you anymore?” Wanda teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha furrowed her brow, “No, because I’m tired.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda hummed, smiling knowingly at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do Billy and Rio even know each other? She doesn’t seem as young as him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not, she’s closer to our age than his.” Wanda replied, “They met when Billy used to go busking. Some idiot kids stole his guitar and she chased them down to get it back for him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened, “Really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she’s kind of scary. But she takes good care of him, I trust her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled softly, glancing over her shoulder to look at Rio. At the same time, Rio turned to her and they caught each other’s gaze. Rio offered a small smile before turning back to her friends.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had a frown on her face when she turned back to Wanda.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Wanda asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha worried her bottom lip between her teeth, “Um, random question.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you know you liked women?” Agatha asked in a hushed voice.
    </p>
<p>
     A huge grin stretched across Wanda’s face, “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just curious.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, the way you feel about men, I feel that but for both women and men. It’s that simple.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought about Ralph. It had essentially been an arranged marriage, in that her mother had meddled and pestered incessantly until Agatha agreed to go on a date with her mother’s friend’s son. And then Agatha had fallen pregnant and her mother had insisted she couldn’t have a child out of wedlock. And that was that.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Ralph, Agatha had her fair share of dalliances. Mostly drunken one-night stands. Deep down, Agatha knew each one was just an attempt to piss her mother off. And so, the multiple women she had slept with and brought to family gatherings were merely fuel to the fire, nothing more. Agatha had never really taken the time to think about her feelings.
    </p>
<p>
     “That makes sense.” Agatha said finally.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Billy called, grabbing her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, teen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What was your favourite song we played?” The boy was slurring his words, he’d clearly had enough to drink.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought about the last song where Rio had shut her eyes and looked completely lost in the music, playing more passionately than she had any other song.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably the last one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s my favourite one to play!” Rio chirped from beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled at her, “I could tell.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You just looked like you were really enjoying yourself. It was the only one you had your eyes closed for. ”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened slightly in shock, her chest rising as her breath hitched.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re observant.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of gagging drew Agatha’s attention away from Rio. Billy was hunched over so his head was under the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, we’re going home.” Wanda announced, standing and rubbing Billy’s back, “You coming Ags?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood and rushed to Wanda’s side, helping her to extract Billy from his seat.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand on her shoulder stopped her from following Wanda and Billy towards the door. Rio stood behind her, nervously wringing her hands together.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just wanted to say thanks for coming.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for inviting me, I had a nice time.” Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you like to go out some time? Maybe somewhere I haven’t spilled something on you.” Rio laughed dryly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile faltered, “I’m married.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe I’ll see you at the next show. Billy will definitely drag me to them all now that I’ve been to one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and forced a smile onto her face, “See you around.”

<p>
     Agatha wrapped a towel around her head, dabbing at her wet hair. She’d decided to stay at Wanda’s the night before; Nicky had already been fast asleep when they returned home. That morning, Wanda had volunteered to get Nicky ready to go while Agatha jumped in the shower quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a knock at the door, followed by Billy’s voice, “Agatha, did I leave my phone in there?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced around, seeing Billy’s phone next to the sink. She reached for it to return to him, but he’d left his phone unlocked and her eyes caught on her own name.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t intend to spy, but she was skim reading before she could think any better. It was a group chat titled ‘the coven’ and seemed to contain the entire band.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Rio:

</p>
<p>
<strong>
      I’m sorry but there’s no way that woman is straight, did you see her??
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Another knock on the door made Agatha jump, nearly dropping Billy’s phone, “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, it’s here! Sorry.” She turned the phone off and unlocked the bathroom door, passing the phone to Billy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to forget what she had seen on Billy’s phone, though she couldn’t help but be distracted while she said goodbye to Wanda and her family. She played Nicky’s favourite playlist on the drive home to avoid disappointing her son with distracted responses to his questions.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Nicky spent the rest of the day lounging around the house, watching his favourite cartoons and playing with his toys.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually Ralph got home, having been at work all day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you have a nice night?” He asked when she greeted him at the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it was nice seeing Wanda.” Agatha gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’d you ladies get up to?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Her son’s band had a show.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A band? Isn’t he Nicky’s age?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, “She has two sons. It was Billy, her eldest.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, the girly one.” Ralph snorted.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s a queer, right? Kid was wearing
     <em>
      makeup
     </em>
     last time I saw him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared, “What is wrong with you? You can’t say things like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, you can’t think that’s normal.” Ralph scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t matter what I think, there’s no need.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s not here, no harm done.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Nicky
     </em>
     is around, Ralph.” Agatha hissed.
    </p>
<p>
     “So? Nicky’s not like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t believe you.” Agatha found her voice raising.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t want to argue about this when her son was home.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t do this now. Nicky’s dinner is in the oven, I’m going out for a couple hours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha drove mindlessly, silently fuming. She found herself pulling into the cafe she’d visited at the start of the week. The cashier informed her they were closing in half an hour. She settled into a booth with a cup of hot chocolate and a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nursed her drink silently, staring unblinkingly at a stain on the table. She’d spent the past 8 years trying to convince herself that marrying Ralph had been the best decision for Nicky. She told herself that her son deserved to grow up in a warm home with a happy family. She’d always envisioned a picturesque family scene; her husband and her son throwing a ball outside, sharing tales of their day over a table with a delicious home cooked meal, reading their son a book together before bed.
    </p>
<p>
     For 8 years, she had waited for this to occur, telling herself Ralph just needed more time. Ralph’s career was important to him, he would eventually reach the point in his life where he had time to devote to his family.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time she had questioned whether this would ever happen, she heard her mother’s words in hear ear. Telling her that if she wanted to be happy, she needed to be a dedicated wife. She had to devote her life to her children, and children deserved a father.
    </p>
<p>
     She wondered what her mother would say if she could see just how undedicated Ralph was to their family.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Snapping out of her reverie, Agatha looked up towards the voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, how are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha faltered, looking back down at the table briefly before smiling at Rio, “I’m good, you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You sure?” Rio raised an eyebrow, “You’ve been zoned out for, like, ten minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have you been there?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, “I was sat over there.” She pointed to the corner of the room, “I’ve been working on some songs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded silently, struggling to find the words to continue a conversation. She heard Rio sigh before the woman sat down opposite her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You wanna talk about it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing, I’m fine.” Agatha took a deep breath, “I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You trying to convince me or yourself?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you feel like you’ve achieved what you’ve spent your life working for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus.” Rio exhaled, “Um, I’m making music, that’s something I always wanted to do. I have good friends, I’m open with who I am. I guess I’m sort of there?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, nodding slowly.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I never really had a
     <em>
      plan
     </em>
     . I’m a live-in-the-moment kinda person, I guess. Maybe that’s why I’ve never had anything steady.” Rio laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “From the minute I found out I was pregnant, I’ve spent my whole life just
     <em>
      waiting
     </em>
     for a happy family. I’m starting to think I should’ve lived in the moment a bit more.” Agatha smiled at Rio sadly, watching the laughter fall from the woman’s face, “I realised that I’ve been so focussed on when things would
     <em>
      get
     </em>
     good, that I forgot to find things that were
     <em>
      already
     </em>
     good.”
    </p>
<p>
     The concern in Rio’s gaze was too much to handle, Agatha turned to look across the cafe out of the window. They sat in silence for a while, Agatha had made things awkward. But once she had started talking, she couldn’t seem to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     One of the baristas approached their table, “Hey guys, I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave. We’re closing now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio stood, each assuring the barista not to worry, before making their way out of the cafe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ugh, I’m not ready to go home.” Agatha moaned when she and Rio reached her car.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned against the car door and dramatically threw her head back. Rio stood silently across from her for a beat, before she moved to lean against the car next to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t go home then, let’s go do something.” She said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, letting her head roll to the side to look at Rio, “I probably should go home. Nicky’s got school tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned so her shoulder was against the car and she was facing Agatha straight on.
    </p>
<p>
     “Live in the moment.” She whispered, flashing a cheeky smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt her pulse quicken. She studied Rio’s face, the lines at the corners of her mouth from the lingering smile, the softness of her eyes. No one had ever felt more real than Rio did in that moment. Agatha turned to mimic the other woman’s stance, her shoulder against the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay.” Agatha replied finally, her voice a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     They’d piled into Agatha’s car, Rio cranking up the volume on the radio, yelling how she loved the song that was playing.
    </p>
<p>
     She insisted they both roll their windows down; the song required it, she’d protested.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but spend more time watching Rio sing along to the song than watching the road. It was a quiet night, luckily.
    </p>
<p>
     The wind pushed the hair out of Rio’s face, revealing her side profile. Agatha watched her with a bright smile, the cold wind causing her own hair to whip wildly past her ears. Rio looked so free, her eyes shut and one arm hanging out of the window, her hand dancing with the wind.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio noticed her staring, and the woman shifted in her seat so she could face Agatha. She sang the words loudly, pointing at Agatha and pulling dramatic faces.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      I’ll stop the world and melt with you
     </em>
     .” Agatha sang back finally, laughing at Rio’s delighted smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached across and grabbed Agatha’s hand, holding it tight as they continued to sing. Agatha’s voice gradually increased with volume as Rio’s excitability started to wash over her.
    </p>
<p>
     As the song reached the next chorus, Rio released her hand, Agatha feeling a confusing twang of disappointment. Rio threw her arm out of the window again, directing Agatha to do the same.
    </p>
<p>
     Switching her hands on the steering wheel, Agatha did as she was told. She turned her face towards the window, feeling the wind dancing in her curls, weaving through her fingers. The wind was bitingly cold but Agatha felt warm. It was oddly grounding, yet thrilling all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked out at the wide open road ahead, trees and houses on either side, no other person or car in sight. It was only her and Rio in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     As the song reached its end, Agatha felt the calmest she’d felt in a while. She turned to tell Rio this, but her breath caught when she found the woman already watching her. Her eyes were soft, lips slightly parted, her expression something akin to awe.
    </p>
<p>
     A gentle smile pulled at Rio’s lips when Agatha met her gaze. Agatha smiled back, trying to ignore the feeling of something tugging at her stomach, the warmth under her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned the volume on the radio down as another song came on, and Agatha turned her focus back to the road ahead.
    </p>
<p>
     “How old is your son?” Rio asked after they’d been driving in comfortable silence for a while.
    </p>
<p>
     “Seven. Well, seven and a half is what he’d say.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, “I bet he’s a good kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The best.” Agatha smiled fondly, “He’s the best thing in my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s something that’s already good then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at Rio sharply, surprised she remembered what she had said at the cafe.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re right.” Agatha paused, furrowing her brow, “I just wanted more for him, I guess. I thought I could give him more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Kids deserve a good father. I knew Ralph wasn’t that when we first had Nicky, but I hoped he could become one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t wait around for someone to change.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What choice do I have?”
    </p>
<p>
     “So your plan is to be unhappy for the rest of Nicky’s childhood, on the off-chance that
     <em>
      Ralph
     </em>
     gets his shit together?” The way Rio spat Ralph’s name elicited a snort from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess it does sound stupid when you put it like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     stupid.” Rio faltered, realising her words, “I hope I’m not overstepping.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, “It’s nice to have someone not sugarcoat things.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good. Because not sugarcoating things is my speciality.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flashed an amused smile at Rio. Her eyes caught on the clock as she looked back to the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, it’s late. I really should get back. Where do you live? I’ll drop you off first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No need, I can walk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     They bickered back and forth for a few minutes until Rio finally caved and gave Agatha her address.
    </p>
<p>
     After pulling up outside Rio’s house, Agatha stepped out and rounded her car to meet Rio on the sidewalk. They stood face to face, Rio watching her uncertainly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for tonight, I think I needed something different.” Agatha spoke first.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you ever need anything different again, I’m your guy.” Rio wiggled her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, then opened her arms nervously, beckoning Rio in. Rio stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Agatha, resting her chin on her shoulder. Agatha’s arms fit perfectly around Rio’s waist, pressing her hands against the small of her back. Rio’s windswept hair tickled her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio pulled back, she lingered in Agatha’s space for a moment before stepping back entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te veo.” She said, turning and walking towards her front door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her go, reciprocating the wave Rio gave before she stepped inside and shut her door.

<p>
     Rio’s words were still fluttering around Agatha’s mind the next morning as she got Nicky ready for school.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How many more sleeps till Christmas?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, “Why don’t you go check your calendar?”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky exclaimed excitedly before running upstairs to his room. Agatha had helped him make his own calendar to countdown to Christmas after the boy had asked her  the same question every morning of the first week of December.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to the kitchen counter, resuming preparing Nicky’s lunch. A pair of arms wrapped around her waist as Ralph appeared behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     She groaned and shouldered him away.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re still mad.” Ralph sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you expect otherwise?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to do? I’m sorry, okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going to tell you how to apologise.” Agatha glanced at the clock over Ralph’s shoulder, “You should head to work. You’ll be late.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph stared at her, his expression a mix of anger and confusion. For a second, Agatha thought he was going to continue questioning her. Instead he threw his hands in the air in defeat and stormed out of the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Nicky saying goodbye and Ralph wishing him a good day at school, before the front door slammed shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “Daddy seemed grumpy.” Nicky mumbled when he wandered back into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think he’s just sleepy, honey.” Agatha ruffled his hair, “How many sleeps till Christmas, then?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Twelve!” He yelled, clapping his hands excitedly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, so close!” Agatha grinned, “Go put your shoes on now, it’s time to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hugged Nicky tightly when they reached the school gates, pressing a kiss to the top of his head before releasing him. She watched him sprint towards the school doors.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning Ags.” Wanda appeared at her side.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning.” She pulled her friend into a side hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Late night?” Wanda asked when Agatha yawned loudly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hm? Oh, yeah. I bumped into Rio, we ended up going for a drive.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio?” Wanda raised an eyebrow, “From Billy’s band?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think she writes all her songs at this cafe near my house. I bumped into her there last night.” She paused, “Ralph and I had an argument again, I needed to get out the house.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda sighed, “I’m sorry, do you wanna talk about it? We could grab a coffee.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry about me. I’ve got a bunch of errands to run today anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’m having a little Christmas party this Saturday. You and Nicky are invited, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not Ralph?” Agatha smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda simply scoffed, dragging Agatha into a tight hug, “If you ever need
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     —“
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the week passed by in a blur. The cafe on the way to school had become a ritual, Agatha stopping there every day after dropping Nicky off.
    </p>
<p>
     Save for only a couple days, she would find Rio sitting in the corner of the cafe at her usual table. It had become somewhat of a routine to nurse her coffee opposite Rio, and the days Rio hadn’t been there had felt like something was missing.
    </p>
<p>
     They rarely had long conversations, Agatha content to sit quietly as Rio concentrated on her laptop. Rio’s presence was oddly soothing, Agatha assumed it had something to do with the night they’d gone on a drive. The woman had known just the right things to say, as if she understood Agatha perfectly. It had to have been that feeling of being seen that made Agatha crave the company of the other woman, what else could it be?
    </p>
<p>
     By the end of the week, Rio had began ordering Agatha’s coffee for her. It was a blessing to have the drink already waiting when she arrived. Rio would catch her eye as she stepped through the cafe door and offer her a bright smile, gesturing to the second takeaway cup of coffee sitting next to her own on the table.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversations they did share were filled with funny anecdotes that had occurred in between the times they saw each other; talk of Nicky and Agatha’s plans for the day, and how Rio’s band practise was going. It was surprisingly easy, the conversation flowing as if they were two old friends who had known each other their whole lives.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was slightly saddened when the weekend arrived as she no longer had a reason to drive past the cafe. But today was Wanda’s Christmas party, and that was something to look forward to.
    </p>
<p>
     She dressed Nicky in a pair of blue jeans and a Christmas jumper with a snowman design. Nicky had picked it out himself, giggling loudly over the 3D carrot nose. She wore a red dress with white heels, something festive enough to appease Wanda but not so on-the-nose.
    </p>
<p>
     Tommy squealed loudly when they arrived, immediately grabbing Nicky’s hand and disappearing inside the house.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s been counting down the days till the party ever since I told him Nicky was coming.” Wanda laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicky’s been doing the same.” Agatha replied, “Think he’s forgotten about his Christmas countdown.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda accepted the bottle of wine Agatha brought with her, ushering Agatha towards the living room while she excused herself to put the bottle in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha walked down the hall towards the living room, she heard a laugh that had become familiar over the past weeks. She suddenly felt nervous, running her hands over her dress and pausing to check her reflection in a photo frame hanging on the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon entering the living room, Agatha found the room scattered with who she assumed were Wanda’s friends. She recognised a few of them, other moms from the school. At the end of the room sat Billy and his friends, including his bandmates.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was the first to notice her, as she was leaning against the wall directly opposite the door. Her lips parted, her eyes immediately wandering Agatha’s frame. She took her time dragging her eyes back up to finally meet Agatha’s gaze. Agatha felt rooted to the floor, frozen beneath Rio’s intense stare.
    </p>
<p>
     She allowed herself to mimic Rio’s wandering gaze, to take in her outfit. The woman wore a smart black pantsuit, though the t-shirt beneath the blazer had a festive design. It had what seemed to be mistletoe and words that were obstructed by the blazer.
    </p>
<p>
     When she finally lifted her eyes to meet Rio’s gaze, the woman was smirking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” Billy’s voice rang through the room, the boy finally catching sight of her. He beckoned her over with an excited wave.
    </p>
<p>
     Her feet finally unglued from the floor, Agatha did her best to stroll casually across the room towards the group, offering friendly smiles towards the school moms who greeted her.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy jumped to his feet to throw his arms around her shoulders, Agatha laughing as he nearly toppled them over in his enthusiasm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom didn’t tell me you were coming!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed as he pushed her down into a seat, her arms gripping the chair to avoid falling. She chanced a glance to Rio, finding the woman stifling a laugh. She shot her a teasing glare before Billy stole her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is Eddie.” Billy announced proudly, gesturing to the boy next to him.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re
     <em>
      the
     </em>
     Eddie.” Agatha grinned, “Nice to finally meet you. I was worried he had another imaginary boyfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     A couple months prior, Billy had come to her in desperation, begging her to give him tips on how to woo the boy he liked. It would be too embarrassing to ask his Mom, he’d explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s joking.” Billy said to Eddie before turning to glare at Agatha, “You’re joking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t joke, teen.” Agatha deadpanned.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation moved on then, Agatha happy to settle back and observe the group. She caught Rio’s gaze a few times, though they were sat opposite each other and striking up a conversation would be difficult.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point, Rio leaned back to take a sip of her beer, causing her blazer to fall open. Agatha could finally make out what her shirt said.
    </p>
<p>
     The words across her chest read ‘
     <em>
      Kiss me under the mistletoe
     </em>
     ’ and an illustration of mistletoe was placed near the bottom of the shirt so the mistletoe was just above her crotch. Agatha felt a heat rise to her face and she couldn’t stop the laugh that tumbled from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The group fell silent, turning to Agatha questioningly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fidgeted under the attention of the group, “Sorry, I just read Rio’s shirt.”
    </p>
<p>
     A broad smirk graced Rio’s face and she shifted so her legs hung further off her seat, gripping the bottom of her shirt to straighten it out.
    </p>
<p>
     “You like it?” She asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, eyes flickering back down to the mistletoe, “It’s very festive.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smirk only widened at that, her tongue darting out to wet her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a dare.” Alice chimed in from beside Rio, “Whoever couldn’t come up with a song by the end of last week had to wear an embarrassing shirt the others chose for them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jokes on you guys, I was gonna wear this anyway.” Rio declared sarcastically.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s why I’m wearing this.” Billy groaned, gesturing to his shirt with embarrassment.
    </p>
<p>
     It had a drawing of Santa Claus, accompanied by the words ‘
     <em>
      Big Nick Energy
     </em>
     ’ in large writing. Agatha didn’t know how she hadn’t noticed it right away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted, “That’s so stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy voiced his agreement with Agatha, turning to bicker with Jen and Alice over their choice.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood then, announcing that she was getting a drink and asking if anyone wanted anything. Agatha watched her make her way to the kitchen, before turning back to the group and excusing herself as well.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was pouring a glass of wine for Jen when Agatha reached the kitchen. She leaned against the counter, studying Rio’s back while she thought of what to say.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, that’s why you were at the cafe so much last week.” She said finally, startling Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced over her shoulder, finishing pouring the drink before she set the bottle down and turned to face Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we really need this last song done for the EP. They won’t let us start recording till it’s done.” Rio sighed, “I didn’t want to say it, but I don’t think Jen and Alice’s songs are strong enough, the label won’t want them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, “That’s frustrating.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It is, I really wanted it done before Christmas but that’s not happening.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sure you’ll get it, you work hard enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks, I hope so.” Rio smiled, then said after a pause, “You look good, by the way.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” Agatha felt heat rise to her cheeks immediately, “Thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That dress is something else.” The way Rio’s eyes slipped to her dress made Agatha’s breath hitch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s no mistletoe pun.” She deflected.
    </p>
<p>
     “True.” Rio nodded seriously, “Your outfit is really lacking in the Christmas-themed pun department. You should step up your game.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know Wanda will have put mistletoe up somewhere. Maybe I can fasten some kind of belt with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     A surprised bark of laughter escaped Rio’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then we’d be matching.” Agatha continued, enjoying the feeling of making Rio laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head in disbelief, “Let’s go find that mistletoe then, shall we?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt like a kid as she jogged after Rio back to the party. Just as Agatha had thought, a sprig of false mistletoe hang over close to the snack table. They shared a glance before hurrying over, Rio standing on her tiptoes on a chair to take the mistletoe down. With her arms stretched overhead, her shirt rose up to reveal her lower stomach, which had a tattoo of vines on either side. Agatha looked away quickly, focussing on keeping the chair steady.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey Rio, where’s my drink?” Jen called to the side of them.
    </p>
<p>
     “In the kitchen.” Rio called back, her voice tight as she strained.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’re you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, Wanda asked us to move this for her.” Rio shrugged, throwing a subtle wink down at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand tugged at Agatha’s sleeve and she turned to find Nicky standing at her side, “Mama, me and Tommy are watching a movie. Can I have popcorn too?
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course, sweetheart.” Agatha smiled, cupping the boy’s face, “Do you need help getting some?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Aunt Wanda’s helping us.” He looked up at Rio then, taking notice of what she was fiddling with overhead, “Hey! You’re under mistletoe and not kissing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze, eyes widening, “Um, well-“
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re breaking the rules, mama.” Nicky pouted and placed his hands on his hips in a stern stance.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t have that, can we?” Rio stepped down from the chair, mistletoe in hand.
    </p>
<p>
     She flashed Agatha a cheeky grin and raised the decoration so she was holding it above their heads. Agatha heard her son giggle loudly at this.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, “Well? You want to set a good example, right? Breaking the rules is bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, then stepped forward, settling her hands on Rio’s shoulders and pulling the woman closer so she could press a kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “There. Happy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Very.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her hand for Nicky to high five, which the boy did enthusiastically, grinning from ear-to-ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’m gonna eat popcorn now. Bye.” The boy said then spun on his heel and ran away, Rio snorting as they watched him go.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio shared an amused look, before they both set off on a mission to find something to make their mistletoe belt. They snuck upstairs, stifling their laughter as they crept around, trying not to get caught away from the party.
    </p>
<p>
     They heard the voices of some of Wanda’s friends approaching the stares and Agatha blanched. She hurriedly pushed Rio in the direction of a door, the pair stumbling through and Agatha closing the door behind them.
    </p>
<p>
     The room was dark, the only source of light being the moon through the window. Agatha recognised it as the guest bedroom. She hushed Rio who was laughing, pressing her ear to the door to listen if anyone was coming.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, look.” Rio said in a quiet voice. She held a red ribbon in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned, reaching for it. She slipped the string of the mistletoe decoration over the ribbon, then wrapped the ribbon around her waist, reaching her arms back to fasten it. Rio stifled another laugh at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     The ribbon kept slipping between Agatha’s fingers as she tried to tie a bow behind her back, feeling increasingly flustered under Rio’s watchful gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me help.” Rio said, stepping up behind Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her hands, letting the other woman take over. As she fiddled with the ribbon, Rio’s fingers brushed against Agatha’s back. Her dress was relatively thin and Agatha could feel every press of her fingers. Finally, Rio’s hands stilled, resting against the small of her back for a moment. Agatha held her breath, the warmth of Rio’s hands seeping into her skin through the thin material.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt Rio’s hands twitch, pressing firmer into her back. Then they were gone, Rio stepping back and Agatha turning to face her.
    </p>
<p>
     They stared for a moment, Agatha noticing that the rise and fall of Rio’s chest matched her own ragged breathing. Rio’s tongue swiping across her lower lip pulled Agatha’s attention to her mouth. She watched the tongue disappear before looking back up to Rio’s eyes, finding the other woman’s gaze lingering on her own lips.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio looked back up, the desire in her eyes stole Agatha’s breath. Rio was looking at her like she’d never craved anything more in her life, and Agatha had never felt more wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a tentative step closer, watching shock and uncertainty flicker in Rio’s expression. Agatha took another, more sure step closer and Rio’s lips parted, her breath quickening, the light from the moon silhouetted one side of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Just then, the door burst open and Agatha and Rio leaped apart.
    </p>
<p>
     “There you are! Nicky’s looking for you.” Wanda announced, “Is that my mistletoe?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stilled, hearing Rio laugh to her side. She glanced down at the belt she and Rio had fastened, before looking back up at Wanda helplessly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha felt left out of the Christmas pun fun.” Rio explained when Agatha couldn’t find the words, gesturing to her shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, stop corrupting my best friend.” Wanda glared jokingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, it was her idea!” Rio raised her hands defensively.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama?” Nicky appeared at Wanda’s side, rubbing tiredly at his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, my love.” Agatha smiled, kneeling down and opening her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky ran across the rooms and dove into her arms, “I’m tired.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood, pulling him up with her so she was holding him. She placed a hand at the back of his head, running her fingers through his hair soothingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, let’s get you home.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to Rio, who was watching them with a soft expression on her face. Agatha offered her a small smile over Nicky’s shoulder which the woman reciprocated.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll see you around?” She’d meant it to sound casual, but it had come out as a question.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be at the cafe.” Rio responded.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she stepped forward, peering round to catch Nicky’s attention. The boy giggled immediately upon seeing Rio. She offered him her hand, which he took, and they shook hands enthusiastically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye little man.” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye-bye.” Nicky whispered back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand landed on Agatha’s shoulder, squeezing firmly. Agatha held her gaze and they smiled at each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te veo.”
    </p>
<p>
     And then she left, stepping past Wanda as she made her way back downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s knees felt weak at the exchange, and she pointedly ignored the surprised look Wanda shot her. Her friend was going to question her on this at some point, but that could wait for another day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Say goodbye to Aunt Wanda.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bye-bye.” Nicky said in a small voice, already half asleep on Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for having us.” Agatha smiled when they stood at Wanda’s front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for coming. See you on Monday.”

<p>
     True to her word, Rio was at the cafe when Agatha stopped there on Monday after dropping Nicky at school. She bit back a goofy grin at the way Rio’s face lit up when she noticed her walking towards her table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     They spoke for a while, Rio filling Agatha in on what had happened at the party after she’d left, the mischief Billy and the band had gotten into, the way one of the school moms had basically thrown herself at one of Wanda’s friends.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation came to a natural end, each of them sporting warm smiles, the remnants of laughter. Agatha expected Rio to go back to her laptop then, as their cafe meetings usually went.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, the woman seemed to become nervous, fiddling with her laptop cable. When she spoke, her voice was unsure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we talk about that moment last night?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stilled, her coffee pausing on its way to her mouth, “What moment?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scoffed, “Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a large sip of coffee, taking her time swallowing it, “There was no moment, nothing happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” Rio said slowly, “But it felt like something
     <em>
      might
     </em>
     have if we hadn’t been interrupted—”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m married, Rio.” Agatha cut her off, her voice sharp, “I mean, I’m
     <em>
      straight
     </em>
     , anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     The look on Rio’s face was a mix of confusion and hurt, her eyebrows creasing, her tongue poking the side of her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right.” Rio said finally, shaking her head as if trying to convince herself she was remembering it wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     She broke their gaze then, looking down to her laptop screen, “Right.”
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in silence from then on, Agatha finishing her coffee faster than usual, Rio tapping harshly at her laptop. Agatha faltered at Rio’s side when she stood to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     “See you tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio said simply.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, “I want us to be friends, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her then, offering a tight-lipped smile, “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mind reeled for the whole journey home. She would be lying if she didn’t say she at least knew where Rio was coming from. Agatha wasn’t oblivious, something
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     sparked between them that night, but they had had a few drinks, and she was surely just responding to the feeling of being wanted. Ralph had never looked at her the way Rio had that night, and he’d certainly never made her feel the way she had felt standing under Rio’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was finally ready to admit to herself that she’d been in a loveless marriage for far too long, of course she would crave the affection of the first person to show some desire towards her, regardless of the gender.  It didn’t mean anything, Agatha was just glad Wanda had gotten there before she had done something she would regret, and ruined her friendship with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     When she got home to what she was expecting to be an empty house, she was surprised to hear the sound of the TV playing. She cautiously peeked around the corner, unsure of what she would find.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ralph?” Her husband was lounging on the sofa.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” He exclaimed, “You’re home!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes… Why are you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t a guy take the day off to spend it with his lovely wife?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at him, trying to find the punchline, “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, they cut my in-person hours. I work from home two days a week now.” He stood up from the sofa, “So, I thought we could do somethin’, can’t remember the last time we went on a date without the kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you have in mind?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I dunno, you were always the ideas gal. We can do whatever you wanna do.” He shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fought down the irritation that rose in her stomach. Ralph was just trying to be nice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, today I wanted to get some laundry done, and I have to go shopping for presents and some more decorations. We’re having Wanda and her family round on Christmas Eve, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That doesn’t sound like a good date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s because it’s not a date, it’s the errands I have to run.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph slunk towards her, bringing his hands to settle on her hips, “Blow ‘em off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and covered his hands with her own, pushing them away, “Christmas is right round the corner, I don’t have the time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m tryna be romantic here!”
    </p>
<p>
     “When have you ever tried to be romantic before?” Agatha raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph pouted, “First time for everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so lucky.” Agatha mumbled sarcastically, mostly to herself. She stepped around the man, heading to the laundry room.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that s’posed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed deeply, she should have held her tongue, “Nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     She entered the laundry room, hoping Ralph would drop it. Instead he followed her, irritation bubbling under Agatha’s skin as she tried to remain calm. She took a steadying breath as she attempted to busy herself with preparing the washing machine.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, what’s it s’posed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph gripped her shoulder, tugging her backwards roughly. In doing so, he sent the washing detergent tumbling out of her hands, falling at her feet and spilling over the floor. Something in Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” Agatha yelled, shrugging his hand off and spinning round to face him, “We’ve been married 8 years, I know you weren’t ready for this, but I’ve been the perfect wife, perfectly patient. I’ve waited for you to get your act together and show
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     interest in Nicky.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha—”
    </p>
<p>
     “I never asked you to love me, I just wanted you to love
     <em>
      Nicky
     </em>
     . That kid is the best thing in the world. And I don’t regret meeting you, not for one second, because it gave me him.”
    </p>
<p>
     A shaky sob escaped Agatha’s lips, her emotions becoming too much to bear. She soldiered on, the stress and weight built up over the course of 8 years crashing down on her in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     “But I think I deserve more. I deserve love, don’t I?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love—”
    </p>
<p>
     “No. You don’t. Don’t lie to me, this was never love. This was my mother forcing us together because you have money and she has some fucked up notion that a child needs a father to grow up right. And I listened to her because I was young and scared.” Agatha’s eyes softened, cocking her head as she eyed him, “You can’t be happy either.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you saying?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha faltered, her gaze slipping from Ralph, the words she’d often thought clinging to the end of her tongue. She imagined the outcome if she spoke them out loud, where would she and Nicky go? Would she have to fight for custody, would Ralph be agreeable? And would Nicky be okay, or would he resent her for it? And what if her mother was right; what if Nicky would be screwed up if he wasn’t raised in a ‘normal’ family.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, four words appeared at the forefront of her mind:
     <em>
      live in the moment
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     She looked back up to Ralph, a new sense of assuredness in her tone when she spoke, “I want a divorce.”
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re what!” Wanda shrieked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, smiling apologetically at the people around them who looked their way, “Keep your voice down.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re seriously doing this?” The excitement in Wanda’s voice was palpable.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re gonna wait till after Christmas. Best for Nicky.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Agatha, I am
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     proud of you!” Wanda pulled her into a tight hug, squeezing her before letting her go, “And I’ll be here for you through the whole thing, anything you need. Seriously, I’ll be at your beck and call.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you do all the paperwork? And deal with Ralph?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda slung an arm around her shoulder as they continued their walk around the shopping mall, “You know I would if I could.”
    </p>
<p>
     They continued their Christmas shopping with a newfound enthusiasm, the long lines and bustling crowds seeming inferior in the face of their excitement. Wanda’s giddiness had made the realisation finally dawn on Agatha that this was
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     happening, she was actually going through with it. The joy she felt was too great to be distilled by anything.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the week sped by in a blur, Agatha taking each day with a skip in her step, a permanent smile etched onto her face. If Rio noticed the change in her demeanour, she didn’t say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Christmas Eve rolled around, and the house was decked out in Christmas decorations, glowing inside and out. She bustled around, making the last finishing touches to the living room where her friends would soon be.
    </p>
<p>
     It was supposed to be a quiet gathering, just Wanda’s family joining them. But Billy had politely asked if his band could join them, and Agatha had been in too good of a mood to find a reason to say no. She was looking forward to seeing Rio outside of the cafe again anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy had also suggested they do Secret Santa, which Agatha would normally turn her nose up at the faff it would cause, but again, her joyous mood had dictated no reason to say no.
    </p>
<p>
     The doorbell rang and Agatha rushed to open it, Nicky hot on her heels.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tommy!” The boy yelled, shoving past Agatha to throw his arms around his friend.
    </p>
<p>
     The two boys ran into the house, giggling loudly. Agatha shared an exasperated look with Wanda, before greeting the woman with a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Billy?”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re on their way, they were at band practise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda and Agatha settled in her living room, each with a glass of wine in hand. They alternated between sharing gossip they’d heard at the school gates, and watching their boys play.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually the doorbell rang again, and Agatha stood to welcome the rest of her guests.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon opening her door, she was greeted with Rio at the front of the group. The woman held an extravagant bouquet of flowers.
    </p>
<p>
     “M’lady.” She bowed, holding the flowers out to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed, taking the flowers from Rio’s hands. The woman stood up straight, revealing a satisfied smirk on her face, Agatha pursing her lips to prevent a flustered smile from breaking out. The rest of the band stifled their laughter behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood to the side, ushering the giggling group inside the house.
    </p>
<p>
     The group joined Wanda in the living room while Agatha excused herself to the kitchen. She found a large vase for the flowers, leaning close to smell them, rubbing a petal between her fingers with a soft smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who gave you those?” A voice startled her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to see Ralph standing in the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A friend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph hummed noncommittally, then turned and left in the direction of the living room. Agatha sighed, she had half-hoped he would have made plans to see friends tonight. But she couldn’t exactly ask him to spend their last Christmas Eve as a family away from the house.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha returned to the living room, she found Ralph talking to Rio. A sense of dread formed in the pit of her stomach as she approached them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why’d you give my wife flowers, then?” She heard Ralph ask gruffly when she neared them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry man, did they outdo the flowers you got her?” Rio responded, sarcasm dripping from her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t get her flowers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I see.” Rio pursed her lips, “Maybe you should’ve.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who do you—”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hurried forward, settling a hand on Ralph’s shoulder to interrupt him, “Have you met the rest of the band yet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph shook his head and Agatha pushed him gently in the direction of the rest of the group. She shot Rio a warning look, the woman simply giving her a wink in response, the lazy smile on her lips never wavering.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few drinks and friendly conversation, Billy excitedly suggested they hand out their Secret Santa gifts.
    </p>
<p>
     They went round in a circle, starting with Alice who proudly presented Jen with a hamper filled with beauty products, her friend gushing excitedly over each one. Jen, in turn, gave a perfectly wrapped present to Wanda who thanked her for the mug and warm, fluffy socks.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched fondly as Billy excitedly tore open her gift to him, a set of fancy guitar picks and a second gift which he blushed harshly at and refused to show anyone.
    </p>
<p>
     They carried on round the circle, Wanda gave a gift to Rio, Billy gave a gift to Nicky. They had realised they were an odd number so had thrown Nicky’s name in the mix. Agatha handed Tommy a present she had gotten him so the kids could open presents at the same time, to avoid any jealousy.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, that only left Rio, and Agatha realised with a jolt that the only person who hadn’t received a gift was herself. That meant her gift was from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled a small, neatly wrapped box from her pocket and passed it to Agatha. She removed the wrapping paper carefully, revealing a jewellery box inside, her fingers shaking slightly as she pried it open.
    </p>
<p>
     Inside was a silver necklace, with a delicate charm. Agatha brought the necklace closer to her face and was shocked to find the charm was a beautifully carved azalea flower. They had been her favourite flower ever since she was a little girl playing alone in her mother’s garden.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes snapped to Rio who was watching her with a nervous gaze, “How did you…” She trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     “You mentioned they were your favourite once.” Rio shrugged, trying to act nonchalant but her nerves were evident to everyone else in the room who watched the exchange silently.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips parted, struggling to find the words to say as she stared at Rio in shock.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it?” Ralph asked, reaching to pull the box from Agatha’s hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snatched the box away without thinking, frowning when she caught herself. She turned the box to show to Ralph.
    </p>
<p>
     Agitation rose in her chest as she watched him stare blankly at the box.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s an azalea.” She explained, bringing the box back to her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “My favourite flower.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought your favourite flowers were roses.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at him blankly, “They’re not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was glaring at Ralph when Agatha looked back to her. Something stirred in her chest at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda cleared her throat loudly, doing her best to break the awkward tension, “I don’t know about anyone else, but I need another drink!”
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone responded in kind, taking the opportunity to stand and stretch their legs, some of them heading to the kitchen to help carry the drinks. Agatha smiled at Wanda thankfully, the woman shooting her a knowing wink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio remained seated, still nursing a half-full beer and Agatha moved to sit next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “This was really thoughtful, thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing.” Rio said, but the pride in her expression betrayed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted the necklace from the box and fastened it around her neck. Rio watched her, nodding in approval when she was done.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, Ralph is—”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re getting a divorce.” Agatha blurted, interrupting Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Rio’s eyes widened and her mouth dropped open was almost cartoonish, and Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle at the reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m…” Rio hesitated, “Sorry?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted, “Don’t be. You’ve met him, you should be congratulating me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, congratulations then.”
    </p>
<p>
     They both laughed quietly at that.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was a long time coming. I have to thank you, actually.” Agatha said when their laughter died down, “It was something you said that really pushed me to do it. Y’know,
     <em>
      live in the moment
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Something shifted in Rio’s expression, her eyes searching Agatha’s. There was that familiar warmth and softness Agatha had come to recognise from Rio’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Glad I could help.” She said, her voice barely louder than a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     The night continued without another hitch. Agatha spent some time getting to know the rest of the band, Nicky and Tommy put on an adorable performance of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer for everyone, Billy had insisted on taking over control of the music, the new upbeat songs bringing a lightness to the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Nicky and Tommy reminded everyone that they all needed to go to bed so Santa could deliver his presents. That had been the cue that set everyone packing up to go.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen were the first to leave, thanking Agatha for a lovely night as she saw them out. Wanda and Billy hugged her tightly in turn, wishing her a Merry Christmas before heading out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lingered behind after everyone, busying herself with cleaning the dishes when Agatha found her in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you don’t need to do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio simply shook her head with a smile and continued. Agatha grabbed a cloth and set upon drying and packing away the dishes once Rio had cleaned them.
    </p>
<p>
     They worked comfortably, Agatha drifting around Rio as she put the dishes in their right places, Rio humming along quietly to the songs still playing in the living room. It felt strangely domestic, a scene that she had often envisioned with Ralph but had never come true.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’re your plans for tomorrow, seeing family?” Agatha asked after a couple minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I don’t really see my family anymore. Just a quiet one at home, I think. Might get dinner with the band.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled sadly, “Don’t worry, their loss.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused, furrowing her brow as she dried a plate, “Was it because you’re…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gay?” Rio raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, I shouldn’t have asked. None of my business.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine. Yeah, it was. There’s no story really, they just couldn’t accept it. I’m the one who left, couldn’t deal with having to push that side of myself away.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded in acknowledgment. She thought of the way Ralph had spoken about Billy, and how it echoed certain sentiments her own mother had. Not for the first time, Agatha considered how brave Rio was for being unashamedly herself, and refusing to hide it for anyone. Agatha wasn’t sure that she would have the courage to do what Rio had done. If her own mother hadn’t died a few years ago, Agatha could imagine that her life would still be dictated by her.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they finished in the kitchen, Agatha thanked Rio for her help and led her to the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for having me.” Rio said, her voice soft.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for coming.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at her, and Agatha hesitated before plucking up the courage to lean forward and press a kiss to her cheek. The surprise on Rio’s face made Agatha’s heart flutter, smiling warmly at the woman.
    </p>
<p>
     They wished each other Merry Christmas, and then Rio was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was falling asleep on the sofa when she entered the living room. She scooped him up in her arms and carried him upstairs. He stirred when she placed him on his bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mama?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, my love. Let’s get you into pyjamas.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha perched on the edge of his bed while he dressed, fiddling with a loose thread on his duvet cover. She thought of how quickly Rio had grown to know her, to understand her. Her mind drifted to the image of Rio in her kitchen, how she had fit in so well, how they had worked around each other easily in an almost practised manner.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought about the beautiful gift she received from Rio, and the way her heart had jumped to her throat. It was a more meaningful gift than Ralph had ever given her. She considered the look on Rio’s face when she had told her of the divorce. Agatha was hesitant to label the look as hope, but in truth, that’s what it had looked like.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky only spoke again when she was tucking him into bed, “Is Rio coming to our house on Christmas?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned, “No, what makes you think that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You smile a lot when she’s around, I want you to smile on Christmas.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart lurched, “I smile when you and daddy are around too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky hummed, rolling on his side as Agatha resumed tucking him in. His voice was small and muffled when he spoke, and Agatha almost missed it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not the same way.”

<div>
<p>
     Christmas day went by without any issues, Ralph and Agatha putting aside their tension for the sake of their son. The days following Christmas carried on much the same way, each of them focussing all of their attention on Nicky and avoiding directly conversing with one another. When they went to sleep, Ralph took the guest room and Agatha enjoyed having a bed to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     They knew they would have to sit Nicky down and explain the situation to him at some point, but they had agreed it best to wait till after New Years. They could start the new year fresh, and it would give them some time to consider how they would go about breaking the news gently to Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite knowing it was the best solution for both of them, Agatha couldn’t help but feel guilty for putting Ralph through this. She knew even Ralph would benefit, the man was equally unhappy in their marriage, though he refused to admit it. So, Agatha agreed that he should go out with friends on New Year’s Eve, just she and Nicky would be at home.
    </p>
<p>
     She was looking forward to a night alone with her son anyway, she hadn’t had much one-on-one time with him since Ralph had time off work for Christmas.
    </p>
<p>
     As expected, the night with Nicky was enjoyable. They watched a Christmassy movie with all his favourite snacks, switching the channel to a New Years countdown when it came time. Nicky cheered loudly when the ball dropped, throwing his little arms around Agatha’s neck and wishing her a Happy New Year.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s your New Year’s resolution, mama?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips. Truthfully, her resolution was to be more present, to not focus so much on working towards the future, to spend more time living in the moment. But she doubted her son would very much understand.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’m going to try drink less coffee this year.” She said instead.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good! Your breath stinks when you drink coffee.” Nicky exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha mock-gasped, diving forward to wiggle her fingers at Nicky’s side, tickling him relentlessly as he laughed loudly and tried to escape.
    </p>
<p>
     She released him eventually, the boy catching his breath and dramatically cowering away from her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s your resolution then?” She asked through a chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to eat more chocolate!” He announced, throwing his arms in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha released a bark of laughter, “Is that so!”
    </p>
<p>
     They continued their playful banter, Agatha’s heart swelling with pride. He was growing into an intelligent and funny boy, where had the time gone?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had just tucked Nicky into bed when someone knocked at the door. She frowned, it was far too early for Ralph to be home and who else would show up on New Year’s?
    </p>
<p>
     The door opened to reveal Rio. She was shaking and tears were running down her face, her mascara streaking black marks under her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped, ushering her inside. She sat the shaking woman down in her living room wrapped up in a blanket, before hurrying to make her a hot drink in her kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Rio’s voice was barely audible when Agatha handed her a mug.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in silence for a while, Agatha watching Rio worriedly. Despite having time to warm up, the woman was still shivering, gripping the corner of the blanket to keep it wrapped around her shoulders. Her hair was disheveled at the front, as if she had been anxiously running her fingers through it, and her eyes were red and puffy from crying.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened?” Agatha asked finally.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sniffed, watching the liquid swirl in her mug rather than meet Agatha’s gaze, “I bumped into my cousin at the bar, he told me-“
    </p>
<p>
     A loud sob escaped Rio’s lips, cutting off her words. Agatha leaned forward to take the mug from her hands. Immediately upon having empty hands, Rio covered her face.
    </p>
<p>
     A new wave of tears took over Rio, the woman’s shoulders shaking as she sobbed into her hands. Agatha moved to sit next to her, and tentatively slid an arm across her shoulders. Rio immediately leaned into her, dropping her hands to cling to Agatha’s shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     They remained in that position for a while, Agatha rubbing soothing circles into Rio’s shoulder, Rio burying her head deeper into Agatha’s chest to muffle the sounds of her crying.
    </p>
<p>
     After a while, Rio’s crying subsided, and she sat back, sniffling and rubbing at her eyes. When she spoke, her voice was hoarse and she cleared her throat before continuing.
    </p>
<p>
     “My cousin told me he came out as trans. He said my parents have been really accepting, they’re even contributing towards paying for his surgery.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I should be happy for him. But I can’t stop thinking, why accept him and not me? Why was
     <em>
      he
     </em>
     the one to make them change? I’m their
     <em>
      daughter
     </em>
     ! They told me I was going to hell for liking women, they said if I was going to do it, to do it behind their backs so they didn’t know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart ached, she longed to wrap Rio up into her arms and hold her tight. But before she could, Rio stood, throwing her arms in the air harshly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a terrible person!“
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you’re not.” Agatha stood, “You’re not a terrible person.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I should be happy for him! Why am I not happy for him?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew nothing she could say would reach Rio in this state. So she stepped forward into the other woman’s space, her fingers grazing Rio’s arms as they reached up to pull her into an embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went willingly, collapsing into Agatha’s arms as if she was an oasis and Rio was stranded in a desert.
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed like that for what felt like hours, bodies pressed tightly together, Agatha tracing soothing shapes into Rio’s back, Rio’s arms squeezing her waist so tight like she thought she would vanish at any moment, her face buried in her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point Rio stepped backwards, dragging Agatha with her, pinning herself against the wall under Agatha’s weight.
    </p>
<p>
     With this new angle, Agatha found her face’s natural resting place was the junction between Rio’s shoulder and neck. It was warm and it smelled of Rio, and if she pressed her nose at just the right angle she could feel Rio’s pulse.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, she felt Rio’s pulse slowing as shaky breaths turned steady. She pulled back then to look at the woman. Tear tracks stained her cheeks, strands of hair sticking to the wetness on her face. Her nose was red and a few remaining tears clung to her eyelashes. She looked almost ethereal and Agatha was struck with a strong desire to shield her from the world and never let any harm come to her again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her own fingers trace Rio’s tear-stained cheeks, watched the way they tenderly wiped away the tears. It was as if she wasn’t in control, her body acting on its own accord.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes had slowly opened at the first brush of a finger against her cheek. Deep hazel appeared more beautiful than ever, the light above their heads meeting tears and creating stars that twinkled in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Those eyes were watching Agatha with something unreadable. They danced across her face, as if trying to commit her features to memory. More than once they landed on her lips, and that’s where they rested now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned close, letting her lips press where her fingers had wiped away tears. The skin beneath her mouth was soft and still damp. She pulled back to move across and press her lips to the other cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     She intended to step back then, to ask how Rio was feeling now. Instead she found a soft pair of lips pressed against hers. The kiss was close-mouthed and lingering, the feeling of damp eyelashes fluttering against hers, noses brushing against each other.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha pulled back, Rio’s eyes were still closed. Without the gorgeous hazel to focus on, Agatha’s gaze remained glued to red lips. Her body acting of its own accord again, Agatha leaned in, pressing their lips together once more. The kiss was still close-mouthed, though more insistent.
    </p>
<p>
     The room around them shrunk, the world ceasing to exist, leaving just the pair of them leaning against the wall, bodies and lips pressed close. Rio’s arms wrapped impossibly tighter around her waist, and Agatha’s hands which had lingered where they had been tracing her tears, moved to cup her face.
    </p>
<p>
     One kiss turned to two, two turned to three. Each kiss remained slow and languid, a lazy exploration of something that somehow felt so familiar and
     <em>
      right
     </em>
     . Rio was making small sounds in the back of her throat, and Agatha greedily swallowed each one.
    </p>
<p>
     Until finally Agatha stepped back completely, inhaling harshly like she’d only just realised what was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes snapped open at the abrupt end to their closeness. Vulnerability clouded her vision, her nervous gaze searching Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry.” Agatha’s voice was hoarse. She cleared her throat before speaking again, “I’m sorry, that was a mistake.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed humourlessly, “Way to hit me when I’m down.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m married.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re getting a divorce.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m straight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you keep saying.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, “I’m sorry, you’re upset. I shouldn’t have done that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t say sorry.” Rio’s voice sounded pleading.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved back to the sofa, silently agreeing to move on from what had happened. Agatha suggested they watch a movie, and that’s how she ended up with Rio’s head in her lap, the other woman fast asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     The movie continued playing—Rio had fallen asleep only 20 minutes in —but Agatha paid it no attention. She watched Rio instead, pleased to see the peacefulness on her face, the sadness finally faded from her expression. Agatha ran her fingers through the woman’s hair, gently separating the knots and tangles. She watched the slow rise and fall of her chest, noticed her mouth was slightly parted, one side of her face endearingly squished where it lay against Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha must have fallen asleep too at some point, because when she next opened her eyes, she could see light streaming through a gap in the curtains. She heard someone pattering around the kitchen, Ralph she assumed.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled softly at the person in her lap, leaning down to press a kiss to her forehead, before carefully extracting herself. She readjusted the blanket so it was around Rio’s shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     She greeted Ralph in the kitchen, the man offering a gruff reply. If he had seen her and Rio asleep on the sofa, he gave no indication.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only when Agatha made to leave the kitchen that he spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “You into women now, then?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to gawk at the man, “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The flowers, the necklace, now you invite her round when I’m not ‘ere. I’m not stupid, y’know. Is that why you’re divorcing me? For her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She had a tough night, she just needed a friend and to not be alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph grunted a reply, clearly not believing a word she said. Agatha scoffed, and turned to leave. She headed upstairs to wake Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     The boy was already awake when she entered his room, playing with his toys. She told him Rio was here and warned him to be quiet when they made their way downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     They ate breakfast together at the kitchen table, Ralph having excused himself to go have a shower.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio entered the room after a while, looking sleepy but much more relaxed than the night prior.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Nicky exclaimed, jumping from his seat and running to hug Rio’s waist.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, a surprised expression on her face at the hug, “Hey, little man.”
    </p>
<p>
     She shot Agatha a confused look, which Agatha merely shrugged in response to, smiling fondly as she watched Rio ruffle her son’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s on your face?” The boy asked when he pulled back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicholas!” Agatha chided.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved Agatha off, “Makeup, I was silly and forgot to take it off before I fell asleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can wash it off now!” He grabbed her hand and tugged her out of the kitchen, Rio glancing helplessly at Agatha before disappearing from view.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head in disbelief, her son was usually shy with people he didn’t know. Something about Rio must have charmed him, Agatha supposed she could relate.
    </p>
<p>
     Now that she was alone, Agatha’s mind drifted to the kiss she and Rio had shared the night before. It had felt so intimate, and Agatha felt conflicted about the emotions it was stirring within her.
    </p>
<p>
     If she thought about it logically, she knew what happened made sense. Agatha was stressed from the situation with Ralph and Rio had received some heartbreaking news, they were both emotional and seeking comfort. It was surely nothing more than a misplaced desire for consolation.
    </p>
<p>
     But on the other hand, every time the memory of their closeness flooded Agatha’s mind, her heart fluttered and she felt a deep regret over putting an end to it, and curiosity as to what would have happened if she hadn’t. When she had awoken this morning, her mind had immediately drifted Rio, and she couldn’t deny the joy it brought her when she opened her eyes to find Rio right there in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had just finished tidying up Nicky’s breakfast when Rio appeared in the doorway again. Her hair was tied back and her face was fresh, the tear-stained makeup washed away.
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled warily at Agatha, her hands twitching nervously at her sides. Agatha sighed, they would have to talk about what happened if they were to remain friends. They couldn’t just sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.
    </p>
<p>
     “Feeling better?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.” Rio replied, “I’m sorry for just turning up last night. I didn’t want to be alone but I didn’t know where else to go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry about it.” Agatha waved her hand dismissively, “I’m glad you came to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at that, though she still looked unsure.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should talk about what happened last night though.” Rio’s smile dropped at Agatha’s words.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess we should.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you come over tomorrow, around midday, if you’re free? Nicky will be at school and Ralph at work.”
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Rio may have left that morning, but the memory of their kiss stayed firmly rooted in Agatha’s mind. She couldn’t shake the woman from her thoughts, constantly replaying what had occurred and deliberating over what it meant.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tossed and turned all night, the vulnerable way Rio had looked at her bleached onto the back of her eyelids.  When she climbed out of bed the next morning, she felt exhausted having gotten almost no sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt like a zombie working on impulse as she got her son ready, and faked her way through small talk with Wanda at the school gates. She almost pulled into the cafe on the way home, before realising she wouldn’t be meeting Rio there today.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to keep herself busy till midday, pattering around the house, doing odd jobs. But nothing she did could distract her mind from thoughts of Rio. She stood in front of her wardrobe lamely, stuck on what to wear. She briefly considered wearing the dress she had worn to Wanda’s Christmas party, Rio had liked it.
    </p>
<p>
     She ended up deciding on a nice but casual purple dress that stopped just above her knee and padded back down the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     At 12pm on the dot, there came a knock at her front door. Agatha took a deep breath in an attempt to steady herself, checking her reflection before welcoming Rio inside.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman looked just as anxious as she felt as they settled down on Agatha’s sofa. Rio couldn’t keep still, picking at her nails and bouncing her leg.
    </p>
<p>
     They attempted to make small talk, catching up on what had happened since the Christmas Eve party. But the conversation felt hollow and they both knew they were just putting off the inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a lull in the conversation in which Rio took a deep breath and finally dared to mention what she had come to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, I haven’t stopped thinking about you since that very first day we met at the cafe. I’m gonna lay it all out here and say that I’m crazy about you. I know you say you’re
     <em>
      straight
     </em>
     , or whatever, but you must feel something between us.” Rio had a crazed look in her eyes as she rambled on, her voice sounding desperate, “I can’t be the only one, nothing that’s happened between us would make sense if this was just, I don’t know, a one-sided thing. I mean, we
     <em>
      kissed
     </em>
     , Agatha. That happened. You can’t ignore that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who said I’m ignoring it?” Agatha cut her off.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, who had been speaking into space, finally turned to look at Agatha. She was breathing deeply, and she looked slightly surprised at Agatha’s words. Agatha sighed.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to understand, I do everything for my son. I’ve put my entire love-life on hold to give him a chance at having a father. But then you show up out of nowhere, and suddenly you’re all I can think about. It’s infuriating.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio quirked an eyebrow, “Infuriating?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes! I don’t- I never- I mean, well, I’ve slept with women before, who hasn’t experimented? But that was college, everyone does stupid stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     Annoyance rose in her chest as she watched Rio bite back a laugh, “I hate to break it to you, but straight women don’t tend to enjoy sleeping with other women.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned, rising to her feet and beginning to pace the floor in front of the sofa, “I’m not like you, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s amusement slipped, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You come bounding into my life and make me feel things I’ve never felt, and then act all high and mighty about it!”
    </p>
<p>
     “High and mighty?” Rio repeated incredulously, glowering up at Agatha from her spot on the sofa, her eyes following her pacing.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve completely derailed my life, Rio!” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “How?” Rio yelled back, “What have I done to you that was so bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve made me question
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     . You’ve made me want things that I know I can’t have.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why can’t you have them? What happened to living in the moment?” Agatha hated the way Rio’s voice took a mocking tone.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- I just can’t, Rio. I have a son.”
    </p>
<p>
     “If you want something, all you have to do is ask.” The anger in Rio’s voice dissipated, replaced by something determined and assured.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed bitterly at Rio’s statement, she made it all sound so simple. She was naive.
    </p>
<p>
     “What is it that you want, Agatha?” Rio insisted, a startling intensity simmering in her unwavering gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, Rio’s tone causing her to falter in her pacing. Her lips parted, her composure slipping. An uncomfortable vulnerability washed over her along with the sudden urge to turn and run. Rio rose from the sofa to stand in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me.” Rio insisted, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     “I-” Agatha’s voice broke, a panicked breath rising in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her face, breaking their gaze, seeking some kind of release from Rio’s intensity. Her hands twitched nervously at her sides, her lips pressed in a thin line as she fought to keep the truth from clawing its way out.
    </p>
<p>
     She squeezed her eyes shut tight, trying to compose herself. When she turned back to Rio, the intensity in her gaze had shifted to something softer, the woman watching her with an expression that could only be described as longing.
    </p>
<p>
     That look in those hazel eyes caused something to snap in Agatha, feeling her composure and well-built defences entirely crumbling around herself. When she spoke again, her voice sounded confident and certain, the weight of the admission rolling off her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio released a shaky breath, swallowing thickly as her gaze flickered, “You want me?”
    </p>
<p>
     She took a tentative step forward, a pleased smirk slowly gracing her face. She really was infuriating.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Agatha admitted, surrendering.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved closer, so close that if she took one more step Agatha was sure she would be able to feel the woman’s breath on her skin as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you want me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped and closed the distance, pulling Rio to her roughly, their lips meeting in a passionate open-mouthed kiss, all tongues, teeth, and desperation.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped backwards, Rio following her blindly. Her legs hit the back of the sofa, and she sank into it, dragging Rio down with her to sit on her lap, a knee pressed into the chair at either side of Agatha. Their lips never separated, and they both groaned into each other’s mouths at the new contact.
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed like that for a while, Agatha alternating between stroking Rio’s thighs and palming at her hips. Rio had her fingers buried in Agatha’s curls, playing with the soft hair at the back of the her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, they had to separate due to the need for oxygen. Agatha was quick to bury her face in Rio’s neck, pressing hot kisses to every inch of skin she could reach, inhaling the woman’s scent as she went. She pulled Rio’s earlobe into her mouth, an earring clinking against her teeth. She switched to pressing open-mouthed kisses to her jaw, smirking at the needy sounds Rio was making.
    </p>
<p>
     She tangled her hand in the back of the woman’s hair, encouraging her to turn her head down to connect their lips again. But Rio simply gave her a quick, chaste kiss before scrambling off of Agatha’s lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could protest, Rio had dropped to her knees, maintaining eye contact as she went. She stilled there for a moment, studying Agatha. Then her hands wrapped around her bare calves, a shaky exhale leaving Agatha’s lips at the touch. Rio’s hands dragged upwards, sliding along her legs, trying to make contact with every expanse of skin. Their gaze separated, Rio’s eyes instead tracing her own hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t look away from the woman’s face, watching her eyes darker than usual, her bruised lips, electricity crackling where Rio’s hands worshipped her skin. Finally Rio took a deep breath and leaned forward to press a kiss to the skin below Agatha’s knee, taking Agatha’s involuntary moan at the touch as confirmation to continue. Her hands continued their exploration of Agatha’s legs, her lips following, leaving a trail of kisses wherever her hands touched.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio dared to move above her knees, slipping her hands along the top of Agatha’s thighs, Agatha’s legs falling further apart involuntarily at the touch. From her clumsily seated position and the stretch of her legs parting, Agatha’s dress had ridden up higher, and Rio’s hands and lips caressed the exposed skin. Rio paused when she reached the hem of Agatha’s dress. She rested her cheek against the inside of her thigh as she finally looked up at Agatha again. Agatha released an audible breath when their eyes met, the lust in Rio’s gaze making her feel powerful. She wondered what she must look like to Rio; no doubt she mirrored Rio’s own desire, her face flushed and her pupils dilated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me to stop.” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly. She studied Rio’s face, the parted lips which huffed deep breaths against Agatha’s thigh, the darkened eyes looking up at her like there was no one else in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t.”

<p>
     Agatha’s arm was dead when she awoke. She turned to find that the cause of her arm’s numbness was Rio. A warm feeling of contentedness washed over Agatha, smiling softly at the woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     She carefully extracted her arm, giggling quietly when Rio whined in protest, rolling over to throw an arm and a leg across Agatha and rest her head on her bare chest. She cuddled closer, squeezing Agatha and humming happily.
    </p>
<p>
     The warmth in Agatha’s chest swelled as she tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear, revealing her face. The woman finally opened her eyes, blinking up blearily at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” She whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi yourself.” Agatha whispered back, unable to fight the grin from her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed herself up to plant a kiss on her lips, instead landing on her cheek as Agatha turned her face away.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have morning breath.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t care.”
    </p>
<p>
     With a huff, Agatha allowed herself to be kissed, humming as she sank into it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ew that was gross, go brush your teeth.” Rio said when they parted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, shoving Rio away teasingly, the woman laughing as she rolled off of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to get Nicky ready for school.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nooo, stay in bed.” Rio complained as Agatha stood, suddenly changing her mind at the sight of Agatha’s bare behind, “On second thoughts, you can get out of bed. But don’t leave.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to slap Rio on the shoulder, before reaching for her robe. Rio’s boos in response to Agatha being covered made her laugh, shaking her head in amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been sleeping together for a few weeks now. They were yet to put a label on anything, and had decided to not tell anyone yet while it was still early days, preferring to enjoy having each other to themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Ralph’s divorce was well underway. They had told Nicky, and the boy had been surprisingly mature about it. He had agreed that two people could love each other but be better off apart. They’d told him that their love for him was stronger than anything, and that would never change, and Nicky had given them a look that conveyed something along the lines of ‘
     <em>
      well, duh
     </em>
     .’
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph had moved out quickly after that, crashing on a friend’s couch while he searched for an apartment. They’d agreed that it would be better to keep Nicky where he was comfortable. Ralph had been surprisingly amenable through the whole thing, Agatha was pleased to see. Maybe he had finally realised this was for the best, that being in a loveless marriage was horrible for the both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio and Agatha’s daily coffee dates still took place—albeit with a lot more flirting—they had taken up another routine. Rio would come over to Agatha’s house most nights after Nicky was in bed, and would leave while Agatha was taking him to school. They agreed that clueing Nicky into their new relationship while his parent’s divorce was still fresh was too much to put onto the boy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt guilty to admit that she couldn’t wait till Ralph got his own place, so he could take Nicky away some weekends, and she and Rio could have the house to themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     Speaking of having the house to themselves, Agatha had arranged for Nicky to have a sleepover at Wanda’s house at the weekend, and the following week dragged on slowly as she counted down the days till Friday.
    </p>
<p>
     The Thursday before Rio was due to come over, the band was playing a show at a small event in a park. There were a few local bands playing, two were scheduled to play before Green Wiccan took the stage, and she and Wanda had arrived during the first act to secure a place close to the front. Wanda laid out a picnic blanket when they arrived, the pair of them chatting aimlessly and enjoying the music.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Green Wiccan was announced and she and Wanda stood, cheering loudly as the band arrived on stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was wearing a green hoodie and black cargo pants that Agatha recognised. Though when she took her seat at the drums, she pulled the hoodie over her head, revealing a tight white tank top.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth dropped open briefly before she caught herself. The top revealed Rio’s toned tatted arms, and Agatha was almost certain the woman wasn’t wearing a bra beneath the shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waved when she caught sight of them, a cheeky smirk on her face that made Agatha aware that she knew exactly what she was doing. Rio played with her usual enthusiasm, the enjoyment evident on her face. She always looked so at home on stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Near the end of their set, Alice announced they were debuting a new song, teasing the album they were working on. The crowd cheered loudly and Agatha felt a swell of pride. The band had garnered an impressive following from playing in local bars and releasing covers on YouTube.
    </p>
<p>
     This new song was slower than their usual stuff, and had a sensual undertone. The lyrics Alice started singing confirmed that this was a song with more obvious adult themes.
    </p>
<p>
     As the song reached its climax, the rest of the band—Rio included—leaned forward to their microphones, joining Alice in singing the chorus in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made direct eye contact with Agatha as she sang. It was a dangerous move; their relationship was supposed to be a secret. But no one that mattered was paying her any attention, Wanda’s eyes were glued to her son and the rest of the band were facing the audience.
    </p>
<p>
     Friday could not come fast enough.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lasted all of 10 minutes with Rio in her house, before she had shoved the woman against her kitchen counter and kissed her fiercely.
    </p>
<p>
     “You were so hot yesterday.” She growled against Rio’s lips in between kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah?” Rio replied smugly, returning Agatha’s fervour enthusiastically.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped Rio’s hips and lifted, the woman jumping to help manoeuvre herself to sit on the counter. She wrapped her legs around Agatha’s hips and her arms around her neck, dragging her impossibly closer.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about it did you like?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, laughing gleefully as Agatha chased her lips, “Nothing more specific?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned, dropping her forehead against the side of Rio’s jaw. She was aware she was being teased, but she was too far gone to care, and she knew Rio wouldn’t shut up and kiss her till she got the response she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “That shirt.” She said in a defeated tone.
    </p>
<p>
     “My shirt?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, “Your arms.”
    </p>
<p>
     “My arms? You’re just listing random things here, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That shirt shows your arms off, they’re so distracting when you play. And the shirt was
     <em>
      white
     </em>
     , Rio.” Agatha leaned back then to meet Rio’s gaze, “You know what happens to white clothes when people sweat.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, leaning forward to press their foreheads together, “Tell me what happens.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were on that stage, all those people looking at you with your
     <em>
      arms
     </em>
     and that
     <em>
      shirt
     </em>
     , but all you looked at was me.” Agatha finally admitted in defeat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back, her gaze softening in surprise. She moved a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s face, gently cupping her cheek and pulling her into a sweet kiss. The kiss didn’t stay sweet for long, eventually returning to the desperate intensity they had been kissing with before.
    </p>
<p>
     They had eaten dinner late that night, other things had felt more important. Other things which had resulted in them tumbling into bed, followed by a shared shower.
    </p>
<p>
     The next morning, they were making the most of the rare opportunity to spend time lounging in bed together. They were sharing lazy kisses between easy conversation when Agatha’s phone rang.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled away from Rio to answer, laughing at the woman’s protests. Rio latched onto Agatha’s neck as she answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi Wanda, is everything okay?” She asked, trying to maintain a level voice, which proved difficult at Rio’s ministrations.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did I wake you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you sounded weird. Anyway, I’m sorry to do this but something’s come up and I’m gonna have to drop Nicky off early. I’m on my way now, I’ll be there in five.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blanched, Wanda hanging up before she could respond. She stared blankly at her phone screen for a moment, before bolting out of bed, accidentally elbowing Rio in the chin as she went.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ow, what the fuck?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda’s on her way!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay?” Rio frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “She can’t know you’re here.” Agatha panicked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? She knows we’re friends. We can just say I had one too many and stayed over.” Rio wiggled her eyebrows, “She doesn’t need to know we shared a bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re right.” Agatha breathed a sigh of relief, “You’re right. Okay, you go pretend to be asleep in the guest room, or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio laughed, “Don’t be ridiculous, I’ll come down with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No!” Agatha snapped, “Just go to the guest room.”
    </p>
<p>
     The wounded look on Rio’s face filled Agatha with guilt. She took a deep breath to try distill her anxiety.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, okay? I’m just not ready to tell anyone about this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “People know we’re friends, Agatha.” Rio said slowly, as if talking down a frightened animal, “Friends hang out.”
    </p>
<p>
     That’s how Rio ended up in her living room while Agatha answered the door for Wanda. She’d expected Wanda to be in a hurry, so had thought she could just collect Nicky and his things, and Wanda would be on her way without ever having to see Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, the woman bustled past Agatha, immediately setting off on a rant about football practise and last-minute time changes. Only when she reached the living room did her rant come to an abrupt halt.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” Rio waved sheepishly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you sleep here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.” Agatha said, at the same time Rio said “Yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda looked between the two of them curiously, frowning at the warning look Agatha shot Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway, you have football practise to get to, don’t you?” Agatha ushered her friend towards the door, “Wouldn’t want Tommy to be late.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s shock at seeing Rio enabled Agatha to manhandle her out the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     “See you on Monday. Bye Wanda!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shut the door on Wanda’s confused face, taking a break to lean against the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     When she returned to the living room, she found Rio and Nicky on the sofa. Rio was laughing as Nicky regaled what he and Tommy had gotten up to at their sleepover.
    </p>
<p>
     The warmth in her chest at the sight was immediately replaced by panic when her son asked why Rio was here.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me and your mom had a sleepover too.” Rio replied simply.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, and Rio has to go now.” Agatha included herself in the conversation, stepping towards the pair.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky pouted, “Aww, can’t she stay and play?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, can’t I play?” Rio mimicked Nicky’s pout, humour evident in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, you have that important event to get to, remember?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face fell at the seriousness in Agatha’s tone, taking the hint.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah, I do.” Rio said monotonously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you come play another day then?” Nicky asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you ask your mom about it later?” Rio suggested, ruffling the boy’s hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put on a TV show to distract Nicky while she and Rio went upstairs to pack up her things and say goodbye.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe we should tell Nicky about us, I think he’d be on board. The kid likes me, and it’d make things easier.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know what’s best for my son, he’s not ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow at her clipped tone, “He’s not ready, or
     <em>
      you’re
     </em>
     not ready?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to tell him, that we’re fooling around? This—“ Agatha gestured between them, “—Isn’t even anything to tell.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Agatha. You can’t tell me this is nothing, you can’t tell me you
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There is nothing between us, Rio. We’re friends, you said it yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said people know we’re friends, not that we
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     . We’re clearly more than friends, I’ve slept in your bed nearly every night this month.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe we should slow down.” Agatha snapped, “Until everything is done with Ralph.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes, “You can’t be serious.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t even know if this is something I’d want if it wasn’t for the divorce.” The words felt wrong on Agatha’s tongue, but she couldn’t seem to stop them from spilling out of her mouth, “I think I just needed some comfort to get me through it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re calling me a
     <em>
      rebound
     </em>
     ? Please, Agatha, stop lying to yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not a rebound, just a distraction.” She raised her voice, hating the way Rio flinched, looking as if she’d just been slapped.
    </p>
<p>
     “A distraction?” Rio echoed, her voice breaking.
    </p>
<p>
     They stared at each other in silence for a while, Rio’s incredulous expression starting to get on Agatha’s nerves. Agatha scoffed and rolled her eyes, looking away from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Y’know what, Agatha? I had enough of this bullshit in high school.” Rio’s voice had a mocking tone but the tears in her eyes gave her away, “Call me when you’re ready to act like a grown up and stop treating me like I’m some secret you’re too ashamed to admit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha remained rooted to the spot as Rio resumed packing her bag, shoving her things haphazardly inside. She stayed there until she heard Rio call a goodbye to Nicky and the front door slamming shut.
    </p>
<p>
     With Rio gone, she finally broke down, tears immediately falling freely from her eyes, her shoulders heaving as she held her tongue to keep from sobbing loudly. She rushed to her bathroom, running the tap and throwing cold water over her face, gasping at the shock.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think?” Wanda asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blanched, she hadn’t been listening, “Um…”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes, “Are you okay, Ags? You seem down.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m fine, it’s just the stress of the divorce and everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, you’ve seemed so much happier the past month. That wouldn’t have anything to do with…” Wanda trailed off, hesitating as she eyed Agatha, “Rio, would it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed, perhaps too quickly to constitute a normal reaction, “What would Rio have to do with it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You got really close really fast, the divorce is moving quickly considering you’ve been putting it off for years. Then she’s staying at yours when I have Nicky.” Wanda shrugged, “It’s not hard to put two and two together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re friends.” Agatha said and the words stung her tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda hummed, dropping the topic, though Agatha could tell she wasn’t convinced. She silently thanked her friend for letting it go, Wanda had always had a secret ability to read Agatha better than anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     Twenty minutes later, Agatha sat in her car, staring anxiously at the cafe across the parking lot. She hadn’t met Rio here in over a week, unsure if the woman would even want to see her. But saying her name out loud to Wanda had made her realise just how much she missed their coffee dates, and more so Rio’s company.
    </p>
<p>
     She had nearly pulled into this parking lot multiple times during the past week on her drive home from school, but had always decided against it, letting her fears get the better of her.
    </p>
<p>
     A memory of one of the first conversations she’d had with Rio had appeared in her mind last night. How Agatha had said that she’d spent her life waiting for things to get good, and ignoring the things right in front of her that already were.
    </p>
<p>
     Mind made up, she got out of her car and crossed the parking lot to the cafe before she could find a new excuse not to go inside.
    </p>
<p>
     A wave of relief washed over her when she saw Rio sitting at their usual table, her back to the door. Even knowing Rio kept coming to the cafe gave Agatha hope, and just the sight of the woman she’d grown deeply fond of calmed something within her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ordered a coffee, careful to keep her voice down so Rio wouldn’t notice she was here yet. She approached the table slowly, a sense of dread settling in the pit of her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     “This seat taken?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s head whipped up, startled, eyes widening at the sight of her. She quickly schooled her shocked expression into something more aloof, shrugging and gesturing to the seat opposite her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze never left her as she settled into the chair, following her every move with her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’ve you been?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, I picked up the divorce papers yesterday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, her expression remaining calculatedly unbothered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just came here to say that I, well,” Agatha cleared her throat, shifting uncomfortably, “I miss you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Though she tried to fight it, Rio’s face softened of its own accord and she sighed, “I miss you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can we, I don’t know, be friends? At least until the divorce is over.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyed her, studying her face. Agatha fiddled with her cup of coffee anxiously as she waited for a response. Rio’s gaze was intense and deliberating, watching Agatha shift nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     She finally spoke, “Is this actually going anywhere? Are you
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     gonna want to tell people?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips parted but she remained quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Will you ever tell
     <em>
      Nicky
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Letting out an exasperated breath, Agatha finally replied, “I don’t know Rio, there’s too much going on to think about that right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a fairly simple yes or no, Agatha. Are you or are you not ashamed to be dating a woman? Will you ever want to tell people, like you said you would after the divorce?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated again, unsure of what to say. She suddenly felt like she was being interrogated, and the anxiety under her skin bubbled hotter.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, “I care about you so much, Agatha. And I get that this is hard for you, I would be more than willing to wait till you’re ready. But I need to know there will be a time when you
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     ready.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waited, staring at Agatha expectantly. When she didn’t say anything, instead dropping Rio’s gaze to watch the coffee swirling around in her mug, Rio continued.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t be with someone who can’t even admit to herself that she’s not straight, I can’t be someone’s secret. I owe it to younger me to know I deserve better than that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood, downing her drink in one gulp and gathering up her laptop hastily, “I think I’ll always want you, if I’m being honest. If you ever feel brave enough, call me and we can do this for real.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her walk away, panic rising in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” She called, rushing to stand to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused at the door, turning to look back at her. Agatha glanced around, noticing the cafe’s patrons staring. She faltered at the attention, looking back at Rio helplessly. Seeing the hesitance in her expression, Rio shook her head in defeat and left the cafe.

<div>
<p>
     It had been around four months since Agatha had last seen Rio, and she no longer thought of the woman.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the lie she would tell to herself as she shook Rio from her thoughts. In truth, the memory of Rio was haunting her. Anytime she wasn’t distracted, there Rio would be at the forefront of her mind. While doing the dishes, there was Rio. While driving Nicky to school, Rio. On the sofa as she watched a movie with her son, in bed when she couldn’t fall asleep, first thing in the morning when she woke up, in the shower, at the school gates, everywhere she went, everything she did, Rio was there with her in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt like she was being haunted. Either that, or she was going insane. Both seemed plausible.
    </p>
<p>
     One good thing to come from the past few months, was that her and Ralph’s divorce had been finalised. Agatha was finally free. Ralph had gotten his own place, and Agatha now had every other weekend to herself. This turned out to not be as enjoyable as she had expected; it was a lot harder to keep Rio off of her mind without a needy seven year old demanding her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d resorted to spending most weekends with friends. More often than not, she would settle on bothering Wanda, visiting the woman at her house or inviting her and Tommy to a walk in a park. Agatha knew it was obvious what she was doing, and she was long overdue a Wanda-interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was currently sitting opposite said woman at her kitchen table. Wanda had asked Billy to take Tommy out so she and Agatha could ‘have a chat’. That should have set warning signals off in Agatha’s head, but for some reason she had thought nothing of it, just happy to have Wanda to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Billy’s band is doing really well. Their album is almost finished. They’re thinking of going on a small tour around the state in a couple months, once the album releases.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. She knew her friend well, and her overprotectiveness had often been the root of discord between her and her eldest son.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re okay with that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda shot her a look, as if to say ‘
     <em>
      of course not!
     </em>
     ’
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, Rio will be there. She’ll make sure they’re all safe.” she said instead.
    </p>
<p>
     At the mention of Rio’s name, Agatha bristled.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda caught the shift within Agatha, “Are you ever going to tell me what happened between you two?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing to tell.” Agatha shrugged, smiling sadly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know you can tell me anything, Ags. I love you no matter what.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What if I told you I wanted to kill her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’d ask you to at least find a new drummer, for Billy’s sake. Then I’d help you hide the body.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chucked at her friend’s antics, shaking her head fondly. Wanda was right, she had been there for Agatha through everything. She had a secret talent for never putting words in Agatha’s mouth, despite knowing exactly what it is Agatha needed to say, somehow drawing admissions out of Agatha of her own accord. And Agatha always felt better for it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t even know where she came from, it’s like she dropped out of the sky and forced her way into my life. And I let it happen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda’s face softened but she remained silent, waiting for Agatha to continue.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t work out if I’m better off having known her. I mean, I’d known her for, what, two months? And suddenly I was getting a divorce.” Wanda gave her an incredulous look and Agatha rolled her eyes, “Okay, okay. I know, it would’ve happened eventually anyway. But now I have all these questions about myself. Like, does this mean I like women? Or do I like men and Rio is just an exception, is that a thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ags, I know you like to pretend you’ve forgotten about it, but need I remind you that you and I didn’t start out as friends?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips, pointedly avoiding Wanda’s gaze. It was true, their first meeting had been a drunken tryst, and they’d remained each other’s main source of distraction and companionship for multiple years before finally deciding they were better as purely platonic friends. It had been good for Agatha at the time, a space to forget about her issues with Ralph, and Wanda had needed someone to lean on following her husband’s passing. But it turned out that they provided each other more comfort as friends. Wanda was also right again, Agatha liked to pretend she couldn’t remember it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not stupid, Agatha. This is gonna sound harsh, but you need to get over yourself. Your mom was awful, and her views were stupid and misinformed, but you
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     she was wrong. You can’t use it as an excuse to repress this part of yourself. It will eat you alive.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed deeply, opening her mouth to respond but being cut off by the sound of the front door slamming shut.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Billy’s voice called.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda gave Agatha an apologetic look, “We’ll talk about this later, okay? I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     She called out to her son then, letting him know they were in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy appeared at the door, an apprehensive look on his face. Tommy bounded in after him, leaping into his mother’s arms. She released a disgusted yelp.
    </p>
<p>
     “What did you do to him? He’s filthy!”
    </p>
<p>
     “He wanted to jump in puddles!” Billy cried.
    </p>
<p>
     “So you let him roll around on the ground instead?” Wanda stood, her clothes now covered in mud.
    </p>
<p>
     She grabbed her youngest son’s hand, the boy complaining and struggling to get away as Wanda ushered him up the stairs to get out of his dirty clothes and take a shower. Agatha shared an amused look with Billy as he took a seat at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “I hear your album’s almost finished.”
    </p>
<p>
     The boy’s face lit up, “Yes! We just have a couple more songs to mix, then we’re all set to release.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So you got that ballad down, then?” At Billy’s questioning gaze, she elaborated, “Rio told me you were all struggling with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     He paused, looking briefly down at his hands before meeting her gaze again, “Rio’s song is actually the one we ended up using.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned, “I thought it was between Alice’s and Jen’s. Rio said she still hadn’t written anything she was happy with.”
    </p>
<p>
     Billy seemed a bit taken aback by Agatha’s extensive knowledge. Rio must have been telling the truth when she said she hadn’t told her friends anything of their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, Rio won’t tell me but I’m not blind, I know something happened between you two. She used to ask about you a lot and she doesn’t anymore. When she stopped mentioning you, that’s when she finished the song. She won’t admit it, but I think it’s about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt like she’d had all the wind knocked out of her. She stared at Billy unblinkingly, unsure of how to respond. The boy pulled his phone out of his pocket, fiddling with it before setting it on the table and sliding it across to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “We haven’t finished mixing it yet, but I think you should hear it.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a video on the screen, the play button yet to be pressed. Agatha stared down at it, deliberating over whether to watch it or not. Her curiosity eventually won out over her hesitation, and she pressed down on the play button.
    </p>
<p>
     The video started shakily, the phone being leaned against something. The person propping the phone up stepped back, revealing themself as Billy. He gave the camera a goofy thumbs up before hurrying to pick up his guitar. The whole band was there, in what seemed to be a garage. They had all of their instruments set up and Agatha assumed the garage belonged to either Alice or Jen, and this was where they did most of their rehearsing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been so focussed on the background, that she’d failed to notice till now that Rio wasn’t at her drum kit. Instead, she was standing in front of the microphone, and Alice, the usual singer, was stood behind a keyboard. Alice started playing, the others joining in on their instruments. And then Rio leaned into the microphone and started singing. Agatha felt all the air leave her lungs, she had never heard Rio sing, aside from harmonies supporting Alice that Agatha could never entirely make out.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Is it bad to have hope?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      It’s just the way I feel,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I want you to love me,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      But it’s really no big deal
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice was breathtaking, and Agatha’s heart ached as she watched the video. It was filmed from far away, but Agatha could tell that Rio was emotional. She held her eyes closed, sadness seeping into her voice as the song went on. The music swelled as they reached the chorus, Rio reaching up to grip the microphone close to her mouth and starting to sway from side to side as she sang.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      And it’s okay if you wanna let go,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      If there’s no way for me to make you stay,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      But I like your love and if you like mine
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Then you’ll come back to me in your own time
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt tears rising to her eyes and she sniffed quietly, fighting to keep them from spilling over. The lyrics rung true to what Rio had said to her the last time they had seen each other. Maybe Billy was right, the song was about her.
    </p>
<p>
     The music reached a climax, Rio’s voice taking on a new tone, her voice sounding almost pleading. Her hands were fidgeting with anything they could touch, switching from wrapping around the microphone, to lowering and rising the stand, to running her hands through her hair. She was restless and nervous, Agatha hated seeing her so distressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Wasting my whole world around you, ease my mind, ease my mind
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Give me something better to do, I’ll be fine every time.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     God, Agatha missed her. She missed her dry humour, her infuriating smirk, her lips, the softness that only appeared in her eyes when she looked at Agatha. With a shaky exhale, Agatha realised in that moment that she would give anything to have one more café date with Rio, to just see the woman in person once more, to be able to reach out and touch her and to hear her laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     The song ended, and Rio stepped away from the microphone, turning so her back was to the camera. She dropped her head into her hands and her shoulders hunched, Alice and Jen stood and made their way to her side while Billy in the video rushed over to pick his phone up and stop recording.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up from the screen and passed the boy his phone back. Overwhelmed by her revelation, Agatha stared off into space, her mind blank as she tried to process everything. Rio’s beautiful voice, the haunting lyrics, the sadness in her performance, Billy’s words earlier suggesting that Rio was just as affected by their separation as Agatha was.
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha didn’t know better, she would accuse Wanda of setting her son up to try get Rio and herself back together. She wouldn’t put it past the Maxmioffs.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know she could sing.” Agatha’s voice sounded foreign to her own ears, her vision still blurred as she stared at nothing in particular.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed absentmindedly. Only when she looked up to give Billy a real answer, did she realise her eyes were damp. She harshly rubbed the tears away from under her eyes, shaking her head and letting out a forced laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, yes, I’m fine. Just an emotional song.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dismissed the boy’s concerned look, switching the topic to something that would take the attention away from her reaction. They chatted amicably for a while before Wanda rejoined them. If her friend noticed the new sadness in her eyes, she didn’t say anything. Agatha only stayed with them for another half hour before making up some lame excuse about needing to get home and get the house ready for Nicky’s return. She knew neither of them bought it, but she ignored the fact, grateful for an escape.
    </p>
<p>
     On her drive home, Agatha’s curiosity and pent-up emotion from the conversation with Wanda and the song Billy had shown her had her pulling into a familiar parking lot. She crossed the lot with a newfound confidence, the bell ringing over head as she entered the café.
    </p>
<p>
     But when she turned to Rio’s usual table, Rio was nowhere to be found. Another couple occupied the table instead. A glance around the café confirmed that Rio wasn’t here. Agatha felt stupid, what had been her plan anyway? The truth was, she hadn’t had a plan. She had just wanted to see Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She ordered her usual coffee to-go and clambered back into her car, setting off on her drive home to an empty house.
    </p>
<p>
     Time sped by in a blur from then, the months slipping by. Agatha started collecting various distractions like it was a hobby in itself. She joined a book club in which she attended all of three sessions, she took up gardening, finally putting some effort into her much neglected backyard. She planted beautiful flowers, only to watch them wilt away when she eventually lost the motivation to tend to them. She finally signed Nicky up to after-school soccer that he had often shown an interest in, though the soccer moms were dull and shallow and she quickly grew to dread Wednesday afternoons.
    </p>
<p>
     On the occasional Nicky-free weekend that Wanda happened to be busy, Agatha would end up in a bar, drinking to pass the time. She soaked up the attention men gave her, flirting back only for the feeling of being desired.
    </p>
<p>
     One weekend, Agatha had found herself in the bar where she had first seen Green Wiccan perform. Only when a dark-haired woman approached her did she remember what Wanda had told her; that this was a gay bar. Agatha had entertained the woman’s flirting, enjoying the playful banter. She had dark hair, hazel eyes, and was slightly taller than Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     When she had first approached her, Agatha’s heart had skipped a beat, thinking for a second that Rio was in front of her. Agatha had taken the woman home that night. She had tried to lose herself in the throes of passion, though she inevitably wound up thinking of Rio, wishing to be with the woman instead, and feeling a strange sense of guilt.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky’s birthday rolled round, Agatha’s house filled with chaos as five 7-8 year old boys piled in for a sleepover. Tommy was one of the boys, of course. Agatha had asked Wanda to help her cope with the mayhem ahead of her, but the woman had declined, explaining that she wanted to spend time with Billy. It was her last night with him before his band went on tour. The album had proved more successful than they had anticipated, so the tour had been stretched to multiple states, and the band would be out of town for a fortnight.
    </p>
<p>
     That news had shaken Agatha, the knowledge that Rio would be miles away making her feel inexplicably uneasy. The idea that Rio would be off having adventures, performing for crowds of people that had paid to see them should have made Agatha feel pride and happiness for her old friend. But instead it made her feel a deep loss, the realisation that she truly wasn’t a part of Rio’s life anymore finally hitting her.
    </p>
<p>
     The day before the band was due to return home, Agatha visited Wanda. The pair sat in her living room, Agatha enamoured by her friend’s excitement over having her son back home so soon.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s been so busy, he’s barely had the time to talk to me! I just hope he wasn’t getting up to anything too bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s a good kid, I’m sure he’s just been working hard.” Agatha half hoped she was wrong, looking forward to drawing tales of crazy parties from the boy’s lips when he arrived home.
    </p>
<p>
     “They have their last show tomorrow at the Witches’ Road, where it all began.” She paused, eyeing Agatha, “Do you want to come?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed warily, “I don’t know, it might be too weird.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on! Billy will love it if you were there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t wanna make Rio feel uncomfortable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a big girl, and you won’t be there for her anyway. You’ll be there for Billy…” She trailed off, seeing that she wasn’t being convincing, “… And me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot her a look, her friend knew how exactly how to guilt trip her.
    </p>
<p>
     So Agatha found herself at the Witches’ Road yet again, fidgeting anxiously with the straw in her glass as they waited for the band to take the stage. Wanda was chatting incessantly, excitement coursing through her veins. Agatha couldn’t focus on a thing she was saying, her own mind running wild. It had been more than half a year since she had last seen Rio, and the hollow feeling in her stomach at her absence still hadn’t healed. She liked to tell herself she was over it, it had never been anything more than sex, after all. But she knew she was just lying to herself, the truth was that she missed Rio more than she had ever missed anyone before.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between. We’re glad to see they haven’t outgrown us after their
     <em>
      biiiig
     </em>
     tour! Welcome to the stage, Green Wiccan!”
    </p>
<p>
     The audience erupted, the applause ringing in Agatha’s ears as she held her breath. The band took the stage and Agatha’s heart leaped into her throat as she laid eyes on the woman who had haunted her as merely a memory in her mind ever since they parted.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked so good, albeit a bit tired. She wore an excited expression, laughing to herself in disbelief as she looked around the bar, the deafening applause stretching on. Her hair was different, cut shorter to just below her shoulders. She wore a familiar white tank top and black jeans, holding her drumsticks in the air as she waved to the crowd. Agatha was sure she could see a couple new tattoos on her arms. Agatha would know, she had spent multiple nights memorising her tattoos, mapping them with her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy searched the crowd for them, waving excitedly when he caught sight of his mother. His excitement drew Rio’s attention to them too, and her eyes froze on Agatha, the grin on her face immediately dropping, shifting to a shocked and pained expression. The audience around them faded, the applause fading to mere background noise. They held each other’s gaze, Agatha trying to communicate a thousand different things.
     <em>
      I miss you, I’m sorry, I think about you everyday
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Only when Rio was nudged by Jen did their gazes separate, and Agatha felt the loss of the eye contact like a stab to her heart. Rio took her place at her drum kit, looking anywhere but at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The band performed harmoniously, even more impressively than the last time Agatha had seen them. They had improved so much in the last few months, Agatha hated that she hadn’t been there to witness the growth. Watching Rio was painfully breathtaking, Agatha soaking up every moment. The way her new hairstyle moved as Rio bobbed her head to the music, the way her eyes traced the sea of people and winked at her friends when they interacted.
    </p>
<p>
     As the band took a brief break between songs to grab a drink and refresh their voices, Alice spoke into the microphone.
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t normally do this song live.” Alice’s gaze flickered towards Agatha, “But tonight we’re gonna make an exception.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned around to beckon Rio forward. Rio’s eyes widened, violently shaking her head no. The crowd cheered, thinking it was some sort of act. Billy leaned over the drums, covering the microphone with his hand and saying something to Rio. Their discussion turned heated, Rio continuously shaking her head, panic evident on her expression. More than once, her gaze slipped to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, after a heated debate, Rio threw her hands up in defeat and stood up, making her way to the microphone. The cheering from the crowd reached a new volume. Agatha and Wanda shared a nervous look.
    </p>
<p>
     “This will be our last performance because I’ll be murdering them all later.” Rio spoke into the microphone when the cheering died down, gesturing to her friends behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     The opening bars to a song Agatha recognised started playing and she gasped. It was the song Billy had said was written about her. Agatha had listened to their debut album almost everyday since it released, and had replayed this particular songs more times than she could count, she knew every word.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she started singing, Rio spoke into the microphone, “I wrote this song about a
     <em>
      straight
     </em>
     girl I was seeing.”
    </p>
<p>
     The audience wolf-whistled and laughed at that, Agatha cringing as Wanda side-eyed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s nerves were evident as she sang the opening verse, her inexperience at singing a solo in front of an audience clear. But the audience started to sing along, a large majority of them knowing the lyrics. Rio’s face widened in shock when she finally realised the crowd was singing along with her. As the first chorus ended, she spun around to share a look with her friends, each of them grinning in disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     With the audience singing along, Rio’s confidence grew. She started to enunciate with her hands as she sang, letting her body sway to the music. She was enjoying interacting with the crowd, singing the words brightly as she met the faces of people who knew her music. Agatha could imagine how amazing it must feel, to have a room full of people singing along to words that had come from your heart, words that seemed to resonate with so many.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced around the crowd as the song reached its climax, the audience screaming the words to the bridge. As the music became softer, Agatha’s eyes returned to the stage, startling when she found Rio peering down at her, singing the lyrics directly to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      When I looked at you and walked away,
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I should’ve told you that I thought about you everyday.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     She noticed Rio’s eyes glistening, and felt tears rising in her own eyes. It hurt to see Rio this way, and it hurt more to know that she was the reason. Rio turned away and didn’t look at her again as she finished the song.
    </p>
<p>
     “It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     about you, isn’t it?” Agatha heard Wanda ask, though she couldn’t bring herself to tear her gaze from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The song came to a close, the audience’s applause reaching a new high. Rio had a disbelieving grin plastered on her face as she breathed heavily, her gaze skirting the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     “Woo!” Alice yelled into the microphone, “Who thinks we should add that to our setlist from now on?”
    </p>
<p>
     The audience cheered loudly and Rio leaned into the microphone.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t joking about murdering them. I’ll kill you all too.” She put two fingers to her eyes and flicked them out to the crowd, making an ‘
     <em>
      I’m watching you
     </em>
     ’ signal that had the crowd laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned to her drums then, the band in their usual roles for the last two songs of the set.
    </p>
<p>
     Ten minutes after they’d cleared the stage, the group arrived at her and Wanda’s table. Wanda stood and pulled them all into a warm group hug, gushing over how amazing their set was and how happy she was to have them all back.
    </p>
<p>
     When the hug parted, all members were grinning ear-to-ear. Wanda’s motherly pride had that effect on everyone. The group put some space between themselves, in doing so revealing Rio to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes immediately met, as if magnetically drawn. They stared at each other with a silent intensity, Agatha’s heart pounding loudly in her chest. She parted her lips as if to say something, but what she had wanted to say, she wasn’t sure. Rio’s eyes dropped to her lips at the movement.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman shook her head and cleared her throat loudly, finally looking away from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna go get a drink. Anyone want anything? Okay, cool.” She excused herself, leaving before anyone could respond.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched Rio all but run to the bar, signalling the bartender. She sighed, her emotions had been running wild during Rio’s performance, just being in the same room as the woman was setting a fire under her skin. But clearly Rio was avoiding her, she wanted nothing more to do with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda and the band tried their best to include her in conversation, but she wasn’t in the mood to talk, preferring to instead stare miserably at Rio who was watching her drink be prepared.
    </p>
<p>
     A blonde woman approached her, saying something that made Rio laugh politely. She was a fan, Agatha assumed. They chatted for a while, and when Rio’s drink arrived and she paid for it, they still didn’t part. At one point, Rio said something that had the woman throwing her head back in laughter and placing her hand on Rio’s arm. Agatha felt something festering in the pit of her stomach and—as the woman flicked her long, beautifully styled hair over her shoulder—she realised that it was jealousy.
    </p>
<p>
     To her left, she heard Jen cackle, “Rio’s found another
     <em>
      fan
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been zoned out of their conversation but the mention of Rio’s name caused her ears to prick up. She was careful to give no indication that she was listening, staring straight ahead.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do they all throw themselves at her?” She heard Billy say through a disbelieving laugh, “What’s her secret?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice huffed, “Seriously, when is it my turn?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This is the first one she’s actually paid attention to that didn’t kind of look like—”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha caught Billy elbowing Jen out the corner of her eye, the woman glancing sharply at Agatha before whispering a sheepish apology.
    </p>
<p>
     She filled in the blanks. This was the first woman Rio had spoken to that didn’t look like Agatha. She felt a shimmer of hope, the dots finally connecting in her mind in that moment.
     <em>
      She wanted Rio back, and Rio might still want her
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Taking one deep breath to steel her nerves, Agatha stood and excused herself from the table. She crossed the bar with a confidence she didn’t feel, her pulse quickening when Rio caught sight of her. The corners of Rio’s lips quirked up, not quite a smile, but enough incentive for Agatha to not turn tail and run.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mind if I cut in?”
    </p>
<p>
     The blonde woman eyed her up and down with an insulted look, “Yeah, I do mind. We’re having a conversation here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to Rio, who simply raised her shoulders, watching Agatha expectantly, waiting for her next move. Seeing Rio up close for the first time in months sent a shiver down her spine. She turned back to the blonde before she lost her train of thought.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s your name?”
    </p>
<p>
     The woman rolled her eyes, “Katie.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, Katie, you’re pretty, right? You know it. You could have anyone in this bar.” She cocked her head and dropped her polite facade, setting what she hoped was an intimidating smirk on her face, “But not Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     Katie frowned, glancing helplessly at Rio. Agatha raised her eyebrows expectantly when she looked back to her, holding her gaze unblinkingly. Katie scoffed, finally breaking their eye contact and mumbling a childish ‘
     <em>
      whatever
     </em>
     ’ before turning and disappearing into the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha turned to face Rio, the woman was looking at her with a dark gaze, “That was hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quirked an eyebrow, a satisfied grin on her lips, “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you gonna tell me
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     exactly Katie can’t have me?” Rio challenged, her tongue poking the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed, “You know why.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to hear you say it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha faltered, the prospect of having to explain her feelings making her feel wary, nerves rising to her throat. Rio took Agatha’s silence as an answer in itself, laughing indignantly and throwing her hands in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you want me to do, Agatha? Do you want me to never date anyone again in case you wake up one day and decide you want to be with me?” She took a steadying deep breath following her explosion, “I’m seriously asking you here; what do you
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     want me to do?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Kiss me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s angry expression immediately slipped from her face, replaced by pure shock, “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a step forward, so close that the toe of her boot nudged Rio’s, so close that Rio felt the need to lean against the bar behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you to kiss me.” She repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     “In front of all these people?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Anywhere you want.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was all the confirmation Rio needed to step forward and close the distance between them. She brought a hand up to tuck one side of Agatha’s hair behind her ear so she could rest her hand against her cheek. Rio took a moment to study Agatha, her eyes—full of wonder as if she couldn’t believe this was happening—tracing every inch of Agatha’s face. Then she finally leaned in, Agatha’s hands coming up to rest on her hips as she met Rio halfway. They kissed softly, both breathing a sigh of relief at the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     The kiss was short, and when they separated and met each other’s gaze, Agatha was sure the hunger in Rio’s eyes was a mirror image of her own desire. They crashed back into each other desperately, Agatha’s hands rising to cradle Rio’s face, her thumb stroking her cheek as they kissed passionately. Rio’s hands wandered her back, her shoulders, her neck, anywhere they could reach.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’re your plans after this?” Agatha asked breathlessly when they parted again, their foreheads resting together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably gonna have some
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     hot reunion sex, what about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned, “I could go for that.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had laced their fingers together, after kissing her again, dragging Rio over to the table where their friends sat, openly gawking at the pair of them, lacking the decency to at least pretend they hadn’t been watching.
    </p>
<p>
     They excused themselves, saying their goodbyes and doing their best to dodge their friends’ questions.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you to call me tomorrow and tell me everything.” Wanda whispered when she pulled Agatha into a tight hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “Perv.” Agatha responded, feeling lighter than she had in months.
    </p>
<p>
     ~~~~~~~~~
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was relieved she had stuck to her plan of only having one drink as she and Rio sat in her car, willing every traffic light to turn green so they could get to her house faster.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was humming along to a song playing quietly on the radio, a lazy smile on her face as she stole glances at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told Wanda about us.” Agatha said when the heated silence became too distracting.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah?” Rio’s smile grew.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I’m pretty sure Billy knows.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh yeah, Billy definitely knows.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned, “You told him?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, he’s just not blind.” Rio snorted, “The whole band knows even if they don’t know for sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot an amused glance at Rio, “I suppose it was kind of obvious.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied her, “And you’re okay with so many people knowing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused, the heated silence returning for a moment. She considered the question, realising with a startling certainty that she didn’t mind people knowing, in fact she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to people to know.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honestly, I want the whole world to know.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio didn’t respond for a while, Agatha glanced at her, finding the woman staring at her with an almost starstruck expression. Agatha was pleased to find she’d left Rio speechless. This was a first.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pressed on, her voice taking on a flirtatious tone, “I want to show everyone that I’m the girl lucky enough to nail down the hottest member of Green Wiccan.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio released a breathy laugh, “Nothing lucky about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     She reached across, settling a hand on Agatha’s thigh
    </p>
<p>
     “It was your irresistibleness that won me over.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted, “My irresistibleness?”
    </p>
<p>
     When they reached Agatha’s house, and after taking multiple breaks—to kiss against the front door, kiss against the wall in the hallway, kiss at the top of the stairs—they finally stumbled into her bedroom. Agatha shoved Rio onto the bed, the woman landing with a quiet oof. She quickly scrambled to prop herself up on her elbows as Agatha all but crawled on top of her, leaning down to press a firm, close-mouthed kiss to her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “You cut your hair.” Agatha said, her voice low as she held herself up over Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “D’you like it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned down to kiss her again, letting Rio know just how much she liked it without words. Rio whined when Agatha pulled back to talk again, “Do you remember how much I like this shirt?”
    </p>
<p>
     She let her hands wander under the white tank top, gliding over Rio’s toned stomach. The woman groaned, her voice husky when she replied, “I think you’d like it better off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, leaning down to press hot kisses to Rio’s abdomen over the shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, it does look really good on you.” She spoke the words into Rio’s midriff.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” The neediness in Rio’s voice had Agatha finally letting up, gripping the hem of the shirt and pulling it up over Rio’s head.

     Agatha watched Ralph stoop down to pull their son into his arms, chuckling fondly at the boy’s enthusiasm as he threw himself at his father. Ralph had blossomed into a wonderful dad over the past year; it appeared separating had provided self-growth for the both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled Ralph into a hug when he stood, wishing him a, “Merry Christmas.”
    </p>
<p>
     Ralph smiled when they parted, “Merry Christmas. See you in a couple weeks?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, watching Ralph walk to his car before shutting the front door. She turned to Nicky then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you have a good Christmas at your dad’s?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes! Can I show you my presents?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed and agreed, following the boy to the living room. It was New Year’s Eve, Nicky had spent three days at his dad from Boxing Day, the pair of them celebrating their own Christmas together late. Nicky had wanted to spend actual Christmas Eve at his mother’s; that’s where Santa knew to bring the presents, he’d explained. Wanda was having a gathering at her house for the New Year’s countdown tonight, and Nicky had wanted to be there.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky sped ahead of her, and she heard the boy squeal excitedly as she rounded the corner.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey little man!”
    </p>
<p>
     Upon entering the living room, Agatha felt a fond warmth envelop her, a softness in her eyes as she took in the scene in front of her. Nicky had all but thrown himself at Rio, the woman currently pinned to the sofa as the boy giggled into her neck. The pair had grown close so quickly, Nicky warming up to Rio faster than anyone he’d met before. About a month after she and Rio had reunited—and had put a label on what they were, Agatha finally brave enough to admit that she had real feelings for Rio—they had told Nicky of their relationship. The boy had taken it surprisingly well, in fact he had been very happy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt so lucky. Their little family wasn’t the family she had envisioned, nor the one her mother had drilled into her that her son required, but it was the family she had needed. For the first time in her life, Agatha was focused on the present; things were already good and no amount of imagining could convince her that anything was worth missing it for.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had moved in around three months after they had gotten together officially. Wanda had made a comment about Agatha embracing the stereotypes that she hadn’t really understood.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatcha thinking about, mi amor?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hm?” Agatha shook herself from her reverie, “Oh, nothing. Just how lucky I am.”
    </p>
<p>
     She moved to sit next to Rio as Nicky got off the sofa to pull out the presents he had gotten from his father.
    </p>
<p>
     “Cringe.” Rio stage-whispered to Nicky who hid a giggle behind his hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “You love it.” Agatha responded, pulling Rio into a sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed against her lips, her mouth quirking up at the corners. They parted when Nicky cleared his throat obnoxiously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Excuse me, I’m trying to show you my presents.” He waggled his finger.
    </p>
<p>
     After Nicky had put on a show-and-tell of his presents, they set upon getting ready to go to Wanda’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha left the bathroom after applying her makeup, finding Rio perched on the edge of their bed. She immediately groaned and fell back dramatically as Agatha entered the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rushed to her side, “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve killed me, you look too good.” She mumbled as she continued to play dead.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t look too bad yourself.” Rio peeked an eye open at that, looking up at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wore a green pantsuit with a black crop top underneath, a silver pendant laid across her chest. She sat up, taking Agatha’s hand and tugging till she caved and sat across her lap, resting an arm across her shoulders. Rio smirked as she laid a hand on her upper thigh, her other hand at the small of her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s just stay here.” She whispered as she pulled Agatha into a kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lost herself in the firm press of Rio’s lips, the hand on her thigh slowly edging higher, the fingers at her back moving to play with her hair. It took all her willpower to pull away, shoving Rio’s hands away gently as she stood up from her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ll be late.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We won’t be late if we just don’t go.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your friends will be sad if you’re not there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’ll understand.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed and reached out to drag Rio to her feet, “Come on. If we get there on time, Wanda won’t be as annoyed when we leave right after the countdown.”
    </p>
<p>
     “When you put it that way…”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda and Tommy greeted them at the door when they arrived, Nicky and Tommy immediately disappearing into the house hand-in-hand. Wanda welcomed them inside, thanking them for the wine they had brought and directing them to the living room. The band called to Rio excitedly when they entered the room, each jumping up to pull Rio into a group hug. Much to her surprise, Agatha was dragged into the group hug too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat quietly by Rio’s side while the band spoke, happy to just sit and listen to the conversation. Rio played with her fingers while she chatted, and every so often she would throw a soft smile at Agatha. It felt so cozy and warm, to simply sit and observe the family she had found for herself; to know that even without contributing to the conversation, they were all happy to have her there. Rio would leave with her in an instant if she asked. She felt important and appreciated, and she revered the feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned suddenly to speak to Agatha in a quiet voice, “Hey, who’re you kissing at the ball drop?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, putting on a show of mulling it over in her head, “Hmm, I’m not sure. Do you think I have a shot with Wanda?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pouted, “No, you don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, I think I might. We have history.” Agatha turned around exaggeratedly to look at the redhead who was interacting with Nicky and Tommy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed and moved closer to rest her head on Agatha’s shoulder. When she spoke, her voice was muffled and Agatha couldn’t make out a thing she was saying.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I said, our history is better.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, “But you don’t want to kiss
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     at midnight. I mean, you would’ve asked if you did.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up quickly, shifting so her entire body was facing her, “Agatha Harkness, will you do me the honour of kissing me at midnight?”
    </p>
<p>
     Chuckling, Agatha leaned forward to press a quick peck to Rio’s lips, “I thought you’d never ask.”
    </p>
<p>
     They were interrupted by Nicky bounding over to sit with them for a while. He perched himself on Agatha’s lap and laid his head on Rio’s so he was lying across them both, giggling to himself at the fact. Rio ruffled the boy’s hair before looking up to share a fond smile with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     When Nicky had left, Alice spoke, “You weren’t lying. You really did become his stepdad.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha frowned, “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, “She’s joking.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, she was meant to be
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     stepdad not Nicky’s.” Billy chimed in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pointedly raised an eyebrow, shooting her gaze around the table till someone caved and explained. Rio finally spoke up with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s nothing. It was back when we first met, I was mad at Billy for not telling me about—“ Rio cut herself off, shooting Agatha a hesitant look before continuing slowly, “About Ralph. I just made a joke about becoming his stepdad to spite him, it was stupid.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s brows knitted together, speaking in a teasing voice, “Becoming
     <em>
      Billy’s
     </em>
     stepdad? You have a thing for Wanda I don’t know about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No! No, Billy said—“ Rio spluttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy interrupted Rio, “Billy said nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared at him, speaking the words quickly so her friend couldn’t cut her off again, “Billy said you were like his second mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     A broad smirk grew across Agatha’s features as she slowly turned her head to face Billy. The boy had an apprehensive expression as he watched for her reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy’s expression only grew more wary at the sight of Agatha’s amusement, “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,
     <em>
      son
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     The group broke into laughter, Billy groaning and dropping his head into his palms, “I hate you Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s no way to talk to your stepdad.” Agatha huffed sarcastically, drawing another round of laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     The night continued much the same way, the group chatting aimlessly and enjoying teasing Billy over his maternal view of Agatha. At some point, Billy had insisted they put on music and dance. It was a clear attempt at escaping the incessant teasing, but they all went along with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon Nicky and Tommy’s insistence, they played musical statues. Agatha’s cheeks hurt from laughing so hard. She was having so much fun, allowing herself to act childishly. She was surprised at just how comfortable she felt around this group of people that only a year prior she had barely known.
    </p>
<p>
     “The countdown’s starting!” Billy announced eventually, rushing to turn the music down.
    </p>
<p>
     The group that littered the living room made their way to stand in front of the TV which broadcasted a live display of fireworks alongside a countdown.
    </p>
<p>
     “10! 9! 8!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled fondly at Nicky and Tommy who were jumping up and down excitedly as they shouted along with countdown. She looked to Billy who had been wrestled into a tight hug from his mother, his face squished as he looked helplessly at Eddie who simply laughed at his predicament. Wanda shot Agatha a scheming wink when their eyes met.
    </p>
<p>
     “7! 6! 5! 4!”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Jen stood to the side of Billy, arm-in-arm as they joined in the countdown. A pair of arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist from behind. She hummed, leaning backwards against the strong body behind her, allowing herself to enjoy the closeness for a moment before turning in Rio’s arms. The woman was smiling softly, a brightness to her eyes as she met Agatha’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “3! 2! 1!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tugged Agatha in by the hands on her waist, Agatha bringing her own arms up so both hands could cradle Rio’s face, pulling her to meet her halfway. They wore matching grins which made it difficult to kiss but Agatha’s heart still swelled. Their friends’ cheers of “Happy New Year!” echoed around them.
    </p>
<p>
     They parted at the feeling of small hands tugging at their legs. Nicky had squeezed his way between them, grinning cheekily up at them. They both laughed, kneeling down to allow Nicky to pull them into a group hug, the boy’s arms wrapping around both of their necks. Their faces were uncomfortably smushed together and Agatha’s back ached at the awkward angle, but the grin never faded from her face and her heart only grew warmer.
    </p>
<p>
     This time last year, Agatha had felt lonely and at her wit’s end. New Year’s Eve had only promised another year of barely scraping by. But right now, she couldn’t wait to see what the next year held for her, and she couldn’t wait to spend it with her newfound family.
