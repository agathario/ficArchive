<h2 class="toc-heading">you look so pretty when you're on your knees</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha could hear the thumping music from across the street as they approached the underground club. The place was booked for a private event she and Rio were invited to—some dance party by an indie artist and her latest party album release. Jen had graciously extended two tickets to them, not that they asked for it. Their mutual friend thought it would be nice for her favourite couple to get out more often—something about Rio getting too busy at work for any sense of a social nor home life, and Agatha going crazy from being stuck working from home.</p><p dir="ltr">They’d only been dating for about a year, and while they’re still very into each other, Jen has heard a bit too many complaints from both her friends about each other (mostly from Agatha), to not do anything about it. This party was Jen’s way (and Alice’s idea too) of dragging Rio’s busy ass out, so she could spend some quality time with her girlfriend and best friends.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m gonna grab a shot. You want one?” Rio asked the moment they stepped into the club.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh god, yes.” Agatha shouted back, scanning the crowd to find their friends.</p><p dir="ltr">When she finally saw Jen and Alice at the back of the club, she was already exhausted from the loud music, and from fighting for her life pushing through the sea of sweaty, moving bodies. She leaned against the cool wall to ground herself, mouthing a small ‘I’m fine’ when her friends tried to check in on her. Agatha was never great with crowds, and after being at home for so long, she almost forgot how overwhelming clubs were.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio failed to show up after a while, Agatha went off to search for her girlfriend. She found Rio by the bar, leaning against the counter in her crisp white jumpsuit, the gold buttons gleaming in the spotlight, white fabric contrasting against skin from the hourglass cut that exposed the sides of her tanned waist. Agatha smiled in relief, picking up her pace, but stopped when she noticed Rio talking to another woman. </p><p dir="ltr">The woman had short blonde hair, smokey eye make up, and a flirty grin that she wore while not so subtly checking Rio out. Rio was laughing in response to whatever the woman was saying, before clinking their glasses and downing a shot together. The other woman reached out to hold Rio’s waist as she doubled over from the sting of the liquor. She stepped closer to Rio, whispered something in her ear, then placed a kiss on her cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was no stranger to women throwing themselves at Rio, but she’s still not used to seeing Rio flirt back. Ironically, the younger woman’s playful nature was what drew Agatha in at first when she approached her at an art show, shamelessly flirting with her with that unfaltering confidence, despite Agatha initially pushing back on her advances. But now that they were in a relationship, even knowing full well that Rio enjoyed making attractive women fluster, she found herself seething quietly whenever Rio flirted back. How dare she have eyes on women other than me? How could she give other women the same attention she gives to me?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha headed back to their table, her eyes fazed by hurt and anger. Alice, noticing something different when she got back, asked if she was okay. Agatha smiled in response, trying her best to act normal.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh yeah, I’m fine. Just need to let loose a little, maybe kiss someone cute. Do you mind?” She asked, pointing at Alice’s glass of whiskey. “Yeah of course.” Alice replied, her voice a tone higher, suspicious. “The kissing though, are you sure? I mean, tonight is about you and Rio spending time together.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, absolutely.” Agatha said with her eyebrows raised mischievously, doing her hardest to convince Alice to get off her back. “We’re loose with these things, ya know? No harm making out with some rando during a night out like this. It’s fine, we’re cool with it.” </p><p dir="ltr">They were, in fact, not cool with it. They’ve never talked about seeing other people while they were together, let alone being physically intimate with some stranger. Not that Rio was doing anything to indicate otherwise, so if she could flirt and touch another woman behind Agatha’s back, then Agatha would do the same to her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha avoided looking at Rio when she finally found them, shot glasses in both hands, and when Rio placed her arm around Agatha’s shoulder, she moved away to put distance between them. “I’m gonna go dance.” she said out loud to the group, avoiding addressing Rio directly. “You wanna come dance with me, Jen?” she asked the taller woman. Sensing something was off, but not entirely sure if she should address it at the moment, Jen uttered a concerned, “Okay?” before following Agatha to the dance floor.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the night, she danced with anyone and everyone who approached her, while glancing at wherever Rio was to make sure she was looking at her. Every time she caught Rio watching, she danced harder, moving sensually against the bodies around her, and at some point, touching and grinding on several women at once. She hoped Rio would eventually approach her, but the younger woman stood where she was and looked at Agatha with a grin on her face, clearly enjoying herself watching Agatha throw herself at other people.</p><p dir="ltr">Further into the night, Agatha saw the blonde woman approach Rio again, pulling her girlfriend into a tight hug, before whispering into her ear again, then giving her another kiss on the cheek. The woman left right after, blending into the crowd and out of sight. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s gaze lingered on the woman for longer than Agatha was comfortable with.</p><p dir="ltr">In a fit of jealousy, Agatha moved closer to one of the women who flirted with her a while ago, and pulled her in for a kiss that turned into a make out. She held the woman’s waist, turning the both of them so that Agatha could have a clear view of where Rio was. The younger woman’s eyes were on both of them, and Agatha could see her tongue pushing against the side of her cheek, her lips turning into a smirk as she watched Agatha caress and kiss another woman. When she broke the kiss, she looked directly at Rio, who raised her glass to cheer her on. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha turned on her heel and left the club, the alcohol she sipped from every stranger who offered her a drink buzzing loudly in her ears.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all the dancing and kissing, she couldn’t keep the sight of Rio and the blonde woman out of her mind. Her heart was racing, her thoughts spiralling into imagining what else both women did to each other after she left them alone earlier. It wasn’t anything Agatha found pleasant.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>I’m going home. Tell the girls I said bye.</em> Agatha texted Rio before ordering her ride. A few moments later, the doors opened to let out blaring music, before muffling out as the door closed. She could hear heels clicking towards her hurriedly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey babe, what’s up?” Rio asked, touching Agatha’s shoulder gently. “Are you okay?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt a wave of disgust from the touch, causing her to brush Rio’s hand away a little too forcefully. “Yeah, I’m good.” she said, not looking at Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">Sensing something was off, Rio asked again, her voice losing some gentleness she had seconds ago. “You don’t sound okay. What’s going on?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Why do you care?” Agatha snapped back, still avoiding Rio’s gaze.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, you’ve been avoiding me the whole night, and suddenly you’re leaving without saying a proper goodbye? Look at me, Ag-.”</p><p dir="ltr">“If you really cared,” Agatha interrupted, finally turning around to face Rio. “I shouldn’t have to leave for you to come to me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What the-? What do you mean? What’s going on?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s fine. Whatever. Go back in and enjoy yourself, hm? Find some chick to cosy up with and leave me alone.” Agatha fumed, crossing her arms, then uncrossing them to check on her ride status.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re drunk.” Rio yanked Agatha’s phone out of her hands and cancelled the ride, her other hand holding Agatha back as the older woman stumbled to grab her phone. “Fuck you. Give it back.” Agatha growled.</p><p dir="ltr">“Enough. You’re fucking drunk and it’s late. I’m sending you home.” Rio said, shoving Agatha’s phone to her chest. “And I don’t think I’ll be staying over tonight.”</p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr">The car ride home was quiet, tense. Agatha stared out the window the whole time, ignoring whatever buzzed through the car stereo, too preoccupied with the buzzing in her head. The lingering effects of her last tequila shot slowly eased off her mind and was replaced with running thoughts of their fight. Rio on the other hand was fuming, pissed that her night was ruined by Agatha acting out from whatever the hell she was on.</p><p dir="ltr">When they arrived, Agatha made a beeline into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water. She downed it in front of the sink, and refused to turn around when Rio entered the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey.” Rio snapped. “Look at me.” she demanded. Agatha kept her head down, pretending not to hear Rio as she washed her glass. Rio strode across the room angrily, stopping just a step behind the older woman. “I said look at me, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha set the glass down and reluctantly turned around, her eyes refusing to meet Rio’s as she kept her gaze elsewhere. Rio flared her nose in disgust, furious at Agatha’s avoidance and silence. Her lover was never confrontational, and it always rubbed Rio the wrong way, especially when something was up. “Are you for real now?” she scoffed. “Unbelievable. What the hell, Agatha? Fine, you wanted to make out with someone else, that’s cool. But pushing me away? Avoiding me the whole night, then blaming me for not coming to you? Not cool. Not cool at all. If you wanted my attention, that was a really fucked up way of asking for it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t have to do that if you were not so occupied with that blonde bitch.” Agatha bit back, finally looking at Rio, tears clouding her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“What blonde bi- Abby?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, sure, Abby, whatever the hell her name is. I saw you both.” she spat bitterly. “Getting a shot for the both of us, my ass. I waited for you like an idiot.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio closed her eyes, exhausted and furious by the misunderstanding. By the implication. Part of her knew she shouldn’t have flirted with her ex-fling, and another part knew that if she wasn’t with Agatha, she would’ve spent the night with Abby.</p><p dir="ltr">But that wasn’t the case. Harmless flirting aside, she wasn’t going to do anything that would hurt Agatha. She made sure to draw a clear line with Abby earlier when she approached her. </p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, Abby’s a friend.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What kind of friend whispers in your ear and holds your waist like that? Don’t lie to me.” Agatha spat.</p><p dir="ltr">“We had a fling years ago, that’s all. We stayed friends after, babe. Nothing else happened. She’s dating someone, and I have you.” Rio dropped her shoulders, her eyes softer now, her voice gentle again. </p><p dir="ltr">“Whether you believe me or not, I’m telling you the truth. Nothing happened between me and Abby, and nothing will.” There was no point trying to justify whatever happened earlier, no point arguing and defending herself when Agatha would just shut down and give her the cold shoulder again. All she could manage now was the truth, and hope to God that Agatha finds it in herself to believe her.</p><p dir="ltr">When she was met with silence, Rio continued. “Agatha, when have I betrayed your trust?”</p><p dir="ltr">“When you lied about liking my cooking.” Agatha said, without missing a beat. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled, chuckling softly under her breath. “It was our second date, and I was trying to get laid.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Still.” Agatha insisted. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio shook her head in defeat. The sincerity in her demeanour dulled some of Agatha’s spikes. Finally, she calmed down a little, realising that she might have overreacted. “Fine. Okay.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, okay. I believe you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s smile melted away more of her spikes. The younger woman opened her arms, inviting Agatha into a hug, which she gingerly stepped into. Both still feeling raw from the fight, both trying to soothe away the hurt and find comfort in each other’s arms again.</p><p dir="ltr">When they finally pulled away, Rio kept her arms around Agatha’s waist, swaying them both playfully. “This might be inappropriate to bring up now…” Rio began, trying to lighten up the mood again. “But you’re kinda hot when you’re jealous.” she finished with a light slap on Agatha’s ass. Instinctively, Agatha smacked Rio’s arms off and shoved her away, her guard coming back up. </p><p dir="ltr">“Who said I was jealous?” she snapped, crossing her arms and looking elsewhere in a sad attempt of a protective stance. Her face was hot from the accusation, knowing that Rio was spot on about her jealousy, but refusing to admit it. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s visceral reaction only turned Rio on. “All that dancing and touching and kissing was a performance. For me.” Rio cooed, amused. She took a step closer to Agatha, right back into her personal space. “You were trying to get my attention, because you WERE jealous.” </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha made no move to back away, and instead stared ahead at Rio. Her face was painted with irritation at Rio’s accusation, not realising the implications from the change in the younger woman’s tone. Rio looked down at Agatha’s lips, her face warm from the growing lust forming in her lower belly. She looked back up into Agatha’s eyes, but this time with desire and increasing hunger. </p><p dir="ltr">Sensing the shift in energy, Agatha swallowed hard, trying to appear normal while attempting to even out her breathing. She looked away again, flustered. “No, I wasn’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, you were.” Rio said firmly, the timbre in her voice sending a pleasant, tingling sensation to Agatha’s brain, causing goosebumps on the back of her neck. Rio licked her lips, enjoying the effect she had on Agatha. She sighed, her voice now thin and almost panting her words. “I’ve misbehaved.” she continued, reaching up to graze Agatha’s shoulder with the back of her fingers, her eyes following her touch. “Do you know what happens to girls who misbehave?” she asked, looking back at Agatha, who finally stopped avoiding her gaze.</p><p dir="ltr">“What?” Agatha croaked, her voice thick with desire. Her pupils were blown out.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned closer, her breath hot against Agatha’s neck. Her voice was a low whisper now. “They get punished.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha exhaled forcefully, not realising she’d been holding her breath the whole time. Her heart was beating out of her chest, and her face blushed from the heat radiating from both their bodies. </p><p dir="ltr">Her heaving chest caught Rio’s attention, and, feeling satisfied from the response, drew back to look into Agatha’s eyes as she delivered her command. </p><p dir="ltr">“So punish me, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha bit back a moan, determined not to give Rio the satisfaction of turning the situation around and turning her on. The younger woman was thoroughly enjoying herself, her fingertips now trailing circles around Agatha’s elbow, her other hand roaming the curve of Agatha’s hips. </p><p dir="ltr">The tingling sensation of Rio’s touch warmed Agatha’s brain, and she was acutely aware of how shallow her breathing had become. Rio dipped lower down her neck, her lips ghosting Agatha’s collarbones, her breath warm against her skin. “Go on,” she urged. “Teach me a lesson.” </p><p dir="ltr">In one quick, rough move, Agatha pushed Rio’s face up into her view, taking in the younger woman’s delighted, lustful gaze. Something in her snapped, and she decided then, that if she was going to play along to Rio’s game, then she damn sure was going to win it. </p><p dir="ltr">She pushed her away and leaned lazily against the sink, inspecting her lover.  </p><p dir="ltr">“Go upstairs and get ready.” Agatha ordered. Rio raised an eyebrow at Agatha, her tongue visibly brushing the back of her teeth, thinking.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, and…” she added. “Change into something more accessible.” She gestured at Rio’s jumpsuit. Despite how hot Rio looked in that outfit, a jumpsuit was one of the least sexy things to remove. </p><p dir="ltr">“Show me how much of a slut you are.” </p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio disappeared up the stairs, Agatha started pacing the kitchen, unsure of what just happened and what was about to happen. The events of the night still left her confidence bruised, but she had to pull herself together to pull it off with Rio later. She shook her hands in front of her, trying to loosen her nerves.</p><p dir="ltr">A bit of self-pep talk later, she straightened her back, and stared up the stairs with renewed determination in her eyes. </p><p dir="ltr">She was going to reclaim Rio as hers, and they’re both gonna have fun doing it.</p><p dir="ltr">Ten minutes. That was how long she’s going to let Rio wait.</p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha opened the door to her bedroom, her mouth watered at the sight that greeted her. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio was wearing Agatha’s black floral robe, the belt haphazardly tied around her waist that allowed too much loose fabric around her upper body. The right side of the robe was deliberately pulled down to expose the top of her shoulder. </p><p dir="ltr">She was leaning back on the edge of the bed, her elbows behind her holding herself up, her legs crossed before her. She gazed at Agatha with an arched eyebrow when the older woman walked through the door, shamelessly drinking in the sight of her lover, her mind racing with what she wanted to be done to her by the older woman.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned against the wall with her arms crossed, a few steps away from the bed. She took her time to take in the view wordlessly, trying to burn the glorious image before her into her brain so she’d never forget. The silent tension between them was buzzing, electrifying. Agatha took her time to savour the moment, but Rio, already thrumming with anticipation while waiting for Agatha, was more impatient than her lover. </p><p dir="ltr">“Well? What are you waiting for?” her words were slow, almost a drawl, a poor attempt at hiding her lack of patience. Agatha smirked, familiar with her girlfriend’s brashness. She gestured mockingly at Rio with her index. “Come, pet.” she ordered.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio pushed herself off the bed lazily, deliberate in the way she swayed her hips as she approached Agatha. </p><p dir="ltr">“On your knees.” Agatha demanded, her voice was hoarse, dark pupils staring down at the other woman.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio bit her bottom lip, careful not to smirk, not to give away that she was enjoying it too much, lest Agatha decided to make her suffer more. She dropped to her knees, never breaking eye contact with the woman standing above her. </p><p dir="ltr">The side of the robe hanging off her shoulder dropped further, exposing her right breast to the cool air. Agatha seized the opportunity to cup her tit and squeezed, then brushed her hand up to pinch her already hard nipple. Rio choked a gasp from the sudden sensation, arching her back in response to push up her chest, in hopes that Agatha would give her breast more attention. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha caressed her a little more before dragging the tip of her nail along Rio’s jaw, lifting the woman’s chin with her curled index to look directly at her. Rio’s pupils were properly blown, her lips quivering as she let out heavy, shuddered breaths. Agatha’s own lips curved into a satisfied grin at the woman’s obvious arousal. She stroked her thumb along Rio’s lower lip, drawing out the anticipation for her next words. </p><p dir="ltr">She lifted Rio’s chin higher, causing the younger woman to straighten her back in response. Like a snake charming her prey, Agatha bent over until she reached the side of Rio’s face, her hot breath sending goosebumps down the woman’s neck. She breathed out shakily, her voice low and thick with want. “Show me what that pretty mouth of yours can do.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio bit her lip again to stop herself from moaning out loud. At that moment, she desired nothing more than to worship the woman before her. To let Agatha use her however she wanted to, so long as it pleased her. </p><p dir="ltr">With every fibre of her being, Rio needed Agatha to want her, to need her. To consume her.</p><p dir="ltr">She moved her hands up Agatha’s thighs, lifting her little black dress slightly as her fingers traced their way up under the fabric. She pushed her dress up further, revealing a lacy underwear soaked with arousal, a sight that spread a warm sensation in her abdomen. Agatha’s scent drove her wild with desire, and she had to talk herself down from diving in and ripping the fabric off with her teeth. Instead, she settled on dragging it down Agatha’s legs, and the view that greeted her made her breath shudder. The dark curls between her lover’s legs were wet and glistening, and Rio couldn’t help but to follow the trail up Agatha’s stomach, to her chest, to her face. An overwhelming gratitude washed over her, and she choked out a soft, “Thank you.”, before putting her attention back to her prize.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled, combing her fingers through Rio’s hair. She liked seeing her lover like this; feeling her want, her desire to please her. “I know.” She whispered, then tightened her grip on her hair, pushing the woman closer to her. “Now, do as you’re told.” Her voice was firm, demanding; reminding Rio she was not off the hook yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio moaned in agreement, closing her eyes to breathe in her scent again, the tug in her hair driving sparks of excitement throughout her body. She leaned forward and planted kisses along Agatha’s inner thighs, leaving small marks leading up to her destination, while her hands reached up to squeeze Agatha’s ass. Moving her hands back, never once breaking skin contact, she reached up and stroked her thumbs along Agatha’s folds, gently holding them apart as she leaned forward to fill them in her mouth. She went to work nipping and sucking on Agatha’s clit, her tongue licking broad strokes across Agatha’s cunt, drawing out a groan from the older woman. Agatha threw her head back, hitting the wall with a soft thud as her groans turned into moans, each stroke making her breathe heavier, each suck making her moan louder.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hips rolled forward, granting Rio more access. The younger woman responded instinctively to the movement, bringing herself closer and putting more pressure, relishing in all the beautiful, needy sounds Agatha made because of her tongue. Soft hands snaked around to grab Agatha’s ass to pull her closer, but Agatha yanked her head away in response. Rio whined at the abrupt loss of warmth on her face, her eyes searching for an answer to the sudden rejection.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head. “Nu-uh. Bad girls don’t deserve nice things.” </p><p dir="ltr">Rio whined harder, looking up at Agatha with puppy dog eyes and a pout.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha bit her lip, pleased with how much power she had over Rio at the moment. She could demand anything from the woman, and she would get what she asked for. She trailed her finger up and down the side of Rio’s neck, feeling her pulse quicken. “Keep your hands behind your back.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s mouth fell open, not in protest, but from surprise. She released her hold and clasped her hands behind her, her chin held high still from Agatha’s grip on her hair. She swallowed hard as her hungry eyes stared directly at Agatha’s heavy-lidded ones, pleading for the woman to grant her access again. Agatha scoffed at her, pulling her head to the side to reveal more of her neck. “Pathetic.” She growled, before pulling Rio’s head back towards her cunt. </p><p dir="ltr">A deep moan vibrated in Rio’s throat as her mouth became occupied again with sweet desire, her tongue pushed into Agatha to lap up what the woman had to offer. Guided by Agatha’s hand at the back of her head, she moaned louder into her, sending pleasing vibrations up her core. Agatha’s other hand shot up to the other side of her head to pull her higher, closer, deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sank lower against the wall, trying to steady herself without Rio holding onto her. When she felt Rio’s lips turn up into a smile, she looked down to see Rio’s smug eyes staring back at her, taunting at her struggle to stay upright without her. </p><p dir="ltr">At this point, Agatha felt like Rio was enjoying herself a bit too much. </p><p dir="ltr">She yanked Rio’s head away forcefully, earning a sharp hiss from the younger woman. This was a punishment, after all. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled deliriously at the pain, the roughness of her lover excited her more than she expected. Her smile turned into feigned disappointment, focused eyes looking eagerly at the Agatha. <em>What are you gonna do to me next?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha almost laughed at Rio’s poor attempt at hiding her excitement. Her willingness to submit herself to Agatha flooded her with tenfold confidence than she had earlier that night. <em>How far can I push you?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned down and brought Rio’s face closer. Their lips met, and the kiss was deep and hungry, never leaving each other a chance to breathe. When they finally pulled away, Agatha kept her face close, her breath heavy against Rio’s swollen lips. “Tits down, ass up.” She said, motioning at the bed. “Go on.” Her voice was bolder now. Commanding.</p><p dir="ltr">The delirious smile came back on Rio’s face when she crawled her way slowly towards the bed, while maintaining eye contact with Agatha. Agatha’s gaze followed the sway of Rio’s hips, the robe barely covering the woman’s ass. The tease of the robe revealing more than it should, made her licked her lips in anticipation. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha watched as Rio knelt by the foot of the bed, then let herself fall forward onto the mattress. She quirked an eyebrow at Agatha while wiggling her hips, inviting the woman over to claim what’s hers. Agatha steadied herself as she pushed off the wall, trying to appear unbothered, but her legs were weak from the overstimulation earlier. </p><p dir="ltr">She approached Rio slowly, admiring the precarious position she put the woman in for her enjoyment. When she went down on one knee behind Rio, the movement rubbed into her sensitive clit, sending a wave of pleasure up her stomach, and she let out a soft moan. Her hands moved up to brush the back of Rio’s thighs, gently caressing the soft skin before bringing them up to her ass to push the robe upwards, revealing dark green panties with a damp spot in the center, deeper than the rest of the fabric. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha scoffed, pleased at what she saw. “Is that for me?” She asked, the surprise in her voice exaggerated and sarcastic. She pulled the underwear down around Rio’s knees, then drew a finger upward along her dripping cunt, getting a strangled moan in response. “Hmm?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes… All for you.” Rio whined. “Agatha...?”</p><p dir="ltr">”Yes dear?” Agatha replied, her tone sweet and teasing. </p><p dir="ltr">”I want you to fuck me.” Rio panted, her voice growing needier as Agatha moved to caress her just outside her folds. “Please… Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">”I’ll think about it.” Agatha hummed in response.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agathaaaaa...” Rio whined again. She moved her hips back towards Agatha, trying to inch closer to where her hands were, so she could feel where she needed her to be. “I need you inside me. P-please.” She whined louder this time, hoping the desperation and neediness in her voice would convince Agatha to give in to her.</p><p dir="ltr">It worked. Agatha leaned forward to grab Rio’s arms, her hips pushing against her cunt, sending a shock of pleasure throughout Rio’s body. She then pulled Rio’s arms backwards, forcing her to shift her weight onto her face and chest against the bed. The friction against Rio’s already sensitive nipples made her clit throb harder, and she could feel her cunt swell and clinch against the gentle press of Agatha’s hips. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha left Rio’s arms behind her lower back, and moved to pull the robe from her shoulder down to her wrists. Rio felt the belt loosen, and the robe itself fell open, inviting a rush of cool air against her heated skin that sent a shiver down her spine. Agatha proceeded to gather the robe and tied it around Rio’s wrists, binding her arms behind her back. </p><p dir="ltr">“Keep it there.” Agatha ordered.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha knelt on both knees behind Rio, savouring the view. She eyed every bump and curve on the woman before her, her hands tracing the sides of her thighs and her hips in admiration and adoration. Low moans travelled around the room every time her hands got close to her eventual destination, each one growing louder and more desperate. </p><p dir="ltr">Each one making Rio’s fingers tingle, and she clawed at the robe, trying to grasp what remaining shreds of patience she had left.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned forward to leave gentle kisses around Rio’s cunt, all the while avoiding the sensitive spot between her legs. She felt her own growing need pooling in her belly, and in one quick move, grabbed a pillow close by to shove it under herself. Relief washed over her as she ground her hips down on the pillow, relishing in the friction it caused against her own cunt. She turned her attention back to Rio, hovering close to her, her hot breath teasing her center. Finally, she pressed broad licks along Rio’s folds, then gathered her clit between her teeth and sucked gently.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio almost yelped at the sudden contact. Her hips jerked upwards, trying to get more pressure on her sensitive spot. Her hands clawed onto the fabric around her wrists, desperate to hold onto anything before she fell apart from the pleasure. Agatha, pleased with the response, wrapped her hands around the front of Rio’s thighs and lifted her hips, giving herself better access to bury her face in the decadent treat before her.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was in no condition to restrain herself while grinding against Agatha’s face. Her tongue simply felt too good in her, and any less effort from her to yearn for more would be a disservice to Agatha’s devotion to fuck every last pathetic whine out of her. She didn’t care if her lover drowned in her pussy—she was sure Agatha wouldn’t mind going out like that. The way Agatha was devouring her cunt supported her theory. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha could feel Rio clenching around her tongue, hinting that she was close. She pulled her head back and dropped Rio back on the bed abruptly. The younger woman let out a muffled gasp into the sheets, followed by a long, bratty whine.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s fingers found their way back to Rio’s cunt, softly teasing and rubbing her slick folds. Without much warning, Agatha slowly pushed a finger into Rio, and then two. The younger woman gasped and moaned at being filled, unaware and unbothered about how loud she was being. Her breathing followed the rhythm of each pump, and Agatha herself riding the pillow in sync with her movements. She leaned forward and steadied herself against the bed with her other hand, using the weight of her hips to push her fingers deeper into Rio while her thumb circled her swollen clit in gentle, circular motions. Sounds of pleasure echoed around the bedroom, Agatha’s name peppered occasionally in the midst of Rio’s moaning and whining.</p><p dir="ltr">“More. Agatha. I need more.” Rio mumbled, her voice muffled by the sheets.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry, I can’t hear you, dear.” Agatha teased, her movements slowing down, as if she was trying to catch Rio’s words.</p><p dir="ltr">Frustrated, Rio turned her head to look at Agatha in the corner of her eyes and nearly yelled. “I need you to fill me up. Please!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s increasing agitation only increased her own wetness, and Agatha, feeling the urgent neediness, complied. “Just because you asked so nicely.” She added another finger, and curled them inside Rio, putting deeper pressure onto her walls. The sensation drove Rio closer to the edge, and Agatha could feel Rio tighten around her fingers. Moments later, her thighs started to shake as she choked on her moans, her body writhing from the growing tension between her legs.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m close.” she mumbled into the sheets in between pants. Her hair was a mess, waves entangled in sweaty locks, stuck to her back or splayed around the bed. Her arms were still behind her back, but her fingers were clawing at her own arms, leaving deep, red marks all over her skin. The sight was enough to drive Agatha close to her own orgasm, but she was careful not to tip them both over too soon. She removed the pillow under her and sat back on her legs, her pace slowing down, and eventually removing her fingers from Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck!” Rio cursed into the mattress. She turned her head to look at Agatha, her eyes pleading desperately. “Agatha, please.” she whined, pushing her hips towards Agatha, urging her to finish the job.</p><p dir="ltr">“Not yet.” Agatha wagged a drenched finger at her. She put the same finger in her mouth, licked it clean, then removed it with an obscene ‘pop’. Rio fixed her eyes at Agatha’s fingers in frustration, wishing they were in her mouth instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha followed Rio’s gaze to her own fingers, and decided Rio had been good enough so far to be rewarded with something nice.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sit up.” Agatha ordered. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio winced at how sensitive she was as she turned over and sat on the bed. Agatha stood and moved closer to her, and granted her wish when she pushed the other two fingers into her mouth while towering over her. Rio moaned softly when she tasted herself on Agatha’s fingers. She licked them clean, all the while looking at Agatha through her lashes, seeking some kind of approval. Agatha smiled, pleased at how well Rio was taking her fingers. </p><p dir="ltr">“Good girl.” she whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio moaned louder at the praise and sucked harder, her tongue swirling around Agatha’s strong fingers, diligently cleaning herself off each digit, eager to serve. Eager to please.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha could feel herself getting wetter. She pressed her legs together, trying to subtly ease the itch.</p><p dir="ltr">When she was satisfied with the clean-up, Agatha reached around Rio to untie the robe from her wrists. “Now,” she twisted the robe into a loose, thick rope before her.  “What do we do with our hands when we beg for forgiveness?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes widened with understanding. She brought her hands together in front of her, as if in prayer. Agatha tied the robe again around her wrist, letting it drop onto Rio’s thighs. </p><p dir="ltr">“On the pillow, on your back.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio did as she was told, letting her panties fall past her ankles as she climbed up the bed, biting her lips in anticipation for what Agatha had planned for her next. The older woman moved towards their night stand, and when she was back in Rio’s view, she was holding their second favourite toy and a silk scarf. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s lips pulled up into a wide grin – they’ve done this before, Agatha blindfolded while Rio had her way with her and their rabbit vibrator. They’ve yet to try it the other way around, and tonight would be the night they found out.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, sweetheart. I thought this was a punishment.” Rio crooned.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha rolled her eyes at the insufferable twat. “Run your mouth again, and I’ll gag you too.” she spat, instantly regretting her choice of words the moment it came out of her. Rio giggled, opening her mouth to say something inappropriate, but biting her lips to hold back a smirk when Agatha glared sternly at her with an eyebrow raised. <em>Don’t you dare</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The blindfold fit onto Rio’s face snugly. Agatha straddled Rio’s waist, shifting her lover’s arms above her head to grant more access to her sides. She took her time admiring the divine sight before her, feeling a wicked sense of control and power vibrating throughout her body, knowing that Rio couldn’t see how hungry she was looking at her, and what she was about to do to her. She licked her lips, unaware how dry they were from the deep, heavy breaths she took in response to the overwhelming desire she felt for the woman under her. </p><p dir="ltr">She traced the curves of Rio’s breasts, hyper aware of how smooth her skin was under her fingers. Then she continued trailing down to her sides, causing Rio to gasp and squirm under her touch. Agatha gasped with her, the rush of oxygen a welcomed surprise when she realised she forgot to breathe. </p><p dir="ltr">She reached up to trace the bottom of Rio’s soft lips, the tint she used before going to the club now faded with only traces of pink left. Agatha leaned in for a kiss, tasting the plum flavoured lip tint in her mouth. Rio kissed back greedily, humming into Agatha’s mouth as she lifted her head to take in more of Agatha’s lips. Moments later, Agatha shifted her attention to Rio’s neck, nibbling at spots that she knew Rio liked. She slowly made her way down Rio’s body, leaving trails of kisses and bruises along the way, moving backwards until she reached her stomach. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio gasped when Agatha lifted her legs up onto her thighs, moving them around her waist so she could wrap her legs around Agatha’s torso. Agatha’s hands gently brushed the side of Rio’s thighs, drawing out the anticipation as she moved her hands between her stomach and legs, purposely avoiding any contact between Rio’s legs. </p><p dir="ltr">The growing uncertainty from the lack of sight drove Rio up the wall. </p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, I need it.” she begged. “I need you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re making this too easy.” Agatha scoffed. “I thought you’d be less cooperative and make me push you for it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m e-easy like that.” Rio panted. “I’m easy when it comes t-to you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Right. You’ll do anything for my forgiveness?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Y-yes.” Rio choked. “Anything.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s smile was wicked, her mind running through fantasies of what she could do to Rio that would turn herself on the most. She settled on gently brushing the vibrator, still turned off, along Rio’s dripping cunt, taking in the desperate whines of response. Satisfied with how slick the vibrator was, she slid it into Rio, tilting it upwards so it placed just enough force against her walls as it went in. Rio’s hips immediately pushed down in response, desperate to feel more pressure against her sensitive spot. </p><p dir="ltr">Her breath hitched when Agatha turned on the vibrator, sending sudden waves of stimulation and pleasure throughout her whole body. She rocked her hips against Agatha’s hand to let the vibrator fill her from more angles, and ground her clit against the extension of the rabbit. Each shift and jerk of her hips drew louder and louder moans, and Agatha, liking what she saw, thrust the vibrator in a pace that matched Rio’s movements.</p><p dir="ltr">“Attagirl. Keep going.” Agatha urged. </p><p dir="ltr">After a while, she turned off the vibrator and brought the toy further out, teasing at the edges of Rio’s core. The younger woman groaned and whined in response to the lack of stimulation, her chest heaving against the cool air. </p><p dir="ltr">“No. Don’t… don’t stop. Agatha… Don’t s-stop.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha brought herself close to Rio’s stomach, pressing gentle kisses on hot skin. She stared up at Rio, her stiff nipples begging to be sucked on. Agatha pushed the vibrator back in deeper, and left it there at the lowest setting. </p><p dir="ltr">“Tell me.” She crawled her way up Rio’s body, pressing kisses onto her as she moved closer to her breasts. “Who do you belong to?” she breathed out her words against the smooth skin along Rio’s breast, kissing the spot softly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned, delighted at where their play was headed. In other situations, a lover’s possessiveness irked her, but right now, with Agatha so close and so demanding, this need to claim her was turning her on. Whatever feeling she had about it otherwise would have to wait, because now, she was going to take her time with Agatha. See how far she can push her .</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, I don’t know, Agatha. Who do I belong to?” Rio teased, and immediately felt a sharp pain on her nipple from Agatha biting down on it. She hissed from the pain, but the sensation shifted into pleasure, and she breathed out a soft whimper. </p><p dir="ltr">“Wrong answer.” Agatha growled. Her knee settled between Rio’s legs to push the vibrator further in. “Think harder, babe. You can do it.”</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of affirmation, pressure, and pleasure pushed Rio further up the edge, and she started seeing sparks dance against the darkness of the blindfold. “Maybe…” Rio moaned. “Maybe you could give me a hint.”  </p><p dir="ltr">Rio felt Agatha move up and straddled her torso again, and this time, she could feel Agatha’s growing wetness on her stomach. One of Agatha’s hands pressed down on her rib, fingers gripping her rolls, while the other hand wrapped itself around her neck, held with enough pressure to make her face go numb. She could feel her heartbeat on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha started rocking her hips slowly against Rio’s stomach, her sensitive cunt deriving muted pleasure from the lack of friction against slippery skin. She dipped closer to Rio, panting into her ears. “Is this…” she whispered, moving her hips faster now, her words coming out in whines, “Is this enough of a hint?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Mhmm.” Rio hummed hurriedly, highly aware of the sensation between her legs, and the growing neediness in Agatha’s hips on her. Agatha’s voice was so low and needy in her ears it made her face hotter, and the numbness on her face became more intense. The sparks in her eyes turned into explosions.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s grip tightened around her neck as she moved faster, pushed deeper. Rio was gasping for air to say her next words. “A-Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha realised Rio’s struggle and loosened her grip, her hands hovering above the younger woman, unsure. She stopped moving her hips. “Babe?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio choked out a strangled breath, heaving through her swollen airway to bring oxygen back to her brain. “Yeah…” she wheezed.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha caressed Rio’s face softly, apologetically. “I’m sorry baby. Was that too much?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m-I’m okay.” Rio sputtered. “I’m okay. Keep going. Please.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You sure?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah. Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha slowly moved her hips again, and after a while, Rio clenched against the vibrator as she regained her senses. Her hands were turned over to hold on to the pillow as she brought her legs together, hoping to push a tighter hold onto the toy. </p><p dir="ltr">“I want to hear you say it.” Agatha groaned as she moved faster against Rio’s stomach, the hand she used around Rio’s throat now rubbing circular motions around her own clit. “Who do you belong to?” she demanded.</p><p dir="ltr">“You, Agatha.” Rio finally gave in. “I belong to you.”</p><p dir="ltr">The admission drove Agatha wild, her smile now wider than ever at her triumph. She rocked her hips even faster, her fingers working overtime to stimulate her clit. “Say it again.” </p><p dir="ltr">“I’m yours, Agatha. I’m all yours.” Rio gladly complied, feeling herself close to the edge as she found the right spot to push the vibrator against. Agatha, realising they were both close, turned around to bump up the vibrator’s setting, before turning around again to chase her own orgasm.</p><p dir="ltr">“Again.” she ordered. </p><p dir="ltr">“I’m yours.” Rio moaned, feeling her orgasm coming closer. </p><p dir="ltr">“You’re mine.” Agatha growled, her breathing becoming heavier and heavier as her climax approached. “You’re mine.” she repeated.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m-I’m yours. Agatha, I’m yours!” Rio moaned one final time, before waves and waves of pleasure crashed into her as she came in a silent orgasm. Agatha screamed Rio’s name as she rode her own orgasm against Rio at the same time, drenching them both with her climax. </p><p dir="ltr">When the last bit of their orgasm tapered off, Agatha slumped against Rio, her body twitching from the aftershock. She hummed against Rio’s chest, satisfied. </p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, the rabbit…” Rio muttered shakily, the vibrator was still stimulating her sensitive core. Agatha quickly reached over to turn off the vibrator and removed it from Rio, before drawing herself back to her lover to remove the blindfold and drowned her in deep, tender kisses. Rio giggled into the kiss, which made Agatha grin against Rio’s lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha pulled away from the kiss to stare into Rio’s eyes. The dark brown eyes that stared back were filled with love and adoration, remnants of arousal still apparent in her wide pupils. “Rio…” Agatha whispered, wanting one last push before she crashed out from exhaustion. “I need you to do something for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Anything for you, sweetheart.” Rio hummed.</p><p dir="ltr">“I want you to come for me again.” Agatha grinned as Rio’s eyes and smile grew wide. She bit her lip and nodded. Agatha reached up to untie Rio’s hands, gently guiding them towards her thighs. “Sit up.” Agatha whispered. </p><p dir="ltr">Once Rio did as she was told, Agatha knelt before her and pushed her legs apart, giving her complete access to Rio’s still sensitive cunt. She was met with little resistance.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha inched closer to her, shifting her thighs under Rio’s and sat back on her heels, so that Rio’s legs were resting on her. “Comfortable?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio gave her small, quick nods. The openness of her position made her highly aware that her core was pulsing into nothing, waiting to be touched. To be filled.</p><p dir="ltr">Fully expecting Agatha to drive her second orgasm, Rio got herself a pleasant surprise when Agatha guided her hands up her own thighs, resting them close to her center. </p><p dir="ltr">“I want to watch you fuck yourself.” Agatha said. “I want to watch you come for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s mouth fell open from surprise once more, feeling herself get wet again from the demanding confidence in Agatha’s words. The older woman was eyeing her up and down, savouring every inch of the compromising position she was in. </p><p dir="ltr">Her punishment wasn’t over yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio gazed directly at Agatha, never breaking eye contact as she moved her hands alongside her folds, her tongue brushing between her teeth, the nerves on the tip of her tongue firing with pleasure with every graze against sharp edges.</p><p dir="ltr">She brought one hand up to circle her swollen clit. The other hand moved up to her lips, and she grinned in satisfaction as Agatha’s eyes fixated on her fingers moving in and out of her mouth, licking and drenching them with her own saliva. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s eyes followed her hand again as it moved back down to her core, and they both moaned when Rio pushed her fingers into herself. The sight of Rio’s fingers disappearing into her own cunt made Agatha shift on her legs, suddenly aware of her increasing arousal. </p><p dir="ltr">“Tell me something, Agatha.” Rio panted, her fingers pumping into herself steadily, her cunt clenching onto her fingers from already being overstimulated from her first orgasm. “Have I been good?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, her eyes still fixed on Rio’s fingers, her practised movements deliciously hypnotising. “You’ve been so good.” Agatha croaked, embarrassed at how choked with want her voice was. “You’re doing so well, baby.”</p><p dir="ltr">The validation sent a tingling sensation all over Rio’s face, at the same time increasing the arousal in her belly. “Mmmm.” She hummed with her lips between her teeth. Her words were coming out in whines now. “Tell me more.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha bit her lip, feeling increasingly turned on by how responsive Rio was to her praises. By how much power her words held. </p><p dir="ltr">“Touch yourself for me, baby.” Agatha urged.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded eagerly, her fingers thrusting faster into herself. </p><p dir="ltr">“That’s right, keep going. You’re almost there.” </p><p dir="ltr">Rio exhaled a shuddered breath, her fingers curling against her walls, driving her closer and closer to her second orgasm. “Mhmm… Go on.” she whined. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stroked her hands along Rio’s inner thighs, her breathing following Rio’s panting. “So pretty. Will you come for me, baby?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes… Yes!” Rio screamed, her fingers curled inside of her, barely moving out now. Her fingertips pressed against her walls, rubbing in quick, deep motions at her most sensitive spot. Her other hand rubbing her clit furiously, precise. </p><p dir="ltr">Agatha cupped her hands onto Rio’s breast, squeezing and kneading them. She traced her fingers to the tip of her breast, and pinched her nipples suddenly to pull on them roughly. </p><p dir="ltr">“Come for me, baby. Come for me.” She demanded.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio threw her head back from the force of her second orgasm, her head hitting against the headboard with a loud thump, but she couldn’t feel the pain over the soaring pleasure of her climax. Her walls clenched around her fingers, making it hard for her to move them, so she settled on pressing up onto herself while bringing her hips down. Her nerves fired simultaneously, her vision blurring as her face went numb from the rush of blood to her core. Agatha buried her face in Rio’s neck and bit down, and the younger woman pressed her chin against Agatha’s head to steady herself while riding out the rest of her orgasm.</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio came down from her climax, Agatha lifted herself off Rio’s neck, drinking in the sight of her lover’s afterglow. She held Rio’s hand in hers, guiding her fingers into her own mouth so she could suck Rio’s fingers clean. She moaned at the taste of her lover on her tongue. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s gaze was soft as Agatha held her hand against her face, melting into the warmth of her lover’s palm. She kissed Rio’s hand before placing it on her chest, her eyes closing at the contact, her smile warm and tender. She then kissed Rio softly on her lips, then another longer one between her eyebrows, before resting their foreheads together.</p><p dir="ltr">They sat like this for a while, eyes closed, their breathing matching as time went by. </p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry for being such a bitch earlier.” Agatha said. </p><p dir="ltr">Rio hummed softly, having forgiven Agatha long before she entered the bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">“She never touched me the way you do.” she whispered, reaching behind Agatha to trail circles at the small of her back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hmm?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Abby. The sex was amazing, but… it’s nothing compared to what we have.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could hear Agatha smile.<br/><br/>“Good.”</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Rio started caressing Agatha’s thighs, fingers brushing across dips where her muscles overlapped. “Let me return the favour?” Rio asked, unsure if Agatha was up for it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Not tonight, my love.” Agatha smiled, placing a peck on Rio’s nose. “I’m beat. But…why don’t you surprise me tomorrow morning?” Agatha suggested.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, her affection for the woman growing by the second. </p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, Agatha.” she said, her voice soft, melodic. “Guess I’ll be staying over after all.”</p>
