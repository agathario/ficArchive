<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>April sat at a bar, nursing her third class of bourbon, contemplating every decision she has made in the last months.</p><p>It has been about a month since she and Andy finalised the divorce. She should have seen it coming years ago at the first mention of kids. She knew Andy wanted kids as much as Andy knew she didn't, but they were happy together, so they both just kind of ignored it and hoped one of them would cave when the time came. They didn't.A few months after their move to Washington Andy popped the question. It only went downhill from there. Soon every conversation turned into one about kids and every conversation about kids turned into a fight. They lived like that for a few months, before both of them lost their patience.</p><p>The split was mutual in the end. Andy tried to get her to change her mind, saying they could fix this, but even he realised they couldn’t after a little while. So April filed for divorce. They quickly settled things, sold the house, April moved into a nice apartment and Andy went back to Pawnee. After just about a month of proceedings it was done. She was no longer April Ludgate-Dwyer.</p><p>They ended things on a good note, promising that once things settled down a little, they would be friends again. But fuck did it hurt.Andy had been her rock. When she didn’t know what to do, he would give her some ridiculously dumb advice, that somehow helped and now he was gone. She didn’t know what to do.</p><p>She kicked back the last of her bourbon, before motioning to the bartender for another. She was playing with the rim of the glass when a body slid into a barstool next to hers. Expecting some sleezy man she rolled her eyes and turned her head. She found herself surprised to be staring into familiar blue eyes.</p><p>“Miss Ludgate, fancy meeting you here. Drinking alone?” Asked the annoyingly confident voice of Jennifer Barkley “Yep. All alone” She replied, taking a sip out of the fresh poured glass. “How come? Where is your husband?” April gripped the glass tighter. “My EX-husband has moved back to Pawnee” She quipped, trying to keep her voice void of any emotion. Unfortunately for her, Jennifer Barkley was great at reading people. Seeing right through that cold exterior. She put her hand on Aprils knee and squeezed a little. “Oh honey, I’m so sorry. Next round is on me, you can tell me all about it.”</p><p>Jen wasn’t usually a very empathetic person, finding most people way too boring for her to be interested in what they were feeling. But something about seeing April, normally so apathetic and emotionless-looking, so broken made her feel uneasy.</p><p>3 glasses of bourbon and a lot of tears later, the two of them found themselves in silence. “I always thought you were too good for him” Jen broke it. April turned to her and raised one brow, wordlessly asking for an explanation. “I mean, no offence to the man but he is a total meathead. Ambitionless. You are so smart, so much potential within you. You need someone who can push you” I would push you. She found herself thinking, but quickly pushed the thought away. April ducked her head, slight pinkness now covering her cheeks. “Thanks. You’re a lot less bitchy than I thought. I don’t know how to feel about it.” Jen barked out a surprised laugh at that “Gee thanks, you sure know how to compliment a lady” She said. They slipped into an easy conversation after that</p><p>It was easy to talk to Jen, April realised. For someone who didn’t really like talking to anyone ,except Andy, she found herself actually enjoying the conversation. They talked about jobs, vacations and lack thereoff, friends, childhoods. The conversation flowed as easily as breathing.</p><p>April also found out that Jennifer was quite touchy especially after she has had a few drinks. During their conversation, Jennifer touched her knee, arm, shoulder, gently squeezing as she laughed at some deadpan ‘joke’ April said. April liked making Jen laugh, she didn’t know why, maybe it was the gentle squeeze she got, maybe it was the sound of Jens infectious laughter. She had no idea, but she found she also didn’t really care.</p><p>“I don’t know why anyone would want to have children, they’re annoying, they’re messy and they take your freedom away” Jen scoffed “I’m happy to stay childless forever” She said as she took a swig of her drink. “Seriously!” April agreed “I mean, I love the triplets, but anytime I’m at Leslies house I feel like my braincells are slowing dying. I should’ve married you, maybe then I wouldn’t be a divorcee at the ripe age of 28.” She chuckled, looking at the other woman, to find her already staring at her “Maybe you should have, the sex would certainly be better” April flushed and almost choked on her drink. She now had that image stuck in her head.</p><p>They talked for a while more, once the bar started emptying and they were both sloshed, they decided to call it a night. They exchanged numbers in front of the bar, before climbing into their respective taxis.</p><p>April found herself thinking about Jennifer instead of Andy as she went to sleep.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Heyy, so like, I wrote the first chapter when I was bored as hell, just for fun y’know. Didn’t really plan on this becoming a thing, but after reading your comments nd stuff I decided I actually wanna finish the story. The downside of that is that I haven’t actually thought about where I want to go with this story, so this might become a big mess. Anyways, bear w me I guess and enjoy!!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>April woke up with a killer hangover. Something that has started to happen to her in her old age. <em>Ugh.</em> <br/><br/></p><p>She wondered whether Jen was feeling like a truck hit her too. <em>Jen.</em> Now that was someone she never thought she would have a 1 to 1 conversation with.</p><p>Not for a lack of interest. Not on her part anyway.</p><p>April found Jens hatefulness and arrogance quite intruguing actually. Rightful arrogance, to be fair.</p><p>The womans mean comments paired with her somehow cheerfull attitude was confusing. <br/><br/></p><p>April liked being confused. Being confused gave her something to get to the bottom of, she liked that.</p><p>That’s why she felt so drawn to the woman now. Actually <em>talking </em>to Jen had made her even more confused.</p><p>Jen had listened to April talk about her divorce  for hours and she didn’t even looked disinterested. She engaged in the conversation. Gave April a different perspective.</p><p>Something so banal as her relationship drama seemed below her. Seemed like something Jennifer would find so incredibly boring.</p><p>Yet, the woman listened, <em>comforted her</em> even. Why?</p><p>The ring of her phone broke her out of her thoughts.</p><p>It was Leslie of course. Who else?</p><p>She groaned, answering the phone “Leslie, you have about 3 seconds before I hang up.”</p><p>           <br/><br/></p><p> </p><p>The day went mostly the same as any other for the past month. <br/><br/></p><p>She ate a late breakfast, had a quick weak moment, remembering her mornings with Andy and Champion, read a few chapters of a book she didn’t remember the name of and just layed in bed. <br/><br/></p><p>The only thing that differentiated today from any other Saturday this month was <em>her</em>.</p><p>April couldn’t get that damned woman out of her head.</p><p>’Jen Barkley ;)´</p><p>She has been staring at her contact for the past 10 minutes. Remembering how Jen typed in the contact name, winking at her before climbing into her taxi and driving away.</p><p>Figuring out what to text Jen was a nightmare.</p><p>April didn’t text people. She sincerely thought the last text she sent (that wasn’t a shopping list for Andy or annoying Leslie) was to her 2 gay boyfriends in collage.</p><p>’I feel like my head is gonna explode and not in a good way’ </p><p>She quickly sent the text, before she decided against it.</p><p><em>Why was she nervous?</em> It’s not like she needed to impress the woman for some reason.</p><p>Before she fell victim to her thoughts, her phone dinged.</p><p>’Oh darling I’m sorry for you. I have a really great tea for hangovers. I can make it for you if you come over’</p><p>Well. Thats gone better than she expected.</p><p>’Okay, give me you adress then’</p><p>’Promise not to murder me in my sleep if I do?’</p><p>’…maybe’</p><p>’Good enough’</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>                        </p><p>She must have the wrong house. There’s no way Jen lives in this alone. Does she live alone? <br/><br/></p><p>Maybe Jennifer has a husband.. or a wife. She never mentioned anyone.</p><p>April felt a pit form in her stomach. For <em>some reason.</em></p><p>She pushed the feeling away and rang the doorbell.</p><p>”Come in sweetie, the gate is open” Jens distorted voice came through the doorbell.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The door to the house opened and April couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>Jen wasn’t in her usual attire, instead she wore booty shorts, a white t-shirt and some slippers. <br/><br/></p><p>She looked so domestic<em>.</em> April has never seen her look so <em>human.</em></p><p>”Hi there sweet,” She stepped away from the door, gesturing for April to come inside “welcome to my humble abode” She chuckled</p><p>”You actually live here?” Chestnut brown eyes looked around the house “Alone?” She asked, hopefully.</p><p>”Yea, just me, nice right?”</p><p>“Y’know, I might reconsider. I might actually kill you and move in here. I’d have to adopt a cat or two tho, no offence, but just your corpse wouldn’t be enough to not make me go insane in here.”</p><p>Jennifer snickered “I think having a dead body in ‘your’ house already makes you insane” </p><p>She headed towards the kitchen, preparing the promised tea.</p><p>”Well I’d still want to talk to you sometimes, I’d just imagine your voice”</p><p>”Oh honey,” She looked at April over her shoulder “You can’t imagine me, I’m unpredictable”</p><p>She had a point there, the younger woman had to admit.</p><p>”Ugh, fine, I guess I’ll keep you alive”</p><p>”Good girl”</p><p>April freezed. <em>What? </em>How can she just say that? And be so fucking nonchalant about it?</p><p>Aprils mind reeled as Jen put the electric kettle on. She turned around to face April and hopped up on the counter.</p><p>”You are a bit red there, hon. Everything okay?” She asked, no actual concern on her face, just a teasing smirk.</p><p>”Y-yea, just got stuck in my head for a bit” Technically, she wasn’t lying. <br/><br/></p><p> </p><p>April drank her tea, alteady feeling better. Jennifer sitting next to her on the couch.</p><p>“Why do you need a house this big? Do you have that many guests?”</p><p>”Oh no, not at all, this is my oasis right here. I don’t let just anyone in here. Consider yourself special” She smiled warmly</p><p>April chose to ignore that little comment for the sake of her sanity.</p><p>”Don’t you get lonely in here then?”</p><p>The older woman shrugged “Eh, sometimes, sure. I have to talk to so many idiots at work, so it’s nice to come back to an empty house. Noone to ask me idiotic questions in here.”</p><p>”I get that, people are annoying. What about a  pet? A cat maybe?”</p><p>”I thought about it, but with having to travel all over so often, finding someone to take care of it would be such a pain in the ass. Besides, what if the cats a bitch”</p><p>April let out a snort laugh.<br/><br/></p><p>“What was that? Did I make the Ice Princess laugh? Do I get an award for that?” She teased</p><p>”Shut up, I didn’t laugh” She mumbled under her breath.</p><p>”Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone you’re able to laugh.” She leaned in to her, her breath tickling Aprils ear “It will our little secret”</p><p>This woman was gonna be the death of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>April went home in a better mood than she had been in for months.</p>

<p>Jen was fine. Cool, collected, totally on top of it as always.</p><p>Except she wasn’t.</p><p>Her and April had been talking for about 2 weeks (16 days, but who’s counting?) and the younger woman has already gotten under her skin.</p><p>April had moved into her ribcage, she was sure of it. <br/><br/></p><p>Why else would she feel so warm and fuzzy anytime she talked to the girl?</p><p>Had she drugged her? Put a spell on her or something?</p><p><em>She is always talking about being a witch.</em> Jen smiled at the thought. <em>Ugh, fuck.</em></p><p>The undeniable fact was that Jen liked April. Had a crush on her or whatever the kids are calling it these days.</p><p>Which was absolutely insane. Jennifer Barkley didn’t do crushes. She used people for sex. Lusted over someone once in a while, but a genuine human connection? The thought would’ve made her sick 16 days ago.</p><p>It still kinda did.</p><p>Whatever it was, it would have to take the backseat. April hasn’t even been divorced for 2 months yet.</p><p>But fuck, was it getting difficult to ignore it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jen was answering emails. She was busy, as she always was. Yet as soon as April texted her, she dropped everything, as she always did.</p><p>Ice princess: ‘Do you have a good lawyer?’</p><p>She frowned, eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>Me: ‘I do, why?’</p><p>Ice princess: ‘I’m gonna burn this fucking building to the ground and I need someone to represent me in court’</p><p>She sighed in relief as an easy smile made its way on her face.</p><p>Me: ‘That bad, huh?’</p><p>Ice princess: ‘People are idiots, I’m just gonna murder everyone in the building’</p><p>Me: ‘Not sure even my lawyer could get you out of that, hon’</p><p>Ice princess: ‘You would bail me out tho, right?’</p><p>Me: ‘I would have to. You wouldn’t last a week in prison, sweets. Besides, who would drink wine with me and talk to me about the Salem witch trials?’</p><p>Me: ‘That does NOT give you a free pass for murder tho!!’</p><p>Ice princess: ‘boring. (I’d make prison my bitch)’</p><p>Jen chuckled. <br/><br/></p><p>Texting. That was another thing that had started to occur. <br/><br/>What started as just a few text regarding their hangout soon turned into texting all throughout the day.</p><p>A few employees even caught her smiling at her phone, which was unacceptable of course.</p><p>She really was Fucked with a capital F.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t seen April for 3 days, which was proving to be too much.</p><p>Working in politics, where everyone is lying and scheming all the time, it was nice to go out with someone so painfully honest.</p><p>April was like a breath of fresh air and Jen craved it.</p><p>Without thinking much about it she pulled out her phone and went to text the girl.</p><p>Me: ‘Wanna come over and tell my why you wanted murder everyone today?’</p><p>She impaciently waited for the response, tapping her nails on the hardwood table. <br/><br/></p><p>The reply came through soon enough.</p><p>Ice princess: ‘Can I kill your nosy-ass neighbor?’</p><p>Me: ‘No, you can leave a threat in his mailbox again tho’</p><p>Ice princess: ‘Okay, I’m coming over’</p><p>Good. Jen thought she would go insane if she didn’t see April for another day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The older woman barely opened the door, before April was strolling in.</p><p>“Hello to you too, sweets” She said in her faux-annoyed voice</p><p>”Do you think I’m emotionless?” The doe eyed girl asked suddenly.</p><p>”Wha-“ It was then she noticed Aprils teary eyes and little pout, she wished she could kiss it away. “No, no of course not. You might not show your emotions very often, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have them. Why would you think that?”</p><p>April sunk into the leather couch, crossed her arms over her chest and mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>”What was that darling?” She asked as she sat next to the younger girl and put a comforting hand on her knee.</p><p>April sighed “This guy came in today, said he wanted at least 30k salary, flexible hours and work from home, while having barely finished high school. So I said he’s delusional and that I’m not a miracle worker” She layed her head on Jens shoulder “Then he got mad, called me an emotionless bitch and spit on me”</p><p>”He spit on you?!” Jen was furious, she wanted that man to suffer.</p><p>”Yea, I don’t care about that, but when he called me emotionless I remembered when we fought with Andy and he called me that and told me I only cared about myself” She almost whispered the last part</p><p>”Oh, honey, no” She wrapped her arm around the small shoulders “April, look at me. You are the best thing thats ever happened to him” She pul her hand on a wet cheek and wiped an escaping tear from her face “and if he doesn’t see that, then he’s a bigger idiot than I thought”</p><p>Brown eyes snapped to hers. “Yeah?” <br/><br/></p><p>“Yes, definietly. I can hire a hitman for both of them if you want”</p><p>That got a chuckle out of April. She leaned into Jen and layed her head on her shoulder.</p><p>Yep. She was totally fucked.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Her legs were shaking, soft whimpers and heavy breathing were the only sounds in her bedroom.</p><p>”Ngh, please, please I need- hah” April squirmed, the only thing keeping her grounded were the arms thrown over her hips.</p><p>Jen smirked, looking up at her through her eyelashes. “What do you need, sweet girl?”</p><p>April only whined, her hands flying to Jens hair, trying (and failing) to guide her head where she needed it.</p><p>Jennifers smirk only widened, before turning into a mock-pout. “Nuh uh darling, if you want something, you need to ask for it”</p><p>She let out a frustrated groan “Need your mouth! Make me feel good, pleasee!”</p><p>She sounded desperate. <br/><br/></p><p>In any other situation, she would’ve hated it. Yet when she saw the pleased expression on Jens face, she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p>“That’s a <em>good gir</em>l” The sultry voice said from below.</p><p>She watched Jen get closer to the place she needed her. <br/><br/>So very close, she could almost feel her tongue. Almost.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The alarm rung. <br/><br/></p><p>Her eyes flew open.</p><p>What the <em>hell</em> just happened?</p><p>April slammed her hand on her phone so hard she thought she broke it. She didn’t. </p><p>The phone lit up, a message on the screen from <em>Jen.</em></p><p>She was suddenly very aware of the wetness in her underwear. <br/><br/></p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>How could this happen? Well, actually, it’s not that hard to see how it happened. Jen was gorgeous and smart and funny and perfect.</p><p>April groaned. The dream has ruined any chance of continuing to lie to herself that Jen was <em>just a friend.</em></p><p>She needed a shower.</p><p>She needed to wash away all the irritation and sexual frustration.</p><p>And if she touched herself under the warm water that was her business.</p><p> </p><p><br/>April couldn’t stop thinking about the dream. She sat on the couch, eating her cereal, thinking of the sinful spark in Jens eyes as she lowered herself between her legs.</p><p>This was fucked up. It’s only been 2 and a half months since she and Andy divorced. How can she be having these thoughts already.</p><p>She felt horrible. She wanted to text Jen. That might just make it worse though.</p><p>Eh, fuck it.</p><p>She opened Jens chat to find a message staring at her.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Morning sweets! We still down for lunch?</p><p>Right. She was supposed to have lunch with Jen today.</p><p>Could she face her? Should she cancel? Jen would definitely notice something was up. She should definitely cancel.</p><p>Me: As long as it’s not that Chinese place again. The music pisses me off.</p><p>Jen (the better one): You got it hon ;)</p><p>
<em>Goddamnit.</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>And so April found herself at some fancy Italian place Jen picked.</p><p>Speaking of, Jen walked in like she owned the place. Aprils mind immediately went to the dream. She flushed.</p><p>”Hey there, hon.” Jen said, clearly in a good mood, her expression soon changed to one of concern “You okay? You seem a little flushed”</p><p>”Y-yea-“ Before she even had time to properly answer, Jen was right in front of her, holding her jaw, looking for some signs of sickness.</p><p>The action made April get even redder. She pushed Jennifers hands away. “I’m fine” She said, looking at her own hands.</p><p>Jen clearly didn’t believe her, but got the message not to push. April was eternally grateful for that.</p><p>Dropping the subject of Aprils well-being, Jen immediately got into a story about some dumbass wannabe politician.</p><p>April tried to listen, she did, but the thoughts of dream-Jen couldn’t leave her mind.</p><p>After about 20 minutes Jen got fed up. “Okay, what is up with you?” She said, a hint of irritation in her voice.</p><p>”I’m fi-“ She started </p><p>“Don’t give me that bullshit. Something is bothering you. I know you April. You’re being weird, even for you. Is it Andy? Had a dream about him or something?”</p><p>Her eyes widened. <em>Not about Andy, no.</em> She wanted to say.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “N-no, just” she scrambled for something to say “how soon after ending it is it okay to have thoughts about someone else?” She blurted out.</p><p>That caught Jen off guard. Multiple emotions passed over her face in just a few seconds. Shock, understanding, amusement and<em> something else,</em> annoyance maybe? Before her expression settled on a small smile.</p><p>”Is that it? Do you feel bad, because you have thoughts about someone else?” She asked</p><p><em>Something like that.</em> She thought. “Yea, I mean, it hasn’t even been 3 months yet, I just feel guilty I guess” She said, looking at her hands. She wasn’t technically lying, it did bother her, even if it wasn’t the whole reason she was being weird.</p><p>Jens eyes softened. “Darling the marriage was over months before you actually divorced. If you keep waiting to not feel guilty about it, you’ll be waiting forever. It’s okay if you want to start dating again”</p><p>April released the breath she didn’t know she was holding. “Okay, yea, you’re right”</p><p>”Honey I’m always right.” She took a sip of her wine “So who’s the lucky guy.. or girl?”</p><p>”Pfft.. I’m not telling. Gotta keep some of my mysteries. You already know way too much. Might have to lock you up somewhere” She said in a monotone voice.</p><p>It made Jen laugh “There’s my little weirdo”</p><p>April tried to ignore the funny feeling in her stomach at that.</p>

<p>April can’t sleep. It’s been like this for at like a week and a half now. She lies down, closes her eyes and nothing.</p><p>Her mind can’t shut the hell up. Ever since Jen told her it’s okay to start dating again. (Something she didn’t know she needed) She’s been obsessing over it.</p><p>Because she didn’t want to date just <em>anyone.</em> She wanted to date <em>Jen.</em> </p><p>But how would she even talk to her about it? </p><p>‘Hey Jen, so, remember when I said I was thinking about someone else and you told me it’s okay to want to start dating again? Yea, so that was about you, anyways, wanna be my girlfriend?’ </p><p>She almost wanted to laugh at herself. </p><p>Being in a relationship for so long, she completely forgot how to deal with <em>this.</em></p><p>Now, she didn’t really know what to do before either, but that’s beside the point. The point was- she liked Jen, wanted to date her.</p><p>Jen, who was so funny and smart and pretty and <em>very </em>non-commital.</p><p>April groaned and threw her head to the other side, catching a glimpse of the alarm on her nightstand. 1:47 am. She’s been stuck with these fucking thoughts for 2 hours <em>at least.</em></p><p>She grabbed her phone, searching for a distraction.</p><p>After a few minutes of scrolling through facebook, trying to find something even a little interesting, a message came through.</p><p>Jen (the better one): U up?</p><p>Her finger hovered over the notification before clicking on it.</p><p>Me: No.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Great. Why? Have trouble falling asleep?</p><p>Me: Yea, just a lot on my mind ig. </p><p>Jen (the better one): Care to share?</p><p>Me: Nah, don’t feel like it. Wbu? Why are u up?</p><p>Jen (the better one): Im at a work thing. </p><p>Me: Ah, boring enough to text me at 2 am?</p><p>Jen (the better one): Yes and no. Yes because I’m surrounded by men with egos so inflated they might pop any second. No, because I wanted to ask u something.</p><p>Me: What’s up?</p><p>Jen (the better one): One of the guys I’ve done some stuff for in the past is hosting a gala and he invited me, said I could bring a date and who better to ask than you, sweets? ;)</p><p>Me: Are you drunk?</p><p>Jen (the better one): A little, thats got nothing to do with this tho. Come on :( Wouldn’t want me to bore to death, would you? Theres gonna be free booze, free food and a lot of idiots to make fun of.</p><p>Me:Lunch later? We can talk about it.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Anything that works for you, darling. Make it a late lunch tho, you bet Im sleeping till noon tomorrow.</p><p>Me: Tonight.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Don’t be annoying.</p><p>Me: Never.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Im counting on tomorrow, go to sleep now, sweets. Youre gonna be whiny tomorrow if u dont.</p><p>Me: Don’t tell me what to do.</p><p>Jen (the better one): You know Im right.</p><p>Me: Whatever, night.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Sweet dreams, darling. ;)</p><p>She put the phone down on the nightstand. How could she <em>not like</em> Jen when she acted like this all the time?</p><p>She decided to drop ot for today and try to sleep again. This time, she fell asleep almost immediately.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2:14 pm, that’s what her display said at least. Jen was supposed to come at 2 pm. Just as she was about to call Jen, someone put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Expecting Jen, she turned around, ready to complain about waiting. When she took in the other person, she was surprised to find a tall guy standing in front of her.</p><p>”What?” She barked out, annoyed.</p><p>The guys small smile turned into a shocked expression. </p><p>“Oh- uh, sorry, I just-“ He cleared his throat awkwardly “You’ve been waiting here for a while and I thought you might want some company” He smiled again </p><p>“I don’t” Came a dry response </p><p>“Hah, well, I mean, I thought that, maybe we could get a coffee while you wait”</p><p>Was this guy <em>flirting with her?</em> She finally looked at the guys face, really looked at it. He was handsome she supposed, still, she had no interest in whatever he was offering.</p><p>”Not interested, thanks” Doesn’t hurt to be polite once in a while, right?</p><p>”Oh come on. I’m a nice guy, just a coffee”</p><p>Oh, guess it did hurt to be nice after all.</p><p>”I would rather hang myself on your shoelaces”</p><p>”Ohh, I was playing nice, but maybe I should try a different approach on such a feisty little thing” He smirked. <em>Ugh, gross. </em>His fingers barely grazed her waist before she was tugged backwards by her hips.</p><p>Jennifers familiar parfume filled her nostrils, she let out a relieved breath, before it hitched again when Jen pressed her front against her back. One of her hands still resting on Aprils hip as she kissed her cheek.</p><p>”Hey darling, sorry I’m late.” Came her melodic voice “And who’s this?” Jen raised an eyebrow at the guy, who by now looked like a dear in headlights.</p><p>”I-I’m Carter” He turned to April “So you’re..?”</p><p>“In a relationship. With me. So, Carter, you’re gonna walk away now, before I sue you for harassment, hm?” Jen said in that faux sweet voice that reeked of poison.</p><p>Without another word, the man spun on his heel and walked away.</p><p>Jen peeled herself away from her after a beat too long.</p><p>”Sorry about that” She said, fixing her outfit “You okay, sweets?” She looked at April, the poison all gone from her face.</p><p>”Y-yea, I’m fine”</p><p>”Good. Let’s go in, shall we?”</p><p>And so they did.</p><p>Was that Jen being <em>jealous?</em> No, probably not, or maybe? Whatever it was, it was sexy as fuck and April <em>knew</em> she was gonna think about it as she lies in bed tonight.</p><p> </p>

<p>It was Thursday evening and she was lying in bed. The gala was on Saturday.</p><p>April would like to say she didn’t know how Jen convinced her to do this, but honestly, she wasn’t sure she could say ‘no’ to the woman at this point.</p><p>
<em>God, she needed to tell the woman or she’d go crazy.</em>
</p><p>She needed advice. Advice from someone who always knows what to say. Someone that wasn’t Jennifer.</p><p>She groaned audibly.</p><p><em>Well, she’d have to tell her at some point. </em>April thought as she unlocked her phone and clicked into the chat.</p><p>Me: Hey, wanna meet tomorrow? I need help with something.</p><p>Before long, her phone lit up with a response.</p><p>Mom 02: OMG, yayy. Of course, meet for lunch at BB’s?</p><p>Me: Sure.</p><p>Mom 02: So excited!!!</p><p>April threw her head back against the pillow and groaned <em>again.</em> (Groaning one time did not show how annoyed she was at this whole situation)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As soon as she stepped into the diner, she was met with Leslie beaming at her from across the space.</p><p>“April hi, oh my god I haven’t seen you in so long-“ The blonde opened her arms.</p><p>”Don’t hug me” April barked out quickly, but as soon as she did, arms enveloped her.</p><p>”I haven’t seen you in 2 months, I’m entitled to this hug” The blonde almost whispered into her hair. <em>God, she loved it when Leslie got a little psycho.</em></p><p>After the hug and some initial catching up.(jobs, Ben, the kids. Boring stuff) Leslie finally asked the question.</p><p>”So, what did you need help with?” She looked at April, curiosity behind those <em>ridiculously </em>big blue eyes.</p><p>The brunette sighed “Okay” She slammed her hands against the table “Two things first. 1- do NOT make a big deal out of this. 2- do NOT tell anyone- yes, even Ben. Understand?”</p><p>“Understand.” Leslie said seriously, before adding “Oh my god, this is so exciting.”</p><p>April fought the urge to roll her eyes. She lost that fight.</p><p>”So, I’ve been getting really close to this person and I know it’s still so early since Andy, but <em>she </em>said something like ‘the marriage was over months before’ and ‘if you wait until the right time you’ll be waiting forever’ and it kinda stuck with me. So I want to tell her how I feel.” She let out a breath “Thoughts?” April looked at the blonde expectantly.</p><p>Leslies eyes looked ready to pop out of her skull. “Wow, April, that’s a lot. So y-you like a woman?”</p><p>”Yes”</p><p>”Okay and you want to be in a relationship with her?”</p><p>”Yes”</p><p>”Do I know her”</p><p>April froze. “Yes”</p><p>That admission made a Leslie smile like a dork. “Oh my god, really? Who is it? Wait no, I’m gonna guess”</p><p>”You won’t guess it”</p><p>Leslie cracked her knuckles. “You underestimate me.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t guess it.</p><p>”Okay, I give up, who is it?” She said, clearly desperate to know already.</p><p>April wiped her sweaty palms and let out a nervous breath. She really was going to admit it out loud.</p><p>”It’s Jen” She stated.</p><p>Leslie stared at her for a moment.</p><p>”Your coworker? You said I knew her, that’s not fair! Besides I thought you said she was a total bit-“</p><p>April let her head fall onto the wooden table, making a loud thud. Before straightening back up.</p><p>She calmed herself. “Not my coworker. Jen Barkley”</p><p>Leslie stared for a good 30 seconds.</p><p>”What?!” She shouted</p><p>”Lower your voice!” April said quietly “I told you not to make a big deal out of it!”</p><p>”This is a big deal! I didn’t even know tou 2 talked to each other”</p><p>”Yea, well, we do. Really often”</p><p>Leslie let out a chuckle of disbelief. “That’s insane” She stated, before getting herself together to find out more “And Jennifer is, y’know?” She made a scissor signs with her hands.</p><p>April groaned before replying. “Yes”</p><p>”Okay so? What’s the problem, just tell her”</p><p>”The problem is,”She mocked Leslies tone “Jennifer Barkley isn’t exactly known for her commited relationships” </p><p>The blonde made a face “Well she isn’t known for voluntarily interacting with anyone from Pawnee, but here you are”</p><p>That actually was a good point.</p><p>”Okay, so you think I should tell her?”</p><p>”Definietly, yes” </p><p>“Okay” She nodded</p><p>”So how did you two start talking?” Leslie asked. They had a strangely pleasant conversation about that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She finally threw herself on the bed, when her phone dinked.</p><p>Jen (the better one): Ready for the gala tomorrow? Do I need to send some dresses over? If you show up in jeans I will strangle you.</p><p>April smiled warmly.<em> Gross.</em></p><p>Me: No you don’t, im capable of dressing myself, thank you. (Don’t threaten me with a good time)</p><p>Jen (the better one): God you’re weird, I don’t know why I talk to you.</p><p>Me: You’d miss my cheerful attitude</p><p>Jen (the better one): right.</p><p>She licked her phone and rolled over on her back.</p><p>She was gonna tell her at the gala. Worst case scenario, Jen rejects her and never talks to her again.</p><p>
<em>Yikes</em>

<p>April was nervous as hell.</p><p>She was gonna tell Jen about her feelings tonight, she wasn’t bugging on that. No chickening out. However it was hour and a half before Jen was supposed to pick her up and she still hadn’t had the faintest idea about <em>how</em> to tell her.</p><p>April was never all that good at communicating her feelings. Shocker. So telling Jen <em>(who did NOT date)</em> that she had feelings for her was an almost impossible task.</p><p><em>I could just kiss her and go from there.</em> She caught herself thinking, but the thought of Jen refusing her kiss with the same look of pity she had when she was consoling her about Andy was painful as hell. <em>So, no to the kissing then I guess.</em></p><p>She wished she could just find out whether Jen feels the same or not <em>before </em>the confession.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>The idea hit her like a brick in the head.</p><p>When that guy in front of the Italian place hit on her Jen seemed almost possessive of her.</p><p>April didn’t know if it was jealousy or just protectiveness, because she clearly didn’t want to be hit on.</p><p>But maybe if she <em>did</em> want to get hit on. (Or at least pretend to anyway) She could totally recognize if Jen is jealous or not and she could go from there. If Jen doesn’t seem bothered by the flirting, April will just have to get over her (as painful as that sounds). And if she does, then back to the kissing plan.</p><p>Awesome. Totally bulletproof plan. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>
5:49 pm. Jen should pick her up any minute now. Her nerves were at all times high, but she had a plan and it was gonna be great, right?</p><p>April waited, sitting on the sofa in her red dress, looking at her phone like it personally offended her.</p><p>When it finally rung she picked it up immediately.</p><p>”Wow, someone’s eager. Not such a bother after all, huh sweets?” Came the distorted voice </p><p>April huffed, making sure it could be heard on the other line “I can still cancel on you.”</p><p>”Come on hun, don’t be like that.” The older woman chuckled “We’re pulling up in front of your apartment building now”</p><p>”Fine, guess I’ll be down in a minute then”</p><p>”That’s what I like to hear, don’t keep me waiting” Jen said and ended the call.</p><p>April shook her nerves off as best as she could. She looked at herself in the mirror for the last time. Looked at the dress, the somewhat elegant updo she managed to do somehow, the pointy black heels. She looked great, if she did say so herself.</p><p>One last look and she was out the door.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as she walked out of the apartment building, her eyes caught Jen and <em>holy fuck she was in</em> <em>trouble. </em>She took the politician in as she walked over to the car. Eyes so wide they might pop out of her sockets.</p><p>Jen wore a dark green dress with a neckline so deep a nun might have a heart attack just looking at it, April almost did anyway. The dress was <em>tight, </em>which meant that April could see every little dip on Jens body and <em>fuck</em> did it make her salivate. Paired with the voluminous hair and the pointiest heels ever invented she was <em>a vision.</em></p><p>As she got closer, Jen finally looked up from her phone, she grinned as soon as her eyes caught April. April didn’t miss the way Jen shamelessly checked her out.</p><p>With the ego-boost, some of her nervousness fell away.</p><p>”You look like those mean ladies on ‘The Real Housewives’ I always had a crush on when I was a kid” She blurted out. So what, a little flirting could help.</p><p>The woman arched an eyebrow and her lips curved into a smirk “That so? Well I can be a little mean if you want ne to sweets” She shot back.</p><p>That made April blush a little, before she could think of a response, Jen was speaking again.</p><p>”I have to say I’m impressed, you look…” She dragged her gaze up and down April, looking at her like she wanted to devour her. <em>April would let her. </em>“I just didn’t expect you to clean up this nice”</p><p>April mock-gasped, her hand flying to cover her heart “You wound me Jen. I can be very professional and elegant” She said, her tone way too dramatic to be viewed as anything but sarcastic. Also had a <em>weird </em>accent, was that british?</p><p>The older woman chuckled. “Well, I see that now.” She motioned to the car and opened the door “Shall we?”</p><p>April just nodded and as she was getting into the car she felt Jens hand brush her lower back. <em>And she hadn’t even had anything to drink yet. </em>She thought. This was gonna be a long night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first hour of the gala was surprisingly fun. She and Jen were getting drunk off of expensive champagne while Jen talked shit about every person she introduced her to.</p><p>That was fun too, the introductions, so far she got to play a Russian orphan, a southern christian girl and a woman with head trauma that thought she was 76. </p><p>She doubted anyone believed her, but that wasn’t the point anyways.</p><p>”-like seriously, who asks their <em>campaign manager </em>for money? It was ridiculous! I cussed him off AND sued him for the money he owed me. Such a fucking idiot, seriously.” Jen rolled her eyes and took another sip of the champagne. </p><p>She was already a tipsy, April was very aware of the increased physical contact. Jen seemed focused on her waist today, maybe she could skip the whole jealousy bit and just-</p><p>Before she finished the thought, a hand that was <em>definitely not</em> Jens had settled on her shoulder. She cringed at the rough palm.</p><p>She didn’t miss the look Jen had as the looked at the hand.</p><p>”I’m sorry ladies, may we interrupt?” Asked one of the two men that came into view as he finally lifted his hand off her shoulder.</p><p>Jen, putting on her professional face, nodded. “Of course, April, these fine gentlemen are Jacob and Jack Thomsons.” She motioned to the guys, then motioned to her “Gentlemen, this is April Ludgate”</p><p>The guy that touched her shoulder, Jacob, took her hand and kissed the back of her hand. She cringed internally.</p><p>Jen looked like she was ready to murder him, but before anything could come out of her mouth, the other guy, Jack, spoke up. “May I borrow you for a minute, I have something to discuss with you.” He spoke to Jen. When he saw her unsure look he spoke again “I’m sure my brother can keep Miss Ludgate company for a while”</p><p>Jen shot April a look. “It’s fine, I’ll be fine, go” The younger woman said. <em>This was it, her opportunity.</em></p><p>The latter gave her a final quick look, before walking off with John. Was that his name?</p><p>Her train of thought was interrupted by Jacobs deep voice “So, you don’t look like the type to go to fancy galas”</p><p>”I’m not. Jen brought me here” She replied as enthusiastically as she could muster.</p><p>”I figured. Me neither, I’d much rather be playing video games with a cute latina by my side” He said cockily</p><p><em>Ugh, this guy was disgusting. </em>“Yeah? So why are you here?” She smiled.</p><p>“My brother brought me here, it’s a family thing, we’re one of the most influential families in DC you know?” <br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Oh really? That’s interesting” She couldn’t care less.</p><p>”It’s true, filthy rich too, I could show you the mansion if you want to”</p><p><em>Bet it’s not nearly as nice as Jens.</em> “That would be so great” She said, her voice dripping in faux sweetness.</p><p>”Yeah, I could take you home tonight” He put his hand on her hip and leaned in “and show you more than just she mansion” He whispered in her ear. His breath smelled of cheetos.</p><p>It took all the self control she had bot to punch him in the throat right now. Fortunately she didn’t have time for that, because as he leaned in to kiss her cheek, a hand on her wrist tugged her backwards. She smirked, already knowing who it was.</p><p>Jen was dragging her through the ballroom without a word, when they finally reached an empty hallway, April took a deep breath and got ready to confess.</p><p>“Jen I wan-“ Before she could get the full sentence out, Jens lips were on hers. Claiming her. Soft hands with sharp nails gripped her waist tightly.</p><p>The younger woman let out a surprised squeak, before throwing her arms around the latters neck and melting into the kiss.</p><p>It was life-changing. Jen kissed her like she was starved, like she wanted to consume her whole. Soon, her tongue has found its way into her mouth. It tasted of expensive champagne. Delicious. April moaned into the kiss.</p><p>That seemed to snap Jennifer back into reality. She pulled away and took a step back, hands falling away like she hand burned her.</p><p>After a few moments of catching breath April wanted to speak, but before she could get a single sound out Jen had bolted out of the hallway.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>It took April a few seconds to recover before she ran right after her.</p><p>She stumbled in her heels and a hand settled on her back.</p><p>”Carefull prince-“</p><p>”Touch me again, I’ll cut your hands off” She said, before recovering and beelining for the door.</p><p>Once she finally gout out the mansion, she could just see Jennifers car driving into the distance.</p><p>April sighed. “<em>Fuck.</em>” She swore under her breath.</p><p>After a few minutes of self pity, she dialed a number, it picked up immediately.</p><p>”Hey Leslie, can you come pick me up?”</p>

<p>The door clicked behind her.</p><p>”Fuck”</p><p>She slid down the door, settling on the cold floor.</p><p>Okay, so she kissed April. She couldn’t help herself, seeing that guy touch April as if she was his to touch set her off. She needed April to know she was <em>hers. </em><br/><br/></p><p>But April <em>wasn’t </em>hers. Wasn’t hers to touch. Wasn’t hers to kiss. She ultimately had no right to drag her away from Jacob (But really? Him of all people? C’mon April)</p><p>The other thing was- April kissed her back, very enthusiastically at that- which confused Jen even more, because why would she flirt with that guy if she <em>clearly </em>wanted to kiss Jen as much as Jen wanted to kiss her?</p><p>
<em>Could’ve found that out if I didn’t run away.</em>
</p><p>Jen put her head in her hands for a second before bolting to her feet. </p><p>She needed to drink some water, the alcohol made her stupid.</p><p> </p><p>After drinking some water and staring at her turned off TV for a few minutes, she came to a realization.</p><p>She would have to see April again.</p><p>She groaned out loud. Throwing her head back, letting it hit the soft cushion.</p><p>She could just move to LA and spend the rest of her life in vegetarian hell. It would still be better than facing the younger woman.</p><p><em>April would find me anyways</em>- the woman was way too good at stalking people. Proven by the time she found out why her neighbor was more insufferable than normal- her husband died, RIP Mr. Hart.</p><p>Jennifer wanted to scream and cry and vomit all over the place, she settled for watching something to distract herself.</p><p>As soon as the TV turned on, two women making out came on the screen.</p><p>Jen huffed, annoyed as she recognized ‘The L word’</p><p><em>Oh fuck off, now is not the time for lesbian representation. </em>She thought as she turned the TV off again.</p><p>She’d just go to sleep. That’s the one place April couldn’t follow her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Oh how very wrong she was.</p><p>Jen woke up sweaty and breathless with a certain stickiness between her thighs.</p><p>Dreaming about April wasn’t new per se, but today it pissed her off.</p><p><em>Wonder if she’s this loud in real li-</em> fuck no, she wasn’t doing this today. </p><p><em>Let’s just go back to sleep.</em> She thought, closed her eyes and- saw Aprils fucked out expression right in front of her. Her eyes snapped open.</p><p>She looked at her alarm- 6:30am. Way too early to be this horny.</p><p>She wasn’t some hormonal teenager, <em>she was a 42 year old woman for fucks sake!</em></p><p>She just needed a cold shower. That would help.</p><p> </p><p>It did not help, she still felt like a 15-year old boy after his first wet dream.</p><p>And so she did what any reasonable adult would do- she got herself off and locked the memory away, never to be remembered again.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was sitting behind her desk in her office. Answering some emails while drinking her morning coffee when her phonescreen lit up.</p><p>Ice princess: Hey, can I come over?</p><p>Jen stared at the notification. Nope. She was ignoring it. Definitely not ready for that yet. Besides, she was busy. Work couldn’t wait (It absolutely could)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2 days, 12 texts, 4 missed calls and 1 voicemail later Jen sat on her couch at 1:45pm drinking wine straight out of the bottle. (No need for fancy shit like a glass)</p><p>She was awfully bored, all her emails were answered, all her work was done, she even baked herself some fucking cookies- even tho she hated baking.</p><p><em>God,</em> what the fuck did she even do all the time before meeting April at the bar?</p><p>The bar. Right, that’s what she did. She went around bars and slept with anyone and everyone. Men, women, sometimes both at the same time.</p><p>The politician thought about it for a while, but it just didn’t seem fun to sleep with randos anymore. </p><p><em>Fuck,</em> what has this woman done to her?</p><p>She missed April like crazy, missed how much of a weirdo she was, missed her half-hearted threats, missed those big brown eyes, missed the smiles she tried (and failed) to hide, missed the lingering touches, missed making her blush- Jen missed everything about her.</p><p>
<em>Ugh, disgusting.</em>
</p><p>Just as she was about to take another swig of her bottle, her phone started ringing.</p><p>She looked at the screen, expecting the younger womans contact picture, she was surprised to find an unknown number staring back at her. </p><p>Intruiged, she set the bottle down and accepted the call.</p><p>”Jennifer Barkley, you better get your-“ An annoying angry voice came through.</p><p>”I’m sorry, who is this?” Jen interrupted.</p><p>”Wha- You don’t have my number? Seriously? We’ve worked together 3 times, why would you not have my number?“</p><p>”Eh, not ringing any bells”</p><p>”Goddamnit, it’s Leslie, Leslie Knope, from Pawnee”</p><p>”Oh my god, Leslie! Hi. How’s life, how’s Ben? Are the kids still so.. annoying?”</p><p>“Y-yeah, it’s fine, Ben is great, he’s- wait, no, you don’t actually care.”</p><p>”I reaally don’t”</p><p>”That’s not why I’m calling anyways. You have to get your shit together Jennifer Barkley!” Aand the angry voice was back.</p><p>”Excuse me?” Jen said in disbelief.</p><p>”You heard me. I mean I get that you’re scared, but ignoring her for 3 days is a bit much, don’t you think?”</p><p>Jen froze.</p><p>Of course, She should’ve expected this.</p><p>”What’s it to you?”</p><p>”What’s it to m-“ Oh she was getting angrier. “Oooh, you’re gonna make me mad. April is my friend and your inability to deal with your goddamn emotions is making her really miserable, so you’re gonna get your shit sorted out and you two are going to talk about this” She was borderline yelling now.</p><p>The brunette was quiet for a moment, processing everything. And then-</p><p>“…Is she really that sad?” </p><p>Her voice sounded almost.. insecure? She hadn’t heard it like that for decades.</p><p>Leslie sighed “Yeah, she is and I really don’t like seeing her like this. She was really nervous about the gala y’know?”</p><p>Jens ears perked</p><p>”Why would she be nervous?”</p><p>Leslie had the audacity to laugh.</p><p>”You know, for someone so smart, you sure can be real dumb”</p><p>”How dare y-“</p><p>”Jen. Just talk to her, please.” It was the blondes turn to cut her off this time.”</p><p>”…Yeah, I will”</p><p>”Good. You have a lot to think about, goodbye Jen”</p><p>”Bye.”</p><p>And then she hung up.</p><p>The truth was, Jen didn’t really have all that much to think about, she already knew everything she needed to know.</p><p>She took a few deep breaths. Her finger was milimeters from the call button on Aprils contact when the bell rang.</p><p> </p><p>On the screen she could see her, April, soaked through, waiting at her gate like an abandoned puppy. Her heart dropped. She opened the gate without a word.</p><p>She opened the door immediately after the first knock.</p><p>April stood there, those deep brown eyes full of tears, staring at her.</p><p>”Hey”</p><p> </p>

<p>“Hey”</p><p>Jen stared at her for a second, not knowing what to say for the first time in forever. Then she registered the state of the younger woman.</p><p>”Oh my god, April you’re soaked through! Come in.”</p><p>And April did, she stepped over the threshold of Jens home silently, gathering her thought for a bit.</p><p>”I’m sorry, I didn’t want to come, but you weren’t answering my texts and calls and I was worried-“</p><p>”April”</p><p>”-that you were mad at me. And I wouldn’t care if it was anyone-“</p><p>”April” She tried a little louder.</p><p>”-else, but I just can’t stand it when it’s you-“</p><p>”April!” She shouted finally</p><p>That made April finally stop. She was looking at her with those big brown puppy eyes glistening with tears. Jens heart ached.”</p><p>”Stop. Take a breath. I’ll get you something dry to wear, you’ll dry yourself a bit, change and then we’ll talk, okay?”</p><p>April nodded, looking so small, Jen felt like she could hold her in the palm of her hand.</p><p>She took Aprils hand, wincing at how cold it was. “Don’t worry your pretty little head darling, I’m not mad, promise.” She squeezed the hand a little before dropping it and walking off to find something for April to wear.</p><p>April sighed in relief. Jen wasn’t mad at her, she called her ‘darling’. Everything was gonna be alright.</p><p> </p><p>Jen returned after a few minutes.</p><p>”The clothes are on my bed and theres some towels in the bathroom, dry yourself off a bit, I’ll wait here, yeah?”</p><p>April nodded shallowly and walked off.</p><p>Jen groaned. She was never good at these things, she could discuss politics in Saudi Arabia for hours, but when it came to her feelings, she was hopeless.</p><p>What was she even supposed to say? Should she apologize? From what she gathered April blamed herself for some reason, which was stupid of course, she hadn’t done anything wrong.</p><p>The door to her bedroom opened. April walked towards her, hair damp, wearing Jens Yale t-shirt and sweats. Jen thought she looked beautiful.</p><p>She took a seat beside her on the couch, looking down at her fidgeting fingers.</p><p>”April, look at me” The older woman said softly.</p><p>As soon as April complied, she took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, as shitty as your taste apparently is, I shouldn’t have dragged you from him and I definitely shouldn’t have kissed you after. I let my feelings control my actions and this is how it ended up.”</p><p>Aprils eyes hadn’t moved from hers as she reached for her hand, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>”I wanted you to kiss me, I liked it. A lot.”</p><p>Jen looked dumbfounded. Gathering her thoughts for a second.</p><p>”If you wanted me to kiss you, why were you flirting with him?”</p><p>April blushed, cast her eyes downward and mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>”What was that, sweets?”</p><p>Her eyes still pinned to her hands, April spoke up. “I wanted to make you jealous.” She met her eyes “I wanted to make sure you felt the same before I confessed.”</p><p>The corner of Jens mouth turned upwards. “So you decided to flirt with the biggest idiot at the gala?”</p><p>April got even redder. “Shut up. It seemed like a good idea at the time.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, before Jen broke it.</p><p>”I do, by the way. Feel the same I mean. I really like you April” Jen blushed for a change.</p><p>April smiled, soft and genuine, so rare on Aprils face. Jen liked it.</p><p>”I like you too.”</p><p>Silence fell upon them once again. This time April spoke first.</p><p>”Why didn’t you answer my calls? I thought you were mad.”</p><p>Jen stiffened beside her. She knew it wasn’t the right thing to do, but she couldn’t bring herself to talk to April about it.</p><p>”I was scared. Horrified really, I didn’t even know if you liked women at the time and I just couldn’t confront the fact that I messed this up.”</p><p>”That was stupid”</p><p>”I know. Leslie called me earlier y’know? Opened my eyes a bit. I was about to call you when the doorbell rang. I’m sorry April, what I did was selfish, I don’t want to hurt you ever again.” </p><p>April stared at her for a bit, licking her lips and finally leaning up for a kiss.</p><p>Their lips touched. It was soft and sweet, nothing like the kiss they shared at the gala. Jens hands settled on Aprils cheeks, holding her close. April gripped her wrist and climbed sideways into her lap.</p><p>April was the one to pull away. She buried her face in Jens neck. </p><p>“Don’t leave again.” She mumbled</p><p>“I won’t”</p><p>“Promise?” She sounded so tired.</p><p>After a beat Jen finally answered. “Promise.”</p><p>With that April fell asleep. Snoring quietly.</p><p>Jen held her close. April had her wrapped around her little finger and she didn’t even realize it.</p><p>April made her feel something she’d never felt before. It scared the hell out of her.</p>

<p>April lies awake in bed in the early morning hours of the morning. It’s been about 2 weeks since they confessed to each other and it was great. </p><p>Not much has changed really, they still spent most of their free-time together, they still went out to eat or drink a lot and they still shittalked anyone and everyone.</p><p>A few things did change though and oh what great changes, April could just lean over and kiss Jen when she felt the urge to, she could hug her from behind when she was doing something in the kitchen and, Aprils personal favorite, she could snuggle up to Jen when they had movie nights- she couldn’t help it, Jen was always so warm and April craved it- kinda like a lizard.</p><p>There were only two things that bothered April about their… arrangement.</p><p>First- they hadn’t exactly defied what it was they were doing, they weren’t in a relationship (officially at least), but they weren’t not in a relationship really. If someone asked April if she was single right now she’d say no. Would Jen? Is it as serious to Jen as it is to her, or does she just view it as something casual?</p><p>Second- they haven’t done.. it yet. And even though April wouldn’t describe herself as an overly sexual person she knew Jen was. So why didn’t she make a pass at April yet? Did she think April would be bad in bed? Sure, all the experience she had was some above waist action with some random girl at a college party, but she was a quick learner and oh how she wanted to learn.</p><p>An unwelcome thought attacked Aprils tired brain.</p><p>
<em>Was Jen getting her fill from elsewhere?</em>
</p><p>Surely not, right? They spent most of their time together, she wouldn’t have the time.</p><p>
<em>You don’t spend your nights together.</em>
</p><p>April groaned out loud.</p><p>Jen wouldn’t really be doing anything wrong really. Once again- they weren’t in a relationship, she could do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted. She could surely get some experienced lesbian to sleep with her anytime.</p><p>
<em>Maybe she was having sex with someone right now.</em>
</p><p>Chestnut brown eyes flickered to a close. She wouldn’t think about that. Just the thought made her sick to her stomach.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>April woke up determined, she would talk to Jen about what was troubling her. She knew Jen had issues with commitment, but this was eating April up from the inside and she didn’t enjoy it nearly as much as she thought she would.</p><p>Luckily for her, she and the politician were meeting for lunch today, so she could bring it up then. She was so excited! (She wanted to impale herself or a machete)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She arrived in front of the restaurant 10 minutes early. Not really her style, but hey, can’t blame a girl for being nervous about potentially ruining her kinda-relationship, right?</p><p>She was in the middle of being swallowed by her own mind when two soft hands planted themselves on her waist and a sweet kiss was pressed to her shoulder.</p><p>April could feel her nervousness go away briefly, before coming back twice as hard.</p><p>”Hey hot stuff, ready to destroy some pasta?” The older woman asked enthusiastically.</p><p>April forced a smile and nodded. Then she leaned over and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to the other womans lips.</p><p>
<em>Maybe the last kiss you’ll get to give her.</em>
</p><p>Lips frowned and piercing blue eyes shone with concern. “Hey, you alright sweet girl?” She cupped Aprils cheek.</p><p>”Fine, just couldn’t sleep well” April answered half-truthfully.</p><p>”A lot on your mind?” Jen asked.</p><p>”Yea, kinda” She spoke quietly.</p><p>The politician smiled sweetly. “You can tell me all about it over some ravioli, yea?” </p><p>Before April had time to respond, the older woman was lacing their fingers together and leading her into the restaurant.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before long, Jen was chomping down her Ravioli and April was nervously stuffing her face with Carbonara.</p><p>The blue-eyed woman finally spoke. “So what is it you’re losing sleep over darling?”</p><p>April swallowed at let out a deep breath. </p><p>
<em>How was this harder than confessing?</em>
</p><p>When Jen raised an eyebrow she finally spoke. “Why haven’t you tried to sleep with me yet?”</p><p>Jen stopped chewing abruptly. And stared at her. “What?”</p><p>”I mean- You’re a very sexual person, right?” April fidgeted with her fork “So I just don’t understand why you wouldn’t want to have sex with me” She finished quietly.</p><p>Jen barked out a quick laugh. “And that’s what you’re losing sleep over?”</p><p>Suddenly April felt dumb. Time to bring up her second point. “Well, yeah. I mean if you’re getting it somewhere else that’s fine I guess. I know I’m inexperienced and it’s not like we’re dating, you wouldn’t be cheating on me-“</p><p>Jen dropped her fork. “Whoa whoa there sweetheart, let’s backtrack a little bit, yeah? What do you mean we’re not dating?”</p><p>It was Aprils turn to be stunned. “Are we?”</p><p>“Well yea, that’s what I thought we were doing at least. Do you not want to date me?” Jen asked.</p><p>The younger womans eyes widened. “No, no, I really do want to, like desperately. I just didn’t know if this was casual to you I guess”</p><p>Jens eyes softened with understanding. “Oh honey, this is not anything near casual to me. I’m serious about this April, about you. That’s why I haven’t tried to sleep with you yet, I was scared to mess it up, if it was casual I would’ve tried to bed you on the first day.”</p><p>It was like a boulder was being lifted from Aprils chest. “So you’re not sleeping with anyone else?”</p><p>The older woman chuckled. “Sweets I haven’t slept with anyone since we met at the bar.”</p><p>April released a relieved breath, “Good, because I was really not fine with it.”</p><p>”And you don’t have to be.” Jen smiled at her, before adding “Do you want me to sleep with you?” She smirked.</p><p>April blushed deep red. “I- well- yeah, I mean I’ve been thinking about it” she mumbled.</p><p>Jens smirked widened into a full grin. “Then how about you come over later so I can show you just how much I’ve been holding myself back?”</p><p>
<em>Well, shit.</em>

<p>April has been practically vibrating ever since her lunch with Jen.</p><p>She had already met with 3 clients, which had taken her mind off of Jen a little bit. Now though it was 20 minutes until 5, she had no more clients and her mind could not focus on anything else than finally having sex with Jen.</p><p>Could she leave early? She has too much nervousness, anticipation and lust inside her to do anything productive anyways. </p><p>Eh, fuck it. </p><p>She packed up her things and was out of the building in record time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She was meeting Jen at ‘around 6, but come whenever you’re ready darling’ which meant she was gonna be there at 6.</p><p>That left her about an hour to get ready.</p><p>Should she shower? She showered this morning. Yes, she should.</p><p>She showered, brushed her teeth, applied a little makeup and even did her hair. Now, for clothes.</p><p>First thing- underwear. That was easy, she had 2 matching sets (anniversary gifts from Andy, way more for him than for her, but they did come in handy) she picked up her favorite black one and moved on.</p><p>The rest of her clothes was trickier. She didn’t want to look like she was trying too hard, but still wanted Jen to want her from the moment she saw her. </p><p>After about 15 minutes of deep contemplation she settled on a grey skirt that reached her mid-thighs and an old The Cure T-shirt.</p><p>17:54. Perfect. She looked at herself in the mirror for the last time, took a deep breath and got out of her apartment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>18:09, April stood before the familiar gate. The anticipation was killing her. She swallowed her nerves and rang the doorbell.</p><p>”Come in darling” Came the distorted voice of her girlfriend.</p><p>She got to the door and waited for the politician to open it. She couldn’t help but have a permanent smile on her face.</p><p>When Jen opened the door she didn’t look too different from the first time April came here. Black booty shorts, white tank top and fluffy slippers. </p><p>Jen looked great in everything, but this had to be Aprils favorite, all soft and domestic.</p><p>Jen grabbed her waist and pulled her inside the house.</p><p>”Hey there my sweet” She said in that melodic voice of hers. “You have a good day at work?”</p><p>April put her hands around her neck. “Mh, ‘t was fine.” Was her reply before leaning in and kissing the others lips softly.</p><p>Jen slipped her pinky under the dark fabric of Aprils shirt. April gasped and Jen giggled, dropping her hands from the others waist.</p><p>She held out her hand expectantly. “Come along, we’re watching a movie”</p><p>April laced their fingers together and let herself be led to the couch.</p><p>She was confused, she didn’t come here for a movie, but expected Jen to have some kind if plan.</p><p>Once they settled on the couch, April sitting sideways in the older womans lap, Jen started the movie.</p><p>April immediately knew it wasn’t meant to capture anyones attention. She figured Jen just didn’t want to get straight into.. it.</p><p>About 10 minutes into the movie the politicians hand moved to stroke Aprils upper thigh under her skirt, her other hand already under her shirt, drawing patterns on her stomach.</p><p>She looked at Jen, who was staring straight ahead, but her expression showed she wasn’t interested in the movie at all.</p><p>April was being teased.</p><p>Well, two could play this game. She started laying soft little kisses and nips on Jennifers neck.</p><p>The older woman sighed. “Mhm, needy girl” her hand moved to her inner thigh, to which she received a sharp bite to the shoulder.</p><p>April kept groaning as Jens other hand moved up, now stroking along her ribs. </p><p>“Touch me” April whined “Please.”</p><p>Jen kissed her deeply, her tongue immediately asking for entrance, which April granted. </p><p>The kiss was slow passionate, lips and tongues  dancing together beautifully.</p><p>Jen broke the kiss and dropped her hands, April whined at the loss.</p><p>”Up you go, come on”</p><p>The younger girl groaned.</p><p>”What? Why?”</p><p>”Because I want you in a bed for this, sweetheart.”</p><p>That got April moving. She took Jens hand and got moving towards her bedroom.</p><p>Jen gripped her waist from behind.</p><p>”Eager girl, aren’t you? No patience” She smirked </p><p>“I’ve been patient.” She pushed the bedroom door open. “And I think you want this just as much as I do.” </p><p>She knew she was right when she turned to see how blown Jens pupils were. Her normally sky-blue eyes were now dark and stormy.</p><p>Before she could say anything else, Jen was tugging her t-shirt over her head, dropping kisses onto her collarbones.</p><p>”Mhm, smart girl.” </p><p>They were steadily moving back. Aprils knees hit the bedframe and she fell back, Jen now on top of her. They moved up the bed when Jen started kissing her lower, tugging her skirt down and throwing it somewhere to be forgotten.</p><p>Her hands moved under April and unhooked her bra. </p><p>“Wait-“ Came the breathy voice of her girlfriend.</p><p>Jen sat up, looking at her with concern. “What is it? Are you okay? Am I going too fast?”</p><p>”No” April blushed and looked away “You’re wearing too much” She mumbled.</p><p>Jen smiled sweetly and dropped a soft kiss to Aprils lips, before climbing off of her. </p><p>She stood next to the bed, getting out of her tank and shorts, underneath she was wearing white lacy matching set, looking so innocent yet so sinful on her body.</p><p>She climbed back on top of her and to Aprils surprise, unclasped her bra and threw it somewhere. </p><p>April stared. She knew her girlfriend was beautiful, but seeing her in all her glory was something else.</p><p>”Don’t be shy darling, you can touch.” She took Aprils hands in hers and put them on her body, just beneath her breasts.</p><p>April groaned when she moved her hands up, now groping Jens breasts, pinching her nipples between her fingers.</p><p>”You feel soft.” She said finally.</p><p>Jen giggled, cupping Aprils cheeks and kissing her.</p><p>”Can I take of your bra now?” She asked, careful not to put any pressure on Aprils.</p><p>April nodded, so Jen did, dropping it on the floor.</p><p>She started kissing the girls collarbones again, moving down and taking one of her nipples into her mouth, sucking softly. She took the other between her fingers and rolled it. </p><p>April groaned and arched her back beneath her. </p><p>“More.”</p><p>Jen couldn’t refuse such a sweet request, so she moved lower, peppering her stomach in kissed before finally peeling her panties off.</p><p>”Mhm, so nice and wet for me, so good for me” She purred.</p><p>April whimpered, the hot breath on her center combined with the praise was too much.</p><p>”Please.” She whined.</p><p>With that Jen ran her tongue along her slit, up to her clit.</p><p>April moaned loudly and her hands shot up to Jens hair, holding her in place.</p><p>Jen got to work. Pulling the girls clit between her lips, sucking softly, then firmer. She put two fingers to the girls entrance.</p><p>”Can I?” She asked.</p><p>April was possibly too far gone at this point, but she still whimpered out a ‘yes’.</p><p>Jen latched back onto her clit, pushing two fingers into Aprils warmth.</p><p>It didn’t take long to find the spongy patch of skin inside her and April fell apart. Jen slowed down and let her ride out her high.</p><p>When April whimpered in discomfort, she slipped her fingers out and climbed up, peppering her girlfriends face with kisses.</p><p>”You did so good darling” She said</p><p>After April caught her breath, words tumbled out immediately.</p><p>”I want to make you come now” She said, breathily</p><p>Jen, a little stunned, giggled. “You don’t have to do that my sweet, I’m happy just like this.”</p><p>April frowned. “No. I want to, I want you to feel as good as I did.” </p><p>The politician smiled, then kissed her cheek softly. “Okay.”</p><p>They rolled over, so Jen was on her back while April was next to her.</p><p>Jen took of her panties and dropped them to the floor.</p><p>April suddenly got nervous. “I, um- I don’t know- I’ve never-“</p><p>Jen cut her off with a kiss. “It’s okay, just do it like you do its to yourself, I’ll guide you through it.”</p><p>And so April did. </p><p>She started by slowly circling Jens clit, when she got a reaction she added more pressure. </p><p>“Yes, you’re doing so good” Jen moaned out “So good baby, inside now”</p><p>April followed the instructions, pressing two fingers into Jen. When she got a deep moan as a reaction, she started moving. </p><p>She eventually got confident, thrusting into Jen with fervor, finding her g-spot and massaging it.</p><p>”G-good, such a good girl, April.” </p><p>April, high off of the praise, put her thumb on her girlfriends clit, which sent Jen over the edge.</p><p>Drawing out every last bit of her orgasm, she pulled out when she felt Jen relax into the mattress.</p><p>”That was amazing, thank you, darling” She said, kissing Aprils cheek.</p><p>Aprils just hummed, obviously tired.</p><p>Jen smiled, looking down at the younger girl. She pulled her close. </p><p>“Sleep now, my sweet.”</p><p>And April did.</p><p> </p>
