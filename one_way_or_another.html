<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio takes a deep breath as she moves along the backstage door on her way to where Agatha is going to be talking with the press. It was a big day, but Agatha had announced that they would pick only three news outlets to conduct these interviews, and for some trick of faith, Underworld was one of them.</p><p> </p><p>This was probably the best opportunity of Rio’s life. She has been working as a journalist in the music field for almost 20 years now and Agatha was one of the reasons she got into music in the first place, so it was an understatement to say she was nervous. </p><p> </p><p>The person from the crew guided her inside the room and she sat on an armchair as she waited for the guy from Rolling Stones to finish his interview. Rio had some time, which was good because Jessica had gone to get some water and still hadn't come back.</p><p> </p><p>“As someone who is considered the new Mick Jagger, how do you feel about coming back to the stage after so long?” the guy obliviously asks and Rio can't help but flinch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face stays neutral, but Rio can see the way her eyes look at the guy with disdain. Rio couldn't blame Agatha, at this point in her career it's ridiculous that people are still using this type of comparison.</p><p> </p><p>“Elated,” Agatha simply says with the most boring tone Rio has ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>The guy struggles to keep the conversation going, but Rio can see that Agatha has already deemed it done. Rio bites her lip, trying to remain calm and rehearse in her head the questions she had prepared for her interview.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, thank you so much for talking to us, I will make sure to send Lilia a copy of the draft before it goes to press,” the guy finally says. “It was nice talking to you,”</p><p> </p><p>“Likewise,” Agatha says, but anyone could see that was far from the truth.</p><p> </p><p>The guy leaves, mumbling something like “what a bitch”, which was loud enough for Agatha to hear and let out a laugh. Rio realized then that she was left alone in the room with the other woman who now had her attention back on her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Agatha, it's such a pleasure to meet you, I’m Rio Vidal from Underworld,” Rio quickly moves to extend her hand for a handshake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her hand then, paying close attention to the ink adorning it, before saying. “The pleasure is all mine,”</p><p> </p><p>After giving Rio’s hand a quick squeeze, she walks around the room looking for something that Rio sees later it was her bag and picks a cigarette.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mind if I smoke? That guy just took the last of my sanity and I need to clear my mind,” she says, already placing the cigarette in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, following the movement of her hand. Her throat feels dry as Agatha’s lips close around the cigarette, probably staining it with the deep shade of purple from her lipstick. She looks back up quickly, but she can see that Agatha has a mischievous look in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She pulls something from her pocket. A lighter with the famous Saturn design from Vivianne Westwood with its silver chain slightly tangling around her fingers as she presses it down lighting the fire close to her cigarette. She takes a slow drag, blowing away the smoke through the small window near the back of the room. It's ridiculous how entranced Rio is by the whole scene, but Agatha seems to thrive in her gaze. Agatha's eyes never leave hers and Rio understands that this is a silent battle she does not want to lose.</p><p> </p><p>The door opens then, breaking their silent conversation and moving their attention to the new person there.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, sorry I got a little lost back there,” Jessica explains a little out of breath.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, I was just taking a break,” Agatha says, tone a bit warmer now.</p><p> </p><p>She puts off her cigarette and moves back to the couch where she was taking the interviews previously. Agatha takes lipstick from her pocket and reapplies it blindly, looking directly at Rio instead. When she shoves the lipstick back into her pants’ pocket Rio tries hard not to stare at the impossibly tight leather pants that are slightly open in both legs but tied by laces that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes travel back to Agatha’s face, quickly diverting from the fact that her nipples are visible through her large white t-shirt. <em> Holy fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Shall we begin?” Agatha says with a teasing tone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks away, picking the small notebook from her bag and adjusting her vest before sitting down beside Agatha. Jessica gives her a knowing look, making Rio look down at her notes embarrassedly.</p><p> </p><p>“I will just adjust the camera to make sure I get the best shot,” Jessica tells them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up again, picking up her signature purple guitar and sitting back looking directly at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“This is my best side,” she teases gesturing to the side of her face that is now turned to the camera.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I think we are all set, you can start whenever you want” Jessica announces.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a deep breath and looks directly at the camera now.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi everyone, I'm Rio Vidal and I have the pleasure to announce that the incredible Agatha Harkness is here with me for a little talk about her most anticipated comeback,” Rio starts before looking back at Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is softly playing with her guitar, giving Rio a disarming smile. </p><p> </p><p>“The pleasure is all mine,” she repeats what she had said before, but with a more flirty undertone that Rio tries to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, what a nice surprise it was for you to drop an unannounced album after being on hiatus for ten years and just when you were about to have your 30th debut anniversary,” Rio introduces, carefully watching Agatha's expression. “Mother, Maiden, Crone has a unique sonority to it that differs completely from your last album and you were also credited as the producer for the whole album, could you tell us a little bit more about it?”</p><p> </p><p>It was a predictable question, one that Agatha had probably answered two times before today, but it was essential to begin a more profound dive into it and Rio had to do it. She is happy to see that Agatha didn't seem bored by it as she was with the last guy. She pondered for a little bit, playing her guitar, but her eyes never left Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Most of my life, I had always been the person who wrote the lyrics and worked around it, but after so long I felt like music was coming back to me through these dissonant sounds that were kinda like a puzzle that needed to be put together and that's was when I started to play around with the beats until it became a story I wanted to tell, you know?” Rio nods, entranced by her answer. “You know that feeling when you’re in the room alone, you’re trying to make sure that you get to the guttural essence of something that only you know? That's how I felt while putting this album together”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is a little taken aback by Agatha's response. Somehow what she said made complete sense, but at the same time felt almost like Agatha was telling her a secret about a spell Rio couldn't quite get.</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds like a lot, were these sounds something that followed you through these ten years and you finally got it out, or was it more like a recent spur-of-the-moment thing?” Rio couldn't help but ask, forgetting for a moment about the questions she had already prepared.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her a playful smile, never breaking eye contact with Rio, which she was trying hard to not let distract her.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess when I decided to go on hiatus I wanted to distance myself from music as much as I could and that was probably why I only started to pay attention to it again a couple of years ago,” she replies and Rio nods at her understandably.</p><p> </p><p>“I have to say, you are a jack of all trades when it comes to music, during your career we saw you dive into a wide variety of genres, but still, this album seems to bring both a nostalgic feeling from your previous work and a completely experimental vibe as you played around with the different instruments and the tempo of the tracks creating an experience that leaves us hooked from start to finish,” Rio introduces and Agatha arches her eyebrow in an approving look. “I would love for you to tell us more about the instruments that you used and if you worked it out with your band in the studio or were just messing around with the beats and samples”</p><p> </p><p>“As you said, I think my repertoire had made it easy for me to play with the genres that I was already used to, but as I said before, I kept thinking about all these other sounds around me that could be incorporated into my songs, I also delved in sounds that came from unconventional instruments from other parts of the world like the Korean janggu that I messed around to give that deep unwavering motion you can hear following all the course of the last track,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nods along, mesmerized by the way Agatha talks about her music. As the conversation flowed, they seemed to have a good connection going, although Agatha seemed pleased to keep distracting Rio with the way she was looking and the slightly flirty remarks, Rio felt overall satisfied with the interview.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you so much for taking your time to talk to us, I can't wait to see you on stage in a few minutes,” Rio concludes. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank <em> you </em> for saving my day from all the other boring conversations I've had, hope you enjoy the show,” Agatha says and Rio is not proud to admit that she might have blushed a little bit when the woman winked at her.</p><p> </p><p>They wrap the conversation and Lilia, Agatha’s manager, comes to inform her that she has to go into soundcheck with the rest of the band.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you again for the interview,” Rio says now off camera.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, I should be the one thanking you, those guys before you bore me to death, at least you did your homework,” she teased. “And it helped that you were a nice sight too”</p><p> </p><p>With that she leaves, giving them one last wave with her hand before closing the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Ok, what the fuck just happened?” Jessica asks.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had no idea how to answer that because she was just as shocked. She only hoped that nobody realized how completely mesmerized she felt when they put out the video.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p align="center">

Agatha had missed music, but she will never get used to the fact that to be able to successfully do what she likes, she has to go through all these other annoying things that usually leave her wanting to punch someone.</p><p> </p><p>“That's all we have for today, you have an hour, but the driver will come pick you up for the photoshoot so for the love of god be ready by then,” Lilia says, agatha just rolls her eyes at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Before you go, I have a favor to ask,” Agatha tries to give her an innocent look.</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely not,” </p><p> </p><p>“I didn't even ask, how are you already saying no?” she asks with a teasing smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please, I know you well enough to know exactly what you want,” Lilia impatiently says.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, I promise I just want to thank her for the interview,” Agatha pleads.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you forget that you were tweeting about wanting to fuck her just 30 minutes ago?” Lilia points out.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you have a point there, <em> but </em> that was just me messing with my fans, I swear it's nothing like that,”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks at her suspiciously but sighs in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, but please don't fuck this up, the girl is brilliant and she was the first person to do her job with you. I would love it if we could still count on her in the future,” Lilia emphasizes. </p><p> </p><p>“I will try my best,” Agatha says and her manager just rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia fumbles with her phone for a bit and soon Agatha's own phone buzzes on the table.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>Lilia has sent you Rio Vidal contact</b>
</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha practically yells before kissing Lilia on her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't fuck this up, Agatha” she warns one last time before leaving Agatha's apartment.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

Rio supposes she must be coming from an external job. She lifts her head, realizing she now probably has key marks all over her face, and looks at her computer screen. When she sees the fucking letter mockingly stamped there, reminding her about the mess she just got herself into, she lets out a heavy sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, what the fuck is going on with you?” Natasha asks, closing her computer to fully look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Jessica pulls the chair next to Rio to get the scoop too.</p><p> </p><p>“So, you know how I interviewed Agatha last week?” she starts and both of her friends look at her like she's going crazy.</p><p> </p><p>“I was literally there, what is the point here?” Jessica pushes.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought that would be the last time I talked to her in my life, but she just texted me,” Rio confesses.</p><p> </p><p>Her friends gasp in unison.</p><p> </p><p>“What did she say?” Natasha is the first to ask.</p><p> </p><p>“She wanted me to go grab drinks with her tonight,”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jessica says.</p><p> </p><p>And at the same time, Natasha asks “Where are you guys going?”</p><p> </p><p>“We are not going anywhere because I said no,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean you said no? The woman was practically devouring you last week, I thought she was going to fuck you right there, in front of me <em> and </em> the camera,”</p><p> </p><p>“I think she is probably into that,” Natasha points out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans again.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't want to go out with her,” Rio simply says.</p><p> </p><p>“You're joking, right? I saw you wax poetry about the way she holds her mic,” Natasha says.</p><p> </p><p>“You told me you thought you would let her fuck you in a dirty bar bathroom,” Jessica adds.</p><p> </p><p>“That's enough, I know what I said, but you guys are missing the point here,”</p><p> </p><p>“Which is…?” Jessica asks.</p><p> </p><p>“First, she made me look like a joke in that interview and second, I joked around, but I don't want to be another name on her endless list,” Rio explains.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, everyone knows that's just how Agatha is, you did an amazing job in that interview and I'm sure not only her fans, but everyone who had seen it could see how much you care about music,” Natasha starts. “Usually I find your music geekiness annoying, but I know deep down that you love this and anyone who read anything from you before knows this too, not even Agatha could destroy that,”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm with Nat on this one, you were incredibly professional considering your gay awakening was eye-fucking you,” Jessica says making them all laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“But still, I don't know if I want to go through this, I know I'm not the one to shy away from casual hookups, but right now I don't want to get myself into that mess, can you believe how fucked up it would be if people saw me going out with her?”</p><p> </p><p>Jessica and Natasha exchange a look before looking back at her again.</p><p> </p><p>“We get where you're coming from, Agatha's life is as chaotic as she makes it be, but are you sure you want to let the opportunity pass because of that?” Jessica asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Who knows, maybe you would be the person to finally make her settle down” Natasha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah right,” Rio says, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>They talk a bit more, but eventually, Hela glares at them from her office so they go back to work. Rio feels a little conflicted about the whole Agatha thing, but at the end of her shift, she just goes back home.</p><p> </p><p>She tries hard not to think about Agatha, but after 2 glasses of wine Rio pathetically looks from her phone to Hades’ aquarium before asking “What do you think, buddy? Should I text her?”</p><p> </p><p>The axolotl just looks at her with an unimpressed expression.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you're right, that's a bad idea,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>And that's the last thing she remembers before accidentally falling asleep on her couch. Again.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha completely ignores Yelena, Birdie’s assistant, before barging into her office. Her friend is on the phone when she gets there. She gives Agatha a pointed look, before going back to paying attention to her call. </p><p> </p><p>She sits comfortably in the chair in front of her friend’s desk, spreading her legs wide. She scrolls through social media completely ignoring Birdie's voice.</p><p> </p><p>“So you've decided to finally pay me a visit?” Birdie says after a while, bringing Agatha back to reality.</p><p> </p><p>“You saw me three weeks ago,”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you're right, I remember that meeting,” she starts and Agatha already knows where this is going. “I don't know if <em> you </em> remember it though because I thought we had everything planned for your album release that was supposed to be next week on your 30th anniversary,”</p><p> </p><p>“Ops?” Agatha says, causing her friend to heave a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you even hire me in the first place if you were not going to do what I said?”</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Birdie, we did all your schedule, I trusted you to create the visuals behind the album, I just couldn't do the whole marketing thing,” Agatha explains. “Besides, everything worked out perfectly, everyone was surprised which brought even more attention to it”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can see her friend's mind going through all stages of grief before just giving up and shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>“You are a lost cause,” she finally says.</p><p> </p><p>“Your lost case,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Please never say that again, that ship has sailed years ago, I do <em> not </em> want to be associated with you like that,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles already used to pushing Birdie’s buttons.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, but seriously, I came because I think we should stick with the anniversary party, but instead of the release we could just open for a press conference,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>“For a second there I almost believed you were worried about work,” Birdie replies.</p><p> </p><p>“But I am,” Agatha innocently declares.</p><p> </p><p>Birdie snorts looking her directly in the eyes. “Agatha, please, you used to lie better than this. I know you just want an excuse to see your new victim again”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you got me there, but that is a good idea, at least I don't have to sit through endless hours of stupid journalists asking me the same rehearsed questions again and again”</p><p> </p><p>“You have a point there, but for the love of god, don't pull any stunts this time, I would love to keep up with the schedule now,” Birdie declares.</p><p> </p><p>“Cross my heart and hope to die,” Agatha promises, already getting up.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I hope you die too,” Brodie murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just laughs, sending her friend a flying kiss before getting out of her office.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the middle of writing an article when Hela called her into her office. That would usually piss her off, but honestly, she had been staring at the screen for the past 30 minutes trying to assess how to professionally say “This album is a piece of pretentious shit” without being fired or blacklisted. </p><p> </p><p>Her boss was frowning at her computer when she got there, but turned to her with a big smile and Rio immediately knew she would not like anything that was about to come out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey boss, you wanted to see me?” She greets.</p><p> </p><p>Hela looks around through her table until she finds a purple envelope and gives it to her. It's addressed to her in neat handwriting. Rio fights back the thoughts about how that deep shade of purple was associated with a specific person but is not surprised when she opens it and reads the invite.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p align="center">Dear Miss Rio Vidal,</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Coven Records is pleased to invite you to Agatha Harkness's 30th debut anniversary party. There will be a press conference before the official event, please make sure to prepare any questions you would like to address the artist beforehand.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Friday, January 10, 2024</p>
<p align="center">7PM</p>
<p align="center">[Address]</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">dress code: a cocktail party</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>“Can you send someone else?” is the first thing Rio asks when she finishes reading it.</p><p> </p><p>“Vidal, the invitation was addressed directly to you,” Hela points out. “Besides, who the fuck am I supposed to send instead of my highly acclaimed <em> music </em> columnist?”</p><p> </p><p>“You can always send Alice,” Rio suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, why haven't I thought about bringing Alice back from Korea, where she is currently on leave working on a book about her mother's heritage, just so she could go to Agatha's party instead of you,” Hela sarcastically states. “Listen, I know Agatha is a pain in the ass, but this is a big deal and you know it”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know,” she says in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>“We have to be there, I love you but if Agatha finally decides to speak about why she left the industry and we do not get the scoop because you were suffering from a stupid crush I will fire your ass right away” There is a playful tone on her voice, but Rio knows she is not kidding.</p><p> </p><p>“Got it,” Rio curtly says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hasn't heard anything from Agatha in days, so she convinces herself that maybe Agatha had just given up her stupid mission to get into Rio’s pants and this party is going to be just another job.</p><p> </p><p>She distracts herself with work the rest of the week, but when Friday finally comes Rio feels like she is about to throw up from anxiety. Hela feels sorry for her and sends her home early, but even there she can't relax.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha comes by her house later to help Rio pick up an outfit that would fit the dress code (and probably just to distract her from going completely insane).</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure this is a cocktail party”? Rio asks, looking at herself in the full-length mirror in her living room.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio is being completely honest, the outfit Natasha had picked was not far from what she would use normally. But somehow, she felt like a different person. Wide, tailored high-waisted trousers with a simple cropped shirt and an oversized blazer with the sleeves rolled. All black.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, I thought I was the fashion columnist here,” Natasha teases, making Rio roll her eyes. “Here, put this on”</p><p> </p><p>She hands Rio a chunky silver chain, Rio also puts on her rings and looks at herself in the mirror again.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop fretting, you look hot as fuck,” Natasha says, coming from behind her and softly slapping her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“I was not worried about that,” Rio whines. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you worried about then?” Natasha asks, genuinely confused.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't know, I feel like I'm walking into a trap,” she admits.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, come on, you're amazing, you will be great and I know Agatha will be happy to see you there,” </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, don't say that, I don't want to think about Agatha like that right now,” she complains.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, but seriously, relax, you've done this a million times. Think at this as just another work function when you least expect you will be heading back home,”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you're right. Besides, JJ will be there with me” Rio says, already looking for her bag.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I forgot you came home early, JJ is not coming with you, Coven sent an email to Hela saying that they will provide video and pictures from the conference, but the actual party has a no camera policy, not even phones allowed,” Natasha explains.</p><p> </p><p>“Awesome,” Rio grumbles.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha decides to hang out at Rio while she is at the party so that if something happens, she can come back to someone there. Rio will never admit it, but she was happy that her friend had stayed.</p><p> </p><p>When she arrived at the venue, it was packed with paparazzi outside and Rio was practically blinded by the flashes. She was more than grateful when someone from Coven came to lead her to the press conference room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio strategically picks a seat a little more at the back of the room. She makes small talk with some people she recognizes from other events like this, soon enough the door is closed and Lilia announces they will be starting in a few minutes.</p><p> </p><p>The room stills like everyone is holding their breaths and Rio tries to focus on Wanda and her team getting ready for the photos just to distract herself. When Agatha finally comes on stage, Rio is pretty sure her heart skips a beat and everything blurs around her because she can only look at Agatha walking to the center of the stage with an easygoing grace as she pulls her sleeveless long silver dress not to fall.</p><p> </p><p>“Good evening, losers,” she jokes and Rio can hear a groan coming from the backstage before the whole room erupts in laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be answering your questions now” she announces and Rio, just like everyone, holds up her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picks a few questions and Rio can see that she is trying hard not to roll her eyes at some of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scans the room until she meets Rio’s eyes. “You, go”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal from Underworld here, you worked with incredible producers by your side, but I would like to know a little more about the process of working hands-on on the album by yourself”</p><p> </p><p>This is something that Rio didn't have much time to delve into in their first interview and she was waiting for a moment to learn more about Agatha’s experience. Some of the people who worked with her had told her before how she tends to be a perfectionist and that she sometimes does a take over and over again until she is satisfied. Rio cannot imagine how that must have been when she was all by herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her a genuine smile before answering. “I guess there are some places you can only go alone and this time I felt like a big chunk of this album was just me finding myself again in this particular side of my life and the rest was basically just me finally having the time to play around with some jams that I collected along all these years and never got the chance to use. There is still so much that I had to leave it out,” </p><p> </p><p>“You can wrap that up in a deluxe version,” Rio said before even thinking, but Agatha just gave her a playful smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I can't wait to milk my fans with that one,” she teases. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sits back down, but she still sees Agatha wink at her before moving to the next question.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, will you tell us about the reason behind your hiatus?” one guy finally asks. The room is silent as everyone looks at the singer with expectant eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinches a little, but she recovers quickly putting on her impassive mask again.</p><p> </p><p>“It seems like things never change around here, huh? You whined for years, begging me to come back and now you can't stop asking about why I left, don't you think if that was something I wanted to talk about I wouldn't have said it already?”</p><p> </p><p>Before anyone could say anything, Agatha leaves the stage.</p><p> </p><p>“That's all for today, you're welcome to join us for the party now. The crew will be keeping your phones and other devices now,” Lilia announced and people started to move around.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sent a quick text to Natasha before dropping her phone back in her bag and walking inside the venue where she caught herself hoping she could see Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha downed the whole glass of her whiskey before the door opened behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” Agatha hears Wanda ask.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha corrected her expression before turning around to look at her friend.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I guess I'm already tired of these losers,” she tries to joke. But she knows her friend can see through her bullshit.</p><p> </p><p>“We can shut this thing off, you know, or send the press home,” she suggests.</p><p> </p><p>“No, that will only put more gasoline into the fire, fuck them I'm gonna get this party started,” she dismisses.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda knew there was nothing she could do, so she just let her friend walk past her to go back to the venue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha goes straight to the bar, purposely ignoring any member of the press who tried to approach her. The bartender was already pulling another glass of whiskey for her when Birdie appeared by her side.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Ags, sorry for being late,” she says, pulling her into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, Lilia told me you've been here the whole day getting everything ready,” Agatha smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but still, Wanda caught me up in what happened,” Birdie cautiously says.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course she did,” Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, it's not like I was not going to know, at least you made yourself clear,” Birdie teases, and Agatha can't help but laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does what she does best, she drinks too much and flirts with every woman in sight. She knew this was never about her anniversary and those vultures just wanted to see this. In the midst of it all, Agatha completely forgets about Rio, until she sees herself once again by the bar.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn't peg you for a drink kind of girl,” Agatha whispers in her ear, almost causing her to spill her drink.</p><p> </p><p>She turns to Agatha then, glaring at her, which Agatha ignores and gives her best smile.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm not usually, but I don't like to get drunk on the clock,” she replies with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>“And a Manhattan was your poison of choice? Agatha arches her eyebrow. “Good to know you have a high tolerance for alcohol,”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I have been nursing this one for a while now, you never know” she taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“I highly doubt that I have a feeling that you would be long gone if you weren't at least a little bit drunk,” Agatha concludes.</p><p> </p><p>“Or I could have been waiting to talk to you,” she says with a playful tone.</p><p> </p><p>“Were you?” Agatha asks and Rio just looks at her with those incredibly beautiful brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess you will never know,” she gives Agatha a cheek grin.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Agatha says, pulling her closer by the waist so she could whisper into her ear. “That offer is still on the table,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes herself away from Agatha with a glare. “You can go back to your groupies, Agatha, I'm not interested,”</p><p> </p><p>And with that she goes away without looking back, leaving behind a very confused Agatha.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p><br/>

Usually, she does not like to attend these types of parties because it usually means she has to work late to finish everything so it's ready to post the next day, but she was happy with the final result of this one.</p><p> </p><p>She locks her phone and goes by her day, feeding Hades, watering her plants, and cleaning her apartment. It's only when she finally sits down to eat some lunch that she is surprised by the buzz of her doorbell.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is it?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Delivery for Miss Rio Vidal,” the guy says and Rio opens the door confused, not knowing what it could be.</p><p> </p><p>The guy hands her a fancy bouquet and asks her to sign the delivery slip before leaving.

<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>yeah pretty much </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles imagining Agatha like a weirdo lying down on her bathtub with her clothes on. What a loser.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>hey, do you wanna grab some coffee?</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">Agatha…</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p align="right">fine</p><p align="right">but if you pull anything I'm out</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>promise 🤞🏻</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes but gets up after Agatha sends her the address saying she will be there in an hour. She hopes she doesn't regret this.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>The coffee shop Agatha had chosen was a quaint place downtown where she could hide in plain sight and both be bothered by paparazzi. She ordered herself an iced coffee and sat on a table near the back, but that still got some sunlight.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't realize Rio arrived until she gets startled by a motorcycle helmet being dumped on the table. She looks up and sees Rio trying to hold her cup of coffee without spilling it. She looks comfortable wearing jeans and a band t-shirt that Agatha couldn't quite recognize. Her long hair was tied in a messy bun. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was not proud to admit that she was already thinking about things that Rio would definitely consider “funny business”.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't know you had a motorcycle,” is the safest thing she could think to say.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down, taking a sip from her cup, hiding a smile. “There are a lot of things you don't know about me,”</p><p> </p><p>“I would love to change that though,” Agatha sincerely says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio seems to ponder what she has just said, but eventually, she says. “So you want to play 20 questions or something?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts in disbelief. But the look Rio was giving her was clearly a challenge and Agatha would never shy away from one.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, I start,” she says and Rio just nods for her to continue. “how many tattoos do you have?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realizes at that moment that unfortunately her brain is still too fucking horny for the woman in front of her. Rio laughs, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>“You're unbelievable,” she teases. “but to answer your question, I don't know, I've lost count after 50”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heaves a sigh, forcing her brain not to imagine the ink covering her body in places that Agatha couldn't see.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have any?” Rio asks and Agatha is forced to come back to reality.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>“Really? I was sure you of all people would have a tramp stamp,” she teases, making Agatha snort.</p><p> </p><p>“So you've been thinking about me on all fours?” Agatha taunts and Rio almost chokes on her coffee.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help the satisfied smile on her face as she sees Rio trying to regain her composure.</p><p> </p><p>“But why have you never done it?” Rio finally asks.</p><p> </p><p>“You haven't answered my question,” Agatha teases and Rio rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You're a menace,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>“So I've been told, several times actually,”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, you were my gay awakening and I am not proud to admit that I might have had a thought or two about it,” Rio states matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was not expecting any of that so she could not hide her surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't flatter yourself,” Rio grumbles looking away.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, how am I not supposed to do that after what you have just told me?” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs in defeat. “Whatever, tell me about the tattoo thing,”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha realizes that she has fucked it up. Rio looks at her expectantly. </p><p> </p><p>“I'm afraid of needles,” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you say?” Rio genuinely asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I said I never did it because I'm afraid of needles,” Agatha explains again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites her lip to suppress a smile. “So the badass Agatha Harkness is afraid of needles? That's not very punk rock of you,”</p><p> </p><p>“Really funny,” </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, it is a bit funny,” Rio says, softly kicking Agatha's foot with hers. “If you ever want to get one, I know a tattoo artist that has such a light hand you will not even feel it”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just stares at her, not really sure what to say.</p><p> </p><p>“I can even go with you and hold your hand,” and somehow, Agatha feels like she is just slightly teasing her.</p><p> </p><p>“I will think about it,” she says, earning a disarmingly cute smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Who's turn is it now?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, but they keep the stupid game going for another hour until she has to go back home for a meeting with Lilia.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you drive here?” Rio asks and Agatha shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio points at her bike, close to where they are. “Wanna a ride back?</p><p> </p><p>“There is literally no way I'm getting in that death trap,” Agatha vehemently says</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives her a sly smile. “Is this another one of your fears, miss punk rock queen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, I already called the car,” Agatha dismisses.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, this was nice, Agatha,” Rio admits.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice enough for you to see me again?” </p><p> </p><p>“I will think about it,” she says before going back to her motorcycle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees the way she sits on the bike, unties her hair, and tucks it over her shoulders, before putting on her helmet and finally turns it on. The engine makes a noise before she moves away shifting gears and fastly disappearing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never more turned on in her whole life.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the middle of her editorial meeting when her phone buzzed on her lap. Hela and Natasha are discussing an article about a beauty product from a press release so Rio could use a distraction.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>can you tell how much I love my job?</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a snort which she quickly hides with a fake cough when everyone in the room looks at her confused. She waits for everyone to go back to the meeting to reply.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">what on earth are you doing today?</p><p> </p><p>Although they haven't managed to see each other again after that afternoon at the coffee shop, they have been texting back and forth for a few weeks now and Rio couldn't say she was not enjoying the way they've been sharing small things about their lives.</p><p> </p><p>

<br/>
</p><p>Rio doesn't get to reply because soon her attention is brought back to the meeting where Hela is discussing a music festival she is supposed to attend and after that, she gets caught up with work.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">bye Agatha</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>good night, ace</p><p> </p><p>Rio is already getting used to Agatha's antics, which she thinks is a long-running joke for Agatha, but she is committed to not letting that fool her. Yes, she would love to see Agatha again, but that's because she liked the way they talked when they got together the last time, not because Agatha wants to get in her pants. </p><p> </p><p>A couple of weeks after, Rio is yet again dragging herself to Hela’s office dreading what could her boss want with her now. She is already tired from spending her whole weekend covering the festival and she was hoping to get a slightly better week, but apparently, that's not going to happen.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey boss,” she says sitting in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, I'm gonna cut directly to the point here, Coven just informed me Agatha is going to her first big concert. They want someone to cover the behind-the-scenes preparations and the big day. It's exclusive, only Underworld will have access to it, we will have a pass to cover everything from backstage to studio arrangements,” Hela explains and Rio can feel her heart beating faster. “I know it's already a done deal, but there is no one I will trust more to do this job than you, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, but as Hela continues to explain how the job will work, her mind is going haywire with what this means. It's hard not to let herself feel like this is only happening because of Agatha. When Hela finally dismisses her, Rio feels so sick she thinks she might throw up.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” Jessica asks and Rio can't force herself to answer, she just shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>She feels Jessica’s hand on her lower back as she walks Rio to the restroom and when the door closes, she realizes Natasha is there too. Her friend offers her a glass of water, which Rio is happy to drink in one go. She takes a deep breath and feels herself getting back to her senses.</p><p> </p><p>“What happened, babes?” Natasha softly asks,</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha is preparing a big comeback concert and Coven invited Underworld for an exclusive look at their production behind the scenes,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, that's so cool! I'm so happy for you!” Natasha says before seeing the look on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Why don't you seem thrilled about this?” Jessica carefully asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I know my work and I'm really happy for what I've built, but I can't help but think this has more to do with Agatha trying to fuck me and less about my competencies,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, come on, you know it's not like that, everyone knows you've been doing an amazing job, don't let your head think there's anything else besides that,” Natasha guarantees.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm with Nat here, if they asked for you it is because they know how good of a job you've been doing,” Jessica says, holding her shoulder and forcing Rio to look at her. “<em> But </em> if you're still not sure you can just ask Agatha yourself, you guys have been talking right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods. JJ is right, if this is actually just Agatha's stupid idea to get into her pants, she will probably tell Rio right away. When they get back to their table, she picks up her phone and decides to get this out of the way right away.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">hey</p><p align="right">can we meet tonight?</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had just finished a meeting with Lilia when she saw Rio’s message. Her brows furrowed as she looked at it. Not that she was not happy to meet her, but she thought it was weird coming all of a sudden.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">sorry I was in a meeting</p><p align="right">just saw your message</p><p align="right">is everything ok?</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Ace</b>
</p><p>yeah</p><p>I just need to talk to you about something.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">I have to go to the studio</p><p align="right">but you can meet me there if you want</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Ace</b>
</p><p>sure</p><p>send me the address pls</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sends Rio the address to her studio. She was already on her way there, but she asked her driver to make a quick detour to get some burgers, imagining that just like her, Rio might have not gotten the chance to eat dinner yet.</p><p> </p><p>She paces around, cleaning up her mess just to have something to do before she hears the knock on her studio door.</p><p> </p><p>When she opens the door, Rio is there with a little unsettling expression on her face. She looks like she just got off of work, with jeans, a white button-down, an oversized leather jacket, and her motorcycle helmet in hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey come on in,” Agatha says, moving a bit so she could enter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stays up, close to the door like she was afraid to actually touch anything there. “Sorry for the short notice”</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, you can sit, I got us some dinner,” Agatha points to the coffee table in front of a small couch where she left the food.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you didn't have to,” Rio bites her lip a little unsure.</p><p> </p><p>“Nonsense, I was gonna get something for me anyway, now come,” Agatha says as she drops on the couch and pets the air next to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitantly sits beside her, trying to put as much space as she could get on such a tiny couch. Agatha handed her one of the bags and was happy to see a little smile on her face when she saw the burger and fries.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want something to drink? I have some tea, beer, and water here, but there is also coffee outside if you want that,”</p><p> </p><p>“Water is fine,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha goes over to the mini fridge and gets them two bottles before sitting back beside Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what do I own to have the honor of your company today?” Agatha teases, but she sees Rio flinch a little. “Are you sure you're okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio heaves a sigh, before turning to look at Agatha. “Agatha, I need you to be serious with me here. Did you invite Underworld to cover your concert because you think that is going to make me go out with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her confused. She knows they wanted to do a little behind the scenes for this concert, but she wasn't sure about what was decided yet.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm gonna be honest with you here, this is the first time I've heard about this,” she says, but Rio still looks at her with uncertainty. “Lilia had told me about Birdie’s idea, but I was not up to what they had decided to do. I thought they were doing a short documentary or something like that, I was not aware it was going to be a piece for your magazine”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her for a second. She looks like she might have something to say, but instead, she just grabs her burger.</p><p> </p><p>“Just so you know, I joke around, but I would never do something like that. I genuinely like your work and the Coven team too, that’s probably why they chose you,” Agatha assures. “Besides, if you met Birdie and Lilia, you would know they would never let me pull shit like that,”</p><p> </p><p>That seems to be what finally gets Rio because she laughs and Agatha can finally let out a breath she didn't even realize she was holding.</p><p> </p><p>“So this is where the magic happens?” she says pointing at the mixing table.</p><p> </p><p>“Some of it, I also have an in-home studio that I work sometimes too,” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>They eat in silence for a while, Agatha is relieved to see Rio a little more like herself now. </p><p> </p><p>“Wanna hear what I'm working on right now?” Agatha asks when they finish their burgers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes widened. “Really?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it's not much yet, just felt a little inspired, but there is no guide yet, just some of the melody,” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>“I would love to hear that if you're sure about this,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up and sits by the mixing board. She pulls another chair so Rio can sit beside her and lends her a big headphone. When Rio puts it on, she clicks around her computer to find the demo and plays it for her.</p><p>Rio closes her eyes and Agatha can't look away. It's only a minute long, but it feels like an eternity before the track stops and she opens her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I listen to it again?” she asks softly and Agatha nods.</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes again, bopping her head to the sound of the beat until it's over. She pulls the headphones down to her neck and looks at Agatha for a few seconds.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I forget you're a music genius,” she simply says and Agatha snorts.</p><p> </p><p>“There is no way you got that from a 1-minute long demo without guide vocals,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I literally hate to admit this, because you're already too full of yourself, but that beat just changed something in me,” she admits.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, maybe I am more than just my looks then,” she taunts again, making Rio roll her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Never mind, I take it back,” she lightly pushes Agatha on the shoulder, but she's smiling too.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna hear the demo of love that never dies?” and Agatha can see her eyes widening.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you trying to seduce me with your music?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don't know, is it working?” She gives Rio a mischievous smile.</p><p> </p><p>“No comment,” she teases and that's good enough for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>That's how they spend the rest of the night, Agatha shows Rio some of her work, and Rio comments and gives her honest feedback. It's easy to talk to her about music because it's a language they are both fluent in, Agatha feels like it is the first time she is talking about this with someone who is not trying to impress her, but who is actually listening to what she has to say. And Rio does not shy away to cut Agatha on her bullshit.</p><p> </p><p>When she sees Rio’s eyes slightly closing from exhaustion, Agatha knows it's time for them to go.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey come on, I will give you a ride, I won't let you into that thing like this,” Agatha says pulling her up.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, I can drive,” Rio tries, but Agatha dismisses her.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't want you to get into an accident because you're too stubborn, come on, you can come pick up your bike tomorrow,” Agatha is so adamant that Rio just gives up and accepts her offer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha calls her driver and he picks them up in front of the building. Rio looks like she is about to crash, but she willingly goes into the car, resting her head on the black-tinted window. Agatha can't hide the small smile on her face when she sees that the woman has fallen asleep. She is not proud to say that she watched her the whole drive until they finally got to Rio’s place.</p><p> </p><p>She softly shakes Rio’s shoulder and bites her lip when she sees her confused expression. “Hey sleepyhead, we're here,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks around, realizing where she is. That seems to be what finally wakes her up because she sits up quickly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha, I'm so sorry,” but Agatha just smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, I'm glad I didn't let you come alone,” she says. “Now go get some proper sleep”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks again,” she hesitantly says. “you know, for everything”</p><p> </p><p>“It's alright, now go,” she says, playfully pushing her off.</p><p> </p><p>She gets out of the car and starts to walk to her building door, before turning around and stopping in front of Agatha’s window. Agatha lowers it giving her a confused look.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha” and she gives Agatha the most disarming smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Goodnight, Ace”</p><p> </p><p>She finally runs up the stairs and enters her building leaving a stunned Agatha behind.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>you wish</p><p>if you don't get here in 1 sec I'm leaving</p><p> </p><p>Rio runs towards Natasha’s stupidly red car, still fixing the buttons of her shirt. When she opens the door she is not surprised to see her picking up a bunch of boxes from some beauty brand that were on her passenger seat. Rio is already used to this, Natasha is always carrying around the shit they receive at the magazine for her to review, besides her usual mess of clothes and shoes she leaves scattered there.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, sorry for making you wait,” Rio says when she is finally allowed to get in and they start moving.</p><p> </p><p>“No problem, I just have a meeting with Wanda later and I have to finish a piece before that so I need to be in Underworld soon,” Natasha explains, ignoring Rio's knowing look.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda who? That's why you look extra hot today?” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm always extra hot, it's literally my job,” </p><p> </p><p>“I don't think that's on your contract,” Rio jokes, and she can feel her friend rolling her eyes even though she is looking at the road.</p><p> </p><p>“So are you gonna tell me why you left your bike at Agatha's studio?” She changes the subject.</p><p> </p><p>“No, let's go back to talking about your crush,” Rio complains.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't have a crush on Wanda Maximoff,” Natasha says matter-of-factly</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, tell me about Agatha, you were so upset yesterday, I was not expecting you to go to her lair so soon,” she says and Rio can't help but laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to talk to her, like you guys said, but she was going there so I met her there,” Rio explains.</p><p> </p><p>“How did the talk go? I'm assuming it went well since you don't look like someone kicked your dog anymore,”</p><p> </p><p>“It was okay. She actually didn't know about the article, she said the team was discussing it, but she was not aware of us being chosen to cover it,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>“And you believe her?” Natasha asks genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, she said that Coven actually likes my job and that she would never do something like that. She also said that Birdie and Lilia would never let her pull something like that,” Rio can't help but laugh at that.</p><p> </p><p>“See, you are the best for this job and that has nothing to do with Agatha wanting your body naked,” Natasha teases and Rio groans. “But that doesn't explain why you left your bike there,”</p><p> </p><p>“We ended up talking for the whole night, she showed me some of her demos and I didn't realize how late it was, she offered me a ride and that's all”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, are you telling me Agatha, your ultimate music crush, had shown you unreleased songs and you managed not to jump on her lap?” Natasha turns to face her in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“Eyes on the road, Romanoff, I don't want to die today!” </p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, I forgot you're saving yourself to die on Agatha's strap,” Natasha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, shut up!” Rio complains but her friends just keep laughing. “Nothing happened, okay? We just talked,”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I'm choosing to believe in you because I think if you actually fuck at some point you are going to spill the tea on me,” Natasha says, finally pulling to Underworld’s parking lot.</p><p> </p><p>“I think if that happens there will probably be an NDA involved,” Rio jokes.</p><p> </p><p>“As if Agatha likes to hide her conquest,” </p><p> </p><p>“no, I meant, I'm the one making her sign it so she doesn't go around telling anyone that,” </p><p> </p><p>“Good luck with that,” her friend teases.</p><p> </p><p>Hela was quick to get on their toes as soon as they got upstairs. Rio gets swamped with work, but she still teases Natasha when she sees Wanda entering the office.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Wanda, I just have to give this to Hela and we can talk,” Natasha says when she gets to their table.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay,” Wanda seems a little flustered and Rio can't believe these idiots.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, nice work at Agatha's party,” Rio compliments, making Wanda smile. “Do you want a coffee or something?”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm good, thanks,” she dismisses and Rio was about to go back to work when she heard Wanda say. “You're coming with us, right? Birdie told me Underworld is covering Agatha's concert”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Coven gave us an exclusive,” Rio tries to ignore the little anxious feeling still creeping on her.</p><p> </p><p>“That's amazing! I really like your writing and all those losers would never be able to pull this. Aggs deserves someone who gets her,” Wanda surprises Rio by saying this.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, seriously, I also think Agatha deserves to be portrayed as the amazing artist that she is,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda seems to have something else to say, but at that moment Natasha comes back and invites her over to their meeting room to discuss a photoshoot they will be working on together.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>hey </p><p>I'm at the studio</p><p>probably gonna be here until late</p><p>so you're free to come whenever to pick up your bike</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">okay</p><p align="right">see you later</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>see you, ace.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stops by the coffee shop near her office to get them some coffee before getting an Uber to Agatha's studio. She feels a strange sense of deja vu as she approaches the unsuspecting building from the night before. Just as Agatha had told her, the security team at the hall let her in and Rio took a deep breath before knocking at the door.</p><p> </p><p>She can't hear anything from inside because Agatha has the whole thing soundproofed, but soon enough the door opens and a disheveled Agatha appears in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, brought you some coffee,” Rio offers her one of the cups.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, thank you,” she exaggeratedly says, picking up the cup and letting out a moan after the first sip. “Fuck, I could kiss you for this”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, shaking her head as the woman in front of her dramatically sips her coffee.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm guessing you haven't taken a break ever since you got here, huh?” she says instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Not really, I had a meeting with Lilia sometime this morning, or maybe it was this after i never know the time when I'm here,” she explains. “I just got this idea stuck in my head and had to work on it”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you even eat something?” Rio looks at her with worried eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I ate a salad Lilia brought me earlier and some snacks I had here,” she confesses.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, that's it, up,” Rio says pulling her up from where she was sitting by the mixing table.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asks when she pushes Agatha in the direction of the door she has just come from.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm taking you out to get some dinner,” Rio explains, closing the door behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“If I knew it was this easy to get a date with you I would have done this earlier,” she teases and Rio elbows her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha just laughs, happily finishing her coffee as they walk back to the parking lot. She stops abruptly when she realizes what that means.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she says right away.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, I promise you will be fine, I know a place just a couple of blocks from here,” Rio says, passing Agatha a spare helmet from the back of her bike. “I will even let you hold my waist”</p><p> </p><p>She gives her a wink and maybe if Agatha was not completely out of herself after god knows how many hours of work she had pulled, Rio would have needed to insist more, but she just sighed, accepting the helmet.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don't kill me, I just started liking my music again,” Agatha dramatically says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, putting her helmet on and climbing on her motorcycle. “Promise you that murdering a rockstar is not on my bucket list, now come here,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels Agatha awkwardly climbing behind her and instantly holding onto her as she almost loses balance. She holds her hands then, pulling them tighter around her waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay there?” She asks. Agatha lets out an unconvincing grunt. “I will go slow, just hold on to me, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hears Agatha take a deep breath when she turns the engine on and she gives Agatha's hand a little squeeze before starting driving. She holds tighter to Rio, but just as she promised, Rio goes slow. Slower than she would usually drive, but she wanted Agatha to actually enjoy this. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't take them much time to get to the restaurant and Rio feels slightly sad to have to separate from Agatha's hold. She feels Agatha untangle from her and takes off her helmet, climbing out of the bike to help Agatha do the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Not so bad, huh?” She asks, smiling at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“I will not comment on that,” Agatha replies.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sees her comb through her already previously messed hair trying to untangle it, eventually giving up.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you loved holding me like that,” Rio teases, pushing a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breath hitches then and Rio realizes then that she got a little too close to Agatha doing that. She takes a step back but gives Agatha a big smile. “Come on, I'm starving,” </p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>“¡Ey, Rio! ¡Hace un montón que no te veía!” Agatha hears the guy greet Rio with a big smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes straight for a hug. “Perdona, manito, he estado trabajando un montón” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at them with curiosity. They seem to catch up until the guy guides them to a table in the back. The guy doesn't seem to recognize Agatha, which just makes the whole experience even better. </p><p> </p><p>Rio seems to finally remember she was there and quickly introduces them.</p><p>“Agatha, this is Emilio, Emilio this is Agatha” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“¿Al final trajiste a tu chica a presentarnos?” the guy says looking at Agatha she's not sure what he is asking, but Rio seemed a little flustered.</p><p> </p><p>“Solo es una amiga,” she quickly says but the guy doesn't seem to believe her. ¡Cállate y tráenos el especial de hoy, porfa!</p><p> </p><p>The guy shakes his head but goes to the back leaving a sincerely stunned Agatha and a slightly embarrassed Rio behind.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm assuming you don't speak Spanish,” Rio jokes.</p><p> </p><p>“Not really, but you clearly do, care to explain what just happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, we were just catching up, our parents used to be friends back in San Juan and when he moved here too, we reconnected,” She explains. “I haven't been here in a while so he was complaining about that”</p><p> </p><p>“Was that what made you flustered there?” Agatha asks with a mischievous grin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her as if pondering if she should tell Agatha the truth or not, but after heaving a sigh she says. “He was asking if you were my girlfriend”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? And what did you say?” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“The truth, that you are just my friend,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her a teasing smile. “So we are friends now?”</p><p> </p><p>“At this particular moment I'm regretting it, but I guess we are,” Rio says, but Agatha just laughs.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn't mind the other title too, you know?” Agatha taunts.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and tosses a balled paper napkin at her. “Shut up, Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>“So you're from Puerto Rico?” Agatha takes pity on her and changes the subject.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I lived there until I finished high school, but came here for college and ended up staying,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>“You still go back there a lot?” </p><p> </p><p>“I used to go all the time, but ever since my parents died i've only been there a couple of times,” </p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry,” Agatha says immediately, but Rio just shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, it's been a while now” she explains. “I think my mom would probably die of a heart attack if she saw how many tattoos I have now”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but laugh. “She was not a fan?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh god, no, she told me one time that my body was too precious for me to be messing it up like this” she says and Agatha winces.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I get that a little, my mom sucked, as you probably already know by my songs,” Agatha jokes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Evanora Harkness was enemy number one in my house,” Rio playfully says, making Agatha laugh again.</p><p> </p><p>“She still is in mine, sometimes I have these weird feeling that she is a ghost hovering by my side and judging everything I do,”</p><p> </p><p>“To be honest, by the way you used to talk about her I would not be surprised about that,”</p><p> </p><p>Emilio comes back then, carrying so many dishes that Agatha has to look at Rio with widened eyes, but she just smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“What it's all this?” Agatha asks when Emilio goes back to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio explains to Agatha what all of the dishes are, making sure to tell her all the tidbits about what they remind her of San Juan and Agatha is more than happy to hear her animatedly talk while she devours the amazing food in front of her. Silently thanking Rio for forcing her out of her studio to have a decent meal.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Wanda came by the office today,” she suddenly says.</p><p> </p><p>“She told me she had a meeting with Natasha,” Agatha can't help but smile remembering her best friend's freaking out about it. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you smiling about?” Rio asks suspiciously.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip to prevent another smile. “Nothing,”</p><p> </p><p>“You know something, don't you? If you tell me your intell I tell you mine,” she proposes and Agatha ponders. </p><p> </p><p>She knows it's probably obvious that Wanda has a crush and from what she had told Agatha about Natasha, it's reciprocal, but she is not sure, so she does not want to mess this up for her friends.  </p><p> </p><p>“What will you give me for this gossip, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“The guarantee that I will not tell anyone you're actually a loser,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>She snorts, shaking her head. It's refreshing being like this with Rio because Agatha knows she is not intentionally trying to impress her and she has no problem calling Agatha on her bullshit, which is more than 90% the women Agatha have been with.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, a lot of people would die to have a chance to have dinner with me,” she taunts and Rio just rolls her eyes at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Lot of people don't even know you, that's not the flex you think it is,” she bites back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quirks her eyebrow genuinely surprised. “So you know me now?” </p><p> </p><p>“No, but at least I pay attention to what you say when you don't have your head deep inside your ass,” Rio retorts, when Agatha doesn't say anything right away she adds. “You already know that i'm your fan, I just hope you also know that there is no hidden agenda here, I am honestly happy to get to know you beyond your annoying rock star persona”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn't know what to say to what Rio had just told her, so she just says. “Damn, you really want that gossip, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, but Agatha sees the smile she tries to hide behind her water glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, they are oblivious losers, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio perks up after she says that. “I knew it! I was not sure about Wanda, but I always thought there was something more than their professional relationship. Natasha tries to deny it, but she's been head over heels about Wanda since that time Underworld hired Wanda to cover Fashion Week with her,”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Wanda's crush is ridiculous, we went to Milan last year during Fashion Week and she made me go to all the places near the Quadrillatero della Moda just so she could casually bump into Natasha, I swear she acts like a high schooler with her first crush,” Agatha exposes her best friend.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio laughs, Agatha can't help the thought in her mind that tells her that Rio’s laugh is like a catchy beat, just like that steady thump of a drum Agatha is used too, but it makes her heart beat in an erratic tempo.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you were having a field day with all those women around you” Rio teases, breaking Agatha's trance.</p><p> </p><p>“Careful Ace, someone may think you are jealous,” Agatha bites back, making Rio scoff.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Agatha, that would have been cute if you haven't been following me around like a lost puppy for months now,” Rio mocked and if Agatha was not so turned on about her audacity, she might have fought back, but instead she just laughed.</p><p> </p><p>“You're unbelievable, you know?” </p><p> </p><p>“I heard that is part of my charm,”</p><p> </p><p>“I would rather not compromise myself commenting on that one,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio refused to let Agatha pay for their bill. When they leave, the night greets them with a warm humid gush and Agatha is more than welcome to pay for their ice cream in a parlor close to the restaurant.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to try mine?” Rio asks as they walk back to where they had parked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had chosen dark chocolate, but Rio was so happy they had Mango as one of their flavors that she couldn't help but be curious about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” she says, stopping beside her on the sidewalk.</p><p> </p><p>She was not expecting Rio to hold the cone in front of her, but Agatha was pleased to see the way her eyes followed Agatha's tongue, purposely licking it in a slow motion. When she pulls back, Rio is still looking at her lips.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally looks up at Agatha's eyes again, she can't help but tauntingly quirk her eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p>“You've got a little something there,” Rio points to what Agatha imagines is the side of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licks her lips, trying to get the smudge, but Rio shakes her head. Surprising Agatha, Rio touches the corner of her mouth with her thumb, they both look at the yellow drop there before Rio puts it on her mouth and licks it clean. </p><p> </p><p>Her brain short-circuits for a second there and she can only look at Rio with mouth agape. She gives Agatha a playful grin. “There, licked and clean”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, she goes back to her ice cream as if she hadn't just given Agatha a heart attack.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to take you back to the studio?” Rio asks as she casually leans on her bike, finishing her ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, I think I had enough of that for today, but thanks for this,” Agatha says, earning another one of those smiles she is starting to love a little bit too much.</p><p> </p><p>Rio waits until the car comes to pick Agatha up, giving her a warm hug goodbye before driving away. </p><p> </p><p>“Home, Miss Harkness?” Bucky asked her.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied, but she knew her mind was too full to sleep right now. “Actually, can you take me back to my studio?”</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she should just use that as inspiration. </p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p><br/>

</p><p align="right">omg</p><p align="right">bye</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so flustered?” Natasha asks.</p><p> </p><p>Jessica looks at her suspiciously before saying “Who were you talking to, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“No one, you two are too nosy, get back to work, losers,” she says opening her laptop and pretending to be focused on something on her screen but in reality she was just staring at her email home page trying to take the image that Agatha just gave her out of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>As they told Rio, Coven had started pre-production for AAA eight months ago, even before Agatha had dropped the album. Birdie had explained that although they were always going to do that first intimate concert, what Agatha really wanted was a big one where she could meet as many fans as she could. This was also how Rio found out the concert is actually the start of a tour Agatha is planning to go for a few months.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is well aware of the irony of her having to actually sign an NDA for Agatha, but Coven part of the exclusivity contract included them not writing about this, because the company wanted to announce it after the first concert. </p><p> </p><p>Since Agatha wanted to be involved in everything about the tour, Rio would need to follow her around as she looked through all the details for this, which was why she had to wake up at the crack of dawn on a Saturday so she could meet Agatha. That was also how Rio had accidentally forgotten her press badge.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe if Rio had had time to drink coffee, she would have texted Agatha, explained the situation, but her still sleepy hazed mind was here fighting a woman who supposedly is Agatha’s bodyguard. Which is ridiculous because after all these months, Rio had not seen her before. Weren't bodyguards supposed to follow people around all the time?</p><p> </p><p>“Ma’am, I already told you, you're not allowed to get inside without your supposedly lost credentials,” she curtly says and Rio wants to punch her in the face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had already tried to explain that she had already gone to the front gate security, that they knew she was coming and so did Agatha, but the woman was adamant about not letting her in. She was not even tall enough to be talking to Rio like that, her stupid brain supplied.</p><p> </p><p>She then tried to call Agatha, but her call went straight to voicemail. <em> Awesome </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen, can you just go get Agatha and let her clear this up? Or use that stupid thing in your ear to get the information from the other guards?” </p><p> </p><p>“You realize that would be really stupid of me to purposely put my client in danger just to prove your point, right?” the woman sarcastically asks.</p><p> </p><p>That moment Rio ponders how fucked up would it be to punch that smug smile out of her face. Rio could not see her eyes behind the black sunglasses, but she was pretty sure the woman was having too much fun with this.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck is going on here?” Rio heard a voice come from behind the woman and saw that Agatha had finally appeared.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked like she had just woken up. A black silk robe loosely tightened around her body and her long hair dropping by her shoulders in a messy way. Rio was not proud to say that she might have stared at the pale skin of her exposed sternum and stupidly low neckline for longer than she should have. When she looked up, Agatha’s dazzling blue eyes were already looking at hers.</p><p> </p><p>The woman put herself between Rio and Agatha in a protective way. Without taking her eyes off Rio, she said. “This woman says she is here to meet you for another appointment, but she refuses to show her credentials,”</p><p> </p><p>“As I said to you, <em> several times, </em> I did not refuse, I just forgot it at home,” Rio practically whines in frustration.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and shakes her head. “It’s okay, B, this is Rio Vidal, she will be accompanying us these next weeks for an article i’m doing for her magazine,”</p><p> </p><p>The woman looks at Rio from head to toe before sighing and finally moving away. Rio passes by her to enter Agatha’s house, but not before giving the bodyguard a glare.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mind Brunhilde, she is just feeling a little protective because Lilia had put her in charge of someone else after I told them I didn't want anyone following me around when I was not even working anymore, but I got mobbed by paps recently and Lilia brought her back”  Agatha explained already moving away, forcing Rio to walk faster to keep up with her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha guides Rio through her house until they are at the diner room, where Agatha sits by the head of the table and starts pouring some coffee for herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you going to be standing there staring or are you going to sit and have breakfast with me?” She teases and Rio once again blames everything that is happening to her this morning on her lack of caffeine.</p><p> </p><p>These are going to be long weeks.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</div><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts as she reads through her fans’ tweets.</p><p> </p><p>“You're so evil, those poor things are going to freak out when they realize they only have two weeks to get the tickets for a concert next month,” Rio teases from where she is seated next to Agatha on one of Coven’s meeting room waiting for Birdie to go over the custom set decorations.</p><p> </p><p>“Says the person who just dropped an article saying their magazine knows nothing about this,” Agatha bites back. “and you know I wanted to give them more time, but we had to make sure everything was okay with the tour”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know it's not up to you, but at least you're adding more dates so a lot of people will be able to see you,” Rio gives her a genuine smile, she’s been going around with Agatha for a week now and she knows how much she's been stressing about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey loser, nice to see you on time for once,” Birdie says as a greeting, but Agatha just scoffs.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, my job is actually what puts food on your table so I thought I could give you the pleasure of my company today,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, as if Coven would be dumb enough to depend on you,” her friend bites back.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you forget that i'm also the owner of this company?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you have some shares, this is still Lilia's company and you are just her overgrown baby,”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, I can't leave you two alone for even 2 seconds,” Lilia says when she enters the room and sees Rio amusedly watching Agatha and Birdie bicker. “At least had the decency not to fight in front of the guest”</p><p> </p><p>“Don't mind me, i'm actually loving this,” Rio says with a playful tone.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you are,” Lilia says, looking between Agatha and her, before sitting beside Birdie.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia cut their bullshit by pulling them immediately to business. Birdie shows them what her team have been working on for the promotion, including the timeline for Underworld article to drop and Agatha could see Rio writing everything down. Agatha was actually fascinated by the way Rio was always handwriting everything even though she had her recorder on and complained about having to type everything up later.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hasn't done anything like this tour before, she wanted to go all out because although she hated most of the aspects of the business, being with her fans on stage was what kept her going for so long. She knows they've been waiting for a long time and she wanted to do everything she could to be with them.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, what about the new mixing? How is it going?” Lilia asked, bringing her attention back to the meeting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had decided to remix some of her old songs to give a special performance to her friends, but that means she had to work on it for hours to make it fit in a way that don't affect the live performance.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm still working on it, but it's getting there,” it's what she says to Lilia who just hums and moves on to the next topic, but Agatha can feel Rio’s eyes on her.</p><p> </p><p>The meeting takes almost 2 hours to go over every little detail they still need to go through until the concert next month and Agatha is already tired from working almost non-stop.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, do you want to go grab some lunch?” Rio asks when they are out of the door.</p><p> </p><p>“I still have to go over those mixes,” Agatha says with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“You need to take a break, if you don't want to go out, I can go and pick something for us,” she insists.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not your job to run out to get me lunch, Ace,” she jokes, but Rio only gives her a concerned look.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't care about it, i'm not doing this because it's ‘my job’, I'm asking because i'm your friend and i'm worried about you,” Agatha is a little taken aback at the way Rio said it.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, let's go, but i want that burger we got that other day,” </p><p> </p><p>“I swear to god, you're like a baby,” Rio says and Agatha can hear Brunhilde snorting behind them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had given up driving her motorcycle around and now she just rides with Agatha everywhere, which she usually complains about, but Agatha knows she is getting used to. Brunhilde moves in front of them to check the front door of the building before letting them enter the car and going to the front with Bucky.</p><p> </p><p>When she closes the door, Agatha sees Rio texting, probably updating Underworld about their day or gossiping with her friends. Agatha had learned that the girls from the magazine are Rio's best friends and somehow it makes Agatha feel a little proud that they seem to like her already. She hears Rio try to bite back a laugh and looks at her curiously.</p><p> </p><p>“What have Pain and Panic done now?” she asks and Rio laughs for real now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha will never get used to the way Rio’s laugh makes her heart swell.</p><p> </p><p>“They keep sending me your fans’ theory about the teaser,” she says, showing Agatha the tweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha puts her hand over Rio’s to hold the phone still as the car passes through a bumpy road and feels the other woman still. Agatha involuntarily traces her thumb over Rio’s smooth skin as she reads, causing a shiver to run down her body, but she doesn't say anything, she doesn't move either, she just stays still there for a couple of minutes as Agatha reads through the tweets.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, at least one of them was right about the link dropping on the 13th, although it has nothing to do with the fact that it is my favorite number,” Agatha jokes, finally letting go of Rio's hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you blame them for going crazy? You've been more chaotic than normal with this album,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“That's why Birdie hates me right now, I fucked up her whole schedule,” Agatha jokingly says, but it's partially true.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries not to let her anxiety show, but she can’t help but fidget with the thread of her jeans.</p><p> </p><p> “She doesn't hate you, just your impulsivity,” Rio jokes, casually putting her hand over Agatha’s on her lap.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha looks over to where she is seated, she has her eyes on her phone again. There is a tap in the car's partition, bringing Agatha’s attention to the front of the car. Without caring about Rio's hand, still on her other hand on her thigh, she clicks the button that opens it. </p><p> </p><p>“Boss, the place is too packed, it’s risky getting out without being mobed,” Brunhilde informs her.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha curses. But Rio squeezes her hand, somehow that is what calms her. “B, can you run there and get us all some food and we can head back to my house, I will work from there and you all can get the rest of the day off,”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure boss,” Brunhilde agrees, taking their orders runing to the burger joint they had chosen.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha,” Rio says, once again giving her hand a little squeeze.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, I guess these years of at least a bit of peace had made me forget how much this sucks,” she admits, absentmindedly tracing Rio’s tattoos.</p><p> </p><p>They stay like that for a while before Brunhilde gets back with burgers to all four of them and Bucky starts driving again.</p><p> </p><p>“I can go back to Underworld if you want, give you some time for yourself, I bet you're tired of me already,” Rio teases, but Agatha realizes that is far from the truth. She has been getting a little too used with Rio's constant presence this past week.</p><p> </p><p>“Or maybe this is just <em> your </em> plan to get away from spending time with <em> me,” </em>Rio scoffs at her, pinching her thigh and causing Agatha to let out a surprised yelp.</p><p> </p><p>“You just want me to say I like spending time with you, huh?” she taunts, but there is a playful smile on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn't be opposed to that,” Agatha says, earning another pinch.</p><p> </p><p>She picks Rio’s hand then, pulling it away from her thigh. Rio’s eyes widened, as if she was surprised that their hands had been connected this whole time. Agatha brings it closer to her face, admiring the intrinsic ink there before pulling it even closer, she hears Rio’s breath hitch as Agatha puts her mouth to it, but instead of kissing she gives it a tiny bite, reveling in the way Rio barks back a laugh and tries to pull out of Agatha hold. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her again, softly dropping a kiss there, before bringing their hands back to her thigh with a wink. She may be imagining it, but she thinks there is a faint blush in Rio’s cheek when she looks away from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The car comes to a stop and Brunhilde announces from the otherside of the partition that they have arrived at Agatha’s. Rio finally pulls her hand back, busying herself with her bag as the bodyguard opens the door for them.</p><p> </p><p>“You guys are free to go, I will order an Uber for her later,” Agatha says, earning a knowing look from her bodyguard, that she hopes Rio hadn't seen.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, boss, see you tomorrow, text us if you need anything,” Bucky says from the car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needs some fresh air, so she walks to the big wooden table outside, Rio following close behind her. Agatha drops the greasy burger bags and soda cups on the table and sits. The other woman does the same, sitting in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“This is nice,” she says looking around.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I wanted a place where I could feel like I'm away from the chaos,” Agatha explained.</p><p> </p><p>As always, Rio was an amazing distraction, she asked Agatha about the project of the house and it was easy for Agatha to forget about work, just live in this little bubble where they are just friends talking about mundane things and not thinking about all the anxieties that came back with writing her music again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows she has work to do, it's still the middle of the day, but as Rio had said to her before, maybe she needs a break and that's probably why she sees herself saying. “Hey, do you want to watch a movie or something?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, cautiously examining Agatha's face for something else in those words. Agatha is not sure if she is more suspicious about her having second intentions or she caught on the way Agatha is deflecting, but her expression softens.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, why not?” she says, already getting up and picking up their trash.</p><p> </p><p>There is no professional explanation for this, Agatha knows the lines are getting blurred, but she leads Rio to the movie room anyway.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not play around with her movies. She had a real state-of-the-art entertainment center with an incredible sound system. The dark room had a big comfortable couch in the middle. Rio laid down in the middle of it while Agatha picked some candy from the snack bar she had there.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what do you want to watch?” Rio asked, ignoring the way Agatha had sat just beside her, even though there was a lot of free space on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“I know the perfect one for this actually,” Agatha says with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>She got up again, looking through some of her dvds before finding what she was looking for and playing it on. Rio couldn't help but laugh when she saw the initial menu on screen.</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Rio teases, picking a bag of sour candy from Agatha's lap and the other just shrugged pressing play.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you would like,” Agatha says and although it is a little dark, Rio can still see Agatha's playful smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head and turns her attention back to the screen where the black and white disclaimer of His Girl Friday appears, making her laugh thinking about how this movie was satirically portraying journalists back in the 40s. </p><p> </p><p>They actually have a lot of fun with the movie, bickering back and forth just like their counterparts on screen. Rio tries not to take it personally when Agatha compliments Hildy, ignoring the fact that she had associated the character with Rio this whole time.</p><p> </p><p>It's only when Rio looks back at Agatha trying to get more of the m&amp;ms she was holding that Rio realizes she fell asleep. There were only 10 minutes left in the movie, so she let it finish. When the credits roll, Rio picks the candy packets from Agatha's lap and covers her with the blanket she found there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes back to the living room where she had left her bag. She wanted to work for a bit while Agatha rested, but something inside her didn't want to leave Agatha alone in case she woke up and thought Rio had left.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits back on the couch and puts on her headphones to transcribe her recording. She loses track of time with the only light in the room being from the dvd menu on screen and Agatha's voice coming from her headphones. </p><p> </p><p>She feels Agatha stir next to her and when she looks her way, Agatha is slowly blinking trying to grasp her surroundings. Rio presses pause and takes off her headphones.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, sleepyhead,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, sorry for falling asleep on you,” Agatha sleepily says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tries not to think about how raw and breathy Agatha's voice sounded. </p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, you need to rest, was it a nice nap?” she asks, trying to control herself not to do anything stupid like playing with Agatha's messy hair falling over her face.</p><p> </p><p>“You're right, I haven't been sleeping properly and that nap definitely fixed something in me,” Agatha jokes, sitting up. “What time is it, Ace?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally checks up the time on her screen and flinches a little when she realizes it's a little past seven. </p><p> </p><p>“7:10,” She tells Agatha who seems to have the same reaction as hers when she realizes she's been out for at least 2 hours.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, you should have woken me up,” Agatha says, getting up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns one of the lights on, forcing them both to blink while they get used to the brightness.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought we have already established that you needed to rest,” Rio says then, saving the copy of the transcription she was working on. “I will be out of your hair now,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her like she is insane and Rio quirks her eyebrow back.</p><p> </p><p>“At least have some dinner, I'm not kicking you after you stayed working here while I slept,” Agatha says, helping her up.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you even know how to cook?” Rio teases but Agatha just rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Turns out Agatha technically could cook, but she had one of those personal chefs who came to her house and made her food when she needed or left food for her, so Rio just watched as she fixed them something from what the chef had left for her.</p><p> </p><p>“You know this doesn't count as cooking, right?” Rio taunts and Agatha just scoffs.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry for not making you a five course meal in the middle of my comeback, love, promise when we're dating I will treat you better,” Agatha jokes, but that makes Rio almost choke on the water she was drinking.</p><p> </p><p>“Who says we're going to date?” she asks when she finally recovers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, turning her attention back to the food. “I'm just manifesting it as the kids would say,”</p><p> </p><p>To that Rio can't help but laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“You're ridiculous, you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>“And yet, you're still a fan,” Agatha says, plating the food and bringing it back to the kitchen island in front of where Rio is sitting.</p><p> </p><p>They bicker and talk the whole dinner, but eventually Rio has to get back home. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, try to have some sleep tonight, okay?” Rio asks, making Agatha roll her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I will, but I think after the accidental nap I still have some hours of work in me before bed,” she says with a playful tone and Rio knows there's no arguing there.</p><p> </p><p>“See you tomorrow then,” Rio says, pulling her into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>“Text me when you get home, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moves on with her nightly routine as soon as she gets home and she almost forgets to text Agatha. She ponders for a bit considering the hour, but she knows Agatha is probably still awake.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p>Although she worked hard on the album and the concert. Agatha was not expecting it to be sold out in only 30 minutes after the sales opened. That might have been what pushed her into an even more anxious state the following weeks.</p><p> </p><p>She has a little bit more than a week until the concert, but somehow it seems like everything is wrong. Agatha can't help but second guess all the job they have done. They had finished all the scenery for the stage and she had shot some promotional videos and pictures. The stage is going to start getting built in a few days. There's nothing much left for her to do besides the last arrangements for the remixes and band practice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows that she has been more of a prick than normal and she has been trying not to lash her frustration out on the amazing team that has been working their asses off to get everything ready for her, but when she gets into a real fight with Birdie in one of their meetings, Lilia sends her out of the room like she is a kid being punished for misbehaving in class.</p><p> </p><p>She pushes around her bodyguard, walking back to her studio, but Agatha can hear footsteps behind her and she doesn't need to look back to know who it is. She gets inside and leaves the door open for Rio to get behind her. Agatha sits on the couch and closes her eyes, bracketing the light with her arm.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel Rio’s intense gaze on her. </p><p> </p><p>“If you want to say something, just say it already,” it sounded harsher than she intended, but she doesn't take it back either.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Rio spits, surprising Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up at her then, her expression looked neutral and if Agatha hadn't spent so much time with her this past month she would even said she looked calm, but the slight change in her breathing was a tell tale of how pissed Rio was.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, what did you just say?”</p><p> </p><p>“I said, what the fuck is your problem?” the way she enunciates every word in an angry manner makes Agatha shiver. “I know you're stressed but that does not give you the right to be an asshole, everyone is just trying to help you,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes and heaves a breath. “I know, okay? I don't want to be an asshole, it just-” but she can't find a way to finish the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio crouches in between Agatha spread legs so she can look her in the eyes. She holds Agatha's hand into hers and like she had done several times now, she softly traces circles on it.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, i'm sure Birdie will forgive you if you apologize, but you need to blow off some steam or you're going to explode,” </p><p> </p><p>“Are you actually offering me a quick fuck?” Agatha asks, quirking her eyebrow and earning a groan from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You're unbelievable, as if you're deserving sex right now,” she says, pinching Agatha's thigh. “but I do have the perfect thing for you though,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her suspiciously, but she just gets up again, pulling Agatha up with her. She follows Rio around until they are at the underground parking lot where Rio had apparently left her motorcycle. </p><p> </p><p>“I don't wanna go on that thing,” Agatha protests just to be a little shit.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't care, you're going to put this helmet on and sit your cute ass on this bike and i'm going to take you somewhere to get rid of this bitchy energy,” Rio commands and Agatha sees herself doing just as she was told.</p><p> </p><p>She is thankful for the helmet so they will not get recognized. The trip actually helps Agatha with some of the anxiety and she is almost sad when they stop in front of what looks like an abandoned warehouse.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said killing a rockstar was not on your bucket list,” Agatha was only half joking saying that.</p><p> </p><p>Rio did not care about it though, she secured their helmet on her bike and pulled Agatha inside, completely ignoring her remark.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha got inside, she could see the place had a big rink in the middle and some gym equipment all around. The place was not that big, but it seemed spacious and the fact that there was no one around besides them gave it a bit of an eerie vibe to it.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck is this place?” she asks following Rio to what seemed to be a locker room.</p><p> </p><p>“This is Elysium,” Rio says before tossing Agatha a t-shirt and a short. “It belongs to one of JJ friends, but we came here all the time to work out”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moves to the other side of the room, probably to give Agatha some privacy to change as she does the same. Agatha feels ridiculous, but she can't help the proud smirk on her face when she catches Rio looking at her bare legs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is not sure how she will be able to concentrate on anything other than Rio’s intricate tattoo designs covering basically all the visible skin she is showing with her own shorts and a muscle tee. But she blindly follows Rio to one of the punching bags.</p><p> </p><p>Rio picks one of her hands then, casually wrapping it in a black boxing wrap, Agatha looks attentively as she makes sure to cover Agatha's knuckles and hand. She repeats the process with the other hand until she is satisfied.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you move your hand?” She asks, opening and closing her hand to show Agatha what motion she was supposed to be able to do.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, i guess i can,” She confirms and Rio puts purple gloves on her then.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you ever done this before?” She asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Punched someone? Yeah, definitely,” Agatha replies, making her laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, the correct way, without risking fucking your hand,” Rio explains and Agatha shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, this is not like what you would do without the gloves on, but you should protect your thumb, so you don't risk breaking it with the impact,” She shows Agatha the correct way to keep her fingers and Agatha tries to emulate it inside the glove.</p><p> </p><p>“The next thing you need to know is how to keep your stance. You're left-handed, right?” she asks and Agatha nods. “So right hand and right foot front, but leave your body diagonally with the left part,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to follow her instructions, but she gets confused, so Rio does the stance in front of her so she could copy. She brings her hands up, in front of her face and Agatha does the same. Rio moves close to Agatha, pushing her shoulders down. “You will need to flex your knees a bit” </p><p> </p><p>When she deems Agatha's stance good, she starts to explain to Agatha how the footwork is supposed to go when she is doing the punches. Agatha almost trips on her foot three times before getting it right, but Rio is patient, she teaches Agatha the basic punching movements and demonstrates each one to her until she feels comfortable to reproduce them herself. </p><p> </p><p>They do this for a while until Rio asks, “Ready to try in the bag?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, i think i got it,” Agatha says, although she is not sure she is completely ready.</p><p> </p><p>Rio positions herself beside Agatha, keeping a safe distance as she yells the name of the movements she wants Agatha to do. Agatha messes up two full sequences before she finally gets the gist. it becomes easier for her to just get in the zone and just punch the heavy black bag in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>She has no idea how much time they spend like this, but she can feel the sweat dripping from her face and breath is coming a little ragged. She puts her two gloved hands around the bag, stilling it as she takes a deep breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Tired already, Harkness?” Rio taunts and when Agatha moves her face to look at her, there is a playful smirk on her face. “I can see now that you're all bark and no bite, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck you, you didn't even do anything, I'm the one doing all the work here,” she complains.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees the way Rio’s tongue moves in her mouth, pushing her cheek in a daunting smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“You really think you can take me, Agatha?” she asks calmly, but Agatha's whole body shivers.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I think I can,” she taunts and Rio gives her a humorless laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, let me at least teach you how to defend yourself so you don't get too humiliated after this,” and Agatha wanted to punch that stupid smile off of her face or kiss it. Agatha is not sure which one she wanted more. </p><p> </p><p>She indulges Rio though, paying close attention to her instructions. When she was finished, she got her own hands wrapped and put on green gloves before inviting Agatha to the rink.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, here's how we're gonna do this, i'm gonna tell you my movements and you're going to try to block me, if you manage that, we can do the real thing,” she explains and Agatha just nods.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha positions herself with the defense instance Rio had just taught her. Rio gives her a playful smile before positioning herself too. Just as she had said, she yells the movement before going forward on Agatha. It's slow at first, she is trying to go easy on Agatha, but Agatha is getting impatient so she goes faster, making Agatha work extra hard to keep up. </p><p> </p><p>“Let's go, Harkness, show me what you got,” she says, playfully jumping around in the rink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha goes forward trying to hit her with a jab that she quickly defends and counter attacks with a right. Agatha barely manages to defend before she is smirking at Agatha again. They go like this, a little dance where they try to predict each other's movements. Rio is clearly more experienced and Agatha can see she is holding back, but Agatha is too competitive to let go without a real fight, so she keeps pushing Rio up.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, Agatha had managed to dodge most of Rio’s attack and that was probably what got her too smug, so she slips on the basics and goes for an attack without protecting her face with her right hand and when Rio counter attacks she hits Agatha square on her temple, making her feet stagger. </p><p> </p><p>She was more surprised than hurt, but if Rio hadn't jumped to hold her by the waist she would have probably fell on her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, I'm so sorry,” she says pulling Agatha up and closely looking at her face in concern.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is a little out of it, but she can't stop looking at Rio’s face, too aware of how close they are. She sees Rio bite her lip as she inspects Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, you're bleeding,” she says stepping back and taking her arms off Agatha's waist in favor to take off her gloves.</p><p> </p><p>She takes Agatha's glove too, leaving both pairs on the rink as she helps Agatha out of the rink and into the locker room. Agatha just follows her, sitting put on the bench when Rio takes off her hand wraps and picks a towel from her locker. Agatha sees her damp it with water from one of the sinks and brings it back along with a little first aid bag.</p><p> </p><p>Rio softly cleans Agatha's face, examining closely a spot close to her eyebrow that feels a little sore. Agatha flinches a little when she puts some antiseptic on the cut, but Rio whispers a little sorry before finishing it with a colorful bandaid.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello kitty, really?” Agatha snorts when she looks at herself in the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, it's the only one we have here,” Rio says, biting her lip. “I'm really sorry, Agatha, I should have been more careful”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns around, leaning on the sink to look at her face.</p><p> </p><p>“It was not your fault, besides, I think Birdie will be happier tomorrow when she sees me coming to the meeting with a black eye,” Agatha teases and Rio can't help but laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, it's probably going to bruise, thank god you have already done the promotion shoot, Lilia would kill me if you haven't already,” Rio puts her hand on Agatha's face gently, turning it so she could examine it again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath hitches, it's impossible to ignore how much her touch affects Agatha. She wants to close the distance and kiss the worry away from her, but she closes her eyes instead. Taking a deep breath, she lets Rio caress her cheek, she feels her shift closer, and her warm breath ghosts Agatha's face, but her lips go up to her temple, softly kissing where the bruise was before pulling away.</p><p> </p><p>“There, now you're going to heal faster,” she jokes and when Agatha finally opens her eyes, Rio is looking at her with such devastating fondness that she has to close it again before she does something stupid.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>One day before the concert, Rio found herself once again working on Agatha's movie room couch as Agatha napped after an intense band practice followed by a soundcheck at the venue. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was supposed to go home and work on her article, but Agatha insisted she wanted Rio to look at the remixes one last time. In the end, Rio convinced Agatha to watch something before they get back to work, anticipating that would make her fall asleep and take a break.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked peaceful, softly breathing next to her, almost the opposite of how she was behaving the whole day, anxiously walking around, messing with her guitar and overthinking everything. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew this was important to Agatha, she had been following her around for more than a month now and she has hours upon hours of interviews, but still feels like there is something else Agatha is not telling her. Rio could not force her to talk about it, but she could at least make sure Agatha was not burning herself out.</p><p> </p><p>After all this time, she couldn't help but worry about Agatha. There was something about seeing the singer so vulnerable all this time that just made Rio want to protect her, even if it was from her own self.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stirs then and Rio can't help but stare as she slowly wakes up from her slumber. Her face is creased from the way it was pressed on the couch and she had a little pout. Rio looks away, fighting the stubborn thought that keeps coming to her mind who urges her to kiss that mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you been working this whole time?” Agatha's hoarse voice asks and Rio just nods, afraid of what might come out of her mouth at that moment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves, closing Rio’s laptop and pulling it away from Rio’s lap before pulling Rio up with her. “You need to take a break, come on”</p><p> </p><p>She takes them back to her studio, sitting by the mixing table as the door closes behind them. The soundproof walls turn off all the noise from the outside and leaving them with a comfortable silence.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said I needed a break,” she teases but Agatha just pulls her closer by the hand.</p><p> </p><p>“This is not work, I mean, at least not for a while, I wanted to show you this song I’ve been working on,” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>Rio does what she has been doing for a while now, she puts on the headphones and closes her eyes as Agatha plays the recording for her. Different from what Agatha usually shows her, this is not a distante beat or an isolated guide, it's almost like a full song. There is a raw emotion behind Agatha's voice as she sings about violent times and all the time she wasted chasing mortality. </p><p> </p><p>It's intense and it's so Agatha that Rio can't help but smile imagining her going over this alone in her studio, mixing the beat with the guide of her voice that she had clearly worked on to change the how it's delivered along the song. The track starts again, Agatha knows Rio likes to listen to it more than once before commenting, so Rio tries to get even more of a grasp of it before the track stops and she opens her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn, this is so fucking good, Agatha, I thought you were going to show me a demo, but this seems like it's done already,” she animatedly says as Agatha just looks at her with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“I really like that line about the lovers,” Rio adds and Agatha laughs.</p><p> </p><p>“I was reading about that the other day and thought it was romantic, you know, that after all these years, someone found the bodies of two lovers embracing in the ashes of Pompeii,” Agatha admits and Rio nods.</p><p> </p><p>They look at each other in silence for a moment, Agatha is sitting on her chair, legs wide open so Rio could fit between them. She is still holding Rio’s hand and she pulls her closer, causing Rio to lose her balance and stumble forward. One of her hands now supports herself on Agatha's chair bracketing Agatha's head and forcing her head to be leveled with hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sees Agatha smile, almost triumphantly, like this was her plan all along. Her free hand comes to hold Rio’s face, pulling her closer. And there was nothing Rio wanted more than to let go of her insecurities and just lean into the kiss, but she can't.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she says, holding her head back and Agatha opens her eyes, looking at her intently. She moves again, but Rio holds her back. “We can't, not like this,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets go of her, so Rio moves, sitting at the edge of the mixing table, making sure not to mess up the panel, but pulling Agatha’s chair towards her with her leg.</p><p> </p><p>“I know we've been working together for a while and we see each other all the time, but as I said in the beginning, I'm not a groupie, Agatha, I'm not doing this because I want to be one more name on your list. I admire your work,” she tries to explain. “Fuck, i admire you, the way you see music, the way you have this nonchalant energy but you are always taking care of everyone around you and you are such an observant person and I can't help but get sidetracked by this, but I don't think it's fair to either of us to mess this up like this”</p><p> </p><p>Her heart is pounding and she wants to take it back, she wants to climb on Agatha's lap and kiss her silly, but she can't.</p><p> </p><p>She sees Agatha close her eyes and take a deep breath. Rio is already imagining losing the whole month of interviews. But that is the least of her worries because she just doesn't know what she is going to do after this if she can't at least be friends with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“You know how I don't talk about why I left the industry?” Agatha finally says and Rio looks at her confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, you don't have to tell me, this is not why i'm here,” Rio tries to explain but agatha shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>“No, but it is. You have no idea how having you by my side had made me make peace with what had been eating me up for years,” she starts. “Back then I was exhausted, I thought I would never come back to this, because even after twenty years of giving all I had to my music, nobody saw me. I know i started my career relatively young, but I tried for years to show that my music mattered, that i was not someone else's successor or just a pretty face, I was giving everything i had thinking that somehow, someday, they would see me as a musician and not just a body,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heaves a breath and Rio can't help but squeeze her hand, silently saying that she is there.</p><p> </p><p>“I know this might sound stupid because you know I had fame back then, but that was never what I wanted. I wanted my music to change something, to mean something and I didn't want it to only be considered important if it was associated with a man. It didn't matter if I was putting out a full album and creating different things, because they would only ask me about a random producer that worked in like one of my songs, or even worse, they would ignored everything and just made it about my personal life as if I was just a court jester there to entertain”</p><p> </p><p>“I got sick of it, I couldn't make anything else without feeling sad and used, so I gave them what they wanted, I left my music behind and become the unhinged lesbian star who was always with someone else, always causing trouble, but even then, it was not enough, they asked when i was going to stop messing around and come back to work. So I gave up, I disappeared for a while, did some therapy and then, one day a couple of years ago, I started to listen to music again, paying attention to how it was playing around me in the smallest things in my life and that's how I fell back. I wanted to do this for myself, like i was reconnecting with an old friend, it was painful, but in the end it felt good”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her in shock, but Agatha just smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“When I made this album, I promised myself that I was not going to let anyone tell my story in any other way, that it wasn't the truth and that's how I met you. From the beginning, you were focused on talking about my work, you cared about my music, not in a fanatic way, but as someone who was genuinely there for what it represented,” Agatha explains and Rio is surprised by the way Agatha had perceived her, even though it was the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you are a fan and I love that about you because it's not like i'm this unattainable person, but because you're this music nerd who just loves to talk about the thing that makes you happy and Rio, I think this is what I like about you the most,” Rio's breath hitches, surprised by the sudden confession. “I'm not saying all this because i want to take you to my bed and fuck you senseless, although I would really love that”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs then, softly kicking Agatha's leg.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm saying all this because I love the way you see me and after all these years, I love to be seen by someone like you. It makes me want to get all stupid and write you the cheesiest of love songs,” and Rio doesn't wait for what Agatha has to say next. She jumps forward, crashing her lips into Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her closer, making her finally sit on her lap as she eagerly kisses Rio. It's almost violent at first, a bruising kiss that marks the end of months of tension, but at the same time is not enough. </p><p> </p><p>They kiss for what feels like hours, before coming for air with their breaths ragged.</p><p> </p><p>“I can't believe you just said all that just to kiss me, who would have thought the famous Agatha Harkness had a soft spot for a music nerd,” Rio teased and Agatha bit her lip hard.</p><p> </p><p>“You're saying that as if you hadn't admitted a few months ago I was your gay awakening and you had sex dreams about me,” Agatha spit back, making Rio groan and hide her face on Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p>“You will never let me live for that one, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>“No, you like to tease me too much for me not to use my own weapons,” she says, kissing Rio's jaw.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha bites Rio’s neck, just above her pulse point, Rio can't help the moan that leaves her mouth. She feels Agatha smile on her skin as she continues to give the sensitive spot bites and kisses.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her again, tongue exploring her mouth as she tries not to roll her hips against Agatha for more friction. Agatha scratches her blunt nails on Rio’s back under her shirt and Rio lets out a whimper, and Agatha draws it out with her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls back then, reveling in the way Agatha follows her trying to chase another kiss, but she stops her with her hands on her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Corazón, we need to stop,” she says. Agatha's eyes widen with the pet name and Rio can't help but drop a small peck on her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Please tell me why i can't fuck you right here on this table?” Agatha asks, hands caressing Rio's thigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you have a concert tomorrow and you are supposed to be resting,” Rio explains, making agatha groans.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck the concert,” she stubbornly says and Rio chuckles.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah right, as if you haven't been going crazy about it, but seriously, we have to be at the venue really early tomorrow and I particularly think this,” she points between them. “is something that we should do with time”</p><p> </p><p>“I hate when you're right,” Agatha complains and she even pouts at Rio, who kisses it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm always right, now help me up because i've been in this position for too long and my knees are killing me,” </p><p> </p><p>“Who is the old lady now, huh?” Agatha says, getting up from the chair and holding Rio by her thighs before putting her on her feet. “Can you at least stay the night? You can sleep here and go back to yours after the soundcheck tomorrow”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, but no funny business,” she says and Agatha squeezes her ass anyway, earning a playful slap from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay okay, I promise, but tomorrow you will be mine,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“If you manage to survive until after the concert I will even consider eating you out in your dressing room,” she was just joking, but she sees the way Agatha's eyes darken. “Nope, don't even go there, we have to eat and sleep now, come on,”</p><p> </p><p>In the end, they manage to fall asleep relatively early even though they spend hours making out before they are too tired to do anything else besides fall asleep in each other's arms.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wakes up with the bright lights coming from the big window. She is confused at first, not recognizing the room or the fancy deep purple comforter over her, the memory of the night before games back to her. The studio, the song, the talk and the kiss. Kisses. She smiles and looks around, hoping to find Agatha, but she can't find her anywhere. She still has her panties and one of Agatha's t-shirt over, so she pads around, following the sound of what she hopes is Agatha in the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>She was barely awake, that's probably why she didn't realize there was too much noise for it to be just Agatha making breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, dear, want some coffee?” Lilia casually says and Rio wants true ground to open and swallow her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns to her then, quickly taking off her robe and putting on her. Which didn't make the situation any better because she was only in her underwear under it. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, baby, I was going to bring you some coffee but Lilia got here and I got distracted,” she whispers, but Rio just hides her face on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio honey, it's okay, I've seen worse and honestly I thought it took you two long enough to get here,” Lilia says from somewhere behind them.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, for fuck sakes, shut up,” Agatha says making her laugh even more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her a cup of coffee and she goes back to her room to take a shower and get dressed. With Agatha's green light she goes over her wardrobe and picks an outfit that she's already planning to steal. When she gets back to the kitchen, she is surprised to see that Agatha is already ready, casually sitting on one of the kitchen stools discussing logistics with Lilia and Brunhilde. </p><p> </p><p>Rio ignores the bodyguard's playful look, sitting beside Agatha who passes her another cup of coffee and puts a hand on her thigh under the table. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha goes back to her room to pick her bag, Brunhilde leaves for the entrance and Rio is left alone with Lilia.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen, it's not what it looks like, we haven't done anything,” she tries to explain, but Lilia looks at her in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“Honey, I really don't care, I know you're not doing this for a scoop, otherwise it would have happened a lot earlier and Agatha is not kicking you out, so I know there must have something else going on,” Lilia says, leaving Rio speechless. “Just don't break her heart or I'll make sure you will not be able to write even restaurant menus”</p><p> </p><p>And with that she leaves. Agatha comes back at that moment though, dropping both of their bags on the table before pulling her into a hug and kissing her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm really sorry about this mess, I was not expecting them to be here so early,” she says, leaving a kiss on Rio’s forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess it could have been worse,” she tries and Agatha quirks her eyebrow. “I don't know, they could have gotten us having sex or something,”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, for that you had to let me have sex with you,” Agatha teases, kissing her again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was right, we didn't even had sex and it was already a mess,” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, it's definitely going to be a mess when I get my hands later,” Agatha whispers in her ear and Rio can feel her whole body shiver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls back then, taking a look at the clothes she had borrowed.</p><p> </p><p>“You look really hot wearing my clothes,” she says, pulling Rio for another kiss. Harder this time, but they get interrupted by a loud honking from the car outside. “Let's go, Ace”</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets busy with last-minute checkups, so she lets Rio go to the stage with JJ and Wanda to talk with the rest of the band. They have one hour for the soundcheck before everyone gets a break and they have to start getting ready for the concert.</p><p> </p><p>She is surprised to find Rio playing around with Gamora’s drums as the drummer and JJ cheer for her. Agatha had no idea Rio knew how to play the drums. Agatha pushes up her sunglasses to look at her properly. She doesn't seem to notice Agatha, too focused on playing one of Agatha's old songs. </p><p> </p><p>“Your new toy is good,” Peggy teases, making Melina snort from where she is tuning her bass.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't call her that,” Agatha warns and her keyboard player gives her a curious look.</p><p> </p><p>“Who would have thought that the woman that would actually manage to make you settle down would be a journalist,” Melina jokes, but Agatha just flips her off, refusing to look away from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>When the song is about to finish, Agatha approaches the back of the stage where Rio finally sees her and gives her a big smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn't know you knew how to play drums,” Agatha says and she just shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“She used to have a band back in college, she knows how to play a lot of instruments actually,” JJ butts in and Agatha sees the moment she realizes what she had done, because she ducks just in time to dodge the drum stick that came flying in her direction.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, sorry Gamora, I will get you a new one from backstage,” Rio says quickly getting off of the stool.</p><p> </p><p>“It's all good, I have a bunch around here,” the drummer says, pointing at the drum stick pile next to the drum set.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha offers Rio her water bottle when she joins her and she drinks most of it. Agatha wants to kiss her, but she knows better than to give all the staff that much gossip material. She puts her hand at the back of Rio’s neck and gives it a little squeeze before letting her go back to the side of the stage. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tosses her another bottle of water and Agatha leaves it by the foot of her microphone stand. She talks into her purple mic, testing if it was working and the reception back to her in-ear piece. The band plays around a little before starting to rehearse some of the songs they are going to play later that night.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha plays around the stage, getting her muscles going and checking how much she can move during the actual concert. She sends a flying kiss in the direction where Rio is standing with Wanda and JJ. Rio rolls her eyes at her, but Agatha can see that she is smiling.</p><p> </p><p>It's past noon when they finish the soundcheck. When Agatha gets backstage the Coven team had already gotten them an insane amount of food. She pulls Rio toward her, sitting next to each other in one of the couches as the rest of the girls fit around the room. </p><p> </p><p>“You looked really hot playing outside,” Agatha whispers in her ear, causing Rio to choke on her water and slap Agatha's thigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you two finally fucked?” Birdie yells when she gets inside the room where they are and Agatha thanks the heavens that it's band and Coven team only.</p><p> </p><p>“Birdie, I swear to god if you don't shut your mouth in the next 5 seconds I'm firing your ass,” Agatha warns, but her best friend just flips her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, are you two really together now?” Wanda asks from where she is sitting next to JJ on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, she does not want to DTR right now in front of her friends and bandmates. She also doesn't want to put Rio on the spot, so she just says. “None of your business”</p><p> </p><p>She can feel her best friends’ eyes on her, but Agatha just ignores them. Mentally thanking JJ for changing the subject. Rio gives her thigh a little squeeze before moving to get some food.</p><p> </p><p>They finish eating, everyone scattering around the room to rest. Agatha decides to go back to her private dressing room for a nap, but she pulls Rio with her, earning a few teasing comments from her friends. The door is barely closed behind them before Agatha is all over Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Now that she got the taste of what it is like to be with Rio, Agatha is having trouble thinking about anything else, which is good because otherwise she would probably be panicking about the concert right now. </p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't seem to be in a different shape than Agatha since she can hear the way the journalist practically whimpers when Agatha calmly teases her nipple over Agatha's white button down shirt she's wearing.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” it was supposed to be a warning, but her name leaves Rio’s mouth more like a moan as Agatha moves the leg that was between her thighs and applies more pressure.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure you want to wait until the concert?” Agatha teasingly whispers in her ear and she feels Rio’s breath hitches.</p><p> </p><p>Surprising Agatha, Rio easily manhandles her changing their position so Agatha's back is now on the door as she hungrily kisses Agatha. Her hand fists around Agatha's messy hair, pulling it hard and drinking Agatha's moans. But then, just as fast as it started, she takes a step back, a playful smile on her face as she admires what  Agatha assumes is the wrecked state she is.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try, cariño, but you need to rest and I need to go home to work before I have to come back,” she says, earning a groan.</p><p> </p><p>“Can't you work here?” Agatha asks, pulling her closer again.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I can't, you are too distracting and I have to make sure there's nothing much for me to fill in tomorrow so I can enjoy the day with you,” there is no arguing there, Agatha knows she's right, but she still pulls her into a kiss for a few more minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes Agatha around until she flops on the dressing room couch. She looks at Rio with what she thinks is her best pleading eyes, but she doesn't bulge. </p><p> </p><p>“Take a nap, Agatha, I will be back in a couple of hours,” Agatha can't say she is not enjoying being bossed around by Rio like this.</p><p> </p><p>When she gathers all her stuff, she comes back to where Agatha is scrolling through her phone and drops a soft peck on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I will come back soon, okay? try to get some sleep or at least distract yourself a little,” she says lightly scratching Agatha's scalp with her nails.</p><p> </p><p>“I know the perfect distraction, but you don't want to help me here,” Agatha teases and she pushes her shoulder lightly.</p><p> </p><p>“You're so annoying,” she says, but there is no bite to it. “I've got to go now, te veo,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her for one last kiss before letting her go. Figuring that there is no point to fight her tiredness, Agatha ends up falling asleep just a little bit after that.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Rio has to work really hard not to get distracted by the images of Agatha that keep popping in her mind. She tries not to think too much about it because the whole thing feels like a crazy dream from her teenage self.</p><p> </p><p>When she finishes her draft it is just about time to get back to the venue before it gets too chaotic — although Brunhilde had told them there were some fans camping out there for a few days. Rio thanks her past self for accepting Nat's help to get ready, because when the blonde gets to her apartment Rio was about to have a fashion crisis.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn, were you trying to murder your wardrobe or something?” she asks, looking around Rio's bed where probably all her clothes were scattered.</p><p> </p><p>“I have nothing to wear and I wanted to do something nice for Agatha,” she complains and Natasha quirks her eyebrow at her.</p><p> </p><p>She gets to work, looking around the clothes, but stops abruptly. “Wait a damn minute, did you two fuck?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, dropping face first over the clothes on her bed. “We haven't had sex yet” she mumbles from where her face is hiding.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, but you want to, huh?” Nat teases, slapping her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ends up telling her everything that happened the night before while Natasha looks around her clothes looking for the perfect “fuck me raw” outfit.</p><p> </p><p>“How the fuck am I supposed to wear underwear with this skirt?” she asks looking at the piece Nat had chosen for her that she didn't even remember getting.</p><p> </p><p>It was a long satin skirt that had a slit that went practically all the way to the waistband, but closed by a delicate string that went just a little bit over her thigh. Natasha paired it with an oversized t-shirt for the concert official merch and some chunky high heels boots that went almost all the way to her knees.</p><p> </p><p>“You don't, it's not like it's the first time you went commando,” Natasha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but I was not working,” Rio says, looking at herself in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>Beside the insane slit on her skirt, the outfit was okay. Casually sexy, but not too far from what she would normally wear and there was something pleasing about wearing Agatha's merch like this. Rio can't help but imagine how the singer will feel about seeing her like this and she has to fight herself not to get too into that image, because she is pretty sure Agatha will love to take her clothes off later.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tosses her hair into a bun, going for a casual look, like she hadn't spent the last two hours trying to find the best outfit to impress Agatha and they finally leave for the venue.</p><p> </p><p>When they arrive, Agatha and her band are busy with the rest of the media. Coven had invited some journalists to interview them before the concert. Rio had already gone through that during the week so they just joined JJ in the other room.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, are you trying to kill Agatha before the concert?” her friend jokes and although slightly embarrassed, Rio just rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda joins them a little bit after that, quickly orbiting around Natasha as they whisper to each other acting like there was no one else in the room.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope those two get together already, it is almost annoying to see them like this,” Rio comments and JJ gives her a knowing look.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“You realize you and Agatha have been doing that same dance for months now, right?” JJ teases.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't get a chance to reply because the room is filled with the band and some of the staff from Coven. She looks around to see if she can find Agatha, but she is nowhere to be found.</p><p> </p><p>“She's in her dressing room, but just a heads up, she is pissed as fuck,” Gamora says, grabbing a water bottle from the cooler next to where Rio was.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't know why we keep doing this, these vultures don't care about music, the just want to fuck with Agatha,” Melina complains, making Rio wince.</p><p> </p><p>She ponders if it's okay to go over there, until Lilia approaches her. “You can go, dear, I think she will appreciate your company right now, just make sure she comes here in 15 minutes because we need to finish hair and make up”</p><p> </p><p>Rio greets Brunhilde with a small smile when she gets to Agatha's dressing room door. She knocks on the door, but when Agatha doesn't reply she decides to just go in.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, I swear to god, I will be there in five minutes, just let me breathe,” Agatha complains from where she is slumped on the couch with her arm over her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth feels dry when she tries to swallow. Agatha is in what is clearly a 70s inspired look. Golden pants practically glued to her thighs and her blouse had an insane neckline leaving her chest practically bare. She didn't realize she was just staring like an idiot until Agatha moved her arm and looked directly at her. Her expression changed quickly from annoyed to smug.</p><p> </p><p>“See something you like, baby?” She teases and Rio is quick to recover, playfully scoffing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks her up and down, taking her outfit in and Rio fights back the urge to be embarrassed about it. She wanted Agatha to look at her just like that.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I should be the one saying that, no?” </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, come here,” Agatha says and Rio obliges.</p><p> </p><p>She stands in between Agatha's spread leg, lowering herself a bit to drop a kiss on her mouth as Agatha holds her waist pulling her close.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands roam down, groping Rio’s ass a bit harder than Rio was expecting her to and she can't help the small moan she lets out. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, you're not wearing anything under this, are you?” she asks and Rio slowly pulls the fabric of her black skirt up so she can sit on Agatha's legs, proving her point. “Are you trying to kill me, princess?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can say the same thing about you, how am I supposed to watch a full two hours concert when you're looking like this?” she practically whines when Agatha moves her hands slowly through her thighs under her skirt. Trailing kisses from her jaw to her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“You wouldn't have to wait if you had accepted my offer earlier,” Agatha teases, breath hot on her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's hips involuntarily buckles and that seems to spark something in Agatha, because she moves her hand up. Fingertip lightly trailing their way to Rio's core. She could feel how wet she was, but when Agatha’s fingers easily traced her folds Rio couldn't help but moan. She moves her hips trying to chase that friction but Agatha pulls her hand off her, making her whine.</p><p> </p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Agatha brings her fingers to her mouth, slowly licking it. She closes her lips around the two fingers, closing her eyes and moaning. “Fuck, you're delicious, baby,”</p><p> </p><p>Her hoarse voice brings shivers down Rio’s body and she bites back another moan. Rio was about to lose all her composure and let Agatha fuck her right there, when they hear a knock on the door, making her practically bolt from Agatha's lap.</p><p> </p><p>“They are waiting for you for hair and makeup, boss,” Brunhilde says from the other side of the door, clearly avoiding walking out on them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up, going to where Rio is standing trying to fix her clothes. She pulls Rio closer by her waist, hands on Rio’s ass as she kisses her. “We will definitely continue this later”</p><p> </p><p>“You bet we are,” Rio assures, biting her lip. “Now go, there's 70 thousand people out there waiting for you to show up,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her one last kiss before walking to the door with her. Brunhilde gives them a playful look that Rio ignores as she follows Agatha back to where the rest of the staff is.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn, if I knew it was this easy to get her to calm down I would have sent you there sooner,” Peggy teased.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you, Carter” Agatha cursed before sitting at the chair so the makeup artist could do her work.</p><p> </p><p>“Did she really managed to fuck you in 10 minutes?” Natasha whispers and Rio wants to punch her in the face.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don't talk about Agatha and fucking or I will explode,” she complains but natasha just snorts.</p><p> </p><p>Rio completely ignored the looks Agatha was giving her through the mirror. distracting herself by looking at what the purples were talking on social media. Lilia offers them some beers and Rio feels herself relax a little bit. When everyone is ready, the band and the staff get together for a crazy handshake, before the venue crew announces they are up in 5 minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone moves around, but Agatha stays behind, pulling Rio toward her. “Hey, aren't you going to give me a good luck kiss?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, but indulges giving her a quick peck trying not to mess up her purple lipstick. Agatha holds her face though deepening the kiss, before someone screams for her to get her ass on stage and she smiles leaving one last peck before running outside.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio meets with Wanda, Nat and JJ at the pit they all give her a suspicious look, but Melina starts the cords of her bass and is quickly joined by Peggy’s keyboard and Gamora drums. The crowd starts to scream, but when Agatha finally enters moving to the center of the stage with her guitar, Rio zones out everything else and it feels like it's just her and Agatha there.</p><p> </p><p>She had already seen Agatha on stage before, but it feels different now. Not only can Rio see the way she thrives on being with her fans, she also knows how much this means to Agatha. She was born for the stage, moving around dramatically and playfully interacting with her band members and the crowd. </p><p> </p><p>At some point she even messes around with them in the pit and Rio tries not to get embarrassed about it. The band takes a break, but Rio and the girls stay put watching the VCRs Agatha had filmed for this part. They laugh at the band’s antics on screen, commenting on Birdie’s job creating this.</p><p> </p><p>When the band gets back for the final part of the concert, Agatha gives Rio a little wink before singing “Love that never dies” and Rio tries to ignore the fact that Agatha seems to be singing directly at her. </p><p> </p><p>The rest of the concert is a blur, Agatha gets emotional when she is doing her ment at the end and that almost makes <em> Rio </em> cry, but she controls herself,  just cheering loudly with the rest of the crowd when Agatha thanks the band and her fans. The fireworks start to blow out, marking the actual ending of the show.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never been more proud in her life.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was ecstatic. This concert felt like she was back to her 20s playing in small clubs again. It felt like the crowd were giving her powers through their cheers and Agatha was vibrating with energy. That moment finally felt like she got her purple back and she could feel the power radiating from her skin.</p><p> </p><p>There were a lot of people backstage now, friends filling in and out, a champagne being popped somewhere, but Agatha could only think of Rio. She searched the room with her eyes, pausing when she finally saw the journalist there, a big toothy smile with that little gap between them that always made Agatha melt. Rio raised her champagne flute, a congratulatory gesture from across the room, but not enough for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Not caring about anyone else, Agatha moves towards her, surprising the other woman by a hug that lifts her feet from the ground. Rio yelps in surprise and Agatha takes that as an opportunity to hungrily kiss her. Rio smiles into the kiss when Agatha slows down and puts her back on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“Congratulations, my love,” she gently says, pecking Agatha's mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, for fucks sake, at least let us have a proper toast before you two go out to fuck each other like rabbits” Agatha hears Birdie complain from somewhere behind them and the rest of the gang laughs, but Agatha is more interested in the soft pink blush painting Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“One drink and we are out of here,” she whispers before pulling Rio by the hand to the center of the room where she gets her own flute.</p><p> </p><p>They toast, drink some champagne, but Agatha unfortunately gets sucked into talking with some people and it's only an hour later when they manage to get into Agatha’s car. She didn't even change from her concert’s outfit, too busy thinking about getting out of the venue with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” Agatha says, pulling Rio to her lap again. She goes pliant as Agatha kisses her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, Bucky and B are literally on the other side of the partition,” Rio tries to argue, but she bites her lip when Agatha squeezes her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“They won't hear us if you keep quiet, baby,” Agatha whispers in her ear, reveling in the way Rio’s body seems to react to her touch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves her hands under the silk fabric of the sinful skirt Rio was wearing. She knows Rio is just as gone as she is, but Agatha loves the anticipation, she thrives in the way Rio's sensible skin reacts to even the softest of touches. Agatha's hands go under her thighs, slightly lifting Rio up so she can push up the fabric and she can move more freely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio buckles her hip, straddling Agatha properly now that her skirt is not restricting her. She kisses Agatha hungrily and Agatha can see she is trying hard not to moan out loud, but that only makes her let out these sinful whimpers that go straight to Agatha's core.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha strongly holds her hip, forcing her to be still as her mouth leaves bruising kisses on Rio’s neck. She pushes Agatha's blouse, using the big neckline as an advantage for easy access Agatha's breasts. </p><p> </p><p>“You have no idea how much I wanted to do this the whole night” she says, caressing Agatha's breast.</p><p> </p><p>She pinches one of her tits and Agatha lets out an involuntary moan. </p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said we needed to be quiet, cariño” she teases, a playful smile on her face as she takes her time touching Agatha's breasts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is a little taken aback, too caught up in the way Rio's touch makes her feel, but when Rio lowers her head to give her left breast a bite, Agatha squeezes one of her thighs hard. It's a silent warning that Rio is happy to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>She moves her hand then, trailing her way up Rio's thigh, until she finally touches the spot between her thighs and relishes in how wet Rio already is. She gasps, but Agatha kisses her again to prevent the obscene moan coming from her mouth as her fingers trace her glistening folds.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you been this wet the whole concert, princess?” Agatha teases. </p><p> </p><p>That seems to trigger something in Rio who whimpers, trying to buckle her hip. Agatha is not ready to stop teasing yet, enjoying a little too much how desperate Rio is now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body jolts as Agatha's fingers deliberately move between her folds, causing Agatha to smirk. She could feel Rio aching as the pads of her fingers applied the slightest of pressure. Agatha knew it was far from enough to get her satisfied, but she was enjoying seeing the shivers forming on Rio’s sensitive skin. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio tries to say, but it comes out more like a whine.</p><p> </p><p>“Please what, baby?” Agatha taunts, slowly tracing her wet folds, but never stopping where she knows Rio wants her to.</p><p> </p><p>“Touch me, you asshole,” Rio complains, moving her hips with more intent and Agatha lets out a chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does, circling Rio's clit and feeling her bite hard on Agatha's shoulders to prevent herself from moaning. She gets impatient, incoherently moving her hips trying to chase the stimulation. </p><p> </p><p>“But baby, you look so good like this, desperately trying to get yourself off on my fingers,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives in a bit, putting pressure on Rio's bundle of nerves and thriving in the way she seems to lose control.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha please, i need… more”  Rio whines after a little bit.</p><p> </p><p>“Use your words, baby, what do you want?” Agatha can't help but tease.</p><p> </p><p>“Just fuck me already” she says impatiently bucking her hips.Agatha is loving how demanding Rio gets when she is turned on. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets her fingers trail down Rio’s cunt. Fingers teasing her entrance before easily putting two fingers inside and feeling her body jerk.</p><p> </p><p>“Like this?” Agatha teases, slowly moving her fingers inside, feeling Rio clench around her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers, buckling her hips. Agatha finally takes pitty on her and fucks her properly, moving her fingers in an unrelently rhythm. Agatha can feel Rio's thigh shaking and she positions the heel of her palm on Rio's clit.</p><p> </p><p>She curls her fingers, paying attention to the way Rio's body reacts until she finds a particular spot that seems to drive her into a high, frantically trying to match Agatha's thrust. The wet sound of her movements and Rio’s staccato erratic breath will probably be engraved in Agatha’s mind forever.</p><p> </p><p>Rio puts her hands on Agatha's shoulder, supporting herself better so she can properly ride Agatha's finger, eyes closed and mouth open. Agatha smiles, fucking her harder until she feels her back arch and a broken cry leaves her mouth. Her body shakes and her walls clench around Agatha as she chases her climax.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps going, helping her until she gets down from her high, whining from the overstimulation. Her body slumps forward. Damp forehead on Agatha’s shoulder as she tries to get her breath even. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly takes her fingers off, holding Rio's thought with her other hand and kissing her softly. Finally Rio pulls back, wrecked expression as she looks at Agatha. She lowers one of her hands, finding Agatha’s and holding it up to her face. Without breaking eye contact she brings the fingers on her mouth and licks it until it's clean.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, you are so hot,” Agatha says, pulling her for another kiss.</p><p> </p><p>When they pull apart, Rio finally asks. “Do you think they heard us?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs and even though she was trying not to, Rio joins hers.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, baby, but there is no way they didn't hear us,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans embarrassed, hiding her face in the crook of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p>“How am I going to get out of this car now?” Rio whines and Agatha chuckles, hugging her tighter.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, it's not like it was the first time,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites hard at her neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Ow, what was that for?” </p><p> </p><p>“Don't talk about fucking your groupies in this car when you just done that to me,” she complains making Agatha snort.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry, baby, promise you're the last groupie i fuck in a car,” Agatha teases and Rio pulls back, pushing Agatha with an angry look.</p><p> </p><p>“You're so annoying, i can't believe I just let you fuck me here,” she says trying to get out of Agatha's lap, but Agatha holds her waist tighter.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm kidding, love,” Agatha says, kissing her. “Let's focus on the part where i said you’re the last one i'm fucking here”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you're definitely not fucking me again with that attitude, so you might as well find someone else” she says looking away and Agatha can't help but smile at her antic.</p><p> </p><p>“We will see about that when we get home,” Agatha teases, squeezing her waist and earning an eye roll.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has no idea how much time has passed, but she thanks the concert's insane traffic for keeping them stuck for long enough so she can get into Rio’s good side again before they get home.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Rio feels like she is drunk when she and Agatha stumble into her house. Thankfully Beunhilde was too professional to comment on the noise or their disheveled state before leaving with Bucky.</p><p> </p><p>“You had no business looking this hot with my merch,” Agatha says, mouthing at her neck as she caresses Rio’s side from under her concert t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you liked me in your clothes,” Rio teases, pulling at Agatha's hair and making her moan on her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Not when I can't take it off,” she says, kissing Rio hungrily as they blindly make their way to her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Even though Agatha had said that, Rio managed to get there wearing only the band t-shirt while Agatha is left in only the most ridiculous piece of lace who barely covered anything. Rio pulled back, shamelessly staring as Agatha stood there with a pride smirk on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Like what you see, baby?” she teased.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her, shoving her backwards until her legs meet the bed and she falls seated on the edge. Rio pushes Agatha's legs open and gives her a hungry look before dropping on her knees between her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hears Agatha let out a curse when she starts to trail kisses on her inner thighs. She couldn't help but to bite and suck on Agatha's milky legs, smiling at the bruises blooming in her skin as the singer squirmed. Rio went all the way up to the hem of Agatha's panties before moving to the other leg. </p><p> </p><p>After what Agatha had done to her in the car, she was more than happy to tease her, taking her time getting close to where Agatha wanted, but never actually touching. Agatha gets annoyed, her hand fisting Rio's hair hard and pulling her head so Rio is forced to look up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop teasing,” she warns, but Rio just smirks.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha's grip softens, Rio bites her hip, just a little bit over the waistband of her panties and she feels Agatha involuntarily buckling her hips. She gives Rio’s hair another pull as a warning and Rio lowers her head, licking Agatha over the damp fabric, tasting her arousal, smiling at the way Agatha moans.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moves the fabric to the left, gathering Agatha's juice on her fingers. She puts on a show by licking the fingers and moaning as she closes her lips around them. She can see Agatha's eyes darken with desire when she takes the fingers out with a pop.</p><p> </p><p>She goes down again, fingers slowly parting Agatha's folds and licking all the way from the entrance to Agatha's clit. Agatha lets out a gutural moan. Without thinking too much, Rio tears down the fabric of Agatha's panties and Agatha just groans before pushing her head where she needed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help the moan that escapes her own mouth as she sweeps her tongue over Agatha's cunt. She puts one of Agatha's legs over her shoulder so she can have a better angle to go deeper. Agatha pushes her face closer and Rio looks up, giving Agatha a show as she devours her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, pushing her head back when Rio flattens her tongue covering her cunt and letting her hips chase the stimulation. Rio drags her tongue from her entrance to her clit again, mouthing and sucking it. She hears Agatha babble nonsense as she tries to keep the grip on Rio's hair. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio pushes her fingers into Agatha there is no resistance. Agatha moves her hips and she is quick to match Agatha's pace, feeling her body react to it as she continues to circle her clit. Curving her fingers, Rio can feel Agatha trying to close her shaken legs around her head, but she doesn't slow her thrusts. It's only when Rio scrapes Agatha’s bundle of nerves with her teeth that she feels Agatha clench around her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio continues her movements as the moans tumble from Agatha's mouth signaling she was reaching the peak of her climax. Her jaw starts to clamp up, but she doesn't stop, letting Agatha buckle her hips until she deems it too much and pulls Rio’s head away.</p><p> </p><p>The grip on Rio's hair finally lifts and her thumb caresses Rio's cheek, cleaning away a tear she didn't even feel falling. Agatha looked at her with a wrecked expression, smiling at Rio, probably admiring the mess of arousal and drool on Rio's face. </p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” her voice is raw as she pulls Rio up to her lap.</p><p> </p><p>She hungrily kisses Rio, cleaning her face. The kisses slow into a more tender, calm pace, until she is just caressing Rio’s face as they look at each other with stupid smiles on their faces.</p><p> </p><p>“Not gonna lie, that was such a good head I think I blacked out a little. 10/10 would do it again,” she teases, causing Rio to snort.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you are such a loser, I wish your fans knew that,” Rio taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, are you sure you want a fan to get me like this?” Agatha mocks and Rio just rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You're insufferable,” she says, but there is no bite to it.</p><p> </p><p>“And yet, here you are,”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I must be crazy,” Rio complains, hiding her smile in the crook of Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Crazy for me, clearly,” Agatha jokes but Rio just grunts.</p><p> </p><p>They stay like that for a moment, Agatha softly tracing circles on Rio's back, humming a song that Rio can't quite catch what it is. It's so peaceful that she is sure she could fall asleep like that until Agatha says. “You know, if you give me a few more minutes I can totally fuck you senseless with my purple strap,”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you're ridiculous,” but she is laughing too much for Agatha to think she is mad.</p><p> </p><p>And she definitely was not complaining when Agatha did just that and much more later that night.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>Agatha Harkness at her SoFi stadium concert (photographed by Jessica Jones)</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness has played around with different concepts for her concerts in the past, but for her surprise announced comeback concert, she wanted to go back to her roots.</p><p> </p><p>For the past month, Coven had granted Underworld an exclusive access to follow their team as they worked into the last details of Agatha Harkness’ most awaited comeback concert.</p><p> </p><p>The pre-production, which started more than half a year ago, was already in full mode, but we got the chance to see how much work is dedicated to pull out a superstar performance.</p><p>

</p><p>Behind the scenes of Agatha Harkness VCR shooting (Photographed by Wanda Maximoff)</p><p> </p><p>Between concept meetings, band practices and working on special remixes for some of her old songs, Agatha has taken upon herself to supervise every detail about her concert.</p><p> </p><p>Harkness, who has been part of Coven entertainment since the beginning of her career, walks us through the incredible connection she has with most of the company's team.</p><p> </p><p>“To be honest, I would blindly trust Birdie and Lilia with everything related to my work. Even after all these years, they still seem to predict all my needs and they understand me on a level that I know I don't need to worry about it” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>Even with all the trust, Agatha still jokes that she likes to keep them on their toes as she walks around checking on everything.</p><p>

</p><p>Behind the scenes of Agatha Harkness promotion shooting (Photographed by Wanda Maximoff)</p><p> </p><p>Just like her latest album, we can see a lot of the witch motif as part of the concept theme. Harkness, who had been known as the witch of punk rock, reclaims her title and uses it with pride.</p><p> </p><p>“It's funny to me that they call me a witch as if it's an offense, because I will never see that as a bad thing,” Agatha jokes.</p><p> </p><p>When talking about how this appears on her album, Harkness explains that she wanted to reconnect with her past self and that also meant reclaiming all the bad things thrown at her and turning into a powerful spell.</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha Harkness at her SoFi stadium concert (Photographed by Jessica Jones)</p><p> </p><p>Although Harkness surprised her die-hard fans by starting with some of her slowest songs like “Darkest Hour” and “Earthly and Divine”, she moved the pace around the next 90-minute show.</p><p> </p><p>Fans seemed particularly excited to hear Agatha revise one of her most famous songs, “Primal Night”. This was one of the tracks Harkness had worked on and presented with a new mix.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</div><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha wakes up the next day, her whole body is sore. Not only from jumping around the stage for almost 2 hours, but also from the crazy night she had with Rio after. </p><p> </p><p>She hears a small giggle and forces herself to open her eyes. Rio seems to be entranced by something on her phone. The top half of her body is bare and Agatha can see the purplish bruises covering her neck and chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally notices that Agatha is awake, putting her phone at the bedside table and turning her attention to her, moving Agatha's hair away from her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, cariño,” she says, dropping a peck on Agatha's forehead. “Did you sleep well?”</p><p> </p><p>“Never better,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, caressing Agatha's cheek. Agatha hums in content, closing her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>“What were you laughing at?” Agatha asks a few seconds later.</p><p> </p><p>“Your fans,” she simply says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her down, cuddling her close when she lays beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“What have they done now?” She asks, kissing Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just reading their reaction to the concert and my article,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>“It's out already? I want to read it,” Agatha says, more awake now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we at least get coffee first? I need to prepare myself to watch you read me professionally wax poetry about you” Rio complains.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts, indulging her, but not before pulling her into a real kiss first. “Come on, I will even make you pancakes,”</p><p> </p><p>She lends Rio one of her robes, putting one herself and pulls her in the direction of the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure we're not going to walk on anyone from Coven in your kitchen?” she teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby, I made sure no one is bothering us for at least 72 hours without risking getting fired,” Agatha assured Rio, laughing.</p><p> </p><p>It takes them more than it should to get their breakfast ready because they couldn't take their hands out of each other or steal kisses in between the cooking steps.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sends Rio outside with their coffee and food, while she looks around for her phone that she had tossed somewhere by the entrance the previous night and one of her reading glasses. When she sits in front of Rio, she stops with her coffee cup halfway to her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha confusedly says.</p><p> </p><p>“Since when do you wear glasses?” There is something about her tone that Agatha can't quite catch.</p><p> </p><p>“a couple of years” she says. “They are only for reading though, why?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her attentively. Agatha sees her bite her lip and swallow hard. Until it dawns on her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, did my reading glasses just made you horny?” she asks incredulously.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, can you blame me? You look like you just came out of one of my wet dreams” Rio explains, making Agatha chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>“Now you're the one being ridiculous,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I stand with what I’ve said” she shrugs, getting back to her coffee.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, opening Rio’s article on her phone while sipping at her own coffee. She can't help but smile as she reads it. Agatha will never get used to reading nice things about herself coming from someone in the press. </p><p> </p><p>When she finishes it, she makes a show of dramatically putting down her phone and looking at Rio with a serious expression. </p><p> </p><p>“So what did you think?” Rio was going for casual, but Agatha can hear her hesitant tone. </p><p> </p><p>“I think they will realize you're in love with me,” Agatha replies in the most serious tone she can manage and Rio groans, throwing a blueberry at her.</p><p> </p><p>“You're insufferable,” she whines. “Can you tell me what you really thought?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up, walking to the other side of the table where Rio was sitting and giving her a kiss. “It's amazing, as always, you almost made me look like a nice person,”</p><p> </p><p>“You are a nice person, Agatha, I will never write about  you in any way that doesn't show who you really are” Agatha is surprised by how serious Rio was replying to her joke.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, love. i'm really thankful for that,” Agatha admits, kissing her again.</p><p> </p><p>After their breakfast, Agatha convinces Rio to take the rest of the weekend off with her. She knows Rio must be just as exhausted as her after spending a month following Agatha around as she was getting things done for the concert. </p><p> </p><p>Rio obliges, but only after getting a hold of her friends to check on her pet while she's at Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is just grateful to be able to enjoy the little time they have before the chaos of the tour starts.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>“You knew about this tour this whole time, huh?” Nat asked from across their table.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, they made me sign an NDA,” Rio admits.</p><p> </p><p>“Who would have thought your NDA would not be because you're fucking Agatha” JJ teases and Rio's eyes widen.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't say that here,” she whisper-shouts.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought this was common knowledge, my bad,” her friend whispers back.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not exactly a secret, but I don't want this going around without context and people thinking this whole thing was a sexual favor or something” Rio explains.</p><p> </p><p>“It makes sense, after that first interview people kinda became obsessed with you two,” Nat says.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, there's even a ship name,” JJ teases.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“They are calling you two Agathario, but i was expecting more from the purples, vidarkness was right there,” Nat casually says, like discussing ship names for her best friend was not the most insane thing.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

Either Europe or South America, I don't care, just let me know beforehand so I can book the tickets, okay?” Hela says, surprising Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, I will check my schedule and get back to you tomorrow, boss”</p><p> </p><p>“I know this goes without saying, but whatever the fuck you have going on with Agatha, I expect you to keep your professional life away from it. I don't mind if you two are fucking or whatever, I just don't want anyone questioning our magazine because of it,” she adds.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I know, you don't have to worry about it,”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, now get back to work because I have other things to go through,” her boss dismisses her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio forces herself to ignore the awful feeling that conversation leaves in her head. Focusing on finishing a new album review before she can finally leave the office and spend the night with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure you don't want us to stay?” Brunhilde asks, checking Rio’s building entrance for the 100th time.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I'm sure, if I need something I call you two later,” she guarantees. “Can I get out now?”</p><p> </p><p>Brunhilde gets out of the car, checking the area one more time before opening the door for Agatha. “Coast is clear, boss”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, thinking about how the whole scene was attracting more attention than if she had just got out of the car and ran to Rio’s building when they got there 10 minutes ago. She sort of gets Brunhilde’s apprehension since Rio’s building doesn’t have any security, but Agatha is not sure anyone would ever find her there.</p><p>She knocks on Rio’s door, making sure she had the fancy bottle of wine she got secured. She can hear music coming out of the apartment and Rio quickly moving around before the door finally opens. The journalist gives her a big smile, hair messly falling into her almost bare shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi cariño, I was just finishing our dinner,” Rio greets, picking the wine and stepping back so Agatha could get in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help but chuckle when she sees the black sweatpant Rio is using is part of her tour merch, that she didn’t even knew it was available already.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you robbed the merch department?” Agatha teases, pulling her for a kiss as soon as she gets inside.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Birdie sent me a box full of these things,” she explain “these are really comfy by the way,” </p><p> </p><p>“You look cute, I love it when you remind me you're a fan,” Agatha taunts, slapping her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites Agatha's lip and she groans, holding her tight. “You are so lucky you're hot”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes that opens a lot of doors,” Agatha says. “and legs too,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushes her away with an indignant grunt. “that's it, you're on time out, no kisses for you until after dinner,” </p><p> </p><p>“What? I'm not a kid for you to put me on time out,” Agatha protests.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, stop acting like one then,” she taunts, pushing Agatha away when she tries to kiss her again.</p><p> </p><p>She walks away, leaving Agatha alone in her loft’s spacious living room. Agatha looks around, taking in the big windows and the enormous couch in front of the tv. The place must look amazing with sunlight filling through the windows, but Agatha thinks it is just as cozy as it is with Rio’s warm lampshades.</p><p> </p><p>There's a lot of plants, which Agatha was not expecting from Rio. but somehow makes total sense and it fits the industrial vibe of her place. Agatha finally sees Hades tank and she carefully approaches it. It's a lot bigger than she was expecting, with a lot of space for him to swim around and Rio had even added some plants and a fake skull for him to hide that matched his title of the god of the underworld.</p><p> </p><p>After a few moments looking at it, Hades decides to show himself for Agatha and she is charmed by his cuteness.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, buddy,” Agatha softly says, watching him swim around.</p><p> </p><p>“I think he likes you,” Rio says suddenly, scaring Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“At least someone in this family likes me,” Agatha taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you were better than that, Agatha Harkness,” Rio teases, pulling her by the waist. </p><p> </p><p>“I have no idea what you're saying,” Agatha says with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you do,” Rio whispers in her ear. “I think you're trying to make me say that I like you,”</p><p> </p><p>“I haven't done anything, but you are free to say whatever you want to me,” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels Rio's smile on her skin before she softly bites her earlobe. Agatha's body involuntarily shivers.</p><p> </p><p>“Te quiero, cariño,” it's just a whisper, barely audible, but it feels like a scream inside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her face, thumbs caressing the soft skin before pulling her into a kiss. Time out is completely forgotten, as they take their time just kissing each other.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, let's eat before it gets cold,” Rio says, dragging Agatha to the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives Agatha a bowl with pasta and sits beside her on the couch before pouring them the wine Agatha have brought.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, I have this dog syndrome,” she says suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha asks, confused.</p><p> </p><p>“JJ says i have this dog syndrome that makes me prefer eating in bowls instead of plates,” Agatha snorts looking at her incredulously. “I swear, everything tastes better when you eat in a bowl”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, shaking her head in disbelief. “I was <em> not </em>expecting that, but I think you have a point there,”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, I knew you would get me, amor” she proudly says, raising her glass for a toast.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha indulges, happy that they can have a moment like this. Rio lets her choose what they are going to watch, even though she bickers with Agatha the whole time, until they settle into an old tv show. </p><p> </p><p>They cuddle on the couch when they finish the food. Drinking their wine as they talk about their day. It doesn't go unnoticed to Agatha how this domesticity, even though it is not something she ever did with her dates, feels right. Maybe it's because it's not that different from how they've been hanging out or maybe it's just because Rio makes Agatha want this. Or even better, she makes Agatha feel like she deserves it.</p><p> </p><p>Later when they are spent, laying in Rio’s bed, Agatha catches Rio's attention away from where she is looking at her phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I'm really glad we got to do this tonight,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>She smiles at Agatha, putting away her phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it's nice to have a little date before you have to go away to be a rockstar,” Rio teases, but there was a bit of sadness there.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, if you haven't turned me down for so long we could have been doing this the whole time,” Agatha jokes, but Rio just rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“This,” she points between them. “had to wait because i'm a professional”</p><p> </p><p>“You are and I'm really proud of you for that, but now I'm about to spend months away from your hot body,” Agatha teases, pulling Rio to her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you like me for more than just my body,” she teases, quirking her eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“I really do, baby, but this,” she squeezes Rio's ass. “is something that i will be missing a lot”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I guess this is a good time to tell you I will be attending your concert in New York, so you won't miss my ass too much,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, seriously?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I will get there on May 1, but I can stay until Sunday with you. You're going to Salem on the 5th, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, we fly there first thing in the morning, but i can take the weekend off, so you can stay with me,” </p><p> </p><p>“Good, because I don't think Underworld would pay for me to extend my visit,” she jokes. “I still have to work on saturday though,”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine by me, I will definitely be too tired for anything else,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio quirks her eyebrow looking at Agatha with a suspicious expression. “Anything, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not that,” Agatha says, mouthing at Rio's neck, sucking at the sensitive spot. “I'm always up for that”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, fisting Agatha's hair and forcing her to look up at her. “How can you be so insatiable? We literally just had sex,”</p><p> </p><p>“Can you blame me? My girlfriend is like a goddess,” Agatha didn't realize she let the term slip until Rio looked at her with a surprised expression.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm your girlfriend now?” she teases, grip tight on Agatha's hair, making her moan.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought we had been through this earlier,” Agatha breathes out as Rio trails kisses on her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but it feels nice to hear you say it,” she whispers, rolling her hips in Agatha's lap.</p><p> </p><p>“If I knew this would get you all horny for me I would have called you my girlfriend sooner,” Agatha teases, earning a hard bite on her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” she pulls harder at Agatha's hair. “I can't believe I actually tamed THE Agatha harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, fondly looking at her <em> girlfriend. </em>That was definitely a feat, considering that Agatha had never called anyone that. Sure she had dated around, but she never cared for anyone enough to have an actual relationship. </p><p> </p><p>“I think i'm actually the one who won the prize here,” Agatha says, kissing her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, definitely, hot music nerd who likes you even when you're being a loser,” she sucks Agatha’s lip, leaving a small bite.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you are the bigger loser here for admitting to be my fan,” </p><p> </p><p>“And yet, you're the one waxing poetry about my ass, who is the real fan here, Harkness?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezes her ass hard. “this ass is a piece of art and if i was not jealous i would make a shrine for it just so everyone would know how fucking good it looks”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs then, involuntarily falling over Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“You are ridiculous, let's go to sleep because unfortunately, I have a real job that does not entail me letting you use my ass as your muse,” she says, finally pulling apart and falling in bed next to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“That is so wrong, quit your job, become my full-time muse,” Agatha jokes, leaving kisses all over her face as she laughs.</p><p> </p><p>“Good night, loser,” she says when they finally calm down.</p><p> </p><p>“Good night, girlfriend” and Agatha can feel her smile from where she is hiding her face on the crook of her neck.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Both of them get busy with work and Rio only gets to see Agatha for a few hours before she has to fly to New York to make sure everything was going as planned for the first stop of the tour. Rio was happy that Agatha had decided to take a private jet because apparently someone had leaked the band flight information and the team was worried she might get mobbed.</p><p> </p><p>Even with the busy schedule, they tried to text and call each other when they could find some time, until it finally came the day of Rio and JJ’s flight. Usually when Rio had to cover out of town gigs, Hela would always send JJ with her and Rio was always happy to get paid to watch concerts with her best friend.</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p>te veo 🖤</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaves her stuff at their hotel room and goes for some sight seeing with JJ. It's been a while since she had been to New York, but she was glad it was already feeling like summer. They avoid the area near the venue because they don't want to deal with the purples. Eventually Agatha texts her saying she is back to the hotel and Rio says goodbye to JJ who was going to meet up with some friends for a drink. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks to the goddess, Rio doesn't have to go through the reception because she ends up meeting Birdie on her way to her room so Rio just follows her to the floor that was reserved for the band. There is more security now, but Brunhilde is still the one guarding Agatha's door when she finally gets there.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey B, what's with all the security?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Some people booked rooms downstairs and were trying to get to the band’s room,” she explains.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew things were getting crazy, but this is starting to be scary.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, is everyone okay?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, hotel security caught them on camera before they even got near the rooms, but we decided to double the security just in case,” she explains. “Anyways, boss is waiting for you, told me to let you in”</p><p> </p><p>She gives Rio a knowing look before swiping her card at the door and opening it for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, B” Rio says before closing the door behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles when she sees the mess Agatha had left behind in her room, shaking her head as she follows the sound of Agatha singing in the shower.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha seems to notice her presence when she opens the door because she stops singing and turns to where Rio is standing on the threshold, admiring her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey creep, want to join me?” she teases, making Rio smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't need to be told twice, stripping from her clothes and joining Agatha in the big shower box. Agatha immediately pulls her closer, kissing her hungrily.</p><p> </p><p>“I missed you so much,” she whispered, trailing kisses down Rio's jaw and neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, missed you too,” Rio practically moans when Agatha put her mouth on her nipple, biting it.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't even have time to catch up, letting herself be touched by Agatha, who has decided to make up for the almost three weeks they have spent apart from each other.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have any idea how much I was dreaming about this?” She trails her hands down Rio's back until they find her ass, squeezing hard.</p><p> </p><p>“You've been dreaming about my ass this whole time?” Rio teases, biting at Agatha's earlobe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns her around, pinning her against the shower wall. Rio can hear her taking a step back, admiring Rio's naked back, glistening from the water that had dripped on her. Rio puts on a show, arching her back so Agatha can have a better view of her ass. She hears Agatha curse, before she traces Rio's ass with her hands. </p><p> </p><p>The slap comes half as a surprise, but Rio sees herself moaning. Agatha caresses her cheek, smoothing the place where her palm was before pulling Rio's body close to hers.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear this ass is a masterpiece,” she whispers in Rio's ear, who just whimpers as Agatha trails one of her hands down her stomach, using one of her legs to pull Rio’s legs apart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio's hair up with her other hand, trailing kisses at the back of her neck, sending shivers down Rio's body. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio moans.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it, baby? Feeling needy already?” Agatha taunts, her fingers slowly parting Rio's wet folds. “I love how you get pliant like this for me, are you going to beg too?”</p><p> </p><p>When Rio doesn't immediately reply, head already in that pleasant fuzzy place, Agatha pulls at her hair harder. She can't help but whimper.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw baby, look at you, already gone and I haven't even touched you properly,” the way Agatha teases her, sends heat directly into Rio's core.</p><p> </p><p>Her legs involuntarily try to close, seeking some stimulation, but Agatha's thigh won't let her. She hears Agatha let out a dark chuckle before finally putting pressure on Rio's cunt. Rio tries to buckle her hips, chase the stimulation she was craving, but Agatha lets go of her hair so she can hold her waist in a bruising hold, preventing her from moving.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this what you want? Did you miss the way my fingers felt on you?” Agatha moves her finger with intent, turning Rio into a mess. “I bet you touched yourself hoping it was me, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, fuck, Agatha, I need you…” Rio babbles and Agatha moves her fingers faster.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what you need, baby” Agatha whispers in her ear.</p><p> </p><p>It's all too much and not enough at the same time and Rio whines in frustration until Agatha finally takes pity on her and puts two fingers inside her. Rio lets out a wanton moan, trying to move to meet Agatha's thrusts. </p><p> </p><p>“You look so good like this for me,” Agatha praises, making Rio moan. “You're taking me so well, baby”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is a mess. Her mind gets even fuzzier as Agatha fucks her harder, whispering praises in her ear as she chases her high. When she feels herself peaking, Agatha fucks her faster, using her thumb on her clit as Rio moves erratically trying to match her pace. </p><p> </p><p>When she finally comes, it is with Agatha's name on her mouth. Agatha slows her movements, making sure not to overstimulate her until she finally pulls out her fingers. Rio is thankful that Agatha was holding her otherwise she would have probably fallen on her knees by the way her legs felt like jelly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her neck and back softly, holding Rio thigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Baby, are you okay?” she asks when Rio's breath finally starts to come out normally.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moves around on her hold so she is looking at Agatha properly. </p><p> </p><p>“I think you almost killed me, but I'm more than okay,” she jokes, making Agatha laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I almost came just from the vision of you bent like that,” she admits.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, i'm sure i can be in an even better position if you decide to fuck me in an actual bed next time,” Rio teases and she can see the way Agatha's eyes darken at that.</p><p> </p><p>They don't manage to do that because Rio ends up eating Agatha out in the shower until they are almost too spent to actually get each other clean and just fall tiredly in bed.</p><p> </p><p>“i'm so happy you're here,” Agatha dumbly says, pulling her closer, kissing the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p>“oh really? i couldn't tell by the way you just fucked my brains out,” Rio teases, dropping her arm over Agatha's belly and cuddling her properly.</p><p> </p><p>“I wish I could bring you around the whole tour,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>“Well contrary to what you like to believe, i do have a job that does not let me follow you around like a groupie,” </p><p> </p><p>“Can you blame me? you did spend a month following me around and are here now, so,” Agatha points out.</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately Underworld is not paying for me to keep doing this,” </p><p> </p><p>“Underworld is paying you to fuck me?” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, technically they just did,” Rio answers and they both laugh. “I'm happy to be here too, cariño”</p><p> </p><p>And that's how they accidentally fall asleep, just to wake up in the middle of the night hungry out of their minds. Rio has to stop Agatha from ordering everything on the menu from the room service and somehow they manage to fall asleep again after eating too much.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>They don't get to laze around in bed because Agatha has to be at the venue for soundcheck and Rio has to meet JJ for brunch before they have to go to the venue too. So when Rio finishes getting ready—once again stealing Agatha's clothes and sunglasses this time—Agatha begrudgingly lets Rio go.</p><p> </p><p>“I will see you later, okay? Text me if you miss me too much,” she teases, kissing Agatha one last time.</p><p> </p><p>“See you later, don't be late”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh didn't you know? I have connections with the band, I heard they won't start until I get there,”</p><p> </p><p>“You must be important then,”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I'm the singer’s girlfriend,” she teases with a big smile and Agatha thinks she will never get over the feeling of knowing Rio is, in fact, her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>“Get out of here, loser” Agatha says, slapping her ass and hearing her giggle on her way out.</p><p> </p><p>It takes Agatha almost an hour to get to the venue because of the traffic and when the soundcheck starts she is already irritated after going through a horde of paparazzi trying to get inside. She tries not to let this transpire since everyone is already stressed out with the first concert of the tour. So she is really thankful to see Rio's text when she finally gets back to her dressing room.</p><p> </p><p>

It's nice to see you like this,”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I'm really happy too,” Agatha admits. “except for the fact that i'm stuck in this tour for months now”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia actually laughs at that. “Need I remind you that you were the one who wanted to do this tour? so you could meet your fans again and all that?”</p><p> </p><p>“That was past Agatha, she had no idea what she was doing,”</p><p> </p><p>“You're old enough to be able to survive a few months without your girlfriend,” Lilia taunts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans. “But do I want to? Can't you ask for another exclusive or something?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don't be ridiculous, Agatha. Rio is an amazing journalist, you will not compromise her work just because you're horny”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, it was worth the shot though” Agatha jokes, but Lilia just shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha must have fallen asleep because the next thing she registers is her phone buzzing next to her.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>oki</p><p>we just got out of the station</p><p>see you soon</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finds her bodyguard by the door and explains everything to her. She doesn't have a chance to see Rio before she is being dragged away by the stylists. Technically, Rio didn't have to be at that part of the backstage, but Agatha was hoping she could see her before she had to go on the stage.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey boss, Rio and JJ are safe, just dropped them at the press room, they had to go through the whole credential check procedure from the venue, but she said she will come by after that,” Brunhilde informs and Agatha just hums in response.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finishes getting dressed, Rio still hasn't shown up, but Agatha has to move for hair and makeup and that's how she finally sees her. Rio is at the end of the corridor, her back to where Agatha is standing.</p><p> </p><p>At first the only thing Agatha can pay attention to is how insane her mini-skirt looked, showing her long tattooed legs. She was once again wearing an oversized tour t-shirt and some high heel boots. Agatha sees her laugh, body casually falling over the person who she is talking to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realizes then that the person was not JJ as she suspected, but a young blonde woman that Agatha couldn't recognize. The mysterious woman puts her hand on Rio’s shoulder, helping her up. They seem close. Too close. </p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is that?” she asks before she has the time to think about it.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that's Carol Denvers, boss” Brunhilde explains, but when Agatha still doesn't seem to recognize, she adds. “She has a podcast about music, I guess she and Rio must be friends”</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, they must be and Agatha knows she is being ridiculous, but she feels a little jealous. She wanted her girlfriend to be giving her attention. Agatha also has to remind herself that she cannot out their relationship so she just stands there staring.</p><p> </p><p>The blonde seems to notice though, because she says something to Rio that makes her turn around. She smiles and waves her hand at Agatha, before turning back to her friend. Agatha sees them hugging one last time and then the woman goes away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walks towards her then, a big smile on her face as she gets closer to where Agatha was with Brunhilde. Agatha can see she was holding back because they were still in the middle of the corridor and anyone could see them so she just motions her head back toward her dressing room and hopes Brunhilde gets the message to stall the makeup artist while they talk.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, mi amor,” Rio greets her as soon as they are alone. “You look so hot”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, letting her look at the new fit for the concert. The stylist had changed the vibe from the previous concert and put Agatha in an oversized blazer covering the tiny shorts she had under it and closed around her waist with a belt.</p><p> </p><p>“You look hot too, I hope you're wearing underwear this time,” Agatha teases, not resisting the urge to squeeze her girlfriend’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>She smiles, pulling Agatha closer. </p><p> </p><p>“For now, but we will definitely change that when we ride back to the hotel,” she whispers in Agatha's ear. Agatha tightens the hold she has on Rio's waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you planning to give me a revival of last month?” Agatha teases, but she just gives Agatha a sinful smile and a wink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her, using the little time she has to enjoy her girlfriend, until they break apart to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>“So, friend of yours?” Agatha stupidly asks when they are almost on their way out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her confused.</p><p> </p><p>“The blonde, you two seemed close,” Agatha tries to go for a casual tone, but she is pretty sure Rio picked up what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>She gives Agatha a playful smile. “Agatha Harkness, are you jealous?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunts, looking away from her, but Rio holds her face in her hands, forcing her to look back.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Carol is my friend, but we haven't seen each other in a while and it was a nice surprise to see her here, even though I was dying to see my ridiculous girlfriend before she had to go on stage,” She keeps looking at Agatha, making sure she got the message. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but smile at her dumbly, even when she pulls Agatha into another kiss, which is almost ruined by how much they are smiling.</p><p> </p><p>“You really thought I was going to pick someone else over my insanely hot rockstar girlfriend who made me come so hard yesterday I almost passed out?” she taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't know, it was just a dumb reaction to your ass in this ridiculous mini-skirt,” Agatha bites back, making both of them laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“You're ridiculous, let's go before Lilia gets me fired for making you late,” she says, giving Agatha one last kiss.</p><p><br/>

</p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>This time Rio did not stay in the pit, since Coven had made a VIP section for the press, but Rio was happy to enjoy it with her friends. Agatha was once again a force of nature and it was undeniable how much she was born to be on the stage.</p><p> </p><p>She messed around with the band, even stopping to play the synthesizer at some point, which was a pleasant surprise for Rio who had already seen this concert before. </p><p> </p><p>When the concert was over, Rio got caught up talking to some of the people at the press room. Although it was the start of the first leg of the tour, Coven had decided not to grant interviews to any member of the press, which means Rio was also out of the pool, so she really didn't have any excuse to go backstage without making it obvious that there was something else going on.</p><p> </p><p>“So, do you wanna go for a drink? Catch up?” Carol asks.</p><p> </p><p>If she was being completely honest, Rio was beat. All she wanted was to go back to the hotel with Agatha, but she didn't know what to say.</p><p> </p><p>“I think i'm gonna head back to the hotel,” it's what she ends up saying.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, i’m down for some drinks if you want,” JJ says then, taking Carol’s attention away from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>That comes as a blessing because everyone is too distracted to see Rio walking out and following Brunhilde back to the parking lot where Agatha was already waiting for her in the car.</p><p> </p><p>She gives Agatha a quick peck as the car makes its way into the crowd. Even with the black-tinted windows they can still see the flashes of the cameras outside.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha adjusts in her seat, dropping her arm over Rio's shoulders so she can cuddle closer. She seems just as tired as Rio feels.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you enjoy today's concert?” she asks, absentmindedly tracing the tattoos on Rio's exposed thighs, sending goosebumps through Rio's body.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you were born for the stage, mi amor. I know you love the introspective part of working by yourself at the studio, but when you are on stage it feels like you're glowing,” Rio says. “I'm really glad you decided to go on tour again, I think both you and your fans deserved this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is silent for a while, probably pondering what Rio had just said. </p><p> </p><p>“I used to love this,” Agatha finally says. “The stage used to be my favorite part. When I first started, we only did small gigs and it felt like I was just karaoking with my friends, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help but chuckle at that.</p><p> </p><p>“Music has always been part of my life, it was what was keeping me away from the chaos of my home. I never planned for it to be something big, I guess this is common knowledge now, but when Lilia found me singing at this stinky bar back in Salem, I thought it was a hoax.” Agatha explains. “I was a covenless witch at that moment and Lilia pulled me in with such blind faith that I felt like i had to do good for her and for myself too” </p><p> </p><p>“I knew how to sing and play guitar, but I still went to vocal training to get better. When things started to get big I was flabbergasted by the crowd response, because who would have thought an angry barely legal girl singing about dismantling the patriarchy and standing up for herself would get into the big media?” Agatha laughed as she was reminiscing about old times. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe that was the problem, nobody wanted to see a dyke talking shit about men in an industry who idolize men being assholes. I ignored most of the things that were being said about me, you know, as I got older I guess I started to get more guarded, but I guess there is just so much shit you can take. I tried to keep going because I knew that even as a crazy unhinged bitch they made me become, there were still young girls who were finding my music and seeing in me a way to find their own coven, find themselves, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio knew because when she was just a little girl herself, she had found Agatha's music and it had changed her whole perspective about what music should be. Agatha's life was nowhere close to hers back in San Juan, but at the same time, she seemed to get those profound feelings Rio had never gotten the courage to say out loud. </p><p> </p><p>Her friends weren't wrong when they said Agatha was Rio gay awakening. In a way she had Agatha’s music to thank for her figuring out her sexuality.</p><p> </p><p>But the thing that she was more thankful to Agatha was for showing her that music was not always about feeling good. Sometimes you need that gut-wrenching feeling that is so devastating it makes you realize you're alive.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve told you this before. I know I should be thankful that my music took me out of the shitty place I was and gave me something so big my past self wouldn't even dream about, but fuck, when your work is yourself there is no way to escape. You can't log out and enjoy your weekend like there's nothing else going on,” Rio can see how distressed Agatha is, so she hugs her tighter, squeezing the hand that was still on her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>There was a lot she wanted to say, but she knew Agatha needed to get this all out of her chest first.</p><p> </p><p>“I caught myself several times thinking how my life would have been if I had just done something else with my life, if I had decided to become an accountant or something equally mundane,” she says with a chuckle and Rio lets out a snort imagining Agatha Harkness as an accountant.</p><p> </p><p>“When I went on hiatus, I wanted to try something else. Lilia suggested that I could go into production, and use an alias so no one would know it was me, but I was so burned out that I got myself into a panic attack because I couldn't do anything related to music without feeling like shit. In the end, I just decided to stop altogether,” Agatha retells. “I give Lilia a lot of shit, but she is the closest I had from a mother and she didn't pressure me at all, she let me do whatever the fuck I wanted even though there was no guarantee i was going back, but when I finally did, she was there waiting for me with open arms,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heaves a long watery sigh and Rio knows she was probably too tired to fight back the urge to cry, so she just lets her do it. She pets Agatha's head and cleans her tear stained cheeks while softly soothing her. After a moment Agatha's breathe seems to even and she squeezes Rio’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry for accidentally dumping all my trauma on you,” she jokes, making them both laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds her face in her hands, forcing Agatha to look at her.</p><p> </p><p>“You should never apologize for that, I'm thankful that you felt comfortable enough to share this with me,” Rio assures and she sees Agatha biting her lower lips hard. “I'm so so sorry that those nasty people pushed you away, but cariño I'm so glad that you're back,”</p><p> </p><p>She caresses Agatha's cheek, trying to coax her to calm down.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm so grateful for what you have done for me. Your music quite literally changed my life, it was a big part of what made me want to pursue this career and it was also what gave me the chance to get to know the incredible person that you are, Agatha” Rio pointedly says. “At this point I hope you know me enough to know I don't say anything without actually meaning it. I know how important your music is to you and I hope from now on you never feel like you have to part with it to live your life. You have changed more lives than your own with your work, Agatha and you deserve to feel the love people have for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives her a watery smile and Rio can see the way her eyes glisten with the tears that are threatening to fall again.</p><p> </p><p>“I know there is nothing I can say to erase those years, but I assure you that if you let me, I will be glad to be here to hold your hand and support you in whatever you decide to do from now on. I have loved you as an idol for a long time, but I'm glad you gave me a chance to love the amazing person that you are behind that too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was not expecting for those words to come out like that, but she didn't regret it either. The past five months had changed the image she had of Agatha and it had shown her a love she was not expecting, but was so grateful for.</p><p> </p><p>“You love me?” The way Agatha asked was so incredulous that Rio almost didn't recognize her usually smug girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I love you, loser,” Rio teases before finally pulling her into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles in the kiss and Rio can't help but do the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, I love you too, Rio.” Agatha admits. “So much it gets me scared sometimes,” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her confused and she sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Not to go into another rant, but you know how shitty it was to grow up with my mom and I'm the poster child of mommy issues, so I was not expecting me being horny for a hot journalist would turn into this. I never got to this point where I have actual feelings for someone, want to have a relationship with them and even catch myself stupidly dreaming about a future together,” Rio bites her lower lip, trying not to smile. “I swear you fucked something inside me. I had crushes before, I guess I even liked some women i've been with, but what i'm feeling right now is so stupidly out of character for me that it makes me feel like i'm going insane,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can't help but laugh then and Agatha ends up joining her too.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry for making you go insane, cariño,” Rio teases, but Agatha just groans. “If it makes you feel any better, this is different for me to, but we don't need to rationalize too much, we can just keep living and see where this will take us,”</p><p> </p><p>“You're right, let's start the tour of our lives,” Agatha jokes and Rio rolls her eyes, but they both know there is no bite to it.</p><p> </p><p>“Loser,” she whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“Your loser,” Agatha kisses her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, only mine,” Rio says, biting at the lower lip and making Agatha gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“Only yours,” Agatha adds and Rio smiles, kissing her.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

Several times during the concert, the singer had stopped to talk and joke around with the crowd, giving whoever was watching the feeling that no time have passed since the last time she was on tour.</p><p> </p><p>Although her latest album “Mother, Maiden, Crone” brought a more somber energy to the setlist, Harkness manages to twist it in a way that work perfectly with some of her more upbeat songs like “Follow me, my friend”.</p><p> </p><p>On her final ment, Harkness talks a little bit about how excited she felt to be able to go on a tour again and meet her fans. That message gets clearer when she chooses to finish the setlist with “Love that Never Dies” a song where she talks about the hardships one has to endure to get what one love.</p><p> </p><p>The first leg of “Agatha all along: tour” is focused on North America and it’s going to pass over some cities in the USA and Canada.</p><p><br/>

</div><p> </p><p>When Agatha wakes up, the space beside her is empty and cold. They hadn't stayed up until late, but she was not surprised that Rio had let her sleep in. </p><p> </p><p>The hotel Lilia had booked for the whole band was one of those luxury ones and although they wouldn't have time to enjoy it too much, she was glad it was big enough to have an actual work station outside the main room of the suite. That's where Agatha finds Rio, reading the paper as she drinks her coffee with her back to the door of the room where Agatha was coming from.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha comes closer, involving her with her arms before dropping a kiss on her temple. She puts down the coffee cup and moves the chair to look at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, cariño, did you sleep well?” she asks, pulling Agatha to her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you got me beat yesterday,” Agatha teases, but her girlfriend just scoffs.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you're forgetting the fact that you were singing for thousands of people yesterday,” Rio says, holding Agatha tight by her waist before moving Agatha's messy hair and trailing kisses on the exposed skin of her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't know, I'm pretty sure it was the sex,” Agatha says, making her laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha holds her face and pulls her into a kiss, not really bothering about the fact that she probably has morning breath and Rio complains, deepening the kiss, but it's not the usual hunger, just that comfortable sensation of kissing someone who knows you.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, JJ texted me earlier asking if we would be down for brunch,” Rio says a few minutes later. “She is going back to LA tonight and apparently this place she found has bottomless mimosas”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, of course JJ would find a place like that.</p><p> </p><p>“We don't have to if you're tired or just not in the mood to deal with people, but from what JJ had said it's a pretty chill place and you can invite Wanda and the band if you like, so it's not obvious that we went out with my friend or something and…” Agatha kisses her before she continues to babble.</p><p> </p><p>“I would love that, but I think just Wanda is enough, I'm gonna be tied to the band for months, I need to use all the time I can get away from them,” Agatha says and she chuckles.</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes to take a shower and Agatha texts her best friend before she gets distracted and forgets to do it altogether.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">hey loser</p><p align="right">what you're doing?</p><p> </p><p>
<b>lydia deetz</b>
</p><p>just woke up</p><p>y?</p><p> </p><p align="right">

</p><p align="right">shut up</p><p align="right">jj is coming</p><p align="right">bottomless mimosas</p><p> </p><p>
<b>lydia deetz </b>
</p><p>okay, now you're talking</p><p>i have to get up tho</p><p>can i meet you guys at the lobby in 40ish?</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">yeah</p><p align="right">we are still busy here</p><p> </p><p>
<b>lydia deetz</b>
</p><p>ew are you texting me while you fuck?????</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>me</b>
</p><p align="right">do you really think if i was fucking my gf i would be texting your stupid ass?</p><p> </p><p>
<b>lydia deetz</b>
</p><p>you forgot I know how kinky you are</p><p>i will just pretend nothing is going on</p><p>for my sake</p><p>see you guys later</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, dropping her phone on the bed before joining Rio in the shower and getting them both late. Agatha lets Rio steal yet another one of her clothes, but this time Agatha had agreed with her that her going out with the clothes she had on the night before would be too suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was already waiting for them when they got to the lobby and they walked with Brunhilde to the car, but not before she called them nasty, getting a confused look from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>True to her words, the place JJ had found was chill enough that Agatha didn't feel that awful feeling that someone was watching her. They ordered too much food and the waiter was happy to keep filling their flutes with mimosa.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, how did it go with Carol last night? Where did you end up going?” Rio asked her friend who promptly choked on her drink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as they stared at each other for a few seconds before her girlfriend almost yelled. “Shut up, you two fucked?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, shut the fuck up, you don't have to tell the whole place about my sex life,” JJ whisper-yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn't help but laugh which got Wanda to finally let out the laugh she was holding and the other two joined them.</p><p> </p><p>“Why am I even surprised? You literally fucked all my friends, I swear to god during college, I had to schedule my hangouts because this idiot kept going out with my friends until they were not only avoiding her but each other too,” Rio complains.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I can totally relate,” Wanda promptly says and Agatha glares at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stills beside Agatha, before heaving a sigh. But she didn't seem pissed.</p><p> </p><p>“You know that there is this theory that when you don't have feelings for your best friend, you end up dating someone that has all their traits? I was hoping it was going to be Nat, not this idiot,” Rio fake complains pointing to JJ who just shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her bratiness away, but they were in public, so she just pinches Rio's thigh behind the table like she had done to her several times and she yelps.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope they are wrong, I don't think I would survive anyone like Agatha,” Wanda teases.</p><p> </p><p>“You forgot the part that says when you didn't have feelings for your best friend. Your little crush saved you there,” Agatha teases “But we all know Nat is more like Birdie than me”</p><p> </p><p>That seems to finally get her friend who almost jumped from the other side of the table to punch Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you are all insane, I thought this was supposed to be a lowkey hangout but you guys acting like kindergartners are kinda attracting attention,” JJ complains and they finally chill.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyways, Carol told me she is moving to LA soon,” her girlfriend says and Agatha can't help but laugh when a piece of strawberry lands on her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was sure they would never be able to step foot in that place ever again.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p>

</p><p>Saying goodbye to Agatha after their amazing weekend together was harder than Rio was expecting. Spending that much time together made her forget for a while that they were about to spend a long time without seeing each other. But they both knew there was no other way to do this, so that's how they got into their little long-distance routine.</p><p> </p><p align="center">NYC ✈️ OLYMPIA</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>i can't fucking believe you</p><p>i will send someone to pick you up</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Rio was undeniably nervous. She hadn't seen Agatha in three months and even though they talked every day during this time apart, it still made her anxious. Somehow this was more nerve-wrecking than the first time she interviewed Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone from the tour crew she met on her way to Agatha's room, greeted her like they were seeing an old friend and Rio guessed that made sense since she had spent a long time with them before.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me, miss. You're not allowed in here,” Brunhilde said, hands up blocking Rio's way when she got to the door, but when Rio just rolled her eyes she let out a laugh. “Nice to see you, chief,”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, nice to see you too, now let me see my woman,” Rio feigned annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>Still laughing, the bodyguard slipped the card at the door and opened it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was pretty sure the person behind booking this hotel was Agatha. The building in itself was breathtaking, but she was definitely not prepared for Agatha's 3 fucking story suite that was at least 3 times bigger than her whole loft. She probably had decided to treat herself because of her birthday, but this was for sure a whole new level of insane.</p><p> </p><p>It actually took Rio almost 10 minutes to find Agatha, but it was worth it because her girlfriend was in a hotel robe, absentmindedly scrolling through her phone in a chair by the infinity pool.</p><p> </p><p>“Looking good there, mi reina,” Rio says, drinking up the way her girlfriend immediately drops her phone and looks at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately pulls Rio to her lap, moving her sunglasses up so she can properly look at her. She holds Rio's cheek in between her hands and covers her whole face in kisses, making Rio laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“I can't believe you're actually here,” she says when she's finally done with the kiss attack.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn't miss my girlfriend's 52 birthday,” she playfully says before going for a real kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“This is insane, i'm never going on tour again if i had to spend this much time away from you,” Agatha complains.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, quit your job and become my stay-at-home fucktoy,” Rio teases, but her girlfriend squeezes her ass hard.</p><p> </p><p>“I fucking missed this too,” she says caressing Rio's ass through her jeans, making her laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sure you did, is your next album going to be an ode to my ass?” Rio jokes.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I could write at least five full albums about it,” she admits and Rio falls over laughing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio really wanted to keep this going, but her stomach growled at that moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, i'm going to get us some room service,” she gets up, pulling them both up.</p><p> </p><p>“Why the fuck does this place have a entire kitchen?” Rio asks, genuinely confused.</p><p> </p><p>“They have an in-house chef that can come here and make us food,” Agatha explains, like that's a normal thing.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, sometimes I forget you're filthy rich, but this is another level, cariño,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“What can I say, I wanted to treat myself, if I have to work on my birthday week, the least I can do is make the stay worth it,” she shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clicks away on a tablet as Rio looks around. Rio feels mesmerized by the way the sun was lighting the whole place with a warm orange light. Agatha joins her in a few minutes, pulling her waist and hugging her close from behind.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm really happy you're here,” she whispers before kissing Rio's neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, involuntarily smiling when she sees the fond smile in her girlfriend’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“Good because after your concert on friday you're taking some days off with me,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha asks, surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“Hela gave me some paid time off after covering this concert and Lilia said you can meet them in Jakarta later, so we're staying in brazil,” Rio promptly explained.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not even my birthday yet and I already feel like it's the best one,” Agatha says, making Rio snort.</p><p> </p><p>They eat late lunch together, but Agatha has to go to rehearsal and although Rio missed the band, she was easily convinced by Agatha to get a massage at the hotel private spa while she worked.</p><p> </p><p>Jet lag kicks Rio's ass when she gets back to their room and she doesn't realize until she wakes up confused in the unfamiliar dark room. Her brain starts to catch up as she looks around for her phone. Panic immediately invades her when she sees that there is barely 10 minutes until August 13th and she has no idea where her girlfriend is to wish her a happy birthday.</p><p> </p><p>She actually <em> hears </em> Agatha before finally seeing her. Agatha looked almost ethereal as the soft moonlight kissed the pale skin of her face. She had her eyes closed, humming as she tuned her guitar. Rio took her time admiring her. The relaxed way she reclined in the fancy chaise longue effortlessly moving her fingers through the cords was definitely doing something to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha seems to notice her, because she opens her eyes and gives Rio a mischievous smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Good night, sleeping beauty,” she says and Rio smiles back, getting closer to where she is.</p><p> </p><p>Her girlfriend turns around on the chair, sitting with her legs to the side of it so she can properly look at Rio. She carefully puts away her guitar and Rio walks closer so she can fit herself between Agatha's legs. Because of the design, the place where Agatha was sat was lower than the other parts, so she laid her chin on Rio’s stomach, holding her by the waist as she looked up at Rio. Dark long hair falling on her back.</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes when Rio moves her fingers through her hair, scraping her nails on scalp the way she knew Agatha loved and earning a pleasant hum in return.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you sleep well?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, sorry, I wanted to get dinner with you guys, but I guess the jet lag beat me,” she explains, admiring Agatha's beautiful blue eyes as they look up to her.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, I knew you must have been tired so I let you sleep in,” she says, softly kissing the skin of Rio’s belly that was exposed from the fluffy hotel robe.</p><p> </p><p>“You're my hero,” Rio teases and Agatha gives her skin a little bite.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna hear something cool?” Rio arches her eyebrows when Agatha asks her this all of the sudden.</p><p> </p><p>“When we got here yesterday, the guy who was showing the place around told me that they wanted to make sure that one of the things they were proud about was the incredible brazilian art pieces they had curated and how this was a big part of the decoration motif,” Rio smiles at her as she explains. “That was how I found out that this chair was actually a special creation from a famous Brazilian architect called Niemeyer,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a short step back, paying better attention to the design.</p><p> </p><p>“The guy explained that Niemeyer was famous for always working with these sinuous curves, but this particular piece was heavily inspired by the landscape of the city he was born,”</p><p> </p><p>“That's cool, it's nice to be able to interact with art like that,” Rio says genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>But there is something about the way Agatha was smiling that told her there was more to it.</p><p> </p><p>“The chair is actually named after that city, do you wanna know what it is?” Agatha asks playfully and Rio nodded. “Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her confused. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“The name of the chair, it's Rio,” Agatha explains with a big smile. “The city he was born was Rio de Janeiro, but he named the chair Rio,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasps in surprise, for a second she almost thinks Agatha is messing with her, but she knew Agatha would have loose it already if she was lying so Rio can only stare at her in shock.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” she adjusts herself again, one leg on each side of the chair so Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits on her lap, back laying at the front part of the chair as Agatha reclined on the back part. Rio moves around a bit so she can straddle Agatha properly.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” she involuntarily moans when she finally feels the harness Agatha was using. </p><p> </p><p>The strap was covered by the fabric of Agatha's robe, but Rio could feel it all over her naked core under her own robe. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha undid the knot on her robe, giving Rio a full look of her bare torso and the purple dildo she had on. Rio could feel herself aching, from the thought of finally getting fucked by her girlfriend after more than three months away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her into a hungry bruising kiss. The movement makes the strap come in direct contact with Rio's already wet core and she lets out a whine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio buckles her hip, enjoying the stimulation as Agatha moves her hands around her body without ever breaking the kiss. It's been so long that when Agatha slaps her ass she thinks she might come just from all the stimulation, but instead she just whines, moving faster. Agatha slaps her two more times before she grips Rio's hip tighter, preventing her from moving.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you miss me fucking you so much that you are trying to come before i even get inside you?” Agatha teases, her finger tracing Rio's entrance slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha please,” Rio whines.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly pushes one finger inside her, but it's nowhere near enough. Rio whimpers, desperately trying to move, but Agatha's hold stays tight.</p><p> </p><p>She takes her time fucking Rio with one and then two fingers, just enough to get her worked up, but not to actually satisfy what she needed. Rio cries out, biting at Agatha's collarbone every time she gets close to where Rio wants her, but never giving what she really wants.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is a mess when Agatha finally takes pity on her and lifts her up so she can sit on her strap. Rio sinks fast, eager to feel full by Agatha's cock and it's only when she bottoms out that she realizes how worked up Agatha is. She looks back at Rio with darkened eyes. </p><p> </p><p>They still for a moment, before Rio moves, putting on a show for Agatha as she rides her. Agatha holds her hip in a bruising grip, helping her move as she sucks marks on Rio's chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I couldn't stop thinking about fucking you here ever since i found out about it,” Agatha grunts moving faster.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moans, trying her best to keep up with her movements, but her legs are starting to give in. Agatha seems to notice though, she forms her feet on the ground getting some leverage to fuck deeper into Rio. Her hand comes to Rio's bundle of nerves that were neglected for a moment and she was feeling so sensitive that after only a few strokes of Agatha's fingers she feels the warmth spreading through her body as it approaches its climax.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucks her through her high until Rio falls over her, too spent to move. Agatha pulls out, carefully moving her before she coaxes her to calm down, caressing her back as she feels her breath come out normally.</p><p> </p><p>“I can't believe you just fucked me over an actual piece of art,” Rio breathes out a few minutes later and she feels Agatha whole body shake with her laughter. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, if it makes you feel any better, I brought the chair the moment the guy told me the name,” Agatha says and Rio pushes herself up to look at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, you're unbelievable, please tell me you didn't spend money on a chair just because it has my name,”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I spent money on a piece of art that I didn't want anyone else to have because it has your name,” she says and Rio shakes her head. “also, now it's something to remember our lovely stay in Brazil”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gives her a playful slap, but then she remembers.</p><p> </p><p>“Cariño, happy birthday!” she exclaims pulling Agatha into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kisses her neck, smiling. “Thank you, baby”</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never a big fan of birthdays. When she was young her mother never cared to celebrate it with her and as she got older she couldn't get the appeal. To her it was just another regular day. </p><p> </p><p>But this year felt different. She woke up with the light of the sun filtering through one of the curtains of the big windows of the hotel room. Her girlfriend was still asleep, half of her body draped over Agatha’s, head on Agatha's neck as her breath tickled her. Agatha couldn't help but smile, she felt fucking happy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stirred then, involuntarily cuddling Agatha closer. Agatha bit back a laugh, but she still started to wake up from a slumber with a confused expression.</p><p> </p><p>“Morning, love,” Agatha whispered, leaving a kiss at the top of her head. She hummed in content.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, birthday girl,” she finally said, lips softly touching Agatha's neck.</p><p> </p><p>They stay there for a moment, slowly getting rid of their sleepiness, just silently enjoying each other’s company.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually Rio gets up abruptly, leaving Agatha confused in bed as she looks through her purse before she comes back with a small purple velvet box.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits back on the bed and extends the box to Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“It's nothing fancy, okay?” she warns before Agatha opens it.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I don't care about that,” Agatha guarantees, finally opening it.</p><p> </p><p>Inside it there's a necklace with a silhouette of three women over a purple background. </p><p> </p><p>“Nat knows goldsmith girl and I asked if she could make this lock to represent the triple goddess from your album,” Rio explains, Agatha traces the design with her thumb before opening it and seeing a picture of them from their NY trip “I wanted to put a picture of my ass since you love it so much, but i was scared you might lose it flying around in tour and i didn't want to risk a possible nude leak,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can't help but laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“You know me too well, baby,” Agatha says, pulling her into a hug. “I seriously love it”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm glad you liked it, now it really feels like an Emily Dickinson shit, with you carrying me around as you are away at war,” she jokes, making Agatha snort.</p><p> </p><p>“It actually feels like a war in my heart being away from you,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you're so cheese,” she says, pushing Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“It's your fault for deciding to date a musician,” Agatha says with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>Because of her birthday, Agatha had a rare day off in the middle of the concert’s preparations. They decide to actually enjoy the day without caring too much. Agatha lets Rio plan their day, so they go for brunch at a cute place close to the hotel before checking a museum.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn't help the warm feeling in her heart, Rio was really invested in making her enjoy her day. She quickly became acquainted with the waitress at the brunch place, surprising Agatha by speaking Portuguese as she got their orders. She was excited about all the locally produced food. Animatedly talking about everything she had just learned about their different types of bread while eating her fruit parfait.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was realizing that she could listen to Rio talk about literally anything without ever getting bored and that said a lot about how whipped she was. Even though they were incredibly full from all the food, Rio still got her a free dessert after explaining to the waitress that it was birthday.</p><p> </p><p>“Feliz aniversário,” the girl had said to Agatha before leaving a berries cheesecake on their table with a tiny lit candle in it.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“You're unbelievable,” Agatha said, shaking her head, but Rio was smiling big at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, make a wish,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea what she could wish for when everything she wanted was already there, but she still closed her eyes and wished to be this happy for a long time. When she blew the candle, she opened her eyes and saw Rio looking back at her.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you wish for?” She cheekily asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Can't tell you, it's a secret,” she replies, taking the first bite of the dessert and letting out a moan.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her with darkened eyes, but Agatha just smiles, picking another bite with her spoon and feeding it to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Pinacoteca, the museum Rio had chosen had an imponent architecture and Rio explained that it used to be an art school, but it was renovated and now was one of the buildings of the group that houses a big collection of modern art. </p><p> </p><p>Since it was an afternoon in the middle of the week, the two of them could enjoy the exhibits without having to worry about being caught. Brunhilde followed them around, but maintained her distance so they could enjoy their date. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't know much about art, but she was happy to observe and listen when Rio explained something to her. Agatha was particularly fascinated by one of the galleries where they curated a lot of self portraits from different periods and styles, but that somehow made it a cool way to look at the different ways one can see themselves.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, one of the temporary exhibitions was about an Brazilian artist that created some of his pieces playing with music sheets and Agatha saw herself entranced by the colorful intrinsic artwork.</p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio involves her arms around her waist, putting her chin on Agatha's shoulder to look at the piece Agatha was looking at.</p><p> </p><p>“That's cool, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, thank you, from everything, this is officially my favorite birthday,” Agatha says, moving her head to leave a kiss on Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm glad you're enjoying it, we still have some time until they have to close, but Lilia texted me saying she wants to have a special dinner with everyone at one of the hotel’s restaurants,” she says, making Agatha groan. “Hey, if you really don't want to, I can make something up, but mi amor, I think you should let people celebrate your amazing existence. They are all your friends and i know they just want to show you some love,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, resting her body on Rio's. She was right, like always.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, let's go,” Agatha finally says.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner is just as much of a hassle as she was expecting, but she lets her friends fuss over her and jokes around as she opens their gifts. Rio stayed beside her, hand on her thigh, grounding her and reminding that she was there for her.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha falls asleep that night is with the knowledge that she's still allowed to enjoy her life, because there is more to it than just her music.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking at Wanda’s computer as she showed her all the pictures from the previous concerts. So what if she wanted to print the best picture of her girlfriend?</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha got back from the hair and makeup, Rio finally looked up.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please fire your stylist,” she blurted out, causing Wanda to snort.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it now?” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Why does she keep putting you in these insanely hot clothes? How am I supposed to survive you in full leather?” Rio whines.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, this is definitely my clue to leave,” Wanda says getting up. “ just a head up, you have 10 minutes, don't even think about it,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gives Rio a quick kiss, careful not to smudge her recently applied lipstick.</p><p> </p><p>“I've missed you being horny about my stage clothes,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't, this is unfair, I hope Gwen knows she's on thin ice with me,” Rio feings annoynce making her girlfriend laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Someone knocks at the door, announcing that Agatha had 5 min and she gives Rio one last kiss before going away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio goes to the staff VIP section by the soundbooth. She hangs around there during the concert while Wanda goes back and forth taking pictures. They were almost at the end of the concert when Rio saw something flying to the stage. She sees security running, but can't actually see what it is from this far, it's only when Agatha picks the object up that Rio lets out a breath and laughs.</p><p> </p><p>“Panties? Really?” Agatha says a little bit later when the song has finished and the whole audience laughs. She seems to examine it. “Definitely a bold move to put your number here, honey,”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head laughing. Of course one of the purples would do something like that. Agatha looks around the crowd, probably looking for her and when she finds Rio she winks playfully and smiles before tossing the lingerie away and getting back to the concert.</p><p> </p><p>When they are back at the car on their way to the hotel, Rio finally says. “I can't believe someone actually tossed you some panties”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs pulling her close.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm surprised you're not jealous,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it's not like you were going to call some random fan,” Rio shrugs. “besides, i know for a fact that you would chose my naked ass over any groupie”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs again, lowering her hand to grip at Rio's ass. “You are absolutely right, love”</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</div><p> </p><p>Rio looked incredulous as more and more pictures of her and Agatha appeared online. They had apparently been following them since January when they were not even together. She didn't know if she wanted to cry or set something on fire or maybe both.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was still on her way back from Japan and probably hadn't seen anything yet. She didn't know what to do, there was no point in denying it, but she didn't want to say anything without talking to Agatha first. </p><p> </p><p>She jumped when her doorbell rang. Rio was afraid that TMZ had already leaked her address, but in the end it was only Nat and JJ. The rest of the day was a blur. She had to turn off her phone because journalists kept calling her to comment and Rio felt sick to think that probably someone that she considered a friend before might have sold her phone number.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't know how, but she does end up falling asleep and she has no idea how much time had passed, when she hears hushed conversation coming from her kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>When she sees Agatha, she looks tired, hair a mess in a clumsy bun. She probably had come straight there when she landed.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby, i'm so sorry,” her girlfriend says, pulling her into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't realize she was crying until she feels Agatha thumb cleaning her stained cheeks. She vaguely registers her friends saying that they will come back tomorrow, but Rio can only focus on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm so so sorry, I didn't want you to go through this, I was on the plane and I came as soon as I could,” she explains and Rio can feel her distress.</p><p> </p><p>“It's not your fault, i'm just glad you're here, I didn't know what to do,” she says with a sob.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, love, Coven legal team is already taking care of everything, you don't have to worry about it anymore, okay?” she guarantees and Rio can only nod.</p><p> </p><p>“I got so scared because they had so many pictures of us and people kept calling me, I guess I was not expecting for it to be like this,” Rio says after a while. “I can't believe you have to go through this all the time, i'm so sorry, cariño,”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, you don't need to apologize, I should be the one apologizing for dragging you into this,”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, nothing about this is your fault, you've been a victim this whole time,”</p><p> </p><p>They talk for what feels like hours. Until Rio finally says. “Are you really sure about this?”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn't trust anyone else for this, baby,” Agatha says, squeezing her hand reassuringly.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚡️🎸⚡️</p><p><br/>

<b>All that's foul and fair: an exclusive interview with Agatha Harkness.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness talks with Underworld about her latest tour and opens up about her time away from music. </p><p> </p><p>By Rio Vidal | Sep 30</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha Harkness for Underworld (Photographed by Jessica Jones)</p><p> </p><p>Freshly out of her five month long world tour, Agatha Harkness sat down with Underworld team for a casual interview.</p><p> </p><p>Harkness, who had been away from the industry for ten years until December of last year, seemed happy to meet her fans again after such a long wait.</p><p> </p><p>“You know when you have a long day and a friend you haven't seen in a while asks you out. You're tired, but you still go and that ends up being more recharging than going straight home? That's what it felt going back on tour, every stop was like the purples were giving me their energy and making me more powerful” Agatha explains.</p><p> </p><p>Harkness adds that when she was working on her new album she was afraid that she might have lost her timing with her fans, but that she was pleasantly surprised by all the love she's been getting from them.</p><p>

</p><p>Agatha Harkness for Underworld (Photographed by Jessica Jones)</p><p> </p><p>Almost a year since her comeback, Harkness opened up about her decision to leave the industry. “For a long time, my face was a symbol of empowerment for women and although that was a title that I was proud of, it also came with a constant backlash from an established industry who was build to keep women away from the top”</p><p> </p><p>Harkness explains that for a long time, she was led to believe that her music didn't matter and she felt like it didn't matter how much she tried, the industry was always gonna see her either as a shadow of a man or wannabe.</p><p> </p><p>“Being constantly in the spotlight was also something that somehow led people to believe they had any right over my life and it started to feel like as long as my work was also my life I would never fully experience what it was like being myself outside it” Agatha points out.</p><p> </p><p>The time apart was important for the singer to be able to come back on her own terms. Determined to not take any more shit from anyone, Harkness sees the new phase of her career as a step closer to becoming her real self.</p><p> </p><p>When asked about her plans for the future, Harkness said that she is taking some time off, but that she's already working on her new album which she expects to come out next year.</p><p> </p><hr/><div class="twt">
