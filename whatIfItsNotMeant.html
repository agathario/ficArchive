     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      “Pleasure,” she quips, making sure her tone reveals it is anything but. “Though, despite what Jen may say, I don’t exactly make a habit of going around and spilling all my secrets.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio nods, “Of course. You’re who they call the ‘terrifying enigma’ of the literary community.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Agatha makes sure her tone drips with sarcasm and a twinge of derision as she responds, “And I hear you’re the new ‘darling’ of the publishing industry.”
     </p>
     <p>
      But then Rio has the gall to actually fucking smirk at her. “Did you just call me darling?”
     </p>
     <p>

    <p>
     Agatha gazes out across the crowd, willing the floor to split open and swallow her whole before she has to withstand another second of this miserable and stuffy fucking party. The depths of hell are probably much nicer than this room filled with people she’s currently being asked to network with. She’s been attending these autumnal galas for eight years and somehow they’ve only gotten worse. Her required presence makes sense in theory considering she’s one of Covenant House’s bestselling authors, but how they haven’t realized schmoozing old men with money to waste is so far down on the list of her abilities, she doesn’t know. Her attendance has to be strong-armed by Lilia every year, citing hierarchy and company politics that is way outside Agatha’s scope of giving a fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t even think about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turns to find Jen, a glass of wine in her hand and the fakest smile Agatha has ever seen plastered on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn’t doing anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can hear your thoughts from across the room, not to mention you’ve had a face the whole night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What face? I’m not making a face.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look like you want to stab everyone in this room before plunging the knife into your own heart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sniffs, taking a drink from her glass before responding. “I call that daydreaming.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well, you’re not leaving. It is far too early, even for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks at her watch and sighs. She hates to admit when Jen is right, but she’s only been here for twenty-two minutes—a new record for how quickly she’s started contemplating mass murder at one of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia suddenly appears at her elbow. “Agatha, I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia doesn’t even bother to look offended, far used to her antics. “I got your email. I see you once again scheduled the chapters to send right as I leave my desk for the day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze sweeps across the room, avoiding eye contact. “Noticed that, did you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lucky for you, I had Billy print them out so I could read them on the drive over.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who the fuck is Billy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Didn’t I tell you? He’s my new assistant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen interrupts, a weird look on her face Agatha has never seen before. “Have either of you seen Alice tonight?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha makes a show of pulling out her phone and swinging it back and forth in front of Jen’s face. “Yeah, let me just check her location, which I track on my phone devotedly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looks at her, unimpressed. “Does it ever get tiring being such an asshole all the time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No fighting, ladies,” Lilia smiles. “The gentlemen are watching.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs. “Well, the gentleman can eat my—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice,” Jen interrupts quickly, “I was looking everywhere for you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice makes her way over to Jen’s side, a shy smile on her face under the attention. “Sorry, I was introducing one of my authors to some people. It’s her first gala.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bad news for them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen rolls her eyes. “Not everyone hates parties as much as you do, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She mumbles Jen’s words back at her in a mocking tone before she responds, “And I don’t hate parties. I just hate pretentious, peevish men who think the money in their pockets gives them the ability to do whatever the fuck—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “As your agent, I am begging you to shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia nods, “And as your editor, I am seconding Jen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh please, I could replace you both in two seconds flat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate to break it to you,” Lilia says, “but very few people would actually be willing to work with you after the stunt you pulled at the National Book Awards last year.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not my fault that woman spilled a drink down my
     <em>
      silk
     </em>
     shirt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen narrows her eyes. “That ‘woman’ was Anne fucking Carson.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha can bite back with an insult loud enough to (hopefully) get her kicked out, a woman she doesn’t know appears next to Alice. “Hey, heard you guys were having a party.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, there you are!” Alice looks grateful for the intrusion, much to Agatha’s dismay. She’s not really in the mood to meet new people tonight—or ever, really—but the woman’s name rings a bell somewhere in the back of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is Lilia,” Alice continues, “my mentor I was telling you about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia shakes Rio’s hand warmly. “Don’t believe a word this one says, she hasn’t needed my mentorship in years.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m grateful all the same. Her red pen basically saved my life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flashes Lilia a wink and Agatha rolls her eyes. Alice points to Jen next, her smile somehow growing shyer, “This is Jennifer Kale with—.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Draft Talent, yeah. Loved the deal you made with Penguin last year for that tell-all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Getting companies to pay women an inordinate amount of money to spill their secrets is my specialty.” Jen shrugs and flashes a smile, and the disgust in Agatha’s stomach twists when she notices Rio’s smile grow, but then Jen turns to her and, “Speaking of, this is—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha Harkness, I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally directs her gaze to Agatha and something about it irks her, the look warm and appraising. Agatha would be lying if she said Rio wasn’t pretty—
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     than pretty, if she’s being honest—but it’s almost entirely cancelled out by the way she looks Agatha up and down like there’s something she wants. Agatha’s suit suddenly feels itchy, the fabric grating against her skin as she fidgets with one of her lapels. Flicking her hair, Agatha reaches out a hand and thanks whatever deity is reigning above for her ability to not flinch at the feeling of Rio’s warm palm sliding against her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pleasure,” she quips, making sure her tone reveals it is anything but, “though, despite what Jen may say, I don’t exactly make a habit of going around and spilling all my secrets.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods, “Of course. You’re who they call the ‘terrifying enigma’ of the literary community.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She makes sure her voice drips with sarcasm and a twinge of derision as she responds, “And I hear you’re the new ‘darling’ of the publishing industry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio has the gall to actually fucking
     <em>
      smirk
     </em>
     at her. “Did you just call me darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha freezes, momentarily caught off guard. She levels Rio with a glare that has sent lesser people running out of conference rooms, but it does nothing to apparently rile the other woman. “I don’t like you,” she says, her teeth clenched with the restraint to not slam the nearest server’s tray out of their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Noted,” and the way Rio says it makes it seem like it’s a challenge, like Agatha is merely a puzzle for her to solve. Anger flushes through her, familiar and intoxicating, but she’s barely opened her mouth to retort when Jen suddenly grabs Alice’s arm, steering her away towards the open bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need a refill. You?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice nods and they walk away, leaving Agatha to wonder when they became so friendly. She turns back to Lilia, angling her body in a way that makes it clear Rio is no longer welcome in this conversation. Rio barely takes a half step away before Lilia fumbles with the phone in her pocket, face instantly pinched in a concerned expression. “Shit, Billy’s calling me. I’ll be back,” then she steps closer to Agatha, voice lowering with irritation, “and then you and I are going to discuss those chapters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia glides across the floor and out of the room, Agatha watching her retreating back and chanting
     <em>
      traitor traitor traitor
     </em>
     in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio steps back into her space, hands casual in her pants pockets as she smirks again. “Uh oh. Someone in trouble?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs, “She probably just wants to sing my praises. Best three chapters I’ve ever written.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows shoot up, disbelief and amusement crossing her face in equal measure. “What’s it about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ll have to wait until the pub date like everyone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t get an advanced copy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice drips with that saccharine playfulness again and it grinds Agatha’s gears even harder. This woman is
     <em>
      insufferable,
     </em>
     and she doesn’t know how Alice can stand to work with her. “I tend to reserve those for people I actually like.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Must be a short list.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t have a comeback to that because Rio is right, but she refuses to let the other woman know she’s hit the nail on the head; Agatha would rather gouge her own eyes out, so she switches tactics. “What about you? Working on anything special?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks like she knows exactly what Agatha is trying to do, but grants it to her anyway. “A sequel to my debut.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That fantasy thing, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, that fantasy thing,” Rio says, putting air quotes around the phrase as her eyes darken. “I don’t imagine you’ve read it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fantasy isn’t really my thing,” Agatha responds, shrugging her shoulders and lapping up the way she can see Rio tensing. A fight is exactly what she needs right now and somehow she knows Rio is more than capable of keeping up with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what is your thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Preferably something with a bit more substance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I see,” and the smirk is back on Rio’s face. “You think you’re too good for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, most of it
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How would you know if you’ve never read it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes another long sip from her glass, making a point to look Rio up and down. “I judge books by their covers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opens her mouth to respond and Agatha braces for it, letting the irritation caused by this whole, pathetic night stiffen her shoulders, when Lilia materializes at her side again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, a word?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets Lilia steer her away by the elbow only because she thinks she might hit Rio if she stays in her presence any longer, but then she remembers what Lilia wants to discuss and she halfheartedly tries to break from the woman’s grasp. “I’m planning to make a break for it in about three minutes so if you could make this quick—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia cuts her off, a frown on her face. “Those were some of the worst chapters I’ve ever read from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pauses, taking in Lilia’s pinched and disappointed face. “Tell me how you really feel, Lilia.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t understand why this book is so difficult for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     why,” she growls.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yet it was
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets the facade drop—just a little—and tries to convey the least amount of vulnerability possible when she says, “I’m trying, okay?
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s face softens a bit, but she doesn’t let up; Agatha would probably fire her if she did. “Try harder. Or I’ll forward all your upcoming projects to Sharon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She narrows her eyes. “You wouldn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know I would. Give me three real chapters by next Friday, Harkness, or the next Covenant party will be your memorial service.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s to her retreating back that Agatha exclaims, “You really know how to show a girl a good time, Calderu.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And right when she thinks the past seven minutes couldn’t get any worse, Agatha feels someone approach her from behind and she just knows it’s fucking Rio. It’s like the surrounding air drops a degree, an electric tension seizing up all the oxygen until it’s nothing but them and a fire that feels like it’s been burning for centuries. Agatha fucking hates it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     in trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “None of your business,” she snaps. She must really be losing her touch if Rio doesn’t flinch under the scowl Agatha throws her way, crossing her arms as a poor means of defense. If anything, Rio looks like she enjoys Agatha’s blatant disregard for her, and it does nothing to quell the hostility Agatha can still feel bubbling in her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Rio fucking winks, a sly
     <em>
      te veo
     </em>
     , Agatha falling from her lips as she saunters away, leaving Agatha alone with a simmering rage and,
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     , a throb low in her abdomen at the sound of that soft accent wrapping around those stupid fucking words.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      See you later
     </em>
     , she knows it can mean—but worse is she knows Rio meant it literally.
     <em>
      I see you
     </em>
     , and Agatha will be damned if she ever does.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     The laptop in her bag weighs down her shoulder, an ever present reminder of all those blank pages on her manuscript document.
     <em>
      Go out and write some place new,
     </em>
     Lilia had said, which is how she found herself in Chelsea before ten in the fucking morning. Normally she lets herself be the slow morning type, but the hanging threat of Lilia forwarding all her future projects to fucking Sharon (which she knows is more bite than bark) and that woman’s affinity for trashy romances and self-help books—not to mention what would be a lifelong shame of not being able to finish this goddamn book—forces Agatha to swallow her pride (a bit) and step into one of those disgustingly modern and hipster cafes she had chosen at random on Google maps.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s a Tuesday, so thankfully it’s not that busy, and she takes her time perusing the overly cheerful menu full of concoctions that are more sugar than actual coffee before finally settling on a latte. She finds an empty table in the back and begrudgingly admits to herself that the coffee is actually quite good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally opening her laptop, the cursor blinks mockingly as she attempts to get back to where she left off. She’s already two chapters behind, her revision of the last three barely making Lilia’s cut, and she needs to work at least forty-two of the next thirty hours in order to meet the next deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, well, well,” a voice says, and she startles. Glancing up at the unwelcome intrusion, she finds the last person on earth she’s interested in seeing right now. “Hello, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     Vidal. With that stupid smirk on her face and a to-go cup in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tenses, the exasperation from the night of the gala returning with full force. “What the hell are you doing here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugs, taking a sip from her drink. “This happens to be my favorite writing spot, though no writing for me today. I sent over my final chapters to Alice last night, so today I’m celebrating before she starts gutting it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? Congrats, I guess.” And she does her best to not say it, but nothing is really stopping her from saying it under her breath as she attempts to dismiss this whole interaction and delve back into the work she really needs to be doing right now instead of whatever
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     is with Rio. “A whole fucking city and I just had to choose the one place you frequent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But it does nothing to offend Rio, like any insult Agatha throws her way only serves to deepen whatever it is that causes her infuriating smirk to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Careful, Harkness. Or else I’ll start to think you don’t like me,” she says, and Agatha notices the way her tongue presses against the inside of her cheek like there’s something more she wants to say, like this is all amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve literally,
     <em>
      explicitly
     </em>
     , said I don’t like you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Noted,” and Rio nods before she takes one last sip from her drink, never breaking eye contact, before moving around Agatha’s table towards the door. “Guess I’ll be seeing you around.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you’re lucky,” Agatha scoffs, rolling her eyes to really drive the point home that she does not like this fucking woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Te veo
     </em>
     ,” Rio repeats, and it takes every ounce of willpower Agatha has not to throw her latte at Rio’s back.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her better judgement, Agatha goes back to the cafe the next morning. She tries to tell herself it’s because the universe wouldn’t be so psychotic as to make her run into Rio for a second day in a row, and that she actually quite likes the coffee shop in all its millennial glory—but she knows she’s lying to herself. A bit. She hasn’t actually thought about why exactly she finds herself back here, knows it probably has something to do with Rio, but that’s a line of questioning she’s not keen on following any time in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
     So it’s not exactly a surprise when Rio drops into the seat across from her as she reaches the second page of her next chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fancy seeing you here,” Rio says, grabbing her own laptop out of her bag and setting it up across from Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     She barely glances Rio’s way, raising one eyebrow as she uselessly searches for yet another synonym for the word ‘evil.’ “I’m working.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mockingly salutes her, then makes a poor attempt of peeking at Agatha’s screen. “You never did tell me what you’re working on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha quickly angles her laptop away from Rio and glares. “I’m aware.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Rio honest to god
     <em>
      pouts
     </em>
     . “Not even a hint?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It sends a flash of heat through Agatha so intense that she doesn’t trust herself to speak, just pointedly turns back to her work and ignores Rio for the rest of the two hours that she sits in that goddamn cafe and writes. She’s not exactly sure why she lets Rio stay there, right across from her as Rio works on… whatever it is she’s working on, but neither speaks another word even as Agatha gets up to leave. Her back pops in a way that is only mildly embarrassing, then she leaves without another glance Rio’s way, an air of triumph carrying her all the way to the street corner where she flags down a taxi to take her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not until she’s settled in the backseat that her phone buzzes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      hey, this is rio. i got your number from jen
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha:
     <em>
      First of all, how do you even have Jen’s number? Second of all, delete mine.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      aw, are you worried i’m talking to other women?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha:
     <em>
      In your dreams.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      but you’re so much nicer to me in my dreams
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha:
     <em>
      Goodbye.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffs and locks her phone, quickly remembering why it is she does not like Rio; she gets under Agatha’s skin in a way no one else has in, well, ever, and she has half a mind to ask the taxi driver to run them right off a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then her phone buzzes once, twice more in her lap, and Agatha is already rolling the window down to throw her phone out of it when she catches sight of Rio’s messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      see you tonight
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      in my dreams. :)
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s now an expectation when Rio slides into the chair across from Agatha the next morning, the early October air outside turning her cheeks a shade of pink that Agatha can feel in her fingertips—but that, oh, well, that is not something she can afford to entertain right now. Flicking her hair out of her face, she goes back to diligently working and does everything she can to ignore the woman across from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     For her part, Rio at least has the grace to wait until Agatha is two lattes deep into the morning before asking, “How about today?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh?” Agatha knows exactly what’s she asking for but plays dumb anyway, not giving Rio the satisfaction of knowing that she bothers to remember anything about their previous interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushes on, “Is today the day you decide to tell me what keeps you so occupied on that screen instead of paying attention to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally, fully focuses on Rio and her breath hitches a bit at the sight of her leaning back against the chair so casually like there’s nowhere she’d rather be than right here, pissing Agatha off with her incessant questioning—except it doesn’t really piss her off that much. In fact, she’s kind of charmed by how persistent Rio is, and genuinely asks, “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The flicker of a real smile crosses Rio’s face before it settles back into the fucking smirk again, and Agatha mentally berates herself for the split second she found this woman charming. Agatha actually hates her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just don’t understand why you’re so determined to keep it a secret. The entire world will know by the time it comes out anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Using her irritation as fuel to turn back to the work she—desperately—needs to be doing instead of whatever it is this conversation has become, she throws out a careless statement she immediately regrets. “I still haven’t decided if it will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Because now Rio looks delighted, pitching forward to rest her arms on the table as she smiles. “Is it a memoir of your deepest, darkest secrets or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs, types one word, then two—
     <em>
      “down the”
     </em>
     —and adamantly ignores the way she can feel Rio watching her. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god. It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what if it was?” She doesn’t look up, just keeps looking at her screen and hoping Rio will drop it even though she knows Rio certainly won’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then I’d stop asking you to let me read it—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wish I’d known that sooner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “—and I’d start
     <em>
      begging
     </em>
     you to let me read it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looks up sharply, surprised to see the way Rio’s gaze darkens with equal parts glee and what looks like pure fucking
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     . It rolls right through Agatha and she can feel her cheeks traitorously flushing, but she will be damned if she lets Rio know the effect her words have. It takes every ounce of self-preservation she has to muster words, let alone a fucking
     <em>
      thought
     </em>
     , that will reassert her control over the situation. “Then I’d say begging is very unbecoming of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How would you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s doing that thing again, where she pokes the inside of her cheek with her tongue and it drives Agatha fucking wild with something she still doesn’t want to name—but then her words register. “
     <em>
      What
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve never seen me beg, so how would you know if it looks good on me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brain short circuits because what the
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     . She is losing her grip on this conversation dangerously fast and the only thing she can think of is to match Rio’s game with her own, actually quite proud of the way her words come out sure and smooth. “Is that an offer?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want it to be?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about you stop answering my questions with more questions?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why won’t you let me read what you’re working on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The reminder of her manuscript abruptly shuts down whatever had been building and Agatha counts her lucky fucking stars for it. She slams her laptop shut and makes a show of throwing on her coat with a slight flourish, purposefully bumping Rio’s shoulder as she walks past. “See you later, Vidal. Some of us have
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     work to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And if her legs wobble as she steps out of the cafe, and her hands clench into fists so tight her knuckles turn white—well, no one is around to notice, are they? Just Agatha, the autumn air tangling in her hair as she flags down a taxi and forces herself to forget exactly why Rio has this affect on her. She doesn’t owe that woman anything, so why does it feel like she’s denying Rio something? Why does Agatha feel so unmoored by her? She’s risky, and she’s distracting, two things Agatha cannot afford, so she rolls her shoulders back and forces it deep, deep down until she can barely remember what got her so worked up in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s not fine when she sees Jen’s name flash across her phone screen later that night. Begrudgingly, she quickly saves her progress and answers the phone only because she knows Jen will call and call and call until she finally answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s the new book?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did Lilia put you up to this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Believe it or not, Agatha, but as your agent, I’m legally required to care how your work is coming along.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums, her lips curling into a cruel smile even though Jen can’t see it. “Did someone put a gun to your head?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia is actually holding it right now. Want to say hi?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go to hell.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not if you get there first,” and she’s vaguely aware how childish this conversation sounds, but there’s always been something about her and Jen that only brings out the—albeit quite successful—worst in each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Send me your latest chapters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pauses, a quick war going on inside her head before she realizes she can only relent. “
     <em>
      Fine
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     Rio is there first when Agatha strolls into the cafe the next morning. After a long look in the mirror while getting ready she feels in control enough to risk going back, but the sight of Rio sitting at their usual table with clenched fists has her back tensing, a low twisting in her gut as she approaches. She really should have stayed home.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do real work,” Rio says when Agatha sits down, like she’s been waiting hours to say it. At Agatha’s questioning glace she explains, “When you left last time, you said ‘some of us have real work to do.’ My work is real.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs a shoulder. “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     ,” Rio’s voice taking on more of an edge, like sharp steel against Agatha’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     A slight laugh escapes her. “Why are you getting so defensive?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bristles, “Because you think writing within the confines of a vague, yet somehow restrictive genre like literary fiction somehow makes you better than me.” She narrows her eyes at Agatha. “Fantasy may not be your cup of tea and that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean it has less merit simply because you don’t like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hardly think stories about magic and dragons have anywhere near the same literary value of those from authors such as Woolf or Wharton—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice alliteration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “—or Didion or Ferrante. You really think fantasy has a ball in their court?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bad analogy, and I’d like to think so.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crosses her arms and Agatha can’t tell if the fight is flaring up or dying down, but she pushes anyway because she doesn’t know what else to do. She’s not good at diffusing situations—if anything, she’s usually the one causing them—and she really doesn’t like how off kilter this conversation is becoming. “Thinking doesn’t make it true, sweetheart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you think your work is up to par?” Rio shifts, her voice lowering until it’s almost a growl, “You have fucking writer’s block, but you’re too scared to call it what it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s spot on, hits too close to home, and Agatha hates that Rio can see her so clearly, that she has said aloud what Agatha has been trying to run from for months. The indignation comes like a tidal wave and she practically hisses, “Imagining a different world where the rules bend to your whim as an author is so much easier than trying to write a story within the rules of this world and making it seem plausible.
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     make things fucking plausible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “World building is a real skill.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The world is
     <em>
      already
     </em>
     built.” Agatha waves her hand around the table dramatically. “Look around you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m looking, believe me.” Her mouth twists into a smirk but it’s deadly this time, all the usual traces of amusement missing as she continues, “I watch you, Agatha. Just as closely as you watch everyone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s a dare, she knows it is—but Agatha’s nothing if not masochistic—so she dares Rio right back. “And what is it you see?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lonely, vicious woman,” Rio says, leaning forward until she can whisper the final blow, “clawing at the world around her and hoping that’s enough to call it love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s vision goes hazy for approximately one second before her face tightens with fury and indignation. “Fuck you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabs her bag off the back of her chair, grateful she never took her coat off because she needs to get the fuck out of here as fast as possible before Rio sees the hot tears beginning to well in her eyes. A hand reaches out to wrap surprisingly gentle fingers around her wrist and it takes everything Agatha has not to look down, to not let Rio see just how true her words are.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I didn’t—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tugs her wrist back, flexing her hand as if it will rid her of the lingering touch on her skin. “You made your point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She amazes herself, really, when she manages to make it all the way back to her apartment before she finally,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     lets her head fall and the tears flow. Tomorrow she will pick herself back up because it is the only thing she knows how to do, but for today she will let herself feel the only thing she’s ever known to be: forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It takes her six days before she feels up for going back to the coffee shop. She surprisingly got a good amount of work done all by her lonesome, even if it was more just edits than writing, but she desperately needs to leave her apartment and a small, traitorous part of her
     <em>
      wants
     </em>
     to go back; despite the company, it’s a good place to sit for hours on end and lose herself in a word document that needs filling (and if working alongside Rio is the best motivation she’s had in years, if the sound of the other woman’s fingers on a keyboard fires Agatha up in a way she’s never known, that’s nobody’s business but her own).
    </p>
    <p>
     She knows she probably shouldn’t go back, that Rio had crossed a line, but didn’t she also cross a line? They had both said hurtful things and no matter how much Agatha wants to fuck off and leave Rio far behind her, to go back to the way things were before they met at the gala and Rio slowly started unraveling Agatha’s carefully constructed life, she also knows there is no going back. She just knows, somehow, that she will always want to know what Rio says next—even if it hits Agatha in a tender spot she thought had long scarred over. It is what pushes her all the way downtown, stopping in line to order first as she instinctually glances over to their table and sees Rio working like nothing ever happened at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She approaches their table and drops into her seat, pausing at the plate in front of her. Confused, she asks, “What’s this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stops typing, looking at Agatha with sheepish hesitation. “An apology croissant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is at least chocolate?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh, I… I wasn’t sure what you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reaches a hand across the table to place on Rio’s arm, expression somber in a completely unserious way. “I’m fucking with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She moves her hand away but her eyes stay locked on Rio’s, and there’s something obviously flickering in them besides the faint amusement, and Agatha cannot put a name to what exactly it is. Seconds go by without either breaking the stare and she feels hot, fighting the urge to pull at the collar of her sweater. She’s finally saved when the barista calls out her name and she quickly stands to grab it. Latte in hand, she walks back to the table and carefully places a plate directly on Rio’s laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles for what feels like the first time. “An apology croissant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A pause. “Is it chocolate?”And thank
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     , Rio’s smirk is finally back where it belongs, stretching across one half of her face as Agatha lets out a small chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t push your luck, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     By some unspoken understanding, they both let the matter lie, Agatha pulling out her laptop to position right across from Rio’s as the minutes tick by and both get lost in their words. Agatha eventually finds a good rhythm and thinks maybe she will actually be able to hand over her next round of chapters to Lilia without immediately wanting to off herself. The first few were torture, between Agatha’s inability to string two sentences together, Lilia and her red pen vibrating with eagerness to slice through Agatha’s latest efforts, and Billy’s near constant emails asking (
     <em>
      “On behalf of Lilia!”
     </em>
     ) when the next section will be done.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it’s been easier lately, and why it’s been easier is not as much of a mystery as Agatha would like it to be, but she figures as long as she doesn’t think about it then it’s almost like it’s not true. Almost.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have a New Year’s resolution for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t look up from her screen, just keeps typing as she throws out, “I don’t believe in those.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tents her screen, peering intently at Agatha. “Read at least one fantasy book.” Agatha makes a noise of protest, but before she can say anything Rio cuts her off, “I even have the perfect one in mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me guess, one
     <em>
      Lady Death
     </em>
     by Rio Vidal?” Agatha, straight-faced and unimpressed, does her best to silently communicate to Rio exactly what she thinks of that idea—then Rio does that stupid thing with her tongue and cheek and it nearly, nearly makes Agatha break, but she imagines sitting down with a five hundred page novel about witches and warlocks and succinctly shakes her head. “Hard pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The smile doesn’t fade from Rio’s face, even with Agatha’s reticence, and it’s not until a minute later when she’s already working again that she gets the last word: “We’ll see about that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that night, Agatha treats herself to a glass of wine in reward for being a good person. Sure, all she bought was a croissant and didn’t even say the words
     <em>
      I’m sorry
     </em>
     , but it’s all semantics anyway. She sits down on the couch, a long sigh leaving her, when her phone buzzes on the coffee table. Without even looking, she knows exactly who it is, knows there is only one person who would risk texting her past nine in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     She considers ignoring it, but she also knows that Rio won’t let it go, that it would be the first thing she says when Agatha sits down at their table tomorrow morning. If she tries hard enough, Agatha can just about hear the teasing inflection in Rio’s voice, so in all efforts to avoid it she picks up her phone against her better judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      have i ever told you
     </em>
     all along
     <em>
      is the book that made me want to be a writer?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not exactly what Agatha expected, but she still knows exactly why Rio said it, and she allows the affront of this false praise to spur her response:
     <em>
      Figures, but
     </em>
     <em>
      flattery will get you nowhere.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s response is immediate:
     <em>
      it’s not flattery if it’s the truth!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of her wants to believe Rio, wants to accept the idea that her own work was so rich she inspired Rio to pick up a pen and become one of the hottest new authors on the market. Hot as in, the next big thing, not hot as in attractive. Not that she doesn’t think Rio isn’t attractive, she just meant—jesus, now she’s trying to justify her own thoughts to herself and she really must be going fucking crazy.
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     is making her crazy. Something about this impossible woman makes Agatha feel like every corner of her life is fraying at the edges; just one small tug on the right thread and she will completely fucking unravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha keeps it simple, tries to convey through as few words as possible that Rio needs to know her place and stay there:
     <em>
      Not a fucking chance.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She treads carefully the next few days, merely waiting for Rio to once again ask for a look at her manuscript, but Rio doesn’t ask. At all. It’s quite eerie the way their conversations border on polite and professional, no teasing or deeply infuriating flirting to be found. Agatha almost admits to herself that she misses it, but that would be admitting she liked it in the first place—which she absolutely does not. If anything, she’s grateful Rio has finally taken the very obvious hint, but this… more refined version of Rio is not…
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     . And she doesn’t like that. This whole arrangement, or whatever else one could call it, only works if Rio is annoying her, which fuels Agatha’s ability to focus more closely on her work than whatever new pickup line Rio has decided to try out in effort of reading her latest writing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what Agatha really doesn’t fucking like is the lights turned off and the door locked at the coffee shop when she arrives one Tuesday morning, a quickly printed sign taped to the door. She’s reading it for the fifth time when Rio approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      We Are Closed Dealing With Burst Pipes!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Should Be Open In A Few Days!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sorry For The Inconvenience!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “A fucking pipe burst?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m more concerned about their lack of grammar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha throws her arms out, exasperation evident as she exclaims, “Where the fuck are we supposed to go now? I finally found a good synonym for ‘turbulent’ on my way here and if I don’t write it down in the next twenty minutes I’m going to forget it forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio does her tongue-in-cheek thing—not that Agatha really notices—and thoughtfully looks around. “Where do you live?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “82nd and West End, why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows raise, letting out a low whistle. “Woo-boy. You’re
     <em>
      rich
     </em>
     rich. How much are you getting in advances these days?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there a reason you wanted to know, or are you just planning on stalking me? I love my fans but even that’s a bit too—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolls her eyes. “Shut up.” Then she grabs Agatha by the arm, leading them away from the cafe. Agatha halfheartedly tries to yank her arm back, but Rio’s grip is firm and something about it sends a frisson through her so strong that she most decidedly will not be examining how and why.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m closer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries not to sound like a snob when she says it, but it still comes out haughty when she asks, “We’re going to your apartment?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stops them in the middle of the sidewalk, facing Agatha with a slight glare. “I happen to have a lovely office big enough for two. Even a spacious living room, if you’d prefer.” Rio drops her arm but starts walking again, leaving Agatha to catch up as she throws over her shoulder, “We can work there until they fix their pipes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you bring me somewhere hellish like the East Village, I’ll break
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     fucking pipes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t threaten me with a good time.” And Rio actually
     <em>
      winks
     </em>
     at her, and there’s all that flirty nonchalance that’s been absent for the past few days. “But no, I’m happy to say we’re going somewhere worse.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stops, glaring at the back of Rio’s head as she waits for her to turn around, a pleading note in her voice. “
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walks backwards as she smiles proudly. “Oh yeah, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does her best to ignore the way Rio’s words run right through her, settling somewhere low in her stomach, opting to keep following Rio because she’s not sure any words that come out of her mouth won’t tremble under the weight of everything she tries to leave unfelt and unsaid when they’re together.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not until they get to the subway station that will supposedly take them to Rio’s apartment that Agatha finally breaks. This is a step too far, a fate worse than death; the only thing worse would be if Rio’s apartment were above the McDonald’s in Times Square.
    </p>
    <p>
     She clenches her teeth, a last feeble attempt fitting through the cracks: “I am not going to fucking Hell’s Kitchen.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She ended up in Hell’s Kitchen anyway, much to her dismay, but she’d be lying if she said Rio’s one bedroom did not (slightly) impress her. It was full of natural light, filtering through the curtains, and cozy in a way Agatha didn’t expect. There were plants absolutely everywhere—Agatha barely survived the quick crash course Rio gave her on the necessity of creating a living, breathing haven in the middle of a grid locked city—but it was… nice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had opted for working in the living room, the idea of being shut up in Rio’s office too unbearable. Forced into such close quarters with the woman she is actively trying not to think too much about even as her body betrays her would be the final straw, and the living room was barely better as it was. There were none of the usual sounds that accompany their hours spent working, no espresso machines whirring and sirens blaring from outside. It was just her and Rio, the quiet creak of floorboards and the soft jazz Rio played through a speaker hidden somewhere behind a bird of paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt
     <em>
      dangerous
     </em>
     , like teetering on a precipice Agatha absolutely could not fall from.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s the third day of the cafe’s unexpected closing and Agatha standing on Rio’s doorstep, and god she really fucking hates this city and all its inconvenient quirks sometimes. She’s not sure how much longer she can keep doing this, can keep pretending like her and Rio alone in the same room doesn’t come with an unexplainable tension that colors their every interaction. She hates it, hates that Rio can make her feel this way with all her unsubtle flirting and baiting remarks. Agatha’s so used to being in control of herself and everything about Rio makes her feel unstable, which is the last thing she needs as her final deadline with Lilia is fast approaching. She needs to
     <em>
      work
     </em>
     , not engage in whatever this game is with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she should really do is leave this doorway and never come back, but she’s always known what’s good for her and done the opposite anyway, which is why she crosses Rio’s threshold once the door opens and deposits her bag next to the couch. Rio comes out of the kitchen a few minutes later holding a mug of what is (annoyingly) a very good coffee, setting it in front of Agatha on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hasn’t even taken her first sip before Rio starts in again. “So if you won’t let me read it, will you at least
     <em>
      tell
     </em>
     me what it’s about? I’d quid pro quo, but you didn’t read my first book.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do you want to know so badly?” Agatha avoids eye contact and brings her computer out, setting it on her lap and pulling up the document she needs to have completed by the first day of November or Lilia will actually kill her. (She’d probably make Billy bury Agatha’s body, which is somehow a worse thought.)
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it enough to say I like your writing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks that’s the end of the conversation, especially when Rio doesn’t respond right away, but she can feel the other woman’s eyes on her and curiosity gets the best of her. She looks up and meets the unwavering gaze, watches as Rio sits down in the chair across from her perch on the couch with a look on her face Agatha has never seen before. It’s softly inquisitive, her eyes roaming over Agatha’s face like she’s looking for the answer to a question Agatha isn’t sure she asked. It’s disarming, this look, and it makes Agatha want to melt into the couch cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whenever I catch you working—actually working, not just looking up the definition of ‘perspicacious’ for the third time because you can never remember—you furrow your brows a bit” Rio leans forward, reaching across and invading Agatha’s space as she lets her fingers linger a few inches from Agatha’s forehead. “Right there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moves her hand away but stays close, and this might be the closest they’ve ever been to each other. It sets Agatha’s skin on fire, every nerve ending suddenly hyper aware of their proximity and it almost hurts how much she
     <em>
      wants
     </em>
     Rio to brush her fingertips over where they had just lingered—but then Agatha might actually die so she resorts to deflecting, tries to get this conversation back to neutral territory even as the taunting note in her voice sounds weak to her own ears. “If I’d known you watch me so closely I would have put on more of a show.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It doesn’t deter Rio though, and she just keeps looking at Agatha with that same inscrutable expression on her face as she slowly picks apart Agatha with nothing but her eyes and her words. “When you’re not happy with something, you purse your lips—yeah, just like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A faint smile crosses Rio’s face as Agatha makes a conscious effort to school her face into impassivity, shocked by the way this conversation has drifted to something so precariously intimate. “I must purse them a lot then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do, yes.” Rio leans back a little, giving Agatha more room as she takes what feels like her first breath in minutes, filling up her lungs with more oxygen than she needs so she doesn’t scream instead. “But sometimes when you’ve written something good,” Rio continues, “and not something you just
     <em>
      think
     </em>
     is good but something you know is
     <em>
      objectively
     </em>
     good, you get this little smirk on your face like you can’t wait for the world to read whatever it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And all of a sudden, it feels like the oxygen is sucked out of the room completely. She can’t describe the way Rio is looking at her, only knows how it feels—enormous, fierce, hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has never really allowed herself to focus too closely on Rio’s face, afraid of what might happen if she does, but she looks now; the warmth of Rio’s eyes as they continue to watch her, the slope of her nose and the bow of her lips—it all connects in a maddeningly beautiful way.
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     is beautiful, and Agatha is just now allowing herself to realize it. Seconds tick by as her lips part around something unspoken, the words needed to break this moment before it stretches into a future she’s not sure she can handle refusing to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
     By some grace, a miracle in its own right, Agatha manages to force out, “Only sometimes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans back against the chair fully, crossing her legs. “I think whatever you’re working on right now scares you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is drawn towards a small movement in her peripheral, watches closely as Rio stretches her hands like she’s trying to shake something off; the tendons flex beneath her skin and Agatha is memorized by the sight until Rio’s words settle more firmly inside her mind. “What could possibly be so scary to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the hands she still hasn’t looked away from points at her, “Being vulnerable. Which tends to be required for most memoirs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snaps back into herself at the words, almost like a weight lifts off her shoulders and sets itself as a wall between her and Rio instead. “I never said it was a memoir.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Three simple words but the way Rio says them makes it sound like she’s already seen right through Agatha, all the way down into the deepest parts of her she doesn’t let anyone else know exists. Agatha has built a career, a
     <em>
      life
     </em>
     , on the ability to make others perceive exactly what she wants them to—but here Rio is, crumbling it all with one simple question.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s more than just this question though; it’s Rio asking if Agatha is going to continue pretending like they aren’t circling each other around a cliff’s edge they both know is inevitable. But Agatha cannot,
     <em>
      will
     </em>
     not, and the only way she knows how to steer Rio away from the intimacy of this conversation—this
     <em>
      perception
     </em>
     —is with the cold, hard truth: “It’s about my mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s satisfied as she watches Rio’s eyebrows raise a little in surprise, the way her lips twitch in such a pretty, pretty way—
    </p>
    <p>
     “What made you want to write it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally looks away, feels brave enough to break their eye contact as she casually throws some of her hair over her shoulder in an effort to gain the control she has very nearly lost, though she’s not sure she ever had it to begin with after stepping foot back inside Rio’s apartment. Part of her thinks she might have given it up willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She died earlier this year,” and it’s clipped, succinct, subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit,” Rio says, leaning forward again to rest her arms on her knees. “I’m sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not,” Agatha laughs and there’s not mirth in it. “She wasn’t a kind woman. Especially to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice is steady, her guard finally strong again, and the truth feels less revealing this way. She is
     <em>
      choosing
     </em>
     to let Rio know, and for some reason, it’s different from Rio finding out on her own. The agency is the key, though she’s still unsure why she’s let Rio know at all; something about this woman makes Agatha want to tell her everything, words she’s never allowed herself to speak aloud—and it’s not just the persistence or the genuine interest on Rio’s part, it’s something else Agatha has yet to put a name to.
    </p>
    <p>
     So focused on her inner musings she almost doesn’t catch the softening of Rio’s eyes as the familiarity between them descends again, the amity making Agatha’s shoulders tense as Rio once again pushes right past what Agatha has spent so long trying to construct. She knows, on an unconscious level she didn’t know existed, that whatever Rio says next will likely push her over the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not sorry she’s dead, Agatha,” Rio says, not reacting to the slight gulp Agatha knows she can see, just watches her words settle in the scant space between them now. “I’m sorry she did whatever it was that made you so…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio trails off in an uncharacteristically timid way, but Agatha needs to know the rest of that sentence, needs to know what exactly Rio sees sitting across from her. “So what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Closed off from the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not said with malice or judgement, just a plain statement that screams. She knows Rio is telling her she wants to discover whatever it is Agatha’s hiding, all those messy parts of her she buries under tailored clothes and biting words.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air thickens and Agatha sways forward, part of her wanting to let Rio know, to let Rio in, but it’s too much; they barely know each other and Agatha doesn’t know why she’s in this moment or in this apartment and it’s
     <em>
      too much, too much
     </em>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why fantasy?” The moment breaks, Agatha’s words like cold water down their backs. “You’ve made your point on why fantasy is a valid literary genre—which I’m still not sold on, by the way,” and her voice gets braver with each word, the shakiness minutely flitting away as she barrels on, “but you’ve never said why you write it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gives her the grace to follow the new avenue, to walk down a different road. Maybe she can sense that Agatha is three seconds away from running out the door. Either way, she lets Agatha ask the question and she lets Agatha know her answer. “To me, fantasy isn’t just about white knights on their steads whimsically fighting off their foes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice alliteration.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honestly, I think that kind of fantasy is overwrought and bland. The kind of fantasy I like to read, the kind I like to
     <em>
      write
     </em>
     —it’s more than that. It’s about escaping the horror and banality of this reality and going to one where the problems are just as real, but goodness can actually prevail for once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what is it you’re trying to escape from?” It comes out softer than Agatha intended, but she’s more surprised by the realization she actually wants to know Rio’s response; she wants to know what has led her into this very situation, sitting with Agatha as they admit quiet things to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is the one to look away for once, her face contorting into something Agatha can only describe as reluctant heartache. “I didn’t have the easiest childhood. My parents died when I was really young and I don’t really have any other family, so I bounced around the foster system until I finally aged out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio…”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s second-hand but the pain Agatha feels at Rio’s confession hurts all the same, understands that Rio is choosing to play it off in a way similar to Agatha in order to not let the gravity of it all weigh her down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then it hits her—this is the first time she’s ever said Rio’s name out loud, and it tastes so sweet on her tongue. Agatha knows if she’s not careful it will become an addiction, that Rio will never truly leave her now that Agatha knows what it’s like to wrap her lips around the syllables of her name. She knows Rio registers it too, but has the grace (that Agatha has never had, no matter how much she has tried to obtain it) to glide over it and keep talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay. Most of the homes weren’t bad, but some were… not great. Writing was the only real thing I had, the one thing no one could take away from me. And I didn’t want to write another sob story about a kid who got dealt a shit hand. I wanted to write something people could read when they needed to be anywhere other than where they were.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods, understands the desire for a different ending. Rio does not seem as finicky with her vulnerability as Agatha is with her own, but she also knows that doesn’t make it any easier to display the parts of you that are secret. “Thank you.” At Rio’s questioning gaze she continues, “You know, for telling me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiles softly, like she knows exactly what Agatha isn’t saying out loud. “Thank you for caring.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t go that far.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A few seconds of silence, both of them locked in amber, then Rio chuckles in a way that’s more like breathing than laughing and Agatha exhales, her own slight laugh falling out with it. Their silence is lighter now, and she watches the way Rio hangs her head, slowing shaking it from side to side with a smile on her face. When she looks back up though,
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     , there is an extra sparkle in her brown eyes Agatha has never seen before, golden and inviting. It makes her want to reach out, trace the lines of fond amusement along Rio’s edges, and find out what else is lying in wait for Agatha to discover—and for some reason, this urge is scarier than their confessions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s throat constricts, her instincts flaring as she hastily stands up, barely catching her laptop before it crashes to the floor.
     <em>
      She’s
     </em>
     about to crash, will need to fling herself out a window if she doesn’t get out of this room within the minute and leave behind whatever the hell just happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     She throws on her coat as Rio looks on, confused, and Agatha’s brain scrambles to come up with an excuse. “I just remembered I have an appointment with my, um, my gynecologist? Probably wants me to work on some exercises or something, so I really must be going now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s practically running towards the door when Rio exclaims, “Tell her to at least wine and dine you before she sticks her fingers—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Goodbye
     </em>
     ,” and she flings the door open, briefly glimpses Rio leaning back into her chair with an arm casually thrown across the back like she isn’t affected by any of this, so unlike Agatha who has to stop herself from slamming Rio’s front door hard enough to splinter the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     She barely takes one step before Rio calls out, her voice muffled behind the door, but the words loud and clear:
     <em>
      te veo.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She waits a whole day before seeing Rio again, and at this point she’s brave enough to admit that’s what she’s been doing the past few weeks: not going to work on her book, but going to see
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     . She checked the cafe’s website and sees they’re open again, but now that she’s been inside Rio’s home Agatha feels an inexplicable craving to go back again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio at least gave her a whole day to herself, not a text to be found on Agatha’s phone, probably because she sensed Agatha would need a little time to herself after their conversation. Agatha would be lying if she said it wasn’t true, or that she wasn’t grateful, but twenty-four hours by herself did nothing to ease the conflict that’s been warring inside her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, some fucking way, she has discovered she actually likes Rio. She doesn’t
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     -like her of course—god, what is she, twelve?—but Agatha can’t deny she enjoys the woman’s company, a thought so abnormal and nerve-wracking that she stared at a wall for forty-five minutes yesterday. She’s not really sure how they got here, could barely stand the sight of Rio a mere month ago, but this is where she is regardless, and it’s been a long time since anyone has made her feel half as exhilarated as Rio does. Working alongside her, both of them knee-deep in a passion that has yet to reach the world, fills Agatha with a determination she thought lost. Rio has made her fall in love with writing again; Rio makes her want to finish writing this fucking memoir taking up space on her hard drive, and she’d be an idiot not to reap it for all that it’s worth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is how she winds up at Rio’s door, again, two cups of coffee in hand. She presses the doorbell with her elbow and waits for the telltale sign of footsteps, but it takes another two buzzes before she finally hears them. The door opens and Agatha’s eyes drop down towards the miles of bare legs Rio’s sleep shorts leave on display.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pauses, clearing her throat against its sudden dryness as Rio blearily rubs a hand over her face. “Agatha? What are you doing here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully the words come quickly and she shrugs. “Figured we’d skip the cafe all together and just set up shop here. Their espresso was shit anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hits her with a blank stare, eyes briefly flickering down to the coffee in Agatha’s hands and back up. “You’re literally holding two of their coffees.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And it is
     <em>
      eight
     </em>
     in the fucking morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s a notable petulance to Rio’s tone, and it’s amusing really, but Agatha just pouts her lips and takes a step as if to turn around. “Problem, Vidal? Should I leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no.” Rio reaches out like she wants to physically stop Agatha, but it drops before she can. She opens the door wider, “I’ll just be a minute. Make yourself at home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is exactly what Agatha does after setting their coffees on the table and settling in to the armchair next to the couch. She’s already three paragraphs in by the time Rio reemerges from her bedroom looking more awake and put together, and she splays herself out on the couch in a way that has Agatha quickly focusing back on her work. Rio turns on the speaker like she usually does, a random movie soundtrack playing, as she settles more comfortably into the cushions facing Agatha and cracks open her computer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not until an hour later, not a word spoken between them, that Agatha notices there is a distinct lack of keyboard sounds coming from Rio’s general vicinity. She risks a glance over and her stomach lurches at the adorable furrow of Rio’s eyebrows as she stares at her screen. Except it’s not adorable—Agatha finds nothing about Rio
     <em>
      adorable
     </em>
     —because it grates on Agatha. This dynamic only works if both of them are furiously typing away, but here Rio is, looking like she never even learned to read.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words come out less irritable than she intended, the levity lacing her tone sickening to her own ears. “Hard at work or hardly working?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighs, flopping her head back against the arm of the couch. “This latest round of edits from Alice is really kicking my ass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you all you wanted was a little ass-kicking, you should have called me”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks that’s the end of it—Rio is a big girl, she can get herself out of a little slump—but a minute later Rio points a finger in her direction. “Ha,” but there’s no derision behind it, “pursed lips. You’re just as stuck as I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t look up, just keeps staring at the cursor blinking on her screen and cursing the way Rio is so attuned to her mannerisms. “Is that your way of telling me I’m getting wrinkles?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re basically the same age, so if you’re already getting wrinkles it is bad news for me too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She does look up then, confused. “Aren’t you like, thirty or something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face morphs into something like incredulity. “Agatha, I’m forty fucking one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth drops open in surprise, genuinely stunned by the revelation. “No shit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, shakes her head, and sits up. “Why don’t you tell me what’s bothering you and I can try to help?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What makes you think I want your help?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shall I call Lilia? Or better yet,
     <em>
      Jen
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it’s funny you’re afraid of them,” and Rio has the balls to smile at her like she doesn’t know exactly what she’s doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can’t deny it, knows she is the tiniest fucking bit afraid of both women because they have hold Agatha’s career in their hands—but Rio pointing it out so flippantly makes her shoulders tense. “You ever say that out loud again and I will strangle you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t say it unless you mean it, Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She ignores the comment so Rio knows it’s beneath her, just sighs deeply as she stands up and seats herself next to Rio on the couch. Agatha angles her laptop towards Rio and raises an eyebrow, waiting for her to get the hint. A full fifteen seconds pass before Rio slowly reaches over and takes the laptop from her, another ten before she tears her eyes away from Agatha to read what’s on the screen. It’s not a terribly revealing section and she knows Rio will spot the issue without her pointing it out, so she just sits back and watches as Rio’s eyes track across the page. At one point she bites her lip and Agatha nearly gasps at the sight, tries to swallow it under a cough and shifts back so she can’t see Rio’s face so clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
     After re-reading it for a third time, Rio hesitantly places her fingers on the trackpad and highlights a sentence, cutting and pasting it another page down. She looks back at Agatha, questioning, and Agatha leans forward to inspect the change. Remarkably, it fixed the whole issue and now the paragraphs flow much better, gratitude quickly replacing her brief flash of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh.” She looks back at Rio, impressed, voice plain. “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, can you say that again?” Rio grabs her phone off the side table, quickly pointing it at Agatha. “I wasn’t recording.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you,” but there’s no malice, just pure delight at Rio’s stupid way of always saying the right thing to make her laugh. Rio leans back against the couch, settling next to Agatha as she turns her head to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turns, meeting Rio’s eyes. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s really good,” and it’s so soft, the way Rio says it. Like she means it, like Agatha truly is a force to be reckoned with, is worth every hype and praise that’s ever been thrown her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     It lights her up and Agatha feels that familiar lurch in her stomach whenever she stares at Rio for too long, and the tension from the other day plummets itself right back into this moment. It would be so easy to give in, to just lean forward and do the thing Agatha has been trying to avoid for weeks. She can see the way Rio feels it too, the hard line of her jaw clenching as she grinds her teeth together. It’s too much, again, but Agatha’s fight or flight isn’t kicking in and she doesn’t know what to do without it—that urge to run—so she does the only other thing her body is screaming for, is so tired of fighting against it, and leans forward to brush her lips over Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s a pause and Rio stiffens slightly, but just as Agatha moves to pull back she feels Rio’s lips slide over hers more keenly, intently, and Agatha sighs against her. The kiss is gentle at first, tender movements as they learn the outlines of each other’s mouths, but soon enough she feels Rio’s tongue dart out to swipe across her top lip and she opens up for her, and then they are devouring, the hot press of their lips hungry and insatiable as Agatha winds her arms around Rio’s shoulders and she feels Rio’s hands climb tortuously up her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is both too much and not enough, and she suddenly needs Rio closer, closer—so Agatha grabs the back of her neck and swings a leg over Rio, settling firmly on her lap. The position changes the angle of their kiss and it’s deeper, filthier, and Agatha can feel her cheeks flame at the whimper that escapes her. Rio’s hands are everywhere—gripping her hips, smoothing over her stomach, resting lightly against Agatha’s throat. She fumbles with the hem of Rio’s sweater, sliding her hands underneath to feel the expanse of skin she has been denying herself, rakes her fingernails down and relishes Rio’s responding tremble. Finally she lifts it over Rio’s head, taking a second to look, and she needs,
     <em>
      needs
     </em>
     to put her mouth everywhere, needs to mark Rio up with a possessiveness Agatha didn’t know she contained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Belatedly, she realizes Rio has started unbuttoning her shirt, fingers quick and sure as she slowly reveals more and more. At her slack-jawed look once black lace is on display, Agatha feels powerful and she can’t do anything but grab Rio’s face and kiss her, licking into her mouth until she hears Rio moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers move down, fumbling with the button of Rio’s jeans until she feels a hand stop her. When she looks up, questioning, Rio loosens her grip but doesn’t pull back. “Should we be doing this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leans back, trying her best to ignore the flush across Rio’s chest that is slowly creeping up her neck, and moves her hand away. “Do you want to stop?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks at her for a second and Agatha can see the way her pupils dilate, how her eyes darken as determination takes root. “
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     , god.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And they’re kissing again, all tongue and teeth as they desperately try to rid each other of their pants, Agatha’s shirt still hanging loosely from her shoulders as she stands both of them up to shove clothing down and over their hips. Then she’s pushing Rio back and climbing over her, so eager for more,
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     that she forgot about their underwear, but it’s fine because Rio is running her fingers over the damp spot on her underwear and nothing so simple has ever felt this good before. She can’t believe she’s gone her entire life without knowing how it feels to have Rio sliding her underwear to the side and pulling lightly on her hair, mouthing down her neck in a way that is sure to leave marks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulls back a bit. “Agatha, look at me.” Another tug on her hair and Agatha finally blinks her eyes open to focus on Rio, trying to see through the haze of lust that has settled so steadfastly over her body. Rio’s mouth is set in a hard line and Agatha can see the way her desire fights against whatever it is she wants to say. “There’s no going back after this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She just kisses Rio again, moving her mouth over her jaw and down until she’s nipping at collar bones. “What if I don’t want to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another tug and their faces are level again. “I can’t have you like this, for me, just once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Something about it lights a fire in Agatha, a potent longing so deeply buried that she can only nod, trying to assure Rio as much as she can without words because anything she says right now would come out as a tremor. She nods again, trails her hands from Rio’s neck all the way down to her hips, snapping the elastic of her underwear. Agatha needs to taste her,
     <em>
      right now
     </em>
     , so she slides to the floor in between Rio’s legs and pulls her forward by her thighs. The scent is overwhelming and heady and her mouth waters—she might actually die from this—and wastes no more time; Agatha bites down into the flesh of Rio’s thigh as she pulls her underwear to the side, too keyed up to wait until they’re off, and licks right up until she can suck Rio’s clit into her mouth. The moan it elicits has Agatha rubbing her thighs together, a moan of her own vibrating right into Rio’s cunt as she runs her tongue up and down everywhere it can reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     She starts slow, tries to figure out what makes Rio twitch and what makes her dig her fingers into Agatha’s hair, and soon enough she is sliding two fingers inside and running her other hand over Rio’s stomach and holding her hips down, feeling the way Rio’s body shakes with the anticipation of release.
     <em>
      Fuck, oh my god, yes, right there, please don’t fucking move
     </em>
     —and Agatha could stay here forever, bracketed by Rio’s thighs squeezing her head and knuckle deep in tight heat, her fingers pressing on that spot inside Rio that makes both of them groan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The orgasm takes them both by surprise a bit, might actually be a new record for Agatha, and the way Rio says her name on a broken moan is almost enough to make her come on the spot. The sight of Rio like this—head thrown back against the couch, hair mussed from Agatha’s hands, lips swollen from Agatha’s mouth, Agatha’s name on repeat like a prayer—it worries her just how much she likes this, how easily she could get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the thought latches on too much, Rio grabs her and tears her underwear away, pulling Agatha back into her lap, knees spread and dripping. Rio teases for a second and Agatha digs her fingernails into Rio’s shoulder blades in response, but then finally,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     Rio is touching her and, “Oh,
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grips the couch behind Rio’s head, white-knuckled, and presses their lips together, letting Rio taste herself on Agatha’s mouth. A whimper fills the air and Agatha’s not sure which one of them it was, but it doesn’t even fucking matter because Rio has three fingers inside of her and it feels so fucking
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One hand moves back to Rio’s neck and she uses her leverage to grind down against Rio’s fingers, throwing her head back and arching as tendrils of pleasure spiral out from her center. Rio’s fingers move faster—
     <em>
      oh, shit, yes, just like that
     </em>
     —and then Agatha feels a thumb brush over her clit—once, twice, three times—and her orgasm is ripping through her, nothing but white heat behind her eyes as she buries her face in the space where Rio’s shoulder meets her neck and bites down, afraid of how Rio’s name will taste in her mouth as she comes, bucking her hips until she’s too sensitive and she gingerly pulls Rio’s hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stay like that, Agatha in Rio’s lap as their breathing slows, and wrap their arms around each other. Agatha can smell the sweet scent of Rio’s sweat on her skin, can’t stop herself from burrowing deeper into the embrace and realizing she is thoroughly and utterly
     <em>
      fucked.
     </em>

     They fuck their way through half of November, and Agatha’s lost count of how many orgasms she’s had since that first one (two, really) at Rio’s apartment. It would all be easier to manage—the balancing act of trying to finish her book but also trying, at any given point, to get Rio underneath her (or on top, to the side; it doesn’t really matter)—if Rio wasn’t so goddamn
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     at it, leaving Agatha with cravings that go beyond insatiable. Sometimes they work first, and sometimes it’s not until after, once they’re wrapped up in nothing but each other, and decide to finally pull out the laptops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two weeks in, Agatha finally lets Rio come over to her apartment. She’s barely opened the door before Rio pushes her against the wall and throws one of Agatha’s legs over her shoulder. It takes even less time for Rio to have her clit in her mouth and leave Agatha a gasping, quivering mess. She has half a mind to push Rio onto the floor right there, but Agatha knows she would pay for it later in her knees, so she grabs Rio’s hand and leads her straight into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shoves Rio onto the mattress and climbs over her, stripping their clothes and turning Rio over until she can slip her hand in between them and have her from behind. Agatha whispers dirty words right into her ear—
     <em>
      god, you’re so fucking wet for me, you just couldn’t wait to have my fingers inside you
     </em>
     —and Rio comes like a whip cracking, bowing her back as Agatha bites down on her shoulder in the spot that is quickly becoming her favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Afterwards, with the sheets wrapped around their bodies to stave off the cold seeping in through the windows, Agatha leans against the headboard and grabs her laptop from its perch on the nightstand. Out of the corner of her eye she can see Rio twisting, her head settled near the footboard as her body bends over the edge of the mattress to grab her laptop from the floor. Agatha doesn’t know how it even got there; was so clouded by desire in her haste to get Rio inside her room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha focuses back on her screen, quickly typing in her password—
     <em>
      ihatemymom1981
     </em>
     —to get started on the last few chapters before her next deadline. It’s down to the wire at this point, the last of the chapters due right before Christmas—which is insane, who the fuck decided that?—and her fingers itch with the apprehension of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never pegged you as someone to mix work and play.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t look up. “You don’t peg me at all,” a snort from both of them, “and we don’t work together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tents her own laptop, peering at Agatha over the top. “What do you call this, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She waves a hand around them, arching an eyebrow, and Agatha shrugs. “Aftercare?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opens her laptop back up, shaking her head even though Agatha can see the upturn of her mouth. “You’re incredibly annoying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmm, say that again but
     <em>
      slower
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     She reaches out a foot to leisurely run down Rio’s arm, but Rio quickly swats it away. “You’re fucked, Agatha. Fucked in the fucking head.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha throws her head back and laughs—when was the last time she laughed like this?—until Rio crawls back in between her legs and shuts her up.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s so fucking late, Agatha knows she is without even looking at her phone, which is why she’s rushing down 10th Avenue and all but physically pushing people out of her way—all because Rio just had to have her
     <em>
      one more time before you leave
     </em>
     , and then looked at Agatha in this devotionally sexy kind of way that had her saying
     <em>
      yes
     </em>
     like a goddamn idiot. Then she left the warmth of Rio and her bed, and with every step closer to the restaurant now in view, she finds herself wanting to crawl right back into it. Something in her gut tells her this lunch will not be fun, a premonition tickling the air around her; she just doesn’t know why yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha completely bypasses the hostess station, heading for a circular table in the back. The others are already there, and Jen narrows her eyes as Agatha takes her seat. “How nice of you to finally join us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I would’ve been on time, but I didn’t want to come.” The joke would’ve landed better if she wasn’t so out of breath, evidence of her efforts, but none of them call her out on it. It only makes Agatha tense more, wondering what they’re saving the ammunition for.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just telling the girls how well your book is coming along.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think you’ll be able to keep the September pub date?” Jen asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only if that bitch in production doesn’t fuck us over with the dust jacket again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, isn’t she the one—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Alice
     </em>
     ,” Agatha hisses, trying in vain to shut the woman up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “—that Agatha wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am-ed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s jaw drops open. “
     <em>
      That’s
     </em>
     why she took an extra month making the mock-ups for the last one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorts, voice dripping with a scorn Agatha isn’t sure is entirely playful. “Isn’t it always Agatha? Leave it to her to screw somebody from her own publishing house, then give the poor woman the whole ‘it’s not you, it’s me and my inability to love people the way they need to be loved’ speech.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going to strangle you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If only you could reach me up here,” Jen says, which only makes her want to strangle Jen more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am
     <em>
      above
     </em>
     the average height—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nobody cares, darling,” Lilia interrupts. Agatha doesn’t argue, just takes a long drink of her mimosa and sulks back into her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     The conversation switches to more idle talk after the server takes their orders, updating each other on work and gossip like they usually do. It’s not until after they’ve started eating that the real blow comes—the one Agatha could sense was coming before she even sat down. Word spreads quickly between a group this small and she really should have known better.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you and Rio seem to be spending a lot of time together,” Lilia says, tone nonchalant as her eyes never leave her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha almost chokes, quickly swallowing the food in her mouth and downing another gulp of her drink. “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen waves a hand. “Calm down, it’s just an observation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “An observation of
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looks over innocently, but Agatha can see the curiosity burning in her eyes. “She told me in our last meeting that the two of you have been meeting up to work on your books together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs, her brain working overtime as she tries to find a way out of this conversation. “It’s less ‘meeting up’ and more that we happen to find ourselves in the same place at the same time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And that ‘same place’ just happens to be your apartments?” Jen asks, looking at Agatha like she knows exactly what they get up to in each other’s apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes Agatha’s face burn, any argument she had before now completely obsolete. “Okay, well, that was actually…” she splutters, and the other three are actually laughing, they’re fucking laughing at her. “No,
     <em>
      listen
     </em>
     —”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia gains a bit of composure, though a giggle still escapes as she says, “Oh, we’re listening. Please, tell us more about how you found yourself in Rio Vidal’s apartment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Last I checked, you hated her,” Jen quips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh-huh,” Alice says, smirking. “Sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s mortifying, the way they all know her business like this. Sure, they call themselves friends, but that doesn’t mean Agatha makes a habit of divulging her personal life with them. She doesn’t tell them much of anything if she’s being honest; she doesn’t even think they would be friends if they didn’t all work in the same circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now Rio has the audacity to tell Alice about their…

      meetings
     </em>
     , and it pisses her off—so much that she abruptly stands and ignores the rest of the group’s faint reactions of surprise. She walks outside, pulling out her phone to dial Rio’s number, waiting impatiently until it picks up on the third ring. She doesn’t wait for Rio’s greeting, just goes right in, “Why the hell would you tell Alice?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell Alice what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “About us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs and it only pisses her off more, like a hand reaching into her abdomen and twisting the knife. “Agatha, I only said that we—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Were working together, I know. That doesn’t answer
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry I was making conversation with my editor about my writing process,” but Rio doesn’t sound sorry at all, just annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Next time, leave my name out of your mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t wait for Rio’s response, just hangs up and walks back inside the restaurant, sitting down at the table with a huff. They all look at her, silent questions they would never dare voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snaps, a sharp, “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia doesn’t bat an eye, just looks at her in the way she always does when she thinks Agatha is acting out for no discernible reason. “Everything okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shoves a handful of fries into her mouth, smiling around them as her words come out muffled. “Just peachy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     None of them say another word about it, and Agatha thinks she might be able to survive the rest of this godforsaken day.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, when she’s alone in her apartment and nursing a glass of wine, Lilia calls her. Agatha waits as long as possible, considers just how pissed Lilia would be if she ignored her for the next week, but figures it’s not worth it. She’s got bigger battles, so she picks it up with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re regressing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pauses, unsure. “Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “These latest pages are all over the place, and the voice sounds like you’d rather be writing about anything else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     rather—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia sighs deeply, exasperation seeping through the phone. “Need I remind you, once again, this was your idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which is coming back to bite me in the ass so spectacularly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fix
     </em>
     it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia doesn’t wait, just hangs up on her. Agatha throws her phone somewhere in the vicinity of her couch and paces around the room, chugging the rest of her wine and filling it right back up. Part of her knows Lilia is right; the chapter wasn’t good, but another part of her is just so fucking
     <em>
      angry
     </em>
     . Writing about her mother shouldn’t be as hard as it is—she survived being raised by her for fuck’s sake—but every morning she wakes up, there is an ineffable dread that accompanies her. Forcing herself to remember every insult, every slap, just puts her right back in that house she’s spent so long trying to escape from. Agatha truly doesn’t know what possessed her to propose the idea to Lilia, a book all about growing up with a mother that never loved her, but her mother’s death catalyzed a need within her she’s never felt before—a need for someone, anyone, to understand the weight of everything she carries around. Sometimes it feels too heavy, shouldering it all herself, and sometimes she is just so fucking
     <em>
      tired
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzes from where it landed in between the couch cushions, a welcome distraction from the spiral of her thoughts. A glance at the lock screen shows a message from Rio, like a beacon in the night:
     <em>
      you’re right, i’m sorry. i won’t bring it up again if you don’t want me to.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, at least one thing has gone right today.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets herself into Rio’s apartment a few days later, calling out her name when she finds the living room empty. A grunt comes from somewhere down the hallway, and Agatha follows the sound into Rio’s office. She was a little hesitant to come today; hasn’t seen Rio since their little tiff, but she figures, if anything, they could at least fuck it out. Communicating is something she absolutely won’t do, but sex she most definitely can.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s never actually been inside the office, only seen it in passing while stumbling to the bedroom, but now she takes in the dark woods and plants placed precariously along the tops of the bookshelves as she hovers by the door. There’s a couch against the wall opposite Rio’s desk, sparking some interesting fantasies in Agatha’s mind, before she notices Rio slumped over and staring at her computer. She’s clearly struggling with something but Agatha waits for her to ask, just makes her way to Rio’s side and fiddles with a paperweight holding down a very organized-looking stack of papers. It’s so different from Agatha’s own office, with notecards randomly taped onto the wall in some semblance of an outline and random bits of stories scattered on every available surface. How she’s managed to put out anything remotely resembling a well-polished book, she doesn’t know. (She’s good at what she does, that’s why.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Rio looks up, a frown on her face. “Can you take a look at this for me? Something about these couple of paragraphs doesn’t feel right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raises her eyebrows. “You really trust my opinion even though I don’t touch fantasy with a ten-foot pole?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I still think you’re a good writer even if you have abhorrent reading tastes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice word.” She stands next to Rio, nudging her until she moves her chair over to make room for Agatha as she leans over to see the screen better. “Let me take a look.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha truly has no idea what’s going on in the story she sees on the page, only catching bits and pieces—something about a betrayal between wives? exes? she doesn’t know—but what she can see is that Rio is, frustratingly, an exceptionally good writer. Even in the places she’s struggling with crafting, it’s obvious there is a lot of care placed into every word. Agatha is almost fascinated by the clear honing of skills, but her thoughts are interrupted when she feels Rio’s hand trace up her back, light touches along her spine. Agatha does her best to suppress a shiver and keep reading, determined now to focus since Rio clearly wants to make this a challenge even if she does actually need the help. Her fingers drift higher, teasing across her abdomen and dipping low before lifting back up. It makes Agatha squirm, trying not to be obvious about the way her thighs clench together, about the way she bites her lip to stifle a whine.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s just about regained her focus when Rio suddenly reaches her hand down, sliding under the waistband of Agatha’s trousers and underwear all in one motion. She knows she’s probably soaking, is a little embarrassed by how little it took to get her there, but then Rio is standing and moving behind her, and everything besides Rio’s hand inside her suddenly doesn’t matter. It’s slow—almost teasing—the way Rio thrusts two fingers in and out. It’s not enough, they both know it, and it makes Agatha grind against the desk in front of her while trying to comprehend the same sentence she’s been reading for the past twenty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bends over, laying herself across Agatha’s back, and whispers into her ear, “Thoughts?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nearly loses it at the feeling of Rio’s breath against her neck, the need for more overwhelming in its entirety, but she’ll be damned if she lets Rio win this game. She grips the desk with one hand and barely manages to highlight a specific line on the document in front of her. “Dialogue is messy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A hum against her neck. “Personally, I think that line is Booker material.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is a classic case—
     <em>
      shit
     </em>
     —of killing your darlings, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you just call me darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She can feel Rio’s smirk against her neck and she’s annoyed that she understands the joke so quickly, that the first time she met Rio is so memorable she doesn’t even have to try to place the words. “Shut the fuck—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cuts off with a groan when Rio uses her hips to thrust into her harder, falling forward to brace her elbows on the desk and nearly knocking Rio’s laptop off. She feels Rio reposition her hips against her ass and she grinds her hips back, moaning when Rio lets out a quiet
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     . When Agatha feels three fingers on the next thrust she drops her head, moans louder when Rio takes one of Agatha’s hands and snakes it down her front to her clit. Rio moves her hand away once Agatha obeys, fingers working in tandem as their pace grows more frantic, and Rio wraps her other arm around Agatha’s middle. They’re close, bodies pressed together, and god she’s so close, she just—
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not yet, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait for me,” and Rio’s hips move faster against her, a frenzy of movement that slackens her jaw and makes her want to smash that paperweight on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans again, moves her head to the side as Rio mouths against her neck. It’s not until she says it—now,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     —her voice hoarse with desperation, that Rio finally curls her fingers and Agatha’s orgasm tears through her body like white heat, Rio following a second later. Their breath comes back slowly, sweat slipping down their bodies as Rio continues clinging to her, and Agatha realizes she could easily get used to this.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought is so terrifying and unexpected she quickly straightens her clothes and leaves the room without looking back. Once she’s on the couch in the living room, she drowns herself in writing the rest of the day with a fervor she hasn’t experienced in years.
    </p>

     Rio:

    <p>
     Rio:

    <p>
     A week and a half later is Thanksgiving, a holiday Agatha has never understood the need to celebrate. Growing up it usually meant her mother would berate her for overcooking the yams, maybe sending her to her room for the night without dinner—the usual. But the past few years Lilia, Alice, and Jen have somehow corralled her into getting dinner with them like some sorority chapter meeting. It’s borderline maltreatment of her time, and Agatha still doesn’t know why she keeps saying yes. If she thinks too long about it, words like
     <em>
      loneliness
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      outcast
     </em>
     drift through her mind, so she chooses not to think about it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s just poured her first glass of wine when Jen forces a whole fucking toast. “Another year, and yet another Thanksgiving none of us have a place to go home to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice makes a noise of protest, “God, when you say it like that it makes us sound pathetic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is a bit pathetic,” Lilia says.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s pathetic is that I keep saying yes to these stupid dinners,” Agatha grumbles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think it’s pathetic. I think it’s actually kind of sweet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks down the table towards the new voice, someone she doesn’t recognize sitting next to Lilia. She truly has no idea when he got here, or if he’s been here the whole time and she was just too lost inside her own bitching and moaning. “Why is there a teenager here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Lilia placates, “this is Billy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, yes. The protege.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This Billy raises a hand in a small wave, a much too bright smile on his face as he leans towards Agatha. “Hi! I’m a really big fan of yours and I can’t believe I’m actually talking to you right now.
     <em>
      Road Not Traveled
     </em>
     is one of my favorite books and I just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cool it, kid,” she interrupts. “Are you old enough to drink?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh, yeah? I’m twenty-two.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus.” Agatha grabs the bottle of wine in the center of the table and tips a hefty pour into the empty wine glass in front of Billy. “Drink this and shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ,” Alice whispers, stern.
    </p>
    <p>
     She throws her hands up—
     <em>
      what are you going to do about it?
     </em>
     —before taking a long sip of her own wine. She’s not tipsy enough for this yet, and especially not when she notices another empty chair next to Alice, a sinking feeling settling in the pit of her stomach. Agatha clears her throat. “Are we expecting someone else?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before anyone can respond, Agatha senses somebody approach from behind, turns her head to find none other than Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here I am,” she says, sitting down in her seat with a huff. “Sorry I’m late. Rush hour was a bitch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The question tumbles out of Agatha’s mouth before she can stop it, sharp and accusing. “What are you doing here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifts one shoulder like she doesn’t know exactly how pissed Agatha is. “I’m having dinner with my friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s momentarily dumbfounded. “
     <em>
      Friends
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Agatha,” Jen responds, “not that you would know what those are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, how you wound me.” She swoons, putting a hand against her chest before flipping Jen off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No arguing on Thanksgiving,” and the stern voice Lilia uses somehow makes them shut up—but Agatha would rather die than not have the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I prefer the term ‘amicable hostility,’” she mumbles, and if it results in Rio smiling adorably at her, making Agatha’s skin light up, at least nobody can tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha keeps her head down and wine glass full the rest of the meal, though at one point Jen shoots her a glance like she’s weirded out by Agatha’s unusual silence—but what’s
     <em>
      weird
     </em>
     is that Rio is here, is it not? She’s somehow wormed her way into both Agatha’s bed and her circle of companions, and she feels stifled. Rio’s presence is quickly becoming all-consuming, a suffocation of her senses, and every sense is telling Agatha to cut and run as fast as she fucking can. Everyone’s voices fade out to background noise, the whirlwind of Agatha’s thoughts playing out in front of her. God, she knew it was a bad idea to start something with Rio; she knew it was dangerous, putting all these cards in Rio’s hands like she wasn’t going to take every chance to fucking play them. Where do they go from here? How long is she expected to act like this—this dinner, this surge of emotion that wells up within her every time she looks at Rio—is fine?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers fidget against the stem of her wine glass, every atom aching to smash it in the grip of her hand. Maybe the sharp edges could distract her, cutting deep until the blood trickling down her palm is a twisted reprieve from the way Rio is eyeing her. It would probably hurt less than Rio’s gaze, but then Rio would probably lick all the blood away and call it salvation—a devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s voice cuts through, the clap of her hands startling Agatha out of her thoughts. “Okay, time for the least exciting part of the night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans closer, watching as Alice fidgets with her phone. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Putting our names in a random generator to see who pays,” Jen explains. “We do it every year.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes slide over to Agatha—again—before turning back to Alice. “Why aren’t you putting Agatha’s name in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha never pays,” Lilia says, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy leans forward, far too eager. “Why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one time we tried to force her, she convinced us she already had and we ended up dining and dashing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone looks at her then, ranging from amused disbelief to hushed contempt. Agatha waves a hand in defense, “I don’t even want to be here, why would I pay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And yet, you show up every year.” Alice smirks because she knows Agatha doesn’t have a response to that, that it is undoubtedly true Agatha shows up every year only to complain they have forced her into a disgusting display of ‘sisterhood’ and ‘friendship’ while also laughing at a story Jen tells about her other clients. Agatha thinks admitting why she shows up without fail to these get-togethers is beneath her, a show of weakness akin to a tail between her legs, so she covers it up with a disdain she’s doesn’t think she ever really felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia ends up paying—
     <em>
      that is so unfair, I paid last year
     </em>
     —and they all shuffle out of the restaurant together, coats wrapped tight against the harsh wind blowing in from the Hudson. Agatha lets them all hug her goodbye, stiffly, except Billy—
     <em>
      no, I don’t know you
     </em>
     —and Rio, who says she’s going in the same direction as Agatha even though every one knows Agatha is just going to get a car. Agatha can feel their stares as they walk away, mixed looks of confusion and curiosity, but she grits her teeth and staunchly ignores them, waiting at the curb for her Uber. She briefly considers walking into the oncoming traffic but figures it would be quite a painful way to go, so she doesn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio steps closer, the bergamot and sandalwood scent of her crowding the space between them, and suddenly the traffic doesn’t seem so bad. Agatha doesn’t look at her when she asks, just leaves it hanging in the air in front of her. “Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She senses more than she sees Rio’s shrug. “It never came up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you didn’t think to mention it?” Agatha looks at her then, sees the way her barbed wire words settle onto Rio’s skin, slicing in a way that Agatha longs for. Anything, even pain, would be better than the panic she feels creeping up her lungs like a slow drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks away for a moment, weighing her words, before looking back at Agatha with tired eyes. “I had a good night and I don’t really feel like arguing with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For once in her life, Agatha relents. She can see the way Rio means it, her pleading look depleting any fight that was building up inside Agatha’s body. She nods and notices the way Rio’s shoulders drop into something like relief, and Agatha’s stomach drops into something like fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her car pulls up and she gets in without another word, not risking a glance at the woman she’s leaving behind until the tinted window can hide it, a separation Agatha has been craving all night. She thought the quiet of the backseat would clear her head, let the panic seep away as the car speeds along the congested roads of Manhattan, but it doesn’t. Something tells her that she is in way too deep, that she has started something that was only ever meant to end. Agatha feels like she is choking on it all, the ash of words left unsaid sitting heavy on her tongue until they—and Rio, always Rio—are the only thing she can remember the taste of.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     Three days later she wakes up and decides to be honest with Rio that whatever is going on between them needs to end. It’s been fun, but now it’s starting to hurt, like sticking your hand in a fire and getting shocked by the pain of the flames licking across your skin. Agatha is all for casual sex, but the way Rio has been looking at her lately is too meaningful, like she’s waiting for Agatha to figure something out. It’s incredibly frustrating, and she spends more time than she would like fretting over the significance of it all, and the only thing she needs to be fretting over right now is finishing her goddamn book. So, it has to end, and now she needs to figure out a way to break it to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost like a summoning, there is a knock on her door; she opens it to Rio, soaking wet and shivering. It’s pouring rain outside, claps of thunder echoing around the block, and she didn’t expect Rio to make the trek up to her apartment—especially because they haven’t spoken since the other night, when Agatha left her alone in the small mess they had both created.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio is here, dripping rainwater onto Agatha’s doorstep, and looking more exhausted than Agatha has ever seen her. She opens the door wider, letting Rio step inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you mind if we just parallel play it today?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It catches Agatha off guard, eyebrows raising in surprise. “Didn’t know you were into that, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Work
     </em>
     , Agatha,” and Rio looks at her with slight disapproval, “I was asking if we can just work like we used to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh.” Agatha nods, motioning Rio forward and trailing after her. Something is off today; Agatha knows that, and she feels adrift by Rio’s demeanor. A nagging feeling tells her it’s more than just their last conversation, bigger than just the two of them, and when Rio sits down on the couch and doesn’t immediately start working, just stares blankly, it unnerves Agatha to the point of voicing her concern out loud. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     It breaks Rio out of her trance, a small shake of her head like she’s trying to will her thoughts away. She moves to pull her computer out of her bag as she mumbles, “I’m fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t believe it for a second because she’s not an idiot, and no matter how much she hates it sometimes, she’s fine-tuned to everything Rio does, knows somewhere deep inside her marrow that something is wrong. She sits down on the couch and leans back, studying the woman in front of her. “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m just having a bad day,” and Rio is pulling up her manuscript like she isn’t on Agatha’s couch with eyes that are screaming for a connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets the silence sit between them for a few moments, waiting until Rio’s fingers hover over her keyboard without moving. Agatha’s voice is soft—so much softer than she ever thought she was capable of—when she asks, “Do you want to talk about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A deep sigh, and then Rio is closing her laptop and leaning back until her head rests right next to Agatha’s hand. She turns her head, and the depths of anguish caught within hacks Agatha’s heart right in two.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you ever feel like you don’t deserve what you have? Like good things are just wasted on you?” Rio furrows her brows, eyes flitting over Agatha like the answers she seeks are etched within the shape of her face. When Agatha doesn’t move, doesn’t say anything, Rio looks away. “That probably sounds stupid, forget I said anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moves like she’s going to stand up and Agatha reaches out to stop her, a hand lingering on her arm like an anchor—though Agatha isn’t sure which one of them it’s meant to moor. She trails her fingers down, grabs one of Rio’s hands and squeezes. “You deserve good things, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course she does, how could she not think Rio isn’t deserving of every single thing she craves? It only unnerves her to think
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     is one of those things that Rio yearns to sink into, because it was never an option to say no; Agatha was always going to give herself over to Rio—but this is
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     , the woman who has never fallen in love because she’s not sure she even knows the feel of it, how love sounds and smells against her skin because she grew up in a house devoid of it. Worse, she was told she was undeserving, that she could only siphon the good parts out of people in the useless hope of making herself better.
     <em>
      Evil, wicked, sinful
     </em>
     —what else is she supposed to believe? She has never, in her entire life, done anything to prove her mother wrong; she has let herself corrupt the air she occupies because it is the only thing she ever learned—
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is speaking, voice more gentle than Agatha deserves. “Hey, where’d you go just now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shakes her head, “Nowhere. It’s nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s a pause, and then Rio is moving her hair back to tuck it behind her ear. “She was wrong, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knows, but she asks anyway, “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your mother. She was wrong about you,” Rio says—simply, like it’s true, “but it’s like her ghost hovers over your shoulder.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s too much, this revelation Rio has placed at her feet. Agatha’s not even convinced; she has only let Rio see the parts of her sanded down enough for the rest of the world, but she knows all it will take to cleave her open is one more delicate word. The worst part is that Agatha discovers, like lightning, that she wants to stop polishing herself off so Rio can see the mess underneath—but she can’t, she doesn’t know how. Agatha needs to turn this conversation back to erase the moments she has stolen for her own pity and leave Rio with something other than her own rotten insides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what about you, huh?” Agatha finally looks back up and hardens herself against the onslaught of Rio’s stare. She can feel her walls sliding back into place, but they’re not fast enough—not for Rio. “Just because some good things don’t last doesn’t mean all endings are inevitable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrows her eyes, piercing Agatha with something indiscernible, but way too close to reverence. “Isn’t that the natural order of all things, to end?”
    </p>
    <p>
     God, how did she ever think she could quit this? Rio is so, so good and Agatha is so, so selfish; she wants to wrap herself around Rio until neither of them can breathe, a simultaneous destruction, but she settles for running a hand across Rio’s jaw, tracing the outline of her lips. “Even if they do, I don’t think anything good could ever be wasted on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She can’t help but lean in and brush her lips over Rio’s, pressing her words into Rio’s mouth so she knows Agatha means it. When she pulls away, Agatha tries to commit every ridge and line across Rio’s face to memory. This is starting to feel like a goodbye, but for some reason, Agatha never considered what it would be like to actually say the words aloud and let Rio leave her apartment without the promise of coming back. She suddenly isn’t sure she wants that at all, and that is the most terrifying part.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drops her hand, leans back, and wraps herself up in undoing. She is fighting back—against what exactly, she’s not sure—with the one thing she learned how to get right. Rio’s eyes flicker between her own, frowning. “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t respond, just stands up and accepts the hurt on Rio’s face like a branding. “I’m not feeling well, so I’m going to run a bath. You should probably leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice is hoarse when she speaks, the burden of everything she’s trying to hide weighing it down, and her chest tightens with every step she takes away from Rio on her couch—waiting, wanting—because leaving is the only thing she knows how to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drowns herself over the next week, unrelenting in her vehemence to cloud her mind with nothing but writing. Her book is the only thing that matters right now, Lilia’s presence in her inbox like a lifeline as Agatha floods her with page after page. Every word feels like a small slice, adding to a thousand across her skin as she unburies all the reasons why she must sabotage every good thing that comes her way—but it is cathartic.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s been (mostly) ignoring Rio’s texts and calls, citing a bad case of the flu as the reason why she’s sequestered herself all alone in her apartment. It’s a weak excuse, and they both know it, but Rio lets her have it anyway. She expected more of an argument, can’t get the image of Rio’s face the last time they spoke out of her head, but there’s nothing. No end has been spoken, but it feels like that’s where they’re at, that Agatha has finally hammered in the last nail of the coffin she is determined to lie in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is fine. She’s fine. There was a time before Rio, and there will be a time after her, as long as Agatha can forget everything Rio left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, pushing in as Agatha decides to abandon—like Agatha has thought her name one too many times—her phone buzzes on the coffee table as Rio calls her. She should ignore it, just go back to another night spent on her couch because her sheets still smell like Rio no matter how many times she washes them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t remember picking up her phone, but it’s against her ear, and now she can hear the way Rio sucks in a breath, like she didn’t expect Agatha to answer. There are muffled sounds, music playing at a distance, and Agatha wonders where Rio is this late before she reminds herself it’s not her job to care.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I come over?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s request surprises her. She didn’t think this would happen again, and she doesn’t think she should let it, but Agatha can’t stop herself from asking, “Where are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doesn’t matter.” The sounds in the background fade a bit, like Rio is walking away to hear Agatha better. She sucks in a breath. “Can I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     This cannot happen. “I’m busy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We both know you’re not working right now.” And it sounds so definitive, like there is never a time Rio isn’t exactly sure what Agatha is thinking or doing. Agatha is about to say no to prove Rio wrong, to follow through on her intentions for once in her goddamn life, when Rio whispers, “I miss you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s so faint that Agatha isn’t sure she was supposed to hear it, but she did, and now it’s floating until Agatha decides to stomp on it or swallow it whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s never been good at denying her own gratification. “Door’s open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paces around her kitchen while she waits for Rio. She really should have asked where Rio’s coming from so she knows how long she has to wait; instead she just fidgets with the sash of her robe and tries not to think about how this is a monumentally bad idea. She shouldn’t have said yes, but there’s always been something about Rio that Agatha cannot deny, like a string connecting them pulled taut.
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s a knock on her door before it opens, and Agatha tries to even out her breathing, wrestling with the certainty that tonight is going to ruin her—she just doesn’t know how yet. Rio doesn’t seem to be faring well either, her face withdrawn and her eyes tentative when she finds Agatha in the kitchen, like she’s half expecting Agatha to kick her out if she moves wrong. Rio stops a few feet away, hip resting against the counter, waiting. Agatha can smell the faint scent of liquor, and her face twists incredulously. “Are you drunk?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowns. “I’ve only had two drinks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, so she’s not drunk, but for some reason Agatha feels the need to even the playing field. This feels like a battleground. She needs to be equal to Rio or not here, standing in her kitchen and teetering on a precipice she’s not sure she’s ready to fall from. Wordlessly, she grabs a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cabinet, pouring a small amount before meeting Rio’s gaze as she knocks it back in one gulp. Their eye contact stays locked as Agatha pours a second one, the burn just as easy as the first one when she swallows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word, Agatha leaves the kitchen and walks into her bedroom, the sound of Rio’s footsteps behind her like a myth. She doesn’t need to look back to know Rio will follow, but she’s not sure Rio would trust her to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t bother turning on the lights, just turns around and watches. Rio is slow to enter, looking around Agatha’s room like this is the first time she’s been in here. When their eyes meet, the tension heightens to a blistering degree; it’s almost muggy, and Agatha needs Rio to make the next move because she doesn’t know what she’ll do if she moves first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanders over to her bedside, fingers drifting across the wood as she pulls open the bottommost drawer. Agatha knows exactly what’s in there and a memory surfaces, almost unbidden, of an afternoon when Rio was rifling through her things like she wanted to discover something Agatha was determined to keep hidden. They never got the chance to use either of the things in that drawer, and Agatha feels a scorching low in her stomach as she imagines just what exactly Rio has in mind tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio pulls her hand out of the drawer, she isn’t holding what Agatha expected. In her hands is the double-sided strap, the one Agatha admitted to never using before. Maybe Rio wants tonight to be a first, something so memorable that Agatha won’t be able to forget whatever happens. Agatha doesn’t think forgetting was ever an option.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds it out to her, a question gleaming in her eyes. Agatha finally steps forward, taking it from Rio’s hand, and starts to undo the tie of her robe before Rio reaches out to stop her. Slowly, much too slowly for Agatha’s tastes, Rio sits down on the bed and tugs Agatha between her legs, hands gripping the back of her thighs like she’s afraid Agatha will leave. Gently, she undoes the knot on Agatha’s robe and peels it back, inch by inch, like unwrapping a present. Her fingers skim over the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, nails scratching until Agatha twitches underneath her. It is fucking torture, the way Rio is taking her time, but Agatha knows she’s the reason they’re in this mess at all, so she lets it happen. She lets Rio kiss the planes of her stomach, lips barely touching; she lets Rio ghost her hands over her chest, nowhere near where Agatha wants her; she lets Rio look up at her, eyes tender in a way that makes her want to scream until her throat feels as raw as her insides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she grabs Rio’s face and kisses her, moaning prettily until she feels Rio match her desperation, tongue licking into her mouth until Rio is putty in her hands. Agatha shrugs off her robe and pulls Rio to standing, tugs her shirt over her head, and fusses with the button of her jeans. When she gets Rio down to her underwear, she slows down, taking her time to mouth down Rio’s neck and brush her fingers over her nipples—she will probably die knowing all the ways Rio likes to be touched, where exactly she wants Agatha’s mouth at any given moment, which beats signal her orgasm and what the flutter of her insides feels like against Agatha’s fingers when she does.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Agatha has her naked, she pushes Rio back onto the bed, slips into the harness as she watches Rio scoot back until her head is resting on the pillows, open and waiting. Agatha kisses her way up Rio’s leg, pauses near the top of her thighs before kissing her way up the other one. Rio is a panting, whining mess, trying in vain to get Agatha to do something; Agatha just takes her time, wants Rio to forget everything but the taste of Agatha’s name in her mouth. God, she’s been a fucking idiot to deny herself this: the searing, musky flavor as she licks up Rio’s cunt, the tug of Rio’s hands in her hair, her name falling on Rio’s lips in a way that can only be described as filthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She crawls up Rio’s body, kissing and biting marks just in case this is the last time she has Rio like this, under her and so needy. Agatha slots her hips in between Rio’s, kisses her until they’re breathless. She was so focused on Rio that she didn’t even realize how her side of the strap sits so deliciously against her g-spot, stoking pleasure while barely moving. She’s not going to survive this—her orgasm might actually kill her—and she moans when Rio locks eyes with her and maneuvers so Agatha is sitting right at her entrance, both of them suspended in a tense heat before Agatha finally—
     <em>
      jesus, finally
     </em>
     —slides in. She pitches forward, hands on either side of Rio’s head, and begins a tenuous rhythm until she feels Rio’s hips meeting her own, wordlessly asking her to move faster, harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasps against her mouth, throws her head back and bares her throat for Agatha. She bites down in her favorite spot, between neck and shoulder, and files away the groan Rio makes in case she needs to remember the sound of it later. Agatha presses their foreheads together, relishing in this mingling of sweat and bodies, thrusts harder as Rio’s moans grow louder. The fire in her own body is sharp and there is suddenly nothing more she wants than to come with Rio like this, their pleasure so fierce and simultaneous that neither of them is sure whose wave it is they’re riding. Rio pulls her head back up, tugging slightly on her hair in a way that makes Agatha choke on a moan. She moves a hand down one of Rio’s thighs and pitches it up higher around her waist so she can reach deeper, hit harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s her name in Rio’s mouth, sounding all broken and wrecked, that snaps something inside her, makes her hips snap harder against Rio’s. She moves her hand back up until it rests against the curve of Rio’s throat, only the slightest pressure until she feels like Rio is
     <em>
      hers
     </em>
     . Agatha can feel the way Rio tightens around her, moans high and needy as Agatha pushes them further and further to the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, baby, come on,” she whispers, squeezing until Rio opens her eyes. They’re hazy, and it drives Agatha insane—she is the one making Rio like this, lust drunk and unholy on her bed. She wants to do this forever, doesn’t think she will stop until Rio pushes her away and they are both a weightless, trembling mess. Her stomach tightens, a thrill splintering out as she feels her orgasm build.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rakes her hands down her back, groans out her name, “Agatha, baby—fuck, I’m gonna come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods, kisses Rio until she can’t breathe—god, she smells like fraser fir and tastes like life, filling Agatha with creation—pants, “Oh, oh—”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And it hits her: Agatha loves her. Agatha loves Rio and probably always will, a colossal realization that feels like coming home, like she has loved Rio for lifetimes. Maybe that’s why they can’t quit each other and why Agatha has the primal need to consume Rio, mark this woman up—because Rio might have always been hers, in other places she doesn’t know about—and why she is just as much Rio’s. It’s intrinsic, written into their bodies so profoundly, and it’s entirely too much, the way Agatha feels about Rio. It fragments around her as she comes and comes and comes, Rio’s name a stuttering lamentation as she eventually submits to it. Rio’s hips buck, and Agatha swears she can feel the flutters of her orgasm around the strap, as Rio cries out and her body spasms under Agatha’s touch and mouth and body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is intoxicating, but it is daunting, and Agatha doesn’t know what to do with her epiphany. She wants to sheathe herself inside these sheets that smell of them, but she also wants to run as far as it takes to obliterate the feelings she is now painfully aware of. Agatha feels her love spilling out over the edges of her framework and she wants to scoop it back up, squashing it down until it’s like Rio was never here at all. She wants so much and Agatha isn’t sure which part of her is going to win because she doesn’t deserve
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     —Rio caressing her face as Agatha slips out, Rio wrapping her arms around her after the harness is thrown onto the floor. Perhaps the epiphany of her love should have made her want to stay, but it creates an aching cavern inside her chest that she can’t unite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha will destroy this like she always does if she lets herself stay here, cloaked in Rio’s tenderness. Agatha doesn’t know if she would survive that slow, gnawing death as she waits for the unavoidable end—so she makes the decision that her death will be quick and agonizing and falls asleep with fear melting on her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In the morning she is slow to wake, stretched out on her stomach and momentarily confused by how warm she feels until she feels someone shift behind her—shit, this has never happened before. They’ve fucked an (ungodly) amount of times but not once have her and Rio slept over at each other’s apartments. Panic flares hot until something pokes her back, the feel of silicone catching over skin as Rio moves on top of her, front to back, and kisses her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You awake?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods, lets out the smallest moan when Rio maneuvers a hand in between Agatha’s stomach and the mattress to circle her clit. Agatha lifts her hips to give her more room, and it makes the strap attached to Rio’s hips slip lower, pressing against her cunt in a way that leaves her groaning. When she’s wet enough—when was the last time someone made her slick like this, so quick and desperate?—Rio pushes the tip in, a slow tease like the morning light filtering through the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” and she barely recognizes her own voice as her tongue wraps around the syllables, wanton and exposed. Another shallow thrust and fuck, she realizes Rio’s playing with her. Agatha can feel the smirk on the back of her neck and it makes her want to reach up and pull Rio’s hair out of her stupid fucking skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     A chuckle, “Yes, sweetheart?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grips the bedsheets, white-knuckled against the crime Rio is committing. “Stop teasing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio follows the curve of her shoulder, lips ghosting over Agatha as she whispers, “I want to hear you beg.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” and Agatha tries to push her hips back to get the strap fully inside her, but Rio leans back, deprives her of anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s not going to fucking beg, it is beneath her and she’s never begged for anything in her life—
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fine
     </em>
     , please just—” Rio pushes back in an inch and, “Fuck,
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     , Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, fucking
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     , Rio thrusts until she’s flush against Agatha and they are both groaning. Rio is unrelenting as she sets the pace and it is sinful, delicious in a way that makes a primal sound claw its way out of Agatha’s throat. She arches her back, tries to get Rio deeper until there’s nowhere left to go. Pleasure coils like a burning and she is
     <em>
      right there
     </em>
     ; she just needs Rio to give it to her. Agatha lifts her hips, meets each thrust as she braces herself against the onslaught of everything that is Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You feel so good, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha whines, scrambles against the bed and knocks the pillows off in the process, but she doesn’t care, she is so fucking close and she’s never needed anything like this so badly in her entire life—
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me come.” Something changes then, a silent cracking that makes Rio thrust harder, faster. Agatha can feel it now—so
     <em>
      close
     </em>
     —like electricity coursing through her veins. “Rio, let me
     <em>
      come
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     One, two, three more and—
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     , fuck, shit, oh my
     <em>
      god
     </em>
     —” She cuts herself off with yell, vision blacking out as Rio gives her this sacrilegiously, fantastic fucking. It’s not until her breath comes back to her that she realizes Rio is still moving gently inside her, and there is nothing she needs more than to make Rio scream her name until the whole fucking city knows who’s giving it to her just as good. She pushes back until Rio slips out of her, Agatha arranging their bodies until Rio is flat on her back and Agatha straddles her. She lifts up, both moaning when she slides the dildo back inside her and braces herself with a hand on Rio’s chest. She angles her hips and grinds them torturously slow, moving in a way that makes Rio’s side hit that spot inside her until they’re both seeing stars. Rio’s hands fly to her waist, hips bucking until she screams Agatha’s name just as loudly as she predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha places a plate of scrambled eggs and toast in front of Rio an hour later, sitting down across from her with a cup of coffee. Rio digs in and Agatha just watches her, caught inside a mental battle. She needs to kick Rio out soon and make sure this never happens again before she lets Rio steal into every corner of her life, fitting herself inside the nooks and crannies Agatha thought would be empty forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to that panel Covenant is hosting next week?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The question catches her off guard, so absorbed in her own thoughts. “I’m actually speaking on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks up in surprise. “What? Why didn’t you tell me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn’t ask.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do they know you won’t take it seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes another sip of her coffee before setting it down on the table with a sigh. “I’ve been trying to tell Covenant House for ten years I’m not fit to do anything in front of large crowds, but they have yet to listen. One day they’ll learn their lesson.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m surprised they’ve never threatened to drop you,” Rio smirks, eyes flashing as she shovels another forkful of eggs into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, they have. I just make them too much money.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of Rio’s laughter carries her through the rest of her day, long past when Rio leaves, and it is just Agatha—alone in her apartment with faint, lingering shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     The panel makes her want to commit a felony, once again surrounded by pretentious creatives that take themselves way too seriously. Agatha tries to drown out the moderator and other panelists droning on and on about “writing with intention” and “daily processes.” She tried to say no, but Jen (unkindly) reminded her it’s written into her contract to appear on these things at least once a year. She really needs to wear her glasses when she reads fine print, which reminds her to slip them on as another author down the table pretentiously speaks about meaningful dialogue—which Agatha knows is a crock of shit because she skimmed through that book at a store once, and it was
     <em>
      awful
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It takes a few seconds for her to realize someone is saying her name, and she looks up as the moderator asks her a question. “What made you choose to become an author?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs. “I never wanted a real job.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A few laughs from the audience, and then the moderator continues, “Did you have a backup plan?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unorganized crime.” The laughs spread and Agatha chuckles awkwardly along with them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moderator—and really, where do they pick these people?—darts her eyes offstage before focusing back on Agatha with a tight smile. “We’re told your next book is set to be a memoir.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Right, she forgot Lilia sent out that press release this week. “Yup.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The moderator tries to hide a grimace but is unsuccessful, which Agatha finds successful in and of itself. “Can you tell us more about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s, um…” and she pauses, because what the hell is she supposed to say? The book is about her dead mom who never showed Agatha an ounce of kindness since the day she was born? “It’s about my mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you worried about the switch in genre? Writing about your own life is a far cry from your previous work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries not to roll her eyes, isn’t sure she succeeds, but takes a second to think about her answer. She looks out at the audience again, their faces blurring together in a sea of monotony until one person stands out—Rio. Of course she came, and of course she’s looking at Agatha with something akin to adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think there’s a little bit of myself in every book I’ve ever written,” Agatha hears herself say, tearing her eyes away from Rio and back to the moderator before she says something stupid. “I just chose not to hide it this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone looks pleased, almost impressed, with her answer, but it’s Rio that looks at Agatha like she’s
     <em>
      proud
     </em>
     —and it’s only then that Agatha registers she didn’t say something stupid. She said something real.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the panel is a blur of mediocrity that does not end quickly enough, and afterwards Agatha tells herself she will stay in the reception room for approximately two minutes (not to mingle, just to down a disgusting concoction of fruity alcohol) before leaving. Somehow, Rio catches her on her way out, an arm grabbing ahold of her and leading them to a mostly deserted hallway just outside. She doesn’t say anything, just lifts a hand and traces a finger across her glasses. Agatha startles, hadn’t realized she was still wearing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve never seen these before,” Rio murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels a blush creep onto her face. “I always forget about them. I don’t know. It’s whatever,” she mumbles, glancing away to peer at the wallpaper like it’ll show her a quick way out of this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mockingly gasps, hand to her chest. “Agatha, are you embarrassed by your glasses?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up,” she snaps. Agatha flits through the possible insults she can fire back before she notices the way Rio is looking at her, predatory and voracious. “Really? This is what does it for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiles, “I like my women old and ailing, what can I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m only
     <em>
      three
     </em>
     years older than you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets Rio lead her to a single-use bathroom thirty seconds later; lets Rio lift her skirt and fuck three fingers into her before Agatha gains her bearings and shoves her hand down Rio’s pants. They come against the hands covering each other’s mouths, but their voices still echo around the bathroom like shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicks send on the email, a low swoop in her stomach as the finality of it hits her. The whole thing, the entire manuscript about her mother and every moment that made Agatha feel unworthy, is now in Lilia’s hands. An image of Rio at the panel flickers through her mind, the pride she so blatantly bestowed, and it causes another swoop that sits uncomfortably. They haven’t seen each other since then, Agatha driven mad by her deadline, but now there is nothing to back the excuses Agatha has been throwing Rio’s way.
    </p>
    <p>
     A buzz from her phone interrupts her spiral, and it’s Rio, always falling into Agatha’s lap like she has a telescope trained on Agatha’s face to analyze every microexpression until she’s sure Agatha is thinking about her—and then she strikes. It’s annoying, this attunement to each other, and Agatha wants nothing more than to ignore Rio’s text in favor of a night alone as she deals with this oppressing love she needs to exorcise from her fucking body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha picks up her phone because she was always going to and reads the message:
     <em>
      how about now?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha:
     <em>
      What?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio:
     <em>
      dinner. can i take you to celebrate finishing your book?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She curses her past self for telling Rio the exact minute she had to send her manuscript by before Lilia blew through her front door. There is no good way out of this, but she chooses the path of least resistance:
     <em>
      I’ll think about it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They both know she won’t, that her answer is as good as no, but Agatha can’t bring herself to say it outright. Breaking things off has become infinitely more precarious now that Agatha understands the depth of her feelings for Rio—because this still has to end, at some point—and it’s not unlike slowly ripping off a bandage.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     The Christmas party is that next week—not Covenant’s, fuck that, just the thing she and the others do every year—and Agatha is well aware Rio will be there. Alice gave her a heads up this time, probably wants to avoid any more awkward tension, and Agatha almost wishes she didn’t. She’s pacing around Lilia’s living room while trying to ignore Billy’s rambling and waiting for everyone else to show up. Why are they late? Is she early? She’s been avoiding Rio for days, texts unread and calls unanswered as another premonition settled on top of her, melding itself into her skin until its prophecy can ring true: tonight she is going to fuck something up and she’s all too aware the only thing she has yet to completely lay waste to is Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t you have a family?” She cuts Billy off because she’s not sure how much more she can take before she throws herself out of Lilia’s twelfth-story window.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Lilia chides as she brings in a charcuterie board from the kitchen, “you can’t just ask someone that these days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She wants to argue, but Billy cuts her off. “I do, but it was too expensive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you from?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy has the wisdom to look a little sheepish as he answers, a quiet Westview tumbling from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia,” and yeah, it comes out bitchy, “you’re telling me you don’t pay this kid enough to afford a five dollar train ticket to
     <em>
      Jersey
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “In this economy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The door opens then, Alice and Jen filing into the room as they lift up meticulously wrapped presents. “We come bearing gifts!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio trails behind them, timid as she makes eye contact with Agatha. “About time you showed up,” Agatha says into her wine glass, relishing in its tang as it slides down her throat and gets her one step closer to tipsy and making this night somewhat bearable—though she’s not sure that’s possible, with Rio looking at her like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, look at her,” Alice says, pointing to Jen. “She’s the one who decided she needed a facial two hours before the party.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know the radiator dries out my skin.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only because you complain about it every night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just say the word and I’ll happily go back to my apartment with my
     <em>
      silk
     </em>
     sheets—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure, and start making the commute from your place again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hang on,” Agatha interrupts. She waves a hand between Alice and Jen, brows furrowing as she tries to understand what’s happening in front of her. “Are you two…?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice tilts her head to the side like she’s confused by Agatha’s confusion. “Dating?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have been for like, eight months,” Jen says, crossing her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha throws an arm out, wine sloshing dangerously close to the edge of the glass. “When the fuck did that happen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia frowns at her. “They announced it in that text thing. Billy, what is that called again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A group chat?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “Oh.” Agatha rolls her shoulders uncomfortably, flicking her hair out of her face. “I have that permanently silenced.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy mumbles something Agatha doesn’t care understand—
     <em>
      I’d say a notification hates to see you coming, but it doesn’t see you at all
     </em>
     —and everyone else eyes her like she’s a feral stray they just pulled in from outside. She narrows her eyes, daring any one of them to call her out on the frantic, anxious energy radiating off of her, but they seemingly move on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speaking of the group chat,” Jen continues slowly, like she’s trying to physically draw them all out of the uneasy silence Agatha put them in, “this is the perfect time to make an announcement. We’ll soon have to add someone new.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice grabs Jen’s arm excitedly, turning between her and Rio. “Wait, did the deal work out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s stomach drops, but she forces herself to ask anyway, like presenting her head to the blade of a guillotine. “What deal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen wraps an arm around Rio’s shoulders, proclaiming to the room, “The one and only Rio Vidal is now my newest client—who I will make sure gets paid
     <em>
      handsomely
     </em>
     from now on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Congrats, Rio!” Billy jumps up and wraps Rio in a hug. “Jen is like, so good at her job.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiles, but she studiously avoids the daggers Agatha is glaring her way. “That’s what I kept hearing. Figured I should find out for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Lilia each take a turn to hug Rio next, congratulations pouring from their mouths as Agatha looks on, frozen in place. The room goes black around the edges, words caught in her throat that she has to swallow around before she chokes. Then the room narrows in, Rio the only thing she sees. “Why didn’t you tell me about this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone stops, looking between her and Rio like Agatha is holding a ticking bomb. Rio deflates, “I think I’m gonna get a drink.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She brushes by on her way into the kitchen and Agatha follows, words thrown against Rio’s back like bullets. “I don’t like surprises.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio spins around, the counter between them, and irritation sparking against the brown of her eyes. “Is that the real reason?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She laughs in Rio’s face and she may as well have slapped her, but she’s in too deep now. “What else would it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I feel like I’m going fucking crazy right now.” Rio grabs her head, rubbing her hands down her face before looking back at Agatha. “
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     make me feel crazy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flounders for a moment—digs deep inside until she lands on the parts of her that only her mother ever saw, evil falling from her lips like a bruise—before she straightens her back and faces this destruction head-on. “You should have told me. Jen is
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     agent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs mirthlessly as she turns away. “Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m starting to get the feeling you don’t want me around.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grips the counter in front of her, grinding her teeth together. She is the one who put them here—in the middle of an argument in Lilia’s fucking kitchen, like the rest of the group can’t hear every word they say—and she needs to do it, just rip the bandaid off. “This is casual, Rio. It was never going to be more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally looks back at her, a few tears escaping as they roll down her face, languidly, like some part of Rio always knew this was going to happen, too. “You were never casual for me, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches as Rio wipes at her face and nods, defeat coating her every move. It tears something open inside Agatha’s chest, a gut-wrenching regret filling it up so quickly she reaches out as Rio tries to walk past her. “Rio—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re getting what you want, Agatha.” She pulls away until there’s nothing but space between them. “I’ll be sure to leave you alone from now on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha follows her a few steps, gaping as she watches Rio walk out the front door without looking back. It’s not until Jen is standing next to her that Agatha remembers she just put on a show. “You are such a fucking idiot, Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I really don’t want to hear it right now, Jen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shuffles awkwardly, pointing a finger over her shoulder. “I’m going to make sure she’s getting home safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia doesn’t say anything, just grabs the present Rio left behind and reads the label. She walks over and shoves it into Agatha’s chest. “Your Secret Santa gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shouldn’t we wait until—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia raises a hand, “I wouldn’t if I were you, Billy. Her claws are out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches the gift as Lilia walks away, the ghost of something Rio said once ringing in her ears:
     <em>
      A lonely, vicious woman clawing at the world around her and hoping that’s enough to call it love.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She falls into a nearby chair and stares at the wrapping paper; it’s a dark green with sprigs of mistletoe and holly, so very Rio that it aches. A voice in her head screaming not to open it, so she does. She could’ve guessed it was a book, but she didn’t expect it to be Rio’s book. Agatha runs a hand over the cover like it will absorb her loss, runs a fingertip over the impression of Rio’s name like an apology. Like there is a beacon pointing her in the right direction, because Rio has always been her lighthouse, Agatha flips open to the dedication and studies the pen marks, the way Rio scratched out the original to write a new one:
     <em>
      To Agatha, the only (non-fantasy) reader’s opinion I care about. I hope this changes your mind.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Only then—when she is left alone as the others move into the kitchen like it isn’t the site of Agatha’s ground zero—does Agatha let herself cry.

     <span>
      February blusters in cold and oppressive, chilling her down to the bone as she fights against the downtown wind. The water in the bay is deceptively beautiful even on this gloomy day, and Agatha lets herself take a deep breath of the breeze. She squares her shoulders, adjusts the misery sitting heavily on top, and keeps walking until she arrives at Covenant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The office sits inside some of the top floors, with views of the city like seen in space. Agatha barely notices as she breezes down the hallways, letting her steps match the rhythm of her own heartbeat, before coming to a stop outside Lilia’s door. It’s closed, which is unusual, so she knocks and waits for it to open; Lilia looks surprised to see her, which isn’t a good sign.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha—do we have a meeting today?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes? Billy emailed me to schedule a ‘check-in’ for the edits.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia doesn’t respond right away, shooting daggers at Billy who is cowering at his desk across the way. “He must have forgotten to put it on my calendar, then,” she grits out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wants to ask what’s wrong, but instead Lilia quickly ushers her inside the office and closes the door with a resounding thud. Agatha sits in one of the armchairs and waits for Lilia to settle back behind her desk, but after a few seconds of silence she grows impatient. “Well?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry I didn’t know you were coming all the way down here, or else I would have had more definitive notes for you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe you should fire Billy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not all of us are that callous, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She knows Lilia probably didn’t mean it that way, but it stings all the same. Lilia’s face drops as she realizes what she’s said, but Agatha just waves a hand. “Tell me your not-definitive notes then.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She half-listens to Lilia, her mind eventually wandering to Rio like it usually does. What she did is callous, it’s true, and the idea that’s all other people see her as sits uncomfortably in her chest. Is that what Rio thinks? That Agatha is cold, unfeeling, and incapable of compassion? She can’t stand the idea of Rio thinking of her like that, but it’s Agatha’s fault if she does. Every word, every move was to push Rio closer and closer to that inevitable conclusion, but it doesn’t feel as vindicating as Agatha thought it would. Instead, all she feels is lonely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She startles, eyes snapping back to Lilia’s as she tries to make it look like she was listening the entire time. “What’s up?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia sighs. “Get yourself together.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve never been more together in my entire life.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It would have been more convincing if her voice hadn’t cracked, but she’s hoping if she ignores it then Lilia will too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think you should go home and think long and hard about things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha narrows her eyes. “Something tells me we’re not talking about my book anymore.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You fucked up,” then Lilia’s face softens, “go home and think about why.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Swallowing around a lump, Agatha just nods—she’s not sure the next thing out of her mouth won’t be a sob—stands up, opening the office door and striding out before anyone else can see the way her face has crumpled in on itself. Halfway to the elevators, head down so she doesn’t have to make eye contact with anyone, she bumps into someone and stumbles. A hand reaches out to steady her and the sight of it makes her freeze, blood running cold as she looks up to find the very thing she’s running from.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The sight of Rio before her, after so long without it, feels like that first deep breath after breaking through the surface. It’s been two months of clean air, but she has missed the smell of Rio every day since.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There are dark circles under her eyes, and she’s never looked so tired, but Rio is still the most beautiful thing Agatha has ever seen, standing in the middle of Covenant House in a gray sweatsuit and a look of contempt Agatha didn’t know she was capable of.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio…” And she should say something more, something that will attempt to erase the pain she’s caused both of them, but Rio turns on her heel before she can get another word in. Agatha immediately follows, her body acting before her brain catches up. “Hey,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       wait
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio storms into the bathroom down the hall, Agatha hot on her heels. It is blessedly empty, and Agatha can see the way Rio closes her eyes for a brief moment in the mirror, then heaves a sigh and turns around. “I don’t really feel like talking, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A fissure appears somewhere in the desolation Agatha has been shrouded in for so long, the cracks filling up with anger; Agatha grasps onto it with all ten fingers and forges ahead. “That’s it, then? You don’t get your way and you throw a tantrum?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio takes a hard step closer, a fight sparking in the depths of brown Agatha is floundering in. “And that’s usually your move, isn’t it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She scoffs, determined to shovel another pile of dirt onto her open grave, already six feet deep and aching in a way she didn’t know was possible. “You’re blowing this way out of proportion and—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m allowed to be hurt, Agatha! Or does that not fall into your definition of ‘casual?’” Rio’s voice is full of fury, but what Agatha hears most is the pure anguish. It makes her want to reach out, that same urge she felt in Lilia’s kitchen two months ago, but Rio is already taking a step back and fixing Agatha with a glare. “You know what I think?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sure you’re about to tell me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think you feel the same way about me, and it fucking terrifies you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha narrows her eyes, hackles rising at the fact that Rio still has the ability to see right through her—even the parts Agatha tries to shield from the rest of the world, the parts she doesn’t let other people see because they have her ugly truths written all over them. “You don’t know a thing about me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio breathes out, a deep sigh through her nose, and moves to leave the bathroom, stopping next to Agatha to speak her final words right into her ear. “I hope your precious solitude is worth it in the end, when you wake up one day and—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Stop
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ,” and Rio does. Agatha can’t hear the rest of that sentence, not if she wants to pick herself back up and get home in one piece. Rio gives one more sidelong glare and then she’s gone, leaving Agatha alone—again—in the detritus of the mess she insisted on creating.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That evening Agatha allows herself to wallow, maybe even shed a few tears if the wine is particularly cheap, and she plays the saddest music she knows. She’s only just uncorked the bottle when her doorbell rings, and she wonders who the hell it could possibly be as she walks down the hallway to answer. The thought of Rio standing on the other side briefly crosses her mind, heart racing at the thought, but she doubts the world would be so shitty to make her cross paths with Rio twice in the same day. Then again, Agatha has done a lot to piss the world off, so.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it’s not Rio standing on the other side of her door—it’s Alice and Jen, holding a whole handle of vodka and a bag of Kit Kats. Agatha is momentarily dumbfounded, and Jen uses the opportunity to push past her with a huff. When she finds her voice again, she trails after them into her living room. “What the hell are you doing here? How did you even get in the building?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I slipped the doorman a fifty,” Alice says at the same time Jen quips, “We can smell your sadness across the entire island of Manhattan.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She already knows it’s useless to try and deny anything is wrong, just asks, “Do I even want to ask how you found out?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice sits on the floor and promptly opens the bottle of vodka, taking a swig. “Rio came into my office ready to jump out the window. Didn’t take a genius to put two and two together.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen settles on the couch behind Alice. “What happened?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sighs, sitting next to Jen and taking the proffered bottle from Alice, swallowing some down with a wince. “I fucked up.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That much was already clear,” Jen says, taking the bottle from Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We ran into each other and I may have said… some things.” Jen narrows her eyes, lips curling in distaste, and Agatha amends, “Okay, some
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       stupid
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was also pretty clear—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Look,” Alice interrupts, “if Rio found out I told you this she would kill me, but you need to know.” At Agatha’s expectant gaze, slightly glassy from the pull of vodka, she continues, “You hurt her.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know that—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, you
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       really
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      hurt her,” Alice interrupts, stopping Agatha mid-eye roll. “Did it ever occur to you that she doesn’t deal well with being abandoned by somebody she loves? The only thing Rio has ever known is loss, and then you come along and start to show her something different.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then you left her, too,” Jen interjects.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha does roll her eyes this time, partly because she can feel them welling up and the last thing she needs right now is to cry in front of other people. Her body misses the memo, though, because the tears slip down her face anyway. She pointlessly swipes a hand across her face, new tears replacing the old ones just as quickly. “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Falling for Rio? Or screwing it up?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Both? I don’t know.” Agatha waves her hand around, frustrated. “This is why I don’t do love, Jen.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice turns around to face them and grabs the bottle from Jen to take another drink before passing it back to Agatha. “Why not?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I never have, it’s just not who I am,” she says after swallowing another god-awful gulp.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Says who?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She grabs a Kit Kat to buy herself a few seconds and fumbles with the wrapper before throwing it across the room in frustration. “Fuck, I am not drunk enough for this.” Another drink. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Me
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , I say so.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It seems like Rio is different for you too, though.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s instincts tell her to oppose the claim, that nothing about Rio Vidal is different from any of the other women she’s entertained over the years, but she knows she can’t. Rio’s been singular since the moment they met. Jen lightly grabs her arm before she can think about that too long, eyes actually sincere as she looks at Agatha. “In the decade I’ve known you, I’ve never seen you even come close to falling in love—then she came along.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She laughs, she can’t help it, all watery and self-deprecating. “Something I wasn’t really planning on.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It never is.” Jen waves a finger between her and Alice. “Do you think we planned on this?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Your happiness makes me nauseous.” She takes another drink from the bottle—maybe a spot of liquid courage—and fiddles with the wrapper as she avoids their gazes. “I’m not sure I deserve something like that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her voice is soft, when Alice asks, “Why not?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And Agatha’s voice is just as soft, when she whispers a truth she’s been trying to escape her entire life: “Because I always ruin it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Life is not about what we
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       deserve
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Agatha,” Jen says, looking at Agatha like she really fucking means it. “It just happens, and we get to decide what to do with it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She still wants to fight against all this, her mouth opening and closing as she struggles to find the words to prove Jen’s well-crafted argument wrong. Alice sees her stumble, swats a hand against Agatha’s leg as she asks, “Do you remember what you said to me when my mom died?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not particularly.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice gives her a wry smile, stealing the bottle and taking a sip, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. “I was so pissed about everything, but especially that she had the audacity to just die like that. And I started taking it out on everyone around me, fuck the consequences, until one day you waltzed into my office. You said ‘this sucks, of course it does, but being angry isn’t going to bring your mom back, and pushing everyone away isn’t going to make that anger disappear.’”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes a deep breath, slow on the exhale as pieces of that conversation come back to her through the cloud of vodka. “Damn, did I really say that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You were the only one brave enough to call me out on my bullshit. Now I’m calling you out on yours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before she can say anything, Jen exclaims, “You, the captain of bullshit, cannot bullshit your way out of how abundantly clear it is to everyone how you feel about Rio.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans, dropping her head into her hands as these new truths begin to pierce through her brain like a fucking headache. “Oh,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       god
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      —”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Love is kind of embarrassing!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You just have to accept it and move on.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She lifts her head, delivering one last moment of candor before she puts the airtight lid back on all this until she’s ready to face it again. “Love is also scary.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The other two share a look, and Agatha wants to slap both of them, but then Alice turns to her and smiles softly. “Yes, but it wouldn’t be scary if it wasn’t worth it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They leave an hour later, Agatha’s tears finally dried as she falls into bed and passes out before she can do anything else stupid—like call Rio and ask her to hold Agatha until she falls asleep. Instead, she dreams of a day that never occurred, but the essence so familiar it may as well have. Rio is lying with her on Agatha’s couch, their laptops perched on their knees as they face each other and go back and forth with quotes from whatever it is they’re working on. They laugh, legs entwined, nothing more. Just existing in the same space, together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wakes up well into the next afternoon, chasing a high she didn’t know she had been craving.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      *
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She tells herself she’s not going to go, that it would be fucking insane if she does.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t mean to find out Rio was giving an exclusive, intimate reading of her new book ahead of its release—she just happened to be browsing the right website at the right time. So what if Rio happened to tell her once that it was her favorite bookstore—a small spot holed up in the Upper West Side that got Rio through her grad school days—Agatha was just doing her due diligence as an author to make sure they stocked all of her books. It’s only stalking if she actually shows up, and she most definitely is not.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s been a few weeks since that night with Jen and Alice, and every day has been spent wallowing around her apartment and muttering obscenities to herself because she has no one else to direct them at. She’s only left for groceries, and at this point she’s practically begging Billy over email for the next round of edits from Lilia. Her book is the only thing she has to occupy her mind right now, small reprieves away from the torment of knowing all the hurt she has caused and still not knowing what to do about it. This limbo feels endless, the solution just out of reach, and it is driving her fucking
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       insane
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . Her thoughts feel like falling snow, torrents in a blizzard, piling up until she is suffocated by the weight of them all. Of course, right when it matters most, she finds herself constantly choking on the answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So no, she should not go to Rio’s reading.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she does.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s nestled between two avenues, the bookstore, and unassuming on the outside. When she walks inside, though, relishing the warmth after enduring the latent winter frost, Agatha thinks she understands why Rio likes it here so much. It’s open and inviting, but still intimate in the ways the shelves climb the high ceiling, books lining them like fruit ripe for the taking. Agatha lingers near the tables adorned with the latest releases, fingers skimming over authors she knows and authors she doesn’t. She notices the stairs leading up to the second floor, a sign indicating that’s where the event is. Her pulse spikes, the distinct urge to flee overwhelming until she reminds herself that Rio never has to know she was here; she can stay in the back, out of sight and only listening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Finally finding the will, Agatha begins climbing the stairs as the chatter of the other attendees grows in volume, listening and  catching stray sentences of conversations about how excited they are to be here, to listen to the reading, to meet Rio. It causes something warm to spread through her chest, thawing nerves and arteries she didn’t even know were frozen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Half of the second floor has been cleared for chairs and a makeshift podium, Rio already standing behind it and talking to a few of the attendees in the first row. Agatha turns on her heel and walks into the closest aisle of shelves, peering around the corner to find just the right spot that will allow her to stay hidden, but giving just enough of a view of Rio. Someone walks by her and Agatha studiously peers at the books directly in front of her—Derrida’s
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       The Gift of Death
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      and Descartes’s
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       The Passions of the Soul
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , and jesus, is this the “boring aisle?”—mindlessly picking one off the shelf and opening it to a random page. Oh great, Aristotle’s fucking
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Poetics
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The din quiets down and somebody introduces the event, applause briefly overtaking their words as Rio blushes at her introduction. Something tugs painfully in Agatha’s thawing chest but she ignores it, just watches Rio as she approaches the podium and begins reading. The words are entrancing, of course they are, but the way Rio delivers them transports Agatha to a world she’s never known. The plot is hard to follow and it’s then she remembers she still hasn’t read the first book—the copy Rio gave her sitting vigil on her nightstand every night like a hex—but Agatha just listens to the cadence of Rio’s voice, lets it wash over her in a way she didn’t know she’d been missing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She listens, and then she watches as the reading ends and the questions begin, Rio taking her time to answer each one with such deliberate care and attention. She has the audience eating out of the palm of her hand, so intoxicating Agatha forgets she is supposed to be hiding. She retreats another step farther into the aisle, hiding her face in Aristotle’s words and trying to recall why she ever thought this was a good idea. She is officially a stalker now, certifiably insane and in great need of an escape route. She’s halfway through figuring out a plan to slip by unnoticed when another round of applause erupts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , she waited too long and the event is over, so now she’ll have to spend even longer in this fucking Western Philosophy aisle while she waits for the right moment to make a break for it. She needs to put as much distance between herself and this goddamn bookstore as quickly as possible, because now people are crowding around Rio, asking her to sign their books, and a few them look positively in love with her. A spike of jealousy rushes through Agatha until it’s overtaken by the bleak realization she has no right to be. She gave this up—gave
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      up—on purpose, and now she has to live with it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then Rio is nowhere to be seen, the masses of people providing enough cover for Agatha to hurry by and make her way back downstairs. She grabs a random book off one of the tables and purchases it quickly, hoping her sales contribution is enough to make sure the staff don’t think of her as some random whack job.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The cashier finishes ringing her up, a sudden glint of recognition in their eyes. “Hey, aren’t you—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope.” Agatha grabs the bag and rushes out the door, sending a quick prayer that this bookstore will never land on the list of places she has to visit on an upcoming book tour. It’s freezing when she gets outside, and she looks around for a moment at the dark and quiet block. It’s starting to snow, the flakes falling gently in front of the lone streetlight, and it’s almost peaceful. The door opens behind her then as people start filing out of the store, and she remembers that she needs to get the hell out of here. Walking a little further away, Agatha pulls out her phone and starts ordering a ride home, fingers numb against the screen as she shivers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re really bad at lurking.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She whirls around, Rio standing a few paces away as Agatha places a hand against her thundering heartbeat. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Jesus
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , fuck. Don’t do that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks unperturbed, hands in her coat pockets as she stands there. “What are you doing here, Agatha?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shuffles on her feet, fidgeting as she’s caught in the (stupid, unhinged) act. “I was in the neighborhood.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right.” Rio’s eyes flicker down and she nods her head towards the bag in Agatha’s hand. “What’d you get?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks down, suddenly aware she has no fucking clue. “Uh…” Agatha reaches into the bag to read the title and seriously, what has she done to deserve this kind of humiliation? Out of all the books on that table, this is the one she had to fucking pick? She looks back at Rio with a new flush to her cheeks. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Good Girl
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A smile briefly appears on Rio’s face, her tongue poking the inside of her cheek and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       god
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Agatha missed that so much. “Interesting choice.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugs, forcing a smirk onto her face she knows is not convincing at all, and unable to come up with an excuse that will convince Rio she’s not crazy for being here.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, well,” and now Rio shrugs, taking a half step away in the other direction. “If that’s all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She starts to turn around and that tug in Agatha’s heart turns painful, an unrelenting need to not have Rio walk away from her again. “Wait—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio spins back around, a hard edge to her eyes as she moves closer. “Are you actually ready to talk about this, or did you just want to twist the knife a little deeper?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrinks under the question. All the things she wants to say are mangled together, too massive to admit on a random night in the middle of a neighborhood she hasn’t been to in years, and looking at Rio like she might want to anyway. Then she remembers what Alice said to her, about the hurt she caused when she proved to Rio that everyone does leave in the end; Agatha closes her eyes against the pressure of not wanting to be right, just this once, and says the only thing she knows for sure: “I just wanted to say I’m sorry.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she opens her eyes a moment later, Rio looks pissed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s it?” When Agatha doesn’t say anything else—what can she say, that will fix this?—Rio does that thing where she laughs but nothing is funny, she just sounds sad. She takes another step closer to Agatha, hot and seething, and the closeness makes her breath hitch. “God, when was the last time you
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       risked
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      something? You can’t keep hiding yourself behind all those walls you built.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her impulse is to rebuff, to reject. “I don’t—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Save it, Agatha. I have been trying to scale them since the moment we met, just hoping I could catch a glimpse of you over the top.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The need to turn this around until it’s Rio’s fault is so instinctual she barely notices she’s doing it, and she fills herself with a counterfeit resentment that still does nothing to hide the grief in her voice. “Why do you want in so badly? Why isn’t what we had enough for you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Was it enough for
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ?” Rio lets her words settle in between them, the only sound their breathing as Agatha stares at her and wonders how she could have gotten this so wrong. “I need you to make a decision.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Agatha doesn’t answer, just looks at her in confusion, Rio continues, “I can’t keep doing this whole back-and-forth thing.” Then Rio meets her eyes, unwavering and so,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       so
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      wrecked. “I lose you either way. At least let me do it in peace.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This time, when Rio turns away, Agatha doesn’t stop her; she just watches as Rio walks down the block and turns the corner, shoulders hunched against the cold and all alone. Is this how it felt all those times she left Rio standing alone? The cavern in her chest she thought had been filled with cement is splintering open, her heart raw and bruised from the beatings she keeps putting it through. As she finally calls a car and waits under the light of a full moon, Agatha wonders how much more it can take.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>

      It’s not too late when she finally makes it home, but the quiet of her apartment is stifling and she needs to rid her mind of the evening. Shedding her coat and throwing it to a random corner of her bedroom, her eyes land on the book still sitting on her nightstand—waiting. Agatha picks it up and runs her fingers over the embossed words again as something snaps.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Walking into her kitchen, she pours herself a glass of whiskey before going back to her room and settling in bed. She takes a long sip, cracks open Rio’s book, and begins to read. It’s good—really fucking good, though Agatha would be loath to ever admit it to anyone—and she soons finds herself a hundred pages in and unwilling to stop. It takes until the middle of the night for her to finish, eyes starting to blur as she reaches the last page and smiles at the well-developed, perfectly placed cliffhanger. She couldn’t have written it better herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And tonight, when she dreams of Rio, it is on a dark and winding road in the middle of an inky forest, no one around for miles but them. It feels heated, and sorrowful, but the way Rio is looking at her makes Agatha think everything could be okay.

    <p>
     <span>
      Someone is shoving her, prodding at Agatha’s shoulder until she blearily opens her eyes against the bright sunlight streaming through the windows. Fear darts through her until she turns over and sees Lilia. “What the… How the fuck did you get in here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia furrows her brows like it’s a stupid question. “I had a spare key made years ago.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha blinks at her, brain trying to process what’s going on as she struggles against the fog of sleep still settled around her. “Why would—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For instances like these. I’ve got coffee brewing,” Lilia says, standing from the bed. “Up and at ‘em, Harkness!” She heads down the hallway, leaving Agatha to slowly get up and tie a robe around her waist. The scent of coffee leads her straight into the kitchen, Lilia’s back to her as she pulls down two mugs from the cabinet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there some secret group chat that lets you guys know when I’ve done something to upset Rio? Because at this point it’s no longer coincidence.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia ignores her. “Sit.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha considers ignoring her but she’s too tired to put up much of a fight, just slides into one of the barstools as Lilia fixes their coffees. When she’s done, she sits down next to Agatha, setting the mugs on the counter. Agatha lets the silence linger, already dreading whatever this conversation will turn out to be, but she’s never been good at letting quiet go unfilled. “I’m assuming this isn’t about the book?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This house call is far more personal.” Before Agatha can respond, Lilia continues, “What are you so afraid of?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She scoffs, “I’m not afraid of anything.” It’s another impulse, this false show of bravado, and Lilia knows that better than anyone. She simply stares at Agatha, eyebrow raised and waiting for her to continue. Agatha looks away, trying to find the words to express everything she has been harboring for the last six months. There is nothing she can hide from Lilia—who has always been far too astute in her observations for Agatha’s liking—but especially now that she’s read Agatha’s memoir. It feels like microdosing the vulnerability she will feel once it’s actually published, and what’s peculiar is that Agatha doesn’t want to break out into hives at the mere thought. Maybe this is growth, and maybe she can finally be honest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes a sip of her coffee, then takes a deep breath, and looks Lilia in the eyes. “My mother was not a good person, you know that. For years she made me feel so unworthy, so
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       shameful
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , and at some point I had to believe her or I was going to drown all alone in that fucking house.” Tears brim her eyelids but she refuses to let them fall, not now—and not over a woman that never deserved it. “I was a kid, Lilia.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Her
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      kid. What choice did I have, other than believe her?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia purses her lips, appraising. “Do you still think that’s true?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What if it is?” Her voice cracks and it kills her, the way her mother still has the ability to break her like this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Your mother was a horrible person, yes, and you endured years of her abuse. But that doesn’t mean she gets to decide you’re unworthy the rest of your life.” Lilia reaches out, grabbing one of Agatha’s hands. “Are you going to let her ruin another good thing, or are you going to finally tell her to fuck off?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looks away, shaking her head. “Giving into this, into Rio, it just—I don’t know. It feels like I’m giving a part of myself up.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia squeezes her hand until she looks back up. “You weren’t born with this rage, Agatha, or this undeniable urge to destroy everything. You had to learn how to protect yourself, but you don’t need to do that anymore.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She nods, letting her argument fall by the wayside against Lilia’s determination and her heart laid bare on the counter in front of them. Agatha lets herself sit in the uncomfortable knowledge that not everything needs fighting against. She tries not to, but a tear escapes anyway, and she likes to think it’s not over the mother who never loved her, but for the girl that needed it.

    <p>
     <span>
      A month later, she (unfortunately) finds herself at lunch in the West Village with Lilia, Jen, Alice, and fucking Billy. He’s been following them around like a lost puppy lately, and Agatha doesn’t know how much longer she can stand it before she ends up killing him. Though she would be lying if she said she wasn’t flattered by his constant admiration of her work.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s barely taken the first bite of her burger when Alice comes in, guns blazing. “Are you going to the launch next week?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She glares, swallowing a mouthful of food and indignation. “Didn’t know I was invited.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I basically hand delivered the invitation,” Lilia says.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha picks at the lettuce on her burger, studiously avoiding eye contact with anybody as she mumbles, “I don’t think she wants me there.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You wouldn’t have been invited otherwise,” Alice retorts. Then, more sincerely, “She cares about you, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy smiles, far too big. “What if you wore something really nice? Like a suit without a shirt—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright,” Agatha cuts in, “let’s not lose the plot here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You mean the one where you crashed and burned your entire life to the ground?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Yes
      </span>

     <span>
      , Jennifer. That one.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think you should go,” Alice encourages. “Think of it as an olive branch.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “One I’m sure she’d like to strangle you with.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha flashes Jen a lethal smile. “Aw, is that one of your little kinks?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia sighs, “I’m trying to eat.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, I’m only going to say this once—because as your agent I’m contractually required to make sure you don’t royally fuck up your life—for fuck’s sake, just
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       do
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      something. You’ve been moping around for months and I’m tired of dealing with it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Agatha can respond with an insult or a knife to Jen’s throat, Lilia agrees, “She’s right. If your memoir has taught me anything it’s that you’re extremely adept at keeping everyone at arm’s length. You just need to believe the good thing will work out.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is this lunch or a fucking fortune reading?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Both,” Alice and Jen say at the same time. The smiles they give each other makes Agatha want to vomit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If it’s any consolation,” Billy pipes up, “any time Rio comes into Alice’s office for a meeting she looks all sad and heartbroken.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that supposed to make me feel better, Teen?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       twenty-
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      two,” he grumbles, but Agatha ignores him. It doesn’t make her feel better, the idea that she has hurt Rio to such a degree. There have been endless moments in the last month when she has wanted to call Rio and profess something stupid—like her feelings. Agatha can feel a breaking point coming, a very thin line just up ahead, in which her emotions will get the better of her because everything she feels borders on the wrong side of too much. She has
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       always
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      felt too much in regard to Rio, but what Agatha has slowly realized is that it’s balanced by the feeling she might never have enough—of her, of them, of the way Rio feels like coming home. It is so bone-deep and horrifying, these two halves of her, and the result is a paralysis so hard to break she might as well be pulling out her own fucking teeth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia interrupts her thoughts. “He’s got a point.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what fucking point is that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That you’re going to the party,” Jen says.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you my handler now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Pretty sure I always have been, which wouldn’t be necessary if you didn’t need to be
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       constantly
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      handled.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, did you see that?” Agatha gasps and points a finger toward the front of the restaurant. “It was your commission flying out the window.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice intervenes, “The launch starts at seven.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just remember what I said,” Lilia speaks, narrowing her eyes in Agatha’s direction.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen nods, “And what I said.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Me too.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I knew you planned those heart-to-fucking-hearts with me,” Agatha responds, shoving a handful of french fries in her mouth to cover up the way her cheeks are, mortifyingly, burning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy smiles again. “This is the final part of the sequence.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ganging up on you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Think of it as an intervention.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Or the grand opening of a new door.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I hate you every single one of you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you think you use insults as a deflection tactic?” Billy leans across the table and
     </span>
     <em>

      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , he’s actually pulling out a fucking notebook and a pen. “I’m doing research on the psyche of trauma victims for my latest—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha grabs her fork and points it in his direction, effectively shutting him up. “I will stab you with this repeatedly until I see the light drain from your beady little eyes, and then I will
     </span>
     <em>

      Ten days later she finds herself in the back of an Uber and on the verge of panic attack. She’s an idiot, she doesn’t know why she’s doing this—putting on her favorite suit just to walk into Rio’s party and make a fool of herself—and it’s only now she’s realizing all the fucked up decisions she’s made in her life that have led her here.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure, Rio technically invited her, but Agatha doesn’t think she actually wants her there. Would she want Rio there if the roles were reversed? No,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       hell
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      no. (She would. She wants Rio everywhere, all the time.) Maybe she can get away with hugging the perimeter, nursing a glass of wine all night as she stays on the outskirts without fully entering the whole sphere. If she’s nice enough, she could convince Lilia or Alice to stay by her side; Jen would tell her to fuck off if she asked, and Billy would be too annoying. It’s better than no plan, and she just about has her breathing under control when the car finally pulls to a stop.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her stomach drops when she takes in the hotel the event is being held at; she’s refused to let herself think this far ahead and she’s starting to wonder if going in unprepared was a good idea or not. Agatha briefly considers asking the driver to ram into the nearest concrete blockade, but no, it’s too late. What if he has a family? She needs to suck it up, put on a brave face, and just get absolutely wasted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The event space is decked out when she finally makes her way inside after (literally) dragging her feet, all purple and green lighting against the fake trees spread out to make it look like the world inside Rio’s books. It’s honestly impressive how accurate it seems, and Agatha finds herself smiling at how perfect it all is. It’s exactly how she pictured it when she read it, and part of her is (embarrassingly) excited to read the next installment. God, just shoot her now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Now
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , because Rio is suddenly in front of her and
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       holy
      </span>
     </em>
     <em>
      <span>
       fuck
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      —she’s wearing a black, sleeveless jumpsuit that hugs her in all the right places. It takes a second for Agatha to pull her eyes away from the material clinging to Rio’s body before meeting her eyes, and if she didn’t know any better she would say there’s a trace of amusement in that shadowed brown.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her tongue feels heavy and she doesn’t trust herself to not say anything humiliating, so she settles for a simple, “Hi.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks like she wants to say something important—her eyes roam across Agatha’s purple suit, tailored to perfection
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       and
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      with a shirt underneath, despite Billy’s protests—but she settles for pleasantries too. “Nice of you to come.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nice of you to invite me,” and seriously, she needs someone to put a gun to her head
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       right
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” Rio shrugs, “you did help with that one bit in chapter seven.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, a tight smile stretching across her face as she remembers the exact circumstances when she did that, flashes of Rio’s fingers inside her burning a trail down her body. “Right.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well then, see you later.” Rio walks away before she can say anything else, the sway of her hips hypnotic even as Agatha is mentally berating herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Smooth.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She jumps a little, heart racing as she turns around to find Alice with a stupid smirk on her face. “Is it your height that allows you to sneak up on people? Because in those boots I should be able to hear you from a mile away.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice ignores her. “The night is young, Agatha,” she sing-songs. “There’s still time to get your girl.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She is not
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>

      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, I’m sure,” she says sarcastically, nodding at Agatha like there’s a joke somewhere in this conversation. She, too, walks away before Agatha can say anything and her fingers itch with the distinct urge to punch somebody. She can see Billy walking towards her in her peripherals, and what a perfect victim he would make.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is this a good time?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snaps, “Does it look like a good time?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There’s your answer.” Agatha turns away slightly, hoping he’ll get the hint and leave, but he just keeps looking at Agatha all hopeful and earnest. It cracks open a small (minuscule, barely there) hole in her heart. “Fine. What is it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was wondering if you’d be willing to look over that essay I was telling you about at lunch? I admire your work so much and I know you would be honest—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Brutally so.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right. So I wanted to ask. Just in case. Because you never know.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her first impulse is to say no—no fucking way, not even with a gun to her head and a fire under her ass—but Billy keeps looking at her with his stupid eyes and that stupid smile. Despite all her efforts to ignore him, he has somehow managed to impress Agatha in the last few months with his work helping Lilia on editing. She sighs, regretting the words before they’ve even left her mouth. “One—
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       one
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      —fucking essay, kid. Got it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you, thank you, thank you!” He looks like he’s about to hug her and she puts a hand out to stop him, awkwardly patting his shoulder instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t mention it, Teen. Ever.” She glares at him until he takes the hint, scurrying away into the throngs of people. She gives herself this second alone, taking a sip from her glass of wine and breathing deeply until she feels her heartbeat slow to a more manageable level. Then of course, in the way only Rio can do, she suddenly stands out like a spotlight across the room. A summoning, a beacon—so many different names and the result is always the same: Rio, simply there. She throws her head back as she laughs at something Lilia says, her smile radiant and so beautiful. That hole in Agatha’s chest splits open again, her heart barely hanging on by a thread inside, but instead of letting it ache she wants to fill it up with warmth—
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Rio’s
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      warmth. As much of it as Rio will allow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It hits her then and there, almost as abruptly as when Agatha realized she was in love with her, and it settles so fervently that she can’t ignore it anymore: she’s a fucking idiot. The only reason they are both still hurting is because Agatha has spent so long agonizing over what to do. Maybe she will never know the correct solution to this. Maybe there is never going to be a right time, and she will never know the perfect thing to say. But she can let herself stop fighting this and simply fall into it, trusting Rio will catch her because Rio—
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       god
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Rio. Agatha loves her so much and she wants to be terribly selfish, she wants to show Rio all the parts of herself that she hides because something twined into her central nervous system is telling her that Rio won’t turn away screaming. Agatha is so, so tired of running  and her love has not waned like she thought (or hoped) it would, it has only grown like Rio is a fucking root system, and now Agatha is absolutely covered in her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is inescapably and unquestionably in love with Rio fucking Vidal. She might actually be the love of Agatha’s life. It’s a yawning truth she faces despite the terror of somehow knowing, like it’s carved into her bone marrow, that this love between her and Rio runs so deep it feels like it’s been building over centuries—like they have been waiting lifetimes to finally find a time to get it right. Maybe this time they will.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The thought feels like a decision, and now Agatha needs to do something about it; she needs to go over there and interrupt whatever conversation Rio and Lilia are having because she cannot let another second go by letting Rio think anything else. She takes a few steps, intention lining her frame, when somebody brushes up behind her. Agatha jerks her arm away, relaxing slightly when she sees it’s Jen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was nice of you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks away, trying not to lose sight of Rio. “What was?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I overheard you talking to Billy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looks back at her, surprised for a moment before she brushes it off. “I’m not all bad.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No,” Jen agrees. But then, “Just mostly.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She squints her eyes, momentarily forgetting her purpose as irritation flickers through her. “Can I help you with something?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just because you piss me off sometimes—actually
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       all
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      the time now that I think—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there a point somewhere in that sentence?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen huffs. “Just because you’re a pain in my ass, it doesn’t mean I don’t care. Or whatever,” she finishes, rolling her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gasps, loud and mocking, hand over her heart and everything. “Wow, are you going to braid my hair next? Should we do each other’s nails?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So caught up in her taunting, Agatha didn’t realize Jen was slowly steering them forward until it’s too late—until they’re planted right in front of Rio and Lilia.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio!” Jen wraps her up in a hug and it makes Agatha’s skin crawl. “Congrats, this party is killing it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio quickly raises her eyebrows, smiling. “I’ve always wanted to kill somebody.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorts, fighting against the fond smile she feels threatening to make an appearance. Jen just frowns, pointing over her shoulder blindly. “Oh look, I think Alice needs me to rescue her from a Salem Seven agent.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I should’ve burnt their business to the ground when I had the chance,” Agatha grumbles.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You do seem to have a knack for burning things down,” Rio says, pointedly looking at her. Agatha tenses, habitually tensing her shoulders in preparation for a fight until she remembers that she is supposed to be done fighting Rio now. Suddenly adrift without her favorite defense mechanism, she ignores Rio to eye Lilia until she gets the hint to
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       say something
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      and save Agatha from this mess she only seems to be compounding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, Lilia whips her phone out of her pocket. “Oh, shit. Billy’s calling me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha just stares at her. “He’s not. I can literally see him over there chatting up Ocean Vuong.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Lilia is already halfway across the room, yelling out, “Duty calls!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Something clicks inside her brain then, the situation all too familiar. “I’m starting to think they’ve been playing the long game,” she comments. Not exactly to Rio but in her general direction as she watches her supposed friends gather around the open bar and surreptitiously glance in her direction.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And how’s that working out?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha finally looks at Rio again, caught off guard by how genuine the question sounds. Her breath catches when she remembers what she came over here to do, her confidence slowly draining in the face of it. But if anything, Rio deserves her honesty, and it’s that thought that finally compels her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can we go somewhere more quiet?” When Rio hesitates, she hastily adds, “Just to talk, I promise.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks down, tucking a stray hand of hair behind her ear. “I’m not sure I have anything left to say.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha considers listening and letting Rio go, but love is not unlike jumping off a cliff, and so much easier when you have a hand to hold on the way down. Maybe if she says enough of the right thing, even if it’s not perfect, Rio will grab her hand anyway. So she lets a quiet desperation coat her throat, a soft “Please?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio meets her eyes, intently lingering as she weighs her options. It feels like years before she finally nods, and Agatha lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. Eyeing the different options, Agatha finally inclines her head towards a door leading out to the balcony. Once outside the noise of the party is a mere hum, and everything feels bigger in the silence. Agatha takes a second to look up at the sky, wondering what stars are overhead even though they aren’t visible. She sends a prayer to whichever ones are listening that she can find the courage to do this. She can be vulnerable here, on this balcony with Rio, who is shivering against the residual chill of a nighttime in late spring.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes off her blazer, daring to tread closer to wrap it around Rio’s shoulders before taking a step back. She fiddles with the buttons of her shirt near her wrist, pretending not to notice the way Rio wraps it tighter around her body and takes a deep breath.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You were right, you know.” Agatha keeps fidgeting, buttoning and unbuttoning. “You scare me. So much. And that’s scary—well, shit.” She drops her hands and finally faces Rio, frustrated with herself. “I don’t know how to do this, Rio. I feel like I missed the window and now I’ll never know how to—how to
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       be
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      with someone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stares, unblinking like she’s trying to discern whether or not Agatha is telling the truth. Agatha tries to drop her walls, letting the melancholy stain the color of her eyes so Rio knows that she has never said anything so faithfully true in her life. Rio must see it, the way Agatha is trying, because her face crumbles under the weight of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha…” Rio reaches out like she wants to grab her hand, and Agatha has never wanted to be touched so badly in her life. “I’m not asking you to have everything figured out or to be some perfect partner. I just want
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But I’m terrified,” and she fucking whimpers, because here she is feeling everything too much again, and she is trying so hard not to drown.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chokes back the tears she feels pooling on her eyelids, willing her voice not to break even though it does. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Losing
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s not going to happen,” and finally, Rio grabs her hand and pulls her closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You can’t promise that. You said it yourself, all things have to end. Why is this any different?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She is desperate now, all but begging Rio to tell her she is wrong. Rio brings a hand up to cradle her jaw, and she leans into the warmth of it, willing it to never end.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tilts her head up, waiting until Agatha meets her eyes to spill her own honesty. “Because I love you—and I think you love me too—and I’m willing to risk that hurt if it means I get to spend just another second with you.” Rio cups her face then, determined. “You make me want to risk things, Agatha, and that makes all the difference in the world.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha lets it wash over her, a serenity so sweet that she can’t help but smile. “I’m not going to be good at this,” but it doesn’t sound like she’s fighting it anymore. It sounds like she’s giving in—and maybe it was never about giving up a part of herself, but letting Rio rewrite it into something more whole.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio lets out a breath it sounds like she’s been holding for months. “We’ll learn.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This isn’t going to be easy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You think I don’t know that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I might try to run away,” and she lets out a watery laugh that Rio returns.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I will, too.” She hugs Agatha then, gathering her close and whispering into her ear, “I just want us to talk about it so we can figure it out together. I want us to talk because I like the way you speak—because I
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       love
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pulls back, cradling Rio’s face in the palms of her hands. She looks at her, really looks at her, for what feels like the first time. She traces the lines and the crevices, lingering over each one because she has the time. “I love you, too,” and it doesn’t feel like an execution to admit it. It feels like existing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And finally, finally—Rio leans in and kisses her, their lips slotting back together like no time has passed at all. It is messy and both of them are probably crying, but Agatha just runs her hands through Rio’s hair and chants
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       I love you I love you I love you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      against her mouth until it’s no longer a question.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, lovebirds!” Agatha pulls back and tries to gather her senses against the image of Rio love drunk and swollen, spotting their friends leaning out the door. “I’m so happy you finally figured your shit out, but this is still Rio’s book launch.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She groans, letting her head fall onto Rio’s shoulder. “Ugh, fuck
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       off
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , Jen.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s right,” Lilia yells. “There are speeches to be made!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice nods, “You can wrap this up later—preferably in your house, with no one else around.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha blushes and thanks god no one but Rio can see it. She relinquishes her hold and gives Rio a nudge towards the door. “Go, before they throw us off of here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiles, pecking her lips one last time before going back inside. Agatha trails after her, slowly and satisfied. She catches up to Jen and Alice just in time to overhear them bickering with Billy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You owe me fifty bucks.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, I said if they
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       do
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      —”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You clearly said if they
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       don’t
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha interrupts, “How about I kill all of you and no one gets the fifty bucks?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy at least has the decency to run away. Alice and Jen just look at her smugly, making her contemplate how quickly she can buy a gun.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later, after a long car ride spent holding hands and watching the streetlights pass over each other’s faces, Rio walks through Agatha’s door and it isn’t the last time. They go right to the bedroom, leisurely shedding their clothes along the way because they have
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       time
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      now, and so much of it. When Agatha tries to push Rio onto the bed, Rio shakes her head, flipping them around until Agatha’s knees buckle against the bed frame. It only takes one glance at Rio to realize she needs to yield tonight, to let Rio take and give whatever she needs from Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s not until Rio is three fingers deep inside her, hand on Agatha’s throat and sweat beading across her forehead that she says it: “If you ever pull that shit again, I will make sure you regret it until the day you die.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha whimpers, gasping against Rio’s mouth because she’s so close. All she can do is nod, scrambling her hands down Rio’s back in desperation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio squeezes the hand around her throat until Agatha opens her eyes. “Say it, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She chokes against the feeling of Rio pressing a thumb against her clit and all it will take is one slight circle for her to come, but she knows Rio won’t give it to her until she manages to speak.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I won’t, baby. I love you, I love—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then she does it, she lets Agatha come with Rio’s name falling from her lips like a benediction.
     </span>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later, later—when they’re wrapped up in the sheets and each other—Agatha falls asleep and doesn’t dream of anything at all.
