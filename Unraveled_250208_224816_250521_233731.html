<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of being with a woman had once seemed impossible to Agatha Harkness-a
            door locked tightly and never to be opened. After all, she was 48 years old, for Christ's sake.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, without so much as a warning, Rio Vidal, a first-year associate, strode into
            her perfectly controlled life and blew Agatha's closet door off its damn hinges.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marching Ever Forward</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness strode through the crowded lobby of a towering skyscraper, her heels
            clicking rhythmically against the polished marble floors. The place buzzed with life-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">executives in tailored suits, assistants juggling coffee and laptops, all part of the
            Fortune 500 empires that called this building home. Legends had walked these very floors. But as she moved,
            the sea of people parted, instinctively clearing her path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her signature purple coat, vibrant and bold, sliced through the sea of black and
            white, a startling contrast that drew eyes in her direction. She felt their glances, the flicker of
            curiosity before they quickly looked away. She relished it-the acknowledgment, however brief, that she was
            someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered being a child, dreaming of being a superhero, of wielding magic,
            saving the day, and standing above mortal men. But that was fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magic didn't exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Power, though-that was real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she had it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached the elevator, watching with delight as the crowd instinctively parted,
            people stepping back to give her space. They pressed against one another, clinging to the edges,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoiding any accidental contact with her. Untouchable-that's what she was. And
            they knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doors slid shut, and the elevator was engulfed in a heavy silence, the kind that
            made the air feel thick. She could feel them holding their breath, as though they feared making the
            slightest sound. Each time the doors opened at a stop, there would be a soft shuffle of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">apologies as they hurried out, clinging to the walls, moving briskly as if their
            lives depended on it. And as they crossed into their floors, she could hear their quiet, collective
            sighs-relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had survived a ride in the elevator with her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Witch of Wall Street.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, the term irritated her. A witch? As if she relied on magic or illusion to
            get to where she was. But then she understood. It wasn't her presence they doubted-it was the control
            she commanded. The icy stillness that filled the room the moment she walked in, the subtle shift in posture,
            the way conversations died on people's lips. Her arrival wasn't seen-it was felt. A chill that made
            everyone sharpen their focus, as if they could sense the power she carried in her wake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't invisible; she was inescapable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't just win cases or close deals-she devoured them. She dismantled
            everything in her path, leaving no room for her opponents to recover. When she entered a courtroom, it
            wasn't just about money; it was about domination. She didn't simply defeat people-she unraveled
            them, stripping away their confidence, their sense of self, leaving nothing but a hollow shell of who they
            once were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't just win; she consumed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha Harkness stepped into a courtroom, she didn't just take your
            money.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took your power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could see it in their eyes-the fear, the uncertainty. And she thrived on
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She clenched her jaw tightly, feeling her patience fray with every stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was one of the few downsides of being on the top floor-the slow crawl as the
            elevator emptied floor by floor. She had considered, more than once, simply telling everyone to get out and
            let her ride alone. They would listen. No one questioned her. But then, she'd miss the fear-the way the
            tension thickened in the small space, the way they avoided eye contact, pressing themselves against the
            walls as if she might devour them whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was entertaining. Still irritating, yes, but in a way, it was the best part of her
            morning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watching them squirm, watching the unease crawl across their faces, knowing she
            caused it. They feared her without her saying a word. Just her presence was enough to unsettle them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small price to pay for the thrill.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she reached the 70th floor and stepped out into the sprawling office of
            Calderu, Wu- Gulliver, Kale, and Harkness. A mouthful of a name. When she became a partner here a decade
            ago, she fought to have her name at the front. They refused, of course-too much history, too much ego. At
            first, it irritated her, the thought of being tacked on like an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">afterthought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, she realized something-she liked being at the end. It was fitting.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't just another name; she was the period. The final word. The exclamation
            point that closed the deal. After her, there was nothing left to say, no argument left standing. She was the
            one who ended it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was power in that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha walked with purpose, her heels clicking sharply against the polished marble
            floor as she moved toward her office. It was in the corner, of course-like she would have anything less. The
            floor-to-ceiling windows offered a sweeping view of the city, a view befitting someone who had clawed her
            way to the top.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she passed by the rows of desks, she could feel the silence in her wake, a ripple
            of stillness that followed her like a shadow. The underlings-the junior associates and paralegals, working
            furiously to finish their briefs, draft arguments, and scour case law-fell silent as she approached. Fingers
            that had been typing with frantic energy slowed, then stopped altogether. Conversations ceased, and the only
            sound left was the faint rustle of papers being shuffled and the occasional throat being cleared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They tried to appear busy, as if they hadn't noticed her, but she knew better.
            Desperation clung to them like a second skin. They all wanted to make their mark, to impress, to be</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">noticed-but not by her. Not like this. They understood that if she stopped to speak
            to them, it wasn't going to be for a pat on the back. And they feared what it would mean if her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention landed on them at the wrong moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She relished their nervous energy, letting it fuel her as she continued
            walking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the hall, just outside her corner office, her assistant, Billy, was
            waiting, standing dutifully with coffee in hand. She barely glanced at him as she approached. Billy-or
            "Pet,"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">as she often called him, with a mix of amusement and indifference-was always there,
            just like this. Silent, obedient, reliable. Like a well-trained dog, always eager to please.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Morning, Ms. Harkness," he said, his voice soft, as if afraid to break the
            unspoken rule of quiet that followed her. He held the coffee out, the cup already perfectly to her
            liking-black, hot like the searing sun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took it without a word, without so much as a nod of acknowledgment. Billy
            didn't need one. He existed to serve, and she had no use for gratitude. He was there because he
            understood the rules. She was everything in this office, and everyone else was just playing for
            scraps.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With her coffee in hand, she breezed past him, the silence trailing behind her like a
            heavy shadow. Billy followed a few steps behind, his voice steady as he recited her schedule for the day. He
            had been with her for five years, long enough to understand the rhythm of her world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy wasn't like the others who feared her from a distance. He was afraid, of
            course-how could he not be? But it was a different kind of fear now. It had settled into him like a coal
            miner's acceptance of the dark. He wasn't scared of the shadows anymore; he'd spent too long
            walking in them by her side. He had learned to thrive in that cold, oppressive quiet, but he also knew the
            danger of digging too deep, of pushing too far. He understood better than</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anyone the kind of collapse Agatha could bring down on him if he made a single wrong
            move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your 9 a.m. is a meeting with Gulliver," Billy started, his voice low and
            professional. "They're still pushing back on the terms from yesterday's negotiation, but
            it's expected. I've prepped the latest drafts for review."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't react, her gaze fixed ahead as she glided into her office.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"At 11, you have a call with the board of ZanderTech to finalize the
            settlement." Billy</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued, falling into step beside her now, keeping his voice even, always careful
            not to overstep. "Then the lunch meeting with Judge Kellerman to discuss the new financial</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rulings."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave a slight nod, the barest flicker of acknowledgment, but Billy didn't
            need more. He had learned long ago that the absence of her displeasure was the closest thing to approval he
            would ever get.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And at 2 p.m.," he added, lowering his voice slightly, "you're
            scheduled to meet with the legal team from Morrison &amp; Blake. They've requested a sit-down regarding
            the new</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acquisition."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A slight twitch of her lips. Billy knew that twitch. She was anticipating a
            battle-and battles were her lifeblood. The legal team from Morrison &amp; Blake had no idea what storm they
            were walking into.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy continued, meticulously marking off each meeting between now and her 7 PM
            dinner with a new client. Agatha abhorred these kinds of schmoozing dinners, the fake smiles, the idle
            pleasantries. But it was how the firm stayed ahead. More money, more revenue-those meant more power. And
            power was always worth a little work, even if she despised it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fought the urge to rub the bridge of her nose, feeling the dull ache of a
            headache starting to creep in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another late night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's going to be disappointed-again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was her week with him. Shared custody with her ex-husband meant her son was
            dropped off at her doorstep every other week. And usually, she tried to keep her schedule in check when he
            was around. Billy knew this. If she had a meeting tonight, it wasn't by choice-it was because Billy had
            no other option. He didn't make mistakes. Not with her. Not ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a long sip of her coffee, trying to stave off the headache, drowning it in
            caffeine. It was a temporary fix, but it would keep her sharp for now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy's voice droned on in the background, listing tasks and schedules.
            "And..." Billy started, his voice faltering as it trailed off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes snapped to him, sharp and unyielding. Hesitation. Agatha hated hesitation.
            She despised weakness, uncertainty-the kind of doubt that poisoned potential. She thought she'd beaten
            that out of him by now. If Billy was going to become the diamond she knew he could be, he needed the heat.
            She flooded him with it, over and over. The pressure. The burn. It had nearly broken him-nearly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of her assistants couldn't take the heat. They quit before they even got
            close to greatness, wilting under the intensity, unable to handle the fire it took to truly become</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">something. But Billy had surprised her-not that she would ever tell him. He
            wasn't perfect, but he was a quick learner, and unlike the others, he always came back for more. More
            punishment, more pressure. Somewhere inside, he must have known she was molding him into something stronger,
            something worthy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hadn't slipped in a while. Which meant whatever he was about to say, he knew
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wouldn't like. That hesitation wasn't fear of the unknown-it was the
            certainty that he was about to disappoint her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speak, Pet," she said, her voice cutting through the silence like a finely
            honed blade. She could feel the tension radiating from Billy as he braced himself, gathering the courage to
            deliver whatever unfortunate news he had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy swallowed hard but kept his composure, though she could see the faint flicker
            of hesitation behind his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The new associates are here," he finally said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze flicked over his shoulder to the glass-walled conference room in
            the center of the firm-a glorified hamster cage. Inside, the freshly graduated associates stood awkwardly,
            shifting nervously, like the little rodents they were. Wide-eyed. Eager. Clueless. Her eyes snapped back to
            Billy, cutting through the moment with a cold, precise focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And that's my problem because...?" she drawled, her words sharp and
            bitter, like they left a bad taste in her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy gave the faintest flicker of a flinch, barely noticeable but there. His lips
            twitched, curling at the edges as he prepared to explain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kale's tied up in a deposition," he said, his voice carefully steady.
            "Her assistant called. She needs you to cover the introduction to the firm."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, irritation bubbling beneath her calm exterior. Of course,
            she thought. It had been years since she engaged with the associates. HR had all but barred her from the
            process-not officially, but after a couple of expensive settlements with a few fragile souls</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">claiming "emotional damage," her involvement was strongly
            discouraged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She scoffed internally at the memory. Weak. She'd barely done anything. Merely
            shown them what the real world was like. Apparently, not everyone had the stomach for it. So, HR had handed
            the task of introductions to the other partners, while Agatha focused on more meaningful work-like
            tightening the ironclad language of their contracts, ensuring no</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">associate would ever dream of suing again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The irony wasn't lost on her. Any lawyer worth their salt would've read the
            fine print before signing. If they didn't, well, they deserved the consequences. But these new recruits?
            They were too green, too eager to belong. They never looked past the first few pages, never questioned the
            terms, and by the time they did, it was too late. The firm owned them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flicked once more toward the glass conference room, where the
            wide-eyed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">associates stood, nervously fidgeting. The sight of them, so raw and uncertain,
            irritated her, yes-but there was also something oddly satisfying about it. It had been so long since she was
            allowed to play with the associates.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a certain thrill in it. Watching them squirm, watching the hope and
            ambition in their eyes slowly drain as reality settled in. They all came in thinking they'd change
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">world, that they'd be the exception to the rule. But by the time she was finished
            with them, they'd understand just how small and insignificant they really were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A part of her relished the opportunity. She could almost feel the anticipation, the
            way it tugged at the edges of her calm demeanor. It had been years since HR had stepped in, taking away her
            favorite pastime. But now, with Kale stuck in a deposition, the door was cracked open just enough for her to
            have a little fun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips curved into a sharp smile. Well, if they wanted an introduction to the firm,
            they'd get one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to Billy, her voice smooth but edged with a scowl, the irritation
            carefully played out on the surface, while the excitement churned deep inside, locked where it
            belonged.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never show your cards.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine," she snapped, setting her coffee down on her desk with a sharp click
            and shrugging off her coat. Billy was already stepping forward, ready to take it from her. She handed it
            over</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">without a glance, her attention shifting briefly to her reflection. High-waisted dark
            plum trousers, perfectly tailored, and a crisp white button-down tucked in. She cursed internally- if
            she'd known she'd be meeting the associates today, she would've worn something a little more
            intimidating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">More black, probably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never red.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Red was overrated. It washed her out, and besides, it carried too much cliché.
            Everyone thought power was red. But if you listened to the real whispers of Wall Street, the ones that
            floated through the corridors of power and wealth, they knew the truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The devil didn't wear red. It wore purple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tricks and Trials</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved through the firm's sleek, gleaming halls with her usual quiet
            intensity, her eyes locked forward as she closed in on the glass-walled conference room. Her fingers</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flickered subtly at her sides, an unconscious dance she could never quite tame. The
            restless energy was always there, simmering beneath her composed exterior, just out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a trademark of hers, something she knew people noticed but never dared to
            comment on. Her fingers had drafted ruthless agreements, shredded defense strategies, and left her opponents
            exposed in the aftermath. Now, as she neared the room of trembling associates, they moved again, eager for
            something-someone-to take apart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inside the glass walls, the fresh-faced associates stood in awkward clusters, their
            eyes darting through the glass as she approached. Even through the thick glass, she could sense their
            discomfort, the low hum of whispers breaking the otherwise tense silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They'd heard the stories. Of course, they had.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one applied to work here for the prestige of the other partners-formidable as they
            were in their own right. Everyone knew the truth: if you survived a year under her roof, you were cut out
            for the relentless grind of the law. This firm was her domain, her garden, and she meticulously weeded out
            the weak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't just demand excellence; she cultivated it. She pushed, tested, and
            tore apart those who couldn't keep up, leaving only the strongest to thrive. And every associate in that
            room knew it-they weren't just here to learn; they were here to survive her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched into the barest hint of a smile, her eyes glinting with a
            predatory gleam. This was her favorite part-the feeling of being watched, the knowledge that they feared her
            long before she ever spoke. It was why she'd insisted on the glass-walled</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">conference room the moment she became a partner. For this exact reason. So everyone
            could see her, circling like a predator, while her prey sat inside, trapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was more than a room-it was a stage. And she controlled the performance from the
            moment she stepped into view.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers stilled as she reached the door, hovering momentarily before she gripped
            the handle and pushed it open. The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly, thickening with the kind of
            tension she thrived on. Every head turned toward her, their eyes glued to her as she walked to the front of
            the room. Some stared with wide-eyed anticipation, others with barely concealed dread.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least twenty faces, fresh and eager, all waiting for her to speak. Fresh graduates
            from Ivy League law schools, handpicked for their brilliance and potential. This firm only took the best-on
            paper, at least. But Agatha knew better. By the end of the year, less than half of</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">these hopefuls would still be standing. The rest would be weeded out, broken by
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">relentless pressure she thrived on. Only one or two might prove worthy of her time,
            worthy of her trust to actual work a case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she reached the front of the room, she let her gaze sweep across them, lingering
            just long enough on each face to watch the anxiety ripple through them. They wanted to impress her. They
            needed to impress her. And she knew that fear would be their greatest motivator-or their undoing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the silence hang, watching the tension rise, her fingers moving again at
            her sides. They were waiting, and she always enjoyed making them sweat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Welcome to Calderu, Wu-Gulliver, Kale, and Harkness," she said breaking
            the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes swept across the room, a practiced, unimpressed gaze moving from
            one young face to the next. Designer suits on young men with haircuts far too expensive for their salaries,
            no doubt paid for by their parents. Women in skirts and dresses that screamed sorority more than law firm,
            posturing like they had something to prove. Agatha had a knack for sniffing out potential with just a
            glance, but as her eyes dragged across the room, she felt nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bored.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indifferent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monotony.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, something caught her attention. Someone, standing near the back-not huddled
            toward the front like the rest, not scrambling to make a good impression. Instead, there was an air of
            indifference, as if this whole gathering was beneath them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Older then rest. Early 30's, probably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned against the glass wall, casually, almost defiantly. Unlike the others, her
            outfit wasn't the standard corporate fare. A men's suit and a green tie.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her raven hair was pulled back, a few stray wisps falling down, framing a face that
            wasn't made up in the typical, polished way. No, this one wore eyeliner darker than appropriate, making
            no effort to blend in. And as Agatha zeroed in on her, her eyes narrowing in curiosity, she noticed the
            final detail that almost made her smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She's chewing gum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened, ever so slightly, her earlier indifference dissolving
            into intrigue. This one wasn't here to impress anyone. She wasn't here to beg for approval. And
            suddenly, Agatha wasn't bored anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Interesting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone shifted uncomfortably, the squeak of their shoe cutting through the silence
            like a blade. Agatha's eyes snapped to him instantly, her gaze sharp and unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Golden blonde hair, a chiseled jawline that seemed carved from stone, and a cocky
            smile that made her pause for a moment. He leaned back in his chair, too relaxed for someone in this</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, his posture screaming entitlement. Agatha's lips twitched, but not in a
            smile-more of a flicker of curiosity laced with disdain. She briefly wondered whose son he was, what strings
            had been pulled to get him here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Typical.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The arrogance in his expression told her he thought himself above the others. He
            wasn't here to prove himself. In his mind, he'd already arrived, sitting on a pedestal he hadn't
            even begun to earn. She'd seen it before-wealth, privilege, and a complete lack of understanding about
            how things truly worked in her world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes narrowed, and the cocky smile on his face faltered ever so slightly under
            her unblinking scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you are?" Agatha's voice sliced through the air, smooth and
            lethal, like a blade drawn just for him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blonde hesitated, caught off guard for a split second before straightening in his
            chair, his practiced grin faltering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jameson Hale," he replied, but the charm that dripped from his voice had
            lost its polish under her cold stare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hale. Agatha's mind sifted through the Rolodex of high-powered names and old
            money. Hale Industries-privilege passed down like a family heirloom. Generations of wealth, entitlement
            baked into his very being. He wasn't just a fresh Ivy League graduate-he was a product of legacy. But to
            her, he was just another arrogant boy who thought his last name was his ticket to power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's expression didn't shift. She tilted her head, her eyes narrowing as
            if seeing right through him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hale," she repeated, her tone devoid of any warmth. "How
            quaint." "My father is-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Stop," she interrupted, her voice sharp enough to cut him off
            mid-sentence. She didn't need to hear the rest. She already knew the story.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me save you the effort, Jameson," she made sure to say his name with
            as much venom as possible. "Your father, your money, your name-none of that matters here."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gestured around her, the sleek conference room that held the fate of every person
            sitting inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is not a country club where you can waltz in with your last name and
            expect doors to open."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped forward, closing the distance between them, her heels echoing like a
            death knell on the polished floor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Here's your first lesson, Mr. Hale," Agatha's voice dropped, cold
            and final, each word</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cutting deeper. "The law is brutal. Unforgiving." She paused, savoring the
            weight of silence, her gaze fixed on him. "But I? I'm worse."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit him like a blow. His bravado shattered completely, leaving him stripped
            of the confidence he'd carried in like armor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god, she relished it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped back from him, already dismissing him as if he were nothing more than
            an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">afterthought. He wouldn't last six months. She could see it now-he'd go
            crawling back to his father's company, where names carried more weight than skill. He wasn't worth
            another breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as she turned to move away, her eyes caught the woman at the back of the room.
            The one leaning against the glass, looking on with an amused smirk, as if she'd enjoyed the takedown
            just as much. Agatha forced herself to look away, returning to the task at hand, her gaze sweeping across
            the room, assessing the group of associates with an intensity that made the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">air feel heavier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good news for you," she said, her lips curling into a predatory grin that
            promised the opposite. She gestured with her hand, and the door swung open. Several senior associates</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">entered, carrying box after box, stacking them in front of the wide-eyed group. Each
            box hit the table with a thud, and Agatha's grin widened as the pile grew. It took a good 10 minutes
            before the final box hit the ground with a resounding thud.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is discovery for a case," she said, her voice rising as she gestured
            grandly to the nearly 100 boxes stacked before them, each one bursting with thousands of documents.
            "A</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">corporate espionage case-one of my finest." Her tone turned almost gleeful as
            she laid it out for them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Broken contracts, faulty products, and a payout that could rival a small
            country's GDP. The only problem?" She leaned forward slightly, her eyes glittering with malicious
            delight. "The company is a military weapons supplier with more influence in Washington than most
            senators, more money than God, and technology that could make us all disappear if they</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave a little shrug, feigning innocence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ergo, the million-document discovery dump they handed us. Buried us, really.
            These boxes? They've been sitting in storage for years. They've been combed through by people far
            smarter than any of you. But..." Her grin widened. "You? You're perfect for this."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the silence hang, letting them absorb the gravity of the task-and the
            impossibility of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You won't find anything," she said, her voice turning almost playful.
            "You'll dig, and dig, and dig until your hands bleed and your brains fry, and in the end,
            you'll realize you're</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chasing a ghost." She paused, savoring the dread she saw flicker in their eyes.
            "But here's the fun part," she continued, her voice dropping lower, dripping with dark
            glee.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you do-if you somehow manage to unearth something real, something no one
            else has found? I will personally mentor you. Build you. Mold you into something unstoppable."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched as her words landed, saw the spark of determination ignite in their
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perfect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the point, after all-to dangle a prize so alluring, yet so impossibly out of
            reach. She never-ever-took on associates. Everyone in the firm knew it. It was legend. To be personally
            mentored by Agatha Harkness was the ultimate reward, a gilded promise no one had ever claimed. But now, here
            it was, presented as if it could be theirs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She saw it-the greed, the hunger. The flicker of belief in their eyes, that glimmer
            of arrogance that whispered, I could be the one. The first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Agatha, it was a win-win. They would fail, and their failure would bring her
            satisfaction. Watching their determination dissolve into desperation would be entertainment enough. But
            if-by some inconceivable stroke of luck-one of them did manage to unearth something?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, then she'd have her white whale, wouldn't she?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that it would happen. Agatha had combed through those documents herself,
            meticulously. There was nothing there. She knew that. But letting them try was the perfect trap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wonderful, she thought. Oh, how delicious it would be to watch them throw themselves
            into this lost cause, clawing and scratching for something they would never achieve. The more they fought,
            the sweeter their inevitable downfall would be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her amusement faded, her voice turning sharp as her eyes narrowed to cold, predatory
            slits.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But if you fail..." She let the threat linger in the air, thick with
            tension. "Then you're nothing but another disappointment."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, watching their faces tighten under her gaze, before delivering the
            final blow with deadly precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And trust me when I say-I don't waste my time with
            disappointments."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed was heavy, almost suffocating. She could see the gears
            turning behind their eyes, the frantic calculations as they weighed their options. Already, the spark of
            desperation had flickered to life. They would chase her approval, pour themselves into this impossible task
            with everything they had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when they inevitably failed, it would mark them. The harsh reality would sink
            in-the precedent set. Working for Agatha Harkness wasn't just demanding, it was merciless. She
            didn't just push people to their limits-she obliterated them. And now, they would spend the rest of
            their year knowing exactly what that meant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smile tugged at the corner of her lips as she watched them fall neatly into
            the trap she'd crafted with such precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh yes, she thought, this is going to be magnificent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that, she stepped back, her presence still looming over them as she prepared to
            leave.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have 24 hours," she said, her voice sharp and theatrical, letting the
            tension linger for just a moment longer. Then, with a dramatic sweep of her hand, she added.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that final flourish, Agatha turned on her heel and strode out, leaving them to
            their fate. She didn't need to look back to know what would happen next-she could already imagine
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They'd be rushing forward, grabbing at the boxes, their faces lit with
            determination. And from the vantage of her office, over the next 24 hours, she would watch that
            determination slowly crumble into desperation as the clock ticked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached her office and sank into her chair, the leather cool against her back as
            she reveled in the impending crush of those tiny little associate hearts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Technically, she mused, I didn't threaten anyone. So HR wouldn't say a word.
            Another win in her book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Staring out at the cityscape, she reached for her coffee, took a sip, and grimaced-it
            had already gone cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Billy," she called, her voice cutting through the silence, and within
            seconds, he was there, practically running to her side. She didn't say a word, just lifted the cup. He
            took it immediately, and she heard the sound of his footsteps fading as he left to fetch a fresh one.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But something tugged at her mind. That smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That woman-the associate with the dark hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait-come back here," she commanded, her voice sharper now. Billy
            reappeared, quick as ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good pet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes drifted past him, toward the hamster cage. The gerbils were already
            at work, tearing into the boxes like scavengers, forming little teams to tackle the overwhelming load of
            documents. It was a smart move-expected, really. More eyes, more chances of finding something.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She scanned the room, and there she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the far end of the table, alone, she moved with quiet confidence, her fingers
            shuffling through the papers with an unhurried, methodical ease. Agatha watched, intrigued despite herself.
            And then, as if sensing her gaze, the woman looked up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c3">Their</span><span class="c1"> gazes locked, and then-she blew a bubble.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A large, obnoxious bubble with her gum, the pop, unheard, but still breaking through
            the silent tension. The woman's tongue flicked out, casually pulling the remnants of the bubble back
            into her mouth, all while maintaining eye contact with Agatha-and, of course, wearing that smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed into a sharp, piercing glare, the surge of irritation
            instantaneous. Who did she think she was? That casual arrogance... it was infuriating. She could feel her
            pulse quicken, annoyance boiling just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This one, she thought, is going to be fun to break.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another second wasted, Agatha tore her gaze away, refusing to give that woman
            the satisfaction of knowing she'd rattled her. But beneath her icy exterior, something unexpected
            flickered-curiosity, sharp and undeniable, a feeling Agatha hadn't entertained in years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then she realized Billy was still standing in front of her. She jumped,
            startled by his presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus," she snapped, her irritation spilling over. "Don't sneak
            up on me like that."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy, unfazed by her theatrics, remained silent, simply waiting as he always did.
            His calm demeanor only served to annoy her further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glared at him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Get me the personal file on the new associate-the woman with the black hair,
            wearing the black suit with the green tie."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy started to turn, instinctively looking for who she was talking about, but
            Agatha's hiss stopped him cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't turn around!" she hissed, her voice low and threatening. She
            didn't need that woman realizing she was under scrutiny. "Do you have a subtle bone in your body,
            pet?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy at least had the decency to look slightly ashamed, his cheeks tinged
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">embarrassment. He nodded quickly, and without another word, he hurried off to
            retrieve what she'd asked for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back in her chair, fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest,
            replaying that damn smirk in her mind. The nerve-to blow a bubble, to meet her gaze with such bold
            indifference. It should have enraged her. It did enrage her. But beneath the anger, something else
            stirred-something far more exhilarating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This must be what Godzilla felt like when he first laid eyes on a city ready to be
            obliterated. The anticipation, the hunger for destruction. A grin tugged at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't just going to tear that woman down. She was going to savor it-watching
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">confidence wither, her defiance crumble under the weight of Agatha's relentless
            pressure. It was going to be a spectacular fall, and Agatha would revel in every moment of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, this was going to be fun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Giveth Sight</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back against the plush leather seat of the town car, her fingers
            absently brushing over the fabric of her white button-down. She glanced down at it, noticing the few buttons
            she had left undone earlier in the evening. With a slight smirk, she buttoned two of them back up, pulling
            the collar higher.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Men.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were predictable, easy to manipulate. A little cleavage, a well-placed laugh at
            their terrible jokes, a subtle touch of her fingers on the rim of her glass as she sipped the bourbon
            they'd ordered-overpriced, of course, but they loved that kind of thing. Feed them</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expensive red meat and stroke their egos, and they practically signed the contract
            themselves. By the time dessert was over, all she had to do was let her reputation speak for itself.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, Larkin &amp; Reed Solutions was now the newest client of Calderu,
            Wu- Gulliver, Kale, and Harkness. A nice little $25 million addition to her already bulging
            portfolio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a quiet, satisfied sigh as the car slipped through the quiet streets, her
            eyes drifting to the city skyline. The deal had gone exactly as expected-smooth, seamless. Men in boardrooms
            rarely expected a woman to outmaneuver them with such ease. But Agatha had perfected the art long ago. She
            didn't need to play their game. She owned it. They never saw her coming, not really. They never
            understood that the moment she stepped into the room, they were already caught in her web.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind wandered back to the dinner. It had been like all the others-too much
            bourbon, too much ego. One of the men had spent ten minutes trying to explain blockchain technology to her,
            as if she hadn't already built a dozen successful cases around it. She'd smiled, nodded</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">along, threw in the occasional "interesting" for effect, and watched him
            puff up like a peacock.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was all so... tedious.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, so effective.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She crossed her legs, staring out the window, a small, satisfied smile playing on her
            lips. The men had no idea she barely needed to lift a finger to win them over. They were convinced
            they'd gotten a bargain by the end of it-thought they'd charmed her. But in reality, they</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">were just another trophy for her shelf, another deal closed in the blink of an
            eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers tapped lightly on her lap, a quiet rhythm of victory, but her gaze
            drifted to her bag where the manila human resources file sat, tucked just beneath the leather. Billy had
            snagged it for her earlier, right from HR. She hadn't had the chance to open it yet, though she'd
            been tempted-several times. The day had been relentless. Too many meetings, too many fires to put
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, in the quiet of the town car, with the city lights flickering by, she
            couldn't resist any longer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled the file from her bag, the crisp paper cool in her hands. She flipped
            it open, her eyes narrowing immediately as they landed on the photo. Of course. Even in her employee photo,
            she was smirking-cocky, bold. That same damn smirk that had irked her earlier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes flicked down to the name under the picture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Interesting name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd guessed the age right-32, older than her peers. That alone was unusual.
            Most</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">associates were younger, fresh out of Ivy League law schools. But Rio? She'd gone
            to law school late, another oddity. Agatha scanned the details, her brow furrowing as she read</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">further. No Ivy League pedigree. In fact, Rio hadn't attended any of the usual
            suspects- Harvard, Yale, Princeton. Not even a Columbia grad.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, Rio Vidal had attended some obscure law school in... Texas. Agatha paused,
            blinking at the word as if it didn't quite compute. Texas. The woman was from Texas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How in the hell did she get into my law firm? Agatha thought, her annoyance mounting.
            Who hired her? And more importantly, why?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She continued skimming the file, searching for answers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Valedictorian, Agatha noted. Not just in law school but all through her academic
            life. Her eyes widened slightly as she saw the LSAT score.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">172.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Impressive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers tapped faster, her mind racing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smart, then.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smarter than the Ivy League brats who had their seats bought by mommy and daddy,
            coasting through law school and slipping into her firm on the weight of their last names and trust</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">funds. The kind who thought expensive degrees equaled talent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this one... She wasn't like them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha flipped through the recommendations, scanning them quickly. Raving reviews,
            glowing endorsements-nothing unusual for someone who made it this far. But then she paused, her eyes
            narrowing as she read a particular letter from one of Rio's law professors.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio Vidal has an exceptional mind-one of the sharpest I've encountered in
            my years of teaching. Her quick wit and ability to think on her feet are unmatched. She doesn't just
            understand the law; she anticipates it, often seeing solutions others overlook. She possesses all the
            makings of an extraordinary lawyer-one who won't just practice law, but redefine it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed the folder with a sharp snap, the force of it reverberating in the
            quiet of the car. The raving reviews, the exceptional LSAT score, the professor's glowing words-none of
            it mattered in the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not until this, Rio proved herself to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned back against the seat, fingers drumming on the folder's edge, her mind
            still circling around the woman in the photo.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sharp. Quick. Unmatched. Beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wait .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beautiful?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her fingers stilling against the folder. Where had that come from? She
            shook the thought away, irritation bubbling up inside her. Beauty was irrelevant. It wasn't what she
            valued, certainly not in an associate. She prided herself on seeing only talent, skill, potential.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Focus, she chastised herself, forcing her mind back to the task at hand. But the word
            lingered, unsettling her more than she wanted to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her phone rang, and for once, she didn't mind the interruption-it was exactly
            what she needed. She glanced at the caller ID and rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she snapped into the phone. Silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hello, Jen. How are you doing, Jen?" came the mocking tone on the other
            end. Agatha rolled her eyes harder, settling back into her seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Talking to yourself now? All those illegal moisturizers you put into your face
            finally melting your brain?" she bit back, the sharpness of her tone unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen huffed, clearly unimpressed. "I need you to come in."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled the phone away from her ear to check the time-9:14 PM. She had
            been</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">working since 5 that morning, and she was tired. Exhausted, really. She hadn't
            seen Nicky all day. By now, he'd be asleep-she'd checked with the nanny earlier. Still, she wanted
            to be there, to kiss him goodnight, to run her fingers through his hair, to be mom for just a moment.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No-it's late," she said, her voice flat, decisive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A pause. Silence on the other end. Then Jen's voice, low but firm.
            "Agatha-just get your ass in here."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could respond, the line went dead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at her phone, irritation bubbling up. She let out a sharp
            breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This night just keeps getting better, she thought sarcastically, tossing the phone
            into her bag. She let out a loud heavy sigh. Her shoulders slumped, taking advantage of the privacy of the
            car to finally let herself collapse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave herself exactly one minute. One minute to completely surrender to the weight
            of the day, to let the stress settle in and roll off, if only briefly. In this quiet, fleeting moment,
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">exhaustion hit her all at once, the strain of the day settling deep into her bones.
            The invisible armor she wore every day felt heavier than usual-pressing down on her shoulders, tight in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, like a switch flipping, she forced herself to pull out of it. Her back
            straightened, her shoulders squared, and the walls she so carefully kept in place slid back into position.
            Agatha Harkness couldn't afford cracks, not even in the privacy of her own car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached for the intercom button, her finger pressing it with a controlled, steady
            motion. "Back to the office, Dan," she ordered, her voice sharp, fully composed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Ms. Harkness," came her driver's prompt reply. She felt the
            subtle turn of the car, the shift in direction steering her away from home and back to the office.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned her head back against the seat, her mind already shifting gears.
            Whatever</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">awaited her at the office had better be important. Jen knew better than to drag her
            back this late without a damn good reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if it wasn't?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, then someone's head was going to roll.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped out of the elevator, her irritation bubbling dangerously close to the
            surface. She knew herself-knew her limits-and she was on the edge of losing her composure. And when Agatha
            Harkness lost it, no one was safe. She marched through the office with a fierce intensity, her steps sharp,
            her focus singular. She was on a warpath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flicked to the glass-walled conference room as she passed, taking a small,
            malicious delight in seeing the associates still toiling away inside. Their once-pristine designer suits and
            dresses were now wrinkled, their faces tense with frustration as they argued over the documents.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good. At least she wasn't the only one suffering tonight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kept walking but felt the nagging urge to glance back, wondering if Rio was in
            there-if she, too, was slogging through the night, just as frustrated as her peers. The thought of seeing
            that infuriating smirk wiped clean, replaced with a frown of disappointment or perhaps even the taut line of
            stress, had Agatha glancing over her shoulder, unable to resist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as her eyes scanned the room, she frowned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flicker of disappointment sparked inside her. If Rio had already given up, she
            certainly didn't have the makings of an exceptional lawyer, as her professor had so boldly claimed.
            Agatha had expected more-a dramatic collapse, perhaps. Something with fire, or at least a satisfying level
            of frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was nothing. No spectacle. No crumbling under pressure. Just...
            absence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The disappointment lingered, heavier than she wanted to admit. She had been
            looking</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forward to watching Rio break-or perhaps she was simply annoyed that she had missed
            it. Either way, it left her feeling unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a letdown, she thought, pushing the irritation aside as she continued toward her
            office. But the annoyance only deepened as she caught sight of people inside-her space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three women lounged on her couch, and she recognized them immediately: Lilia Calderu,
            Jennifer Kale, and Alice Wu-Gulliver-the other partners. They were laughing, casually sipping on her whiskey
            as if they belonged there, making themselves comfortable in a place they had no right to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, her fury simmering. This did not look like an
            emergency.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She marched forward, her steps quick and sharp, and dramatically ripped the door
            open, stepping in with a stormy presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The laughter died immediately, the room quieting as all three women turned to face
            her, their expressions faltering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze swept over them, eyes cold and cutting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," she said, throwing her hands in the air with an exaggerated
            flourish, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "The building clearly isn't on fire. So why am I
            here?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words hung in the air, thickening the already tense atmosphere. The partners
            exchanged uneasy glances, clearly unsettled despite how accustomed they were to Agatha's theatrics. No
            matter how well they knew her, she still had the power to get under their skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All except Lilia.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia, the oldest and most seasoned of them, simply raised an eyebrow. She was always
            unfazed by Agatha's theatrics, a fact that both annoyed and impressed Agatha in equal measure. Lilia had
            a gift-an unnerving ability to read people like open books, as if she could peer into their souls and know
            exactly what made them tick, what they would do next. It made Agatha uncomfortable, but she begrudgingly
            respected her for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Lilia said, her tone carrying a hint of exasperation, like a
            mother addressing an overly dramatic child. She leaned forward, grabbing the decanter of whiskey with a
            casual grace, and poured a generous amount into a glass. Offering it to Agatha, she gestured toward the
            empty chair. "Sit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, her annoyance flaring again. She didn't take orders
            from anyone,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Lilia knew that. But the sooner she figured out what this impromptu gathering was
            about, the sooner she could get back home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a reluctant sigh, she took the glass and settled into the chair, her posture
            stiff, her gaze unyielding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This better be good," she muttered, taking a sip of the whiskey, her sharp
            eyes scanning the three women.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen met her gaze evenly before leaning back in her chair, arms crossed in that casual
            but calculating way Agatha despised.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have the new associates working the Vanguard case." Agatha's eyes
            narrowed, her patience wearing thin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is that why you dragged me in here? Because I have associates working?
            That's not exactly groundbreaking news, Jen. This literally could've been an email." Her tone
            was mocking, laced with sharp irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's expression hardened, her eyes narrowing in return. "I thought we all
            agreed to put Vanguard to rest."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned forward, her fingers tightening around the glass.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I never agreed to that," she said, her voice cold and sharp.
            "Vanguard was shelved because the rest of you lost your nerve, not because it's a dead
            case."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a slow sip of whiskey, throwing Jen an unapologetic look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And besides-you dumped the associates on me, remember?" she added, her
            tone turning defensive. "What else was I supposed to do with them?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We have plenty of active cases," Jen shot back, her irritation
            clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"None of them are challenging enough," Agatha bit out. "I wanted to
            see what they were made of."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia chuckled softly, her knowing gaze settling on Agatha. "You didn't want
            to test them. You wanted to break them."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised a hand to her chest in mock offense, her eyes wide with exaggerated
            innocence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who, me?" she said dramatically, her voice dripping with false sincerity.
            Jen's patience snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enough," she cut in, her tone sharp, silencing the room. She glanced at
            Alice, giving her a quick nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice, who had been quietly watching, shot Agatha a look before reaching for a folder
            on the table. She handed it to Agatha, her expression unreadable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha eyed the folder suspiciously, then snatched it from Alice's hand.
            "What's this?" she asked, her voice edged with curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," Jen deadpanned, "is the reason I called you in." Agatha
            gave her a look, full of skepticism.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And here I thought you were finally inviting me into your little sisterhood of
            the traveling jade egg."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice gagged at the comment. "Gross, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just read the damn file," Jen growled, clearly losing patience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, still smirking, flipped open the folder, her amusement quickly fading as her
            eyes scanned the contents.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha flipped open the folder, her initial smirk fading as she skimmed through the
            documents. Emails, reports-familiar enough. All of them from the Vanguard file. She recognized every page.
            But as she continued to flip through, something caught her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Handwritten notes, scribbled in sharp, messy black ink. Chicken scratch, really. And
            there were small tabs sticking out of the sides of certain pages, marking specific sections.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her brow furrowed, curiosity piqued as she studied the scrawled handwriting. The
            notes were meticulous, pointing out dates and correlating them with other reports. A pattern emerged-
            subtle, almost invisible. But the handwriting-whoever it belonged to-had spotted it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She flipped to another page, her eyes scanning a hand-written note that called out
            discrepancies between official reports and internal memos. Some of these reports had been</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">doctored, their numbers altered just enough to avoid raising suspicion. And
            they'd slipped through even her scrutiny. Agatha's stomach churned slightly at the
            realization.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How the hell did I miss this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The handwriting continued to circle glaring issues she hadn't noticed-small but
            damning irregularities hidden beneath layers of data. She flipped through faster now, eyes scanning the tabs
            and notes with growing intensity. Whoever had gone through this file had not only found cracks in
            Vanguard's defense but had started pulling at those threads, unraveling the very thing Agatha had
            thought was impenetrable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused at a particular note, her fingers brushing over the ink. It wasn't
            just pointing out an error-it was laying out a trail. A breadcrumb of clues Agatha herself hadn't
            followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who the hell wrote this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced up at Jen, then Alice, but neither of them spoke. They just watched her,
            waiting for her to put the pieces together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, flipping back to the beginning of the file, her mind
            racing. She hadn't missed this because of negligence. No, this was the kind of work that required more
            than skill-it required obsession.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slammed the folder shut, the room's silence thick with anticipation.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who wrote these?" Agatha demanded, her voice sharp, slicing through the
            heavy silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three women exchanged knowing glances, as if they had anticipated this exact
            moment. Jen, taking her time, raised her glass to her lips and sipped her whiskey slowly, leaning back into
            her chair with a casual, almost cocky posture. She met Agatha's gaze, savoring the tension like a fine
            wine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio Vidal," she said, drawing out the words with relish. "Your new
            mentee."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blood and Tears and Bone</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha despised being late. Every minute she wasn't in the office felt like she
            was losing ground, like the day was slipping from her grip before it even started. She didn't just want
            to keep up-she wanted to conquer each day, crush it beneath her heel. But today had been</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">different. Today, she'd woken up with Nicky wrapped around her, clinging to her
            as if holding on tightly enough would make her stay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His little arms, wrapped like a boa constrictor around her waist, squeezed with all
            the love and desperation a five-year-old could muster. And the moment she felt his grip, she knew it was
            going to be one of those mornings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a battle from the start: first, a meltdown over a pair of socks that
            didn't fit just right, then she didn't cut his toast the way he liked, which led to a complete
            refusal to ride</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the driver to school. Every moment felt like she was dragging him out of
            quicksand, and through it all, she could feel the weight of his frustration. But she couldn't blame him.
            He was his mother's son-he had the same flair for dramatics, the same spiral when things slipped out of
            his control, and the same intensity, burning with the heat of a thousand suns.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was, in many ways, her recompense for how she had acted all her life. Every
            tantrum,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every stubborn refusal, felt like a mirror reflecting her own relentless need for
            control. And now, at five years old, Nicky had the same fire, the same relentless energy. Yesterday she had
            missed dinner and bedtime-big moments in his little world. He didn't understand why his mother
            couldn't be there. He just knew she wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, when he lashed out, she let him. It was familiar-deserved.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, she just gave in. Afterall, it was his last day with her before he went
            to his fathers for the week.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she let him ride with her, even though it meant going in the opposite direction
            of the office. She sat in the back, scrolling through her phone, reading emails, pretending not to</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">notice him still sulking next to her. Her time was ticking away, the demands of work
            looming closer, but she didn't mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside her, Nicky was fiddling with something-probably one of the files she had
            tossed into her bag last minute. She was used to him doodling on her documents, often using them as
            makeshift canvases while she worked. Once, he'd drawn over a contract and when she brought it back to
            the associate who wrote it covered in crayon, she pointed out the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"mistakes" her son had marked, just to remind them to stay humble.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's pretty," Nicky said, his small voice cutting through the quiet
            of the car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes snapped up from her phone, her brow furrowing in confusion as she
            looked ahead, out the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who is pretty?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't see anything, so she looked down at him and her stomach dropped when
            she saw what he was holding-Rio Vidal's personal file. Open. Her son's tiny fingers were tracing the
            edges of Rio's photo, his innocent eyes studying the image intently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart skipped a beat, an unexpected surge of emotion hitting her as she
            tried to process the sight of Nicky holding Rio's file. How did he-?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who is she?" he asked, his little voice curious, blue eyes-just like
            hers-staring up at her expectantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rarely found herself speechless, but now, with her son's innocent question
            hanging in the air, she struggled to find the right words. Her mind raced. Who is she?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She is-" Agatha hesitated, searching for an answer that wouldn't
            betray the truth. She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't very well tell her son that this woman was her newest challenge, her
            latest game- someone she intended to crush under the weight of impossible expectations. That kind of</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cruelty didn't fit in a world where her son was watching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's a friend at work," she finally said, the words coming out
            carefully, tasting foreign on her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky blinked, eyes moving back to the picture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's pretty," Nicky repeated, as if that single observation was all
            the explanation he needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a fleeting moment, Agatha couldn't help but agree-and she hated herself for
            the thought. She quickly pushed it aside, forcing her focus back to something she could control. Reaching
            into her bag, she pulled out a red permanent marker and held it out to him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Here," she said, offering the marker with a subtle nod toward Rio's
            personal file. "Have at it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes lit up, and he grabbed the marker eagerly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">HR wouldn't like it, but Agatha didn't care. Rules didn't apply to her.
            And this Rio woman?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wouldn't be around long enough for it to matter-not if Agatha had anything to
            say about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hamster cage was empty when Agatha arrived at the office. The Vanguard files had
            been moved to a new room, now that something had finally been found, and the partners-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reluctantly-gave her the green light to pick the case back up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they'd made it painfully clear-no more pouring millions into this fight. No
            more</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">endless hours and resources bleeding into the abyss. If she wanted to chase her white
            whale,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">it would be on her terms this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One associate, they said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was all she got.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Agatha wanted Vanguard, she had to roll up her sleeves and dive headfirst into the
            dirt herself. She could practically feel the disapproval clinging to her like a shadow, the weight of their
            judgment pressing against the back of her mind. They were done funding her fight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with the new findings, they still saw it as a lost cause-a battle she
            couldn't win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And gods-that burned something fierce inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't done with Vanguard. She would never be done with them. Not until she
            had her heel on their throat, pressing down until there wasn't even the faintest gasp left.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted them broken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just a case anymore; it had become something darker, something
            bordering on obsession. The gnawing pull of unfinished business that kept her awake at night, dragging her
            thoughts back again and again. When she couldn't sleep, she would find herself in the file</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, fingers brushing through old documents, searching for something-anything-that
            might have been missed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew it was unhealthy. Knew that the case had sunk its claws into her, tightening
            its grip every day. But she couldn't let it go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wouldn't let it go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard wasn't just a case anymore. It was a reckoning. And Agatha needed to be
            the one to deliver it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On her way to her office, she paused outside the war room adjacent to her door.
            Stepping inside, the familiar thrill shot through her veins. Stacks of Vanguard files towered against the
            walls, the whiteboard beside them still untouched, waiting to be filled with the threads of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">conspiracy that Agatha knew she was about to unravel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn't matter that she only had one associate. She thrived in the chaos, and
            that board was going to tell the story of Vanguard's downfall. All she needed was a crack in the armor,
            a single loose thread to pull.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hunt. This was the part of her job she lived for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the surface, the company was clean as the whiteboard-a massive defense contractor
            with deep ties to the Department of Defense. They supplied everything from tanks to missiles,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anything designed to kill. If it could destroy, Vanguard had a hand in making it. But
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew when a company was that big-in that line of work, there was always a trail of
            filth hiding under the glossy veneer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five years ago, an anonymous whistleblower dropped a bombshell on her
            desk-serious</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">allegations that painted Vanguard in a very different light. It was like someone
            handed her a blacklight to expose the mess, and like a truck stop bathroom, it showed just how absolutely
            filthy those fuckers really were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the tip, Vanguard wasn't just arming the U.S. military. They were
            allegedly selling weapons to terrorist organizations in the Middle East, drug cartels in South America, and
            organized crime families that held entire cities in their grasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just shady-it was catastrophic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The data dump that came with it was massive-financial records that didn't line
            up, shipping manifests that made no sense, and buried within the files was an obituary. Brooke Sinclair, an
            accountant at Vanguard, twenty-seven years old. Dead by suicide. Found by her family in her garage, the car
            still running.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had felt a chill run down her spine when she read it. That's when she knew
            the case wasn't just numbers on a page.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was bigger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Darker.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final piece in the whistleblower's file had been an innocuous-looking
            email-something so routine it almost seemed irrelevant. Brooke had forwarded a concern to her
            higher-ups.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd found inconsistencies: missing storage containers, financial line items
            that didn't trace back to any purchases. She was simply requesting a meeting to clear things up
            before</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">finalizing her month-end report. That was it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No grand reveal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No dramatic accusations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just a simple request for clarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that email had been the last time anyone heard from Brooke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whole thing reeked of a cover-up, and Agatha could smell it a mile away.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke's death was ruled a suicide, but nothing about it sat right with Agatha.
            The pieces didn't fit. She managed to convince Brooke's grieving parents to let her take on the
            case, pro bono, of course. They were Midwestern farmers, barely scraping by, but they were desperate for
            answers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brooke wasn't suicidal. She was happy," her mother had sobbed,
            clutching her husband's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">arm. The father, stoic and broken, had nodded along silently, his weathered hand
            reaching out for the contract.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Give it to me," he had said, his voice rough, his signature swift and
            deliberate. He handed the contract back to Agatha, fury burning in his eyes. With one hand, he held his
            grieving wife; with the other, he handed over the last thing he had-the hope that Agatha could give them
            justice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was enough to bring a suit, but Agatha knew this was going to be an uphill battle.
            Vanguard was too big, too powerful. And they'd already hired the only firm in the U.S. that had a</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reputation to rival her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A firm out of Boston: Fox, Ratcliff, Coyotl, Wise, Crow, Orm, and Swarmen. A fucking
            mouthful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But most people just called them The Salem Seven.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had a certain gravitas to it, didn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Witch of Wall Street v. The Salem Seven. It felt like something ripped from a
            Marvel movie-two juggernauts going head-to-head, each wielding their own brand of legal magic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this wasn't a movie, and reality was a much harsher beast.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn't need to destroy her with a knockout punch. No, they played it smart.
            They dragged it out, bogged her down in procedural delays, tiring her out with endless paperwork and
            technicalities. Agatha could see the strategy, and she hated to admit it-but she respected the move.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was ruthless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Effective.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whistleblower's records? Thrown out. The Seven claimed they were
            doctored.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha put in a formal request for the originals then. The court granted it. But of
            course, they didn't just give her what she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They gave her everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They practically annihilated a rainforest to bury her in paper. Files upon files,
            crates upon crates of documents, all designed to slow her down, to drown her firm in an avalanche of
            meaningless information.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were good. So, fucking good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it worked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a year of relentless digging, after burning through five million dollars in
            associate hours, combing through mountains of case files and finding nothing, the partners finally</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">called it. Vanguard was bleeding them dry. It had become a war of attrition, and her
            own firm was starting to crack under the pressure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">3-1 vote.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had to put the case away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every part of her seethed with frustration, knowing they were being played. Vanguard
            had won-not by being smarter, but by exhausting her, by exploiting the resources of her firm and dragging
            down into the mud until she couldn't breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shutting down the case had felt like swallowing glass.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as she stood in the war room, staring at the mountain of files towering before
            her,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but feel the weight of it all pressing down on her. The
            thought crept in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-the possibility of failing again. She wasn't afraid of much. She prided herself
            on that. But failure? That was the one thing that clawed at her insides, the one fear she could never
            shake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be less-that was her nightmare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't set the bar sky-high without holding herself to those same brutal
            standards. She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn't completely heartless. She demanded perfection, but she demanded it from
            herself first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, with Vanguard staring her in the face, she had to wonder-could she survive
            another fall?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Billy waiting for her, standing there with
            that wide- eyed, puppy-dog expression, holding her coffee like a peace offering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed loudly, the weight of the war room and the gnawing thoughts of failure
            still heavy on her mind. Without a word, she turned and walked out it, brushing past him, snatching the
            coffee from his hand as she made her way out the door. The morning with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, the pressure, the looming task ahead-it was all too much, and it made her
            snappy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Get me the updated financials from Vanguard," she barked, barely giving
            him a glance. "And the client contracts from last quarter reviewed by noon."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy opened his mouth, clearly ready to say something, but before he could, she cut
            him off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Also, track down those emails-you know the ones-and I want a report on the last
            quarter of stock movement. I wanted those 5 minutes ago."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy's mouth hung open again, his eyes darting as he tried to keep up, but
            Agatha didn't slow down, her words spilling out like a rapid-fire barrage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"-And I want those updated financials on my desk before lunch. And call IT about
            the damn firewall issues at my home office-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's words and her steps halted simultaneously as she entered her office and
            realized she was not alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There, on the cream-colored couch, sat Rio Vidal. Leaning back with infuriating ease,
            dressed in a forest green suit paired with a high-collared white button-down, her presence was impossible to
            ignore. Her hair was down today, framing her face in a way that softened her sharp look, but that smirk-that
            damn smirk-and the casual way she crossed her legs, as if she belonged there, made Agatha's brain
            short-circuit for a brief, disorienting second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her composure faltering for only a heartbeat before she whirled on
            Billy, who had the decency to look properly terrified.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have a visitor," he mumbled, offering an apologetic grimace and a look
            that practically screamed, I tried to tell you.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes at him, the sharpness in her gaze cutting like a blade.
            "I have eyes," she hissed, her voice a low warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a flick of her hand, she shooed him away, her irritation barely
            contained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind whirred back into focus, her attention shifting back to Rio, who looked far
            too</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">comfortable in her office. It set Agatha's nerves on fire, but she refused to
            show it. One of her many talents was projecting confidence and resolve, even when she didn't feel a
            shred of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ignored Rio completely, striding to her closet to hang up her jacket as if the
            woman weren't even there. Then, with calm precision, she moved to her desk, booting up her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">computer and diving into her emails. The silence between them was thick, almost
            tangible, but Agatha could do this all day. The steady sound of her typing filled the room as she fought the
            urge to look up, knowing Rio's gaze was on her, watching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ten minutes passed in silence, the tension growing by the second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I liked your speech yesterday," Rio's voice finally broke through,
            cutting through the quiet like a blade. Agatha's fingers stilled on the keyboard. It wasn't the
            comment that threw her- it was the voice. There wasn't a trace of the Texas drawl she had expected.
            Instead, Rio's voice was rough, a gravelly tone with an undercurrent of lilting precision, tinged with
            something else. Something... bilingual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio wasn't done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It was very-'I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the
            senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.'"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind screeched to a halt. What in the hell was this woman talking
            about?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then it clicked. She was the mother of a five-year-old who had learned to read at
            three, well beyond The Very Hungry Caterpillar. They'd started reading Harry Potter together earlier
            this year, and now Agatha recognized the quote, the words landing in her mind like a bomb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head snapped up, her neck practically breaking from the speed of it. Eyes
            narrowed, she glared at Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you just compare me to Snape?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And gods, that smirk. It stretched across Rio's face like she could taste
            Agatha's annoyance and was savoring it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dark, brooding, powerful-misunderstood," Rio shrugged casually, her smirk
            deepening. "It fits, doesn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clenched her jaw, torn between irritation and-though she would never admit it-
            something dangerously close to amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened as she stared at Rio, a sharp retort poised on her lips,
            but she hesitated. Rio was clearly enjoying this little game, and feeding into it wasn't going to give
            Agatha the upper hand. Still, the comparison gnawed at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Misunderstood?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't misunderstood. She was crystal clear about who she was and what she
            wanted. Power. Control. Victory. There was no mystery in that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not misunderstood," Agatha said coldly, her voice slicing through
            the tension like a blade. "I'm very clear about what I do-and how I do it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only widened, leaning back on the couch as if settling in for a long,
            enjoyable battle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I don't doubt that. But misunderstood doesn't have to mean unclear,
            does it?" Her tone was playful, teasing-yet there was something sharp underneath, like she was trying
            to poke at something deeper. "Sometimes, people can see exactly what you are and still miss the
            point."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, refusing to rise to the bait. She turned back to her
            screen, her fingers resuming their steady typing, dismissing the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't seem deterred.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">'"You know, I think people misjudge you," she continued, her voice
            taking on a more serious tone. "They think they see all there is to you. But they
            don't."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused mid-keystroke, her irritation growing with each word. She didn't
            like being analyzed, especially not by someone-lesser.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And what, exactly, do you think they're missing?" she asked without
            looking up, her voice cool and measured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was silent for a beat, long enough to make Agatha glance up, meeting her gaze.
            The smirk had faded, replaced by a thoughtful expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They miss how much you care," Rio said quietly, her eyes locking onto
            Agatha's. "You hide it well, but I see it. You're ruthless, yes. But it's because you give
            a damn."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at her, caught off guard. She hadn't expected that. Most people
            assumed her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ruthlessness came from a cold, detached place. The idea that someone might see her
            drive as a sign of care-of passion-unnerved her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shook her head, breaking the eye contact, her fingers clenching the edge of the
            keyboard. "You don't know me. Don't pretend you do."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, her tone soft but insistent. "Maybe I don't. But I know
            people like you."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met her gaze again, this time with a mix of annoyance and curiosity.
            "People like me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were no people like her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled faintly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"People who fight like hell because they care too much. Not because they
            don't care at all."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at her, unsure whether to feel insulted, intrigued, or both. For the
            first time in a long while, someone had managed to catch her off guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it bothered her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman was going to be a problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned from her screen, her gaze finally settling fully on Rio. She really
            looked at her this time-studying her, sizing her up. The playful smirk was still there, but beneath
            it,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could see something else: resolve. The kind of resolve that didn't crack
            easily, the kind that didn't care about boundaries or hierarchies.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it wasn't just her words. It was the way Rio held herself, the calm
            confidence that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">radiated off her, the way she didn't flinch under Agatha's scrutiny. Most
            people-hell, most seasoned lawyers-would have backed down by now, would have shown some flicker of doubt or
            fear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But not this woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, taking in every detail, from the tailored green suit to
            the way Rio's fingers drummed softly against the arm of the couch, as if daring her to make the next
            move. This wasn't some naive associate trying to make a name for herself-this was someone who knew
            exactly what she wanted and wasn't afraid to push for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaning back in her chair, Agatha crossed her arms, her eyes narrowing as she studied
            Rio more closely, weighing her options. She wasn't used to being on this side of the equation.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why are you here?" Agatha found herself asking, her voice sharper than she
            intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, as if assessing her, sizing her up in a way that Agatha
            hadn't experienced in a long time. Most people looked at her with fear or reverence. But Rio? She looked
            at her like a challenge, like she was ready to meet her head-on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I work here," Rio deadpanned, her tone infuriatingly calm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, that was good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the tug of a smile pulling at her lips, and she had to fight it, biting
            down on the inside of her cheek to keep it from showing. Instead, she clung to the simmering self-</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">righteous anger she always kept close, using it as her shield.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why are you in my office?" she hissed, her voice low and dangerous, eyes
            locked on Rio, waiting for her next move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't flinch. In fact, the smirk on her lips deepened, as though she was
            fully aware of the effect she was having-and relishing every second of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mrs. Kale said I was helping you with Vanguard," she said, her tone
            maddeningly casual, as if the monumental weight of the case meant nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Your new mentee. Jen's voice echoed in Agatha's mind, curling through her
            thoughts like a thorny vine, digging deeper with every passing second. Agatha's jaw clenched, her teeth
            grinding as she fought back the rising surge of irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She said I earned it because I found something on Vanguard. That I'm
            officially your associate now," Rio said, her voice steady and maddeningly calm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled deeply through her nose, half-expecting smoke to billow out with the
            fire that was steadily building inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did she now?" Agatha's voice was cold, sharp enough to slice through
            the thick tension that filled the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk didn't waver. She shrugged, completely unfazed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I mean, technically, you said it first. If I recall, your exact words were:
            'If you somehow</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">manage to unearth something real, something no one else has found, I will personally
            mentor you. Build you. Mold you into something unstoppable.'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched. Jesus Christ. Those were her exact fucking words. What was
            she, Rain Man?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, her gaze hardening into something lethal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If I wanted to hear myself talk, I'd do it. I don't need you of all
            people quoting me back to myself."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio didn't flinch. That damn smirk stayed fixed on her lips, taunting Agatha,
            pushing her, challenging her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god-Agatha had never wanted to break something so badly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, her voice dropping dangerously low, her eyes locking onto
            Rio's with unblinking intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me make one thing very clear: I don't play games. You're mistaken
            if you think this is going to be some mentor-mentee bonding experience," she hissed, her tone venomous.
            "I don't do hand-holding. If you're staying, you'll keep up or get crushed. No
            in-between."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression didn't falter. She shrugged again, that irritatingly calm
            demeanor still intact. "I'm not here to play. I'm here to help. And from where I'm
            standing, it looks like I've</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">already gotten further than your last attempt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes burned, and for a moment, the room crackled with silent fury. She
            studied Rio in silence, her fists tightening at her sides. This woman-had nerve. A dangerous nerve.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Agatha leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright then," she said, her voice cold and cutting. "If you're
            so eager to prove yourself, let's see how long you last. But don't expect any help from me. You sink
            or swim-either way, I don't care."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time, the smirk on Rio's face softened. Her eyes gleamed, not with
            arrogance but with something far more dangerous-excitement. Real, unbridled excitement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," she said, her voice steady and sure. "That's how I prefer
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lip curled into a slow, predatory smile. Her voice, when she spoke, was
            dripping with challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay, Vidal. Let's see what you're made of, then."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where All That's Wrong is Right</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's day was a relentless barrage of phone calls, emails, and fires that
            constantly needed extinguishing. Being a partner meant she was more of a firefighter than a lawyer these
            days, managing crises instead of sinking her teeth into the work that used to ignite her. Budgets, briefs,
            frantic clients-she moved through them all like a machine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Efficient.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Precise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it didn't stop the pull-to the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every time her gaze slipped from the pages in front of her and drifted toward the war
            room, that's what she repeated to herself. It was Vanguard-the hunt for her white whale-that tugged at
            her focus, not the woman inside that room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her office offered the perfect view of the war room, a constant reminder of the
            battle waiting for her. Every free second-a breath between calls, a brief pause between emails-her eyes
            would find their way there. Watching the case take shape, watching the clues unfold,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watching the documents mount.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what mattered. That's what she was watching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the lie tasted bitter on her tongue every time she told it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio Vidal had first stepped into the war room, Agatha had watched her closely,
            narrowing her eyes, half-expecting the woman to stand there paralyzed, realizing the sheer magnitude of what
            Agatha had put on her. But no. Vidal just stood there, taking it all in, a quiet, unsettling calm about
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She's in over her head. She will soon see, Agatha had thought, almost waiting for
            her the moment her to crack-to see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then the phone rang, dragging Agatha into yet another client emergency.
            Irritation simmered as she spent the next twenty minutes navigating someone else's disaster, her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention fracturing. She tried to shove the pull-Vanguard, she forced herself to
            think-into the background as she dealt with the issue, but it lingered like a shadow at the edge of her
            mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second the call ended, her eyes snapped back to the war room, instinctive and
            immediate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there was Vidal-now at the table, the first of the boxes spread out before her, a
            document in hand. She looked calm. Too calm, really. The predatory smirk Agatha had come to expect was gone,
            but something else had taken its place-something that looked disturbingly like... pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unmistakable in the way Vidal's lips curled, ever so slightly, as she
            read. Her eyes moved across the page with a slow, deliberate satisfaction, her fingers tracing the edge of
            the paper like she was savoring every bit of it. Agatha could feel it, that quiet enjoyment, the subtle
            shift in her expression-so calm, so focused, so utterly immersed in the work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pleasure in it was tangible, almost intimate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Nicholas's words from this morning echoed through her mind like a punch
            to the gut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's really pretty."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought jolted her, snapping her out of the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell was that?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shook her head, a surge of emotion flooding her chest-anger, yes, but
            something else too, something she refused to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Focus, she commanded herself, ripping her gaze from the war room as if it burned her.
            She tried to steady the sudden quickening of her pulse, tried to shove down whatever it was stirring inside
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully, her email dinged, yanking her back to reality. A brief from one of the
            senior associates she'd been waiting on. She clicked it open, desperate to shift her mind back to
            something-anything-else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as her eyes scanned the first page, her thoughts refused to follow. No matter how
            hard she pushed herself to focus, her mind stayed stubbornly locked on Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, not Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard. Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Irritation flared hot in her chest. She tore through the first two pages of the
            brief, redlining it ruthlessly before she even made it halfway through. The work was sloppy, half-baked. Her
            temper rose as she furiously typed an email in response, not bothering to sugarcoat her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Submit something like this to me again, and the next thing you'll be
            drafting is your resignation," she fired back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment, her pulse racing-not just from
            the poor quality of the work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fixation was dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't afford it-didn't want it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grabbing a folder off her desk, she opened it and she forced herself to focus on the
            contract in front of her. It was for one of her biggest clients, so it needed by perfect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to be sharp, precise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But instead, she gnawed on the top of her pen, frustration simmering just below the
            surface. Her eyes kept pulling toward the war room, despite every ounce of will she tried to muster against
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don't look. Focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the thought alone had her glancing up-and god, she wanted to slap herself.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was Vidal, seated at the table, chewing on the end of her pen, lips brushing
            against the plastic in the same thoughtless way Agatha had just been doing. Agatha's breath caught, her
            grip tightening around her own pen. She quickly tore it from her mouth and tossed it aside as if it burned
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scene in front of Vidal was controlled chaos: papers scattered everywhere, stacks
            teetering on the edge of collapse, but somehow, the woman didn't look overwhelmed. If anything, she
            looked... pleased.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart stuttered, her pulse quickening as she watched Vidal lean forward
            slightly, that faint smile playing on her lips as she studied something on the page.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then-goddammit-her tongue flicked out, just briefly, running over her lips in
            thought. Agatha felt heat rise in her chest. It sent a pulse straight through her, sharp and unwanted.
            Nope.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No Fucking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tore her gaze away, her jaw clenched so tightly she thought she might crack a
            tooth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is wrong with me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Billy!" she barked, her voice sharp enough to cut through the hum of the
            office, and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything went quiet. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Vidal look up too-just a
            glance, no smirk, no expression, just looking. And god, Agatha forced herself to stay locked on Billy's
            panicked face instead, fighting the urge to meet Vidal's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to get the hell out of here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Move my lunch meeting to now," she ordered, already on her feet, heading
            for her coat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy blinked, stammering, "Um-Ms. Harkness, it's only 10 AM. I don't
            even think the restaurant is-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pulling on her coat with a swift, irritated motion, she fixed him with a look that
            made him shut up instantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Figure it out, Pet," she hissed, brushing past him as if the very air
            around her was suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stalked down the hallway, her coat billowing behind her with the sheer speed of
            her steps. Agatha's heels clicked sharply against the polished floor, each step echoing like the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crack of a whip, a warning to anyone in her path. She refused to look toward the war
            room as she passed it, keeping her eyes fixed straight ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But god-she could feel it. Feel her eyes on her. That quiet, insufferable gaze of Rio
            Vidal</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watching her, and it only made her walk faster. She felt the heat rise in her chest,
            a frustration she couldn't name, and the need to get away from it-from her-was overwhelming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The client meeting had gone... okay. Of course, the client wasn't thrilled about
            the meeting being pushed two hours early, but when Agatha Harkness reschedules, you move with her or
            don't move at all. That's just how it worked. By the end of it, Agatha felt steadier, like she'd
            finally found her footing again, her core settling back into place. The tightness in her chest</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">eased.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She walked back into the office with a singular purpose: head straight to her desk
            and bury herself in the next task. Passing the war room, she was fully determined to keep going-until
            something stopped her cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whiteboard was no longer white.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused mid-step, her eyes narrowing as they took in the scene through the
            glass. There, standing next to the now-cluttered board, was Vidal, completely immersed in the board.
            Documents were pinned up, sticky notes scattered across the surface, and in the middle of it all, written in
            that familiar messy handwriting, was a name that hit her like a freight train.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke Sinclair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just below it, a picture of the woman herself. Agatha's heart gave a heavy
            thump, the kind that pulled her forward like she was tethered to the case itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't help it. The pull-this time of the case, she told herself-had her
            moving toward the door, her hand reaching for the handle before she even realized what she was doing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the door creaked open, Vidal turned, her eyes widening ever so slightly at the
            sight of Agatha. It was a subtle reaction, but one Agatha didn't miss. And god, she took a small,
            satisfying pleasure in catching Vidal off guard. It was a rare thing, and Agatha savored it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Working hard, I see," Agatha said, her voice cool as she stepped into the
            room. But as soon as the words left her mouth, she noticed something that caught her completely off guard-
            Vidal had shed her green jacket, now standing there in just her tailored green pants and a</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crisp white button-down, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. A dark leather-banded
            watch hugged her left wrist, and the simplicity of it-the rolled sleeves, the effortless confidence- threw
            Agatha more than she cared to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Agatha's gaze lingered, betraying her control. She wasn't used
            to this-being the one caught off balance-and it took everything in her to tear her eyes away from
            Vidal</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and force her focus back to the board.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Focus on the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha repeated to herself, forcing the thought into her head like a mantra.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What have you found?" she asked, her voice steadier than she felt as she
            nodded toward the board and stepped forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal snapped back to the task, nodding and stepping aside so Agatha could get a
            clearer view. But Agatha's attention flickered, unwillingly, from the board to Vidal's rolled-up
            sleeves, her toned forearms casually on display.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've found a couple of things in the data," Vidal said, pointing at a
            series of numbers that were incomprehensible to Agatha. She nodded absently. "I need more time to see
            if the pattern repeats itself, but there's something here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave a sharp nod, barely able to keep her mind tethered to the words.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this report..." Vidal reached for a document pinned to the whiteboard,
            handing it to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha. As Agatha took it, their fingers brushed again, and the contact sent an
            unwanted jolt of heat up her arm. She stiffened but kept her expression cold, despite the sudden
            warmth</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rushing under her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is a logistics report from 2022," Vidal explained, stepping closer as
            she pointed to a section of the report. Agatha could feel the proximity now, the way the air seemed to
            tighten between them. "It outlines shipping containers, their contents, deliveries. But this
            page-" Vidal reached for the report again, her fingers brushing Agatha's with maddening ease,
            "- this page was scanned separately from the rest."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes snapped up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How could you possibly know that?" she asked, a little sharper than she
            intended, trying to shake off the effect Vidal's presence was having on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's smirk returned, lazy and confident, and god, it sent a pulse of
            frustration-and something else-through Agatha. Vidal leaned in closer, too close, flipping through the pages
            with a deliberate slowness that had Agatha grinding her teeth. Their hands touched again, and Agatha felt
            her breath catch against her will.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You see this?" Vidal pointed to a small, nearly imperceptible black dot at
            the corner of the page. "It's on every page of the report-except for this one."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brows furrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was this woman doing to her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And why does that matter?" she asked, forcing herself to focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal leaned in closer, close enough for Agatha to catch the faint scent of her
            perfume-a subtle blend of cedar and forest, earthy and intoxicating. Agatha's jaw tightened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because," Vidal continued, her voice smooth, her fingers brushing against
            Agatha's again as she flipped back to the key page. "That dot comes from a scanner defect,
            something that burned into every page of this report. Except page 37."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze snapped to Vidal's fingers-long, nails short, well manicured,
            tracing the document. The heat between them felt unbearable, almost suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal glanced at her, satisfaction practically glowing on her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Which means someone scanned this entire report, removed page 37, and replaced
            it with a different one from another scanner. They are hiding something."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes flicked back to Vidal, heart pounding a little harder than it
            should have. She was good.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Too good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the way she stood there, just a breath away, that self-satisfied smirk on her
            face-it set something off in Agatha. She hated being off-balance, hated the way her body reacted to
            Vidal's closeness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But damn if it wasn't getting harder to tear her eyes away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, trying to ignore the heat coursing through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good catch," she said, her voice tight. "But next time, try not to
            take so long explaining it." Vidal's smirk didn't waver; if anything, it sharpened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't think you minded the details."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glared at her, trying to push away the pull, the distraction of Vidal's
            proximity. She tore her eyes back to the board, forcing herself to focus on the case. Her gaze landed on the
            picture of Brooke Sinclair, and she stepped away from Vidal closer to the board.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal tracked her movement, her eyes following the shift.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brooke Sinclair," she began, her tone more serious, but still carrying
            that annoying edge of confidence. "I think there's something you and your team might've missed
            with her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brow arched, irritation creeping in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh yeah?" she mocked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah." Vidal stepped a little closer, filling the gap Agatha tried to
            between them. "The deep dive your investigator did on her-did you catch her text messages with her
            co-worker,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kelcie?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha frowned, trying to place the name. "The engineer at
            Vanguard?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal gave a small nod, her eyes meeting Agatha's with that same challenging
            gleam. "That's the one."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, her patience hanging by a thread. She hated being led around,
            especially by someone who was clearly enjoying it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're going to have to give me more than that, Vidal."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal huffed, rolling her eyes in a way that was both exasperated and
            somehow...endearing. Then, without hesitation, she dropped the bomb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They were definitely fucking."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word hit Agatha like a slap-unexpected, raw. Her breath caught in her throat, and
            for a brief second, her mind blanked. The bluntness of it, the way Vidal said it so casually, so brazenly-it
            sent a shockwave through her, leaving her momentarily off-balance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stared at Vidal, her expression carefully neutral, but her mind was anything
            but.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal seemed to realize her slip a beat too late, her face reddening slightly as she
            quickly corrected herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I mean-they were definitely having sex," she amended, clearing her throat
            and shifting uncomfortably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the damage was done. The word still hung in the air between them, heavy and
            sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fucking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a strange heat crawl up her neck, her pulse quickening despite her best
            efforts to stay composed. There was something about hearing Vidal say it-so bluntly, without apology</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-that had her struggling to control the ripple of tension that passed through
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a split second, Agatha found herself frozen, staring at Vidal's flushed face,
            the awkward shift in her stance, the way her fingers nervously tapped the edge of the report in her hands.
            It was such a rare crack in Vidal's usually cool, impenetrable demeanor that Agatha wasn't sure if
            she found it amusing or maddening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cleared her throat, trying to force the tension back down, though when she spoke,
            her voice was tighter than she intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And how exactly did you come to the conclusion they were-" she paused,
            letting "fucking" linger in the air, "having sex? All indications point to them being
            friends, colleagues who hung out after work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Colleagues have sex," Vidal said casually, her tone so dismissive, so
            self-assured, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit Agatha harder than she expected. A sharp, visceral reaction stirred
            inside her, one she couldn't easily tamp down. It wasn't just the bluntness of the statement-it was
            the ease with which Vidal said it, as if the line between professional and personal was one she could cross
            without a second thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if it were normal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened, her irritation flaring as she tried to smother the
            deeper, more unsettling emotion rising in her chest. She stiffened, her jaw tightening as she forced her
            voice to remain steady, neutral-controlled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Not everyone crosses that line," she replied, her words clipped, but the
            faint edge in her tone betrayed her. She couldn't help it-something about Vidal's nonchalance struck
            a nerve, poking at the carefully constructed boundaries Agatha had built over the years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The line between personal and professional. The line she never crossed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And there's nothing in Brooke's profile that suggests she was
            gay," she added, as if the facts could reinforce her point, could pull her back from whatever slippery
            slope Vidal had her teetering on. Agatha threw Vidal a sharp look before returning her gaze to Brooke's
            photo pinned on the board. "Catholic upbringing, only ever dated men, Republican farmers for
            parents."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't usually one for boxing people in, for making assumptions. But
            sometimes facts were just facts, and she needed facts to steady herself. Facts anchored her, gave her
            control-and she needed control-especially now with the storm brewing inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal wasn't even slightly fazed. She snorted, and the sound of casual
            dismissal stung more than Agatha expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So what? You think religious upbringing and a few boyfriends in her past makes
            her straight? People are more complicated than that." Vidal leaned in just slightly, her voice low and
            almost teasing, as if she was enjoying this push-and-pull. "Sexuality is not always</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">concrete-it can be fluid-and it can surprise you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, a flicker of heat rising in her chest. She hated the way
            Vidal spoke with such confidence, as if she knew something Agatha wasn't willing to admit. The
            deliberate playfulness in Vidal's words stoked a fire of irritation, but beneath it, something else
            churned-something she refused to acknowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speaking from experience, Vidal?" Agatha shot back, needing hit back, but
            unable to keep the edge from her voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal didn't miss a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh-I am not straight," she said so casually, like it was the most natural
            thing in the world. "I exclusively-" she paused, letting that word hang between them, charged,
            lingering, "- see women."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus Christ, Agatha thought. I'm not going to survive this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air felt too thick, too charged, and Vidal was entirely too calm. Too
            comfortable. Agatha was suddenly acutely aware of the way Vidal's eyes hadn't wavered, how she
            didn't flinch or hesitate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was so...unapologetic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had to pull herself together, fast. Mockery was her best weapon, her shield, and
            she wielded it now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, how touching that you trusted me enough to come out," Agatha replied,
            her voice laced with sarcasm so sharp it could cut glass. "I'll be sure to put a rainbow flag in my
            pen holder, so you know I'm a proper ally."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were barbed, dripping with disdain, but deep down Agatha felt the tension
            rising. The sarcasm came too easily, masking the discomfort Vidal's candor stirred. It wasn't the
            gay thing-Agatha wasn't ignorant, wasn't naive. It was the fact that Vidal delivered it with such
            quiet confidence, like it was a power move. Like she was in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god, Agatha hated how much she respected that. How much she-no.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought against that train of thought. She forced herself to hold her ground,
            to stay rooted in logic, in the facts. She straightened, her chin lifting, eyes narrowing as if daring Vidal
            to challenge her further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There's nothing in this case to suggest Brooke was anything but
            straight."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal didn't back down. In fact, her smirk deepened, her eyes glittering with
            that maddening confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Really? You're straight, right?" she asked, her voice a slow,
            deliberate drawl, like she was savoring the words. Letting them hang between them, heavy, charged,
            deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her ground, but only barely. The truth?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd always considered herself straight-strictly men. They were uncomplicated,
            predictable. She didn't like complications, not in her personal life. Professionally, sure, she could
            outmaneuver anyone, but intimacy? She wanted it clean, simple, controlled. She dated men, married one,
            divorced him, and now she was 48. Too old, she told herself, to consider what she never allowed herself to
            entertain in her youth. Those fleeting thoughts, the ones she buried deep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal's eyes were on her now, and the way they narrowed with predatory
            curiosity made Agatha's chest tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Focus, she commanded herself, trying to keep her expression unreadable, but the
            charge between them was undeniable. She couldn't ignore it, couldn't ignore her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal was watching her too closely, taking in every shift, every subtle movement. The
            silence stretched, and Agatha felt the heat rise in her, skin prickling as she fought to maintain control.
            She glared at Vidal, determined to remain stone-faced, unaffected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal wasn't done. That damn smirk-cocky, knowing-stretched across her
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're telling me," she said slowly, her voice almost a purr now,
            "there's not a single woman in the world you'd let into your bed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question was like a challenge thrown between them, and Agatha could feel the
            pull, the heat behind the words wrapping around her, daring her to engage. Her chest tightened, and for the
            first time in a long while, she was at a loss for words. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out-caught
            between the raw, unspoken tension in Vidal's gaze and her own need to keep control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence stretched again, and Vidal's smirk only deepened, like she'd won
            something. She leaned back, her body relaxed, but her eyes gleaming with triumph.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I rest my case," she murmured, almost mockingly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt something inside her snap, a pulse of heat rushing through her veins.
            This was no longer about work, no longer about a case. This was personal, a dangerous push-and-pull that had
            her teetering on the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she wasn't sure which way she wanted to fall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlock Thy Hidden Gate</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three days later, Agatha sat in the war room, the glow of the overhead lights casting
            sharp shadows across the piles of documents and tangled threads of the Vanguard case. Night had fallen long
            ago, and while her days were consumed by the responsibilities of being a partner</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-meetings, clients, and the endless fires that required her attention-after seven,
            Agatha was finally able to dive into what she truly craved: the hunt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Vanguard case was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Special.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gnawed at her, demanded her attention, and pulled her in ways she hadn't felt
            in years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And though she would never, ever admit it out loud, Rio Vidal made the chase even
            more intoxicating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal was sharper than anyone Agatha had worked with in a long time. The way she
            could</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">recall details from reports she'd read days ago, quoting them word for word, or
            cite case law with frightening accuracy, was nothing short of extraordinary. It was like she had a
            photographic memory, effortlessly cataloging and retrieving information like it was nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal was also green.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's where the real dance began.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal would unearth something she believed was bulletproof-a key link, a
            watertight</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">argument-and Agatha would systematically tear it apart. She'd poke holes in it
            until there was nothing left but the shredded remains of Vidal's confidence. But where most would shrink
            under that kind of scrutiny, Vidal didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She absorbed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every critique, every jab Agatha threw her way, Vidal took it like it was nothing-no,
            not nothing. She took each blow like a challenge. Fuel that made her dig deeper, push harder, and come back
            sharper, more determined.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had to hand it to her-Vidal was either a masochist or had the kind of
            unrelenting resolve that could cut through steel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably a little of both, she thought and that sent Agatha's mind spiraling.
            Professionally, the working relationship between them had become a well-oiled machine. They were good
            together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She despised how well they worked, the efficiency, the rhythm. She hated that every
            part of her knew it was true.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But personally? Privately? That was a different beast entirely. The part of herself
            Agatha kept locked away, tightly controlled, felt like a live wire sparking dangerously next to an open gas
            can. It was volatile, electric, and it was only getting worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every touch-which Agatha swore was intentional. Every look Vidal sent her way.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That fucking smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The constant challenges. The playful word games. The way Vidal's lips would quirk
            ever so slightly when she caught Agatha staring-like just now, chewing on the end of a pen cap as if it
            wasn't driving Agatha mad.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It ate at her, little by little, each moment sparking something dangerous. Something
            Agatha hadn't felt in a long time. She couldn't remember the last time she'd felt this affected
            by</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anyone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to get her shit under control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was everything. Her rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her shield.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her weapon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her armor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with every passing day, every heated glance from Vidal, every veiled innuendo,
            Agatha felt that control slipping, unraveling bit by bit. And that terrified her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Agatha was scared-when control seemed just out of reach-she lashed
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The entire office was walking on eggshells around her. Yesterday, she swore she saw
            Billy's eyes glisten with tears when she tore into him over something he had no control over. But he was
            closest, and she needed something-someone-to attack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment she entered a hallway, senior associates who were quite used to her
            antics, turned and went the other way. She had already driven two new associates to hand in their
            resignations within the last 48 hours. A personal record, really. Usually, it took a week to break
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two in two days? That was impressive, even by her standards. Jen, however, was not
            impressed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two who quit had been Jen's picks-clients' kids, no less. Now, those
            clients were</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">calling, demanding to know why their golden children left the firm in tears,
            questioning what kind of place they were running.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha braced herself for the usual shovel talk from Jen, the lecture about how they
            needed to "play nice" with important clients. But instead, Jen threw her a curveball that hit her
            like a brick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is Nicholas, okay?" Jen had asked, her voice unexpectedly soft, filled
            with genuine concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question startled Agatha. Jen was looking at her differently, with something
            Agatha despised-pity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Agatha snapped, her voice more defensive than she intended.
            "He's fine."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen didn't blink, just continued to look at her-really look at her in a way that
            made Agatha feel exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's just-I haven't seen you like this since..." Jen trailed off,
            but the unspoken words hung heavy between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened. She knew exactly what Jen was talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Nicholas was sick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory slammed into her-unwelcome, like a sharp sting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha finally died, hopefully it would be a long, long time from now-because
            she had plenty more things to destroy-there was one thing she knew for certain. The first thing she'd
            do, wherever she ended up, would be to find the powers that be, wrap her hands around their necks, and
            scream:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What kind of god gives a three-year-old cancer?!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully it was treatable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Modern medicine had advanced just enough for them to catch it in time, treat it, and
            put</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicholas into remission. Now, there was barely a chance it would ever return. But
            during that time, when he was sick, when her little boy had been hooked up to machines, fighting a battle he
            shouldn't have ever had to fight... Agatha had lost control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She became a monster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing survived her wrath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tore through the office like a storm, annihilating everything in her path. Six
            contempt citations in court-a personal record. She fired so many people in the span of those months that the
            partners had to temporarily strip her of the authority to fire anyone because they</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't fill positions fast enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one wanted to work with her. No one wanted to be near her. And James, her husband
            at the time? He was in that group, too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't surprised when James left. He had always been weak-too weak to
            handle her, too weak to handle Nicholas's illness, and too weak to shoulder the weight of their world
            crumbling around them. So, he walked away. And Agatha, true to form, didn't have time to mourn
            him-didn't care to, either. She was too busy clawing her way back to control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't until the remission diagnosis, when the words "he's going to
            be okay" finally</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached her ears, that she felt something inside her ease. The only thing that pulled
            her back</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">from the brink, from the chaos she'd become, was the knowledge that Nicholas had
            survived. That she had fought through it and won.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was control, pure and simple. It had always been control that kept her
            anchored.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm glad Nicholas is okay," Jen said quietly, letting the words linger
            between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They weren't friends-not exactly-but they were something. Her and Jen's
            relationship was the kind that was built on mutual survival, where only they could stab each other in the
            back and no one else. In a weird, twisted way, they protected each other, even while plotting each
            other's downfall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Symbiotic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them thickened before Jen snapped out of it, her expression
            hardening into the familiar glare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Stop terrorizing the first years," Jen warned. "They see you coming
            and practically sprint in the opposite direction. And if I have to take one more call from a client asking
            why their golden-child left the firm in tears-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's sharp laugh cut her off, the tension between them breaking as she
            slipped back into her usual bravado.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, please," Agatha said, rolling her eyes. "You're just mad that
            your hires turned out to be incompetent. There's no way those two passed the bar on their own merit. Did
            you see the brief Callaway wrote? It looked like it was written in crayon! And don't get me started
            on</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wright. Do you know why I yelled at him? I overheard him asking another associate
            what</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">prima facie meant."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's mouth twitched, fighting back a smile, though the stern look in her eyes
            remained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she said with a tired sigh. "Just lay off them. I'm
            running out of excuses for your behavior."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have you tried blaming it on my 'mommy issues'? That's what my
            therapist says." Agatha quipped, earning an eye roll from Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen turned to leave clearly giving up on the battle, but something clicked in
            Agatha's mind, and before she could stop herself, the words slipped out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who picked Vidal?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen froze, brow raised, her eyes flicking toward the war room, then back to Agatha,
            as if she were trying to piece something together. Agatha instantly regretted asking, watching Jen's
            lips quirk into a devilish smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why do you ask?" Jen's voice dripped with amusement, almost taunting.
            Agatha fought to keep her face impassive, unwilling to give Jen an inch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," she said carefully, searching for words Jen couldn't pick
            apart. "She's... surprisingly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-not an idiot, unlike the rest of your recruits."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's smirk deepened, her eyes gleaming with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Not an idiot?" repeated Jen with an almost sing-like tone.
            "That's high praise coming from you. Careful, Agatha, someone might think you actually like
            her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, irritation flaring. "I don't like anyone, Jen.
            You know that."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I know," Jen said, her tone light, teasing. "But you're
            curious, aren't you? She's gotten under your skin."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, refusing to take the bait.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's just competent. Which is more than I can say for the rest of the
            associates you've sent my way."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen shrugged, unbothered by the jab. "Whatever you say."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to leave, clearly enjoying the small victory she thought she'd gained,
            but before walking out the door, Jen called over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She was Lilia's pick, by the way." Agatha froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia-of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia didn't hire often, but when she did, she had an unshakable talent for
            picking the good ones. She had a sixth sense for potential, seeing things in people that others
            couldn't. Agatha knew that all too well-Lilia had been the one to poach her from her old firm when she
            was a third-year associate, recognizing her potential long before anyone else had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Lilia picked Vidal-then that meant she was special.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory lingered until Vidal's voice cut through, pulling Agatha out of her
            thoughts. She jerked slightly, realizing she'd missed whatever Vidal had said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal stood in front of the whiteboard, her expression bored, arms crossed. "I
            want to talk to Kelcie Baker," she repeated. "She knows something."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back in her chair, her lips pursing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She won't talk to us. Vanguard will never allow it without a lawyer
            present."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could react, Vidal stepped forward, moving closer-too close, almost
            hovering over her. The proximity made Agatha's skin prickle with tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you-" Agatha began, but Vidal was already reaching past her,
            grabbing Agatha's laptop without hesitation. The fact that Vidal's chest was nearly pressed against
            her face</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn't lost on her, and Agatha's irritation flared and something else
            flared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you have any respect for personal space?" Agatha growled as Vidal moved
            away, though not far enough for her liking-still standing way too close, a teasing smirk playing at
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">edges of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal paused mid-typing, glancing at Agatha with that infuriating flash in her
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Does me being close to you bother you?" she asked, voice low and loaded
            with challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was such a simple question, but it was delivered like a dare. The way Vidal's
            eyes gleamed, the way she stood there as if she knew exactly how much she was getting under Agatha's
            skin, left Agatha bristling with frustration and something she still refused to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched, her voice steely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she lied. "But I do expect some professionalism."
            Vidal's smirk finally emerged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," Vidal said, her voice dripping with feigned innocence.
            "Just checking."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she turned back to the laptop, typing away as though the tension between them
            hadn't just skyrocketed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's patience wore thinner with each click of the keys. She was about to snap
            when Vidal suddenly stood and turned the laptop toward her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as she read the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Gay of Thrones: The Dance of the Dragon Queens. Drag Show at the Red Light
            Tonight," she read aloud, her irritation palpable. She exhaled sharply. "And what exactly does
            this have to do with work?" she practically hissed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's grin grew predatory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kelcie RSVP'd to the event," she said, her eyes gleaming with
            satisfaction. "She'll be there."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That caught Agatha's attention. Her eyes flicked back to the screen, which looked
            like a unicorn had thrown up a rainbow all over it. Interesting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Even if we could get her to talk," Agatha said slowly, her mind working,
            "we can't use anything she says in court. It's hearsay. She'll never sign an
            affidavit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal nodded, not missing a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We don't need her statement. If she gives us something-anything-we can use
            it as a lead. Let her point us in the direction we need to follow. Instead of building this case blind, we
            let her be our compass."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated that it wasn't a terrible idea. In fact, it was annoyingly clever.
            She chewed over it, her mind racing through the possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And what if she won't talk?" Agatha asked, still searching for any
            flaw in the plan. Vidal's smirk widened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She'll talk."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised a brow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You sound awfully confident."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal leaned in just slightly, her voice low, almost cockily. "Let's just
            say I have a way of getting people to open up."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened, but she tamped down the reaction, keeping her
            expression impassive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman was impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stared at Vidal, then back at the screen, before finally exhaling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine. We'll go," Agatha said, her decision already made the moment
            Vidal mentioned</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kelcie's name. She stood, grabbing her purple trench coat from the back of her
            chair and swinging it on with a practiced ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We?" Vidal echoed, sounding genuinely surprised. "You're actually
            going?" Agatha turned, eyes narrowing as if the very question was an insult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is my case," she said, the weight of authority clear in her tone.
            "I'm not letting some baby lawyer question a key witness-again-in my case without me
            there."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a brief second, Vidal looked impressed before she masked it with a neutral
            expression. "Okay," she nodded, grabbing her own jacket. "Are we riding
            together?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha laughed at that, the sharp sound echoed in the war room as she moved toward
            the door, tossing Vidal a withering look over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll be riding in my town car," she said, her eyes scanning Vidal up
            and down with a hint of condescension. "You can take an Uber."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gave a dismissive wave, her fingers wiggling in a mock farewell.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ta ta," Agatha added, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she sauntered
            out, a smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't bother looking back-satisfied with the certainty that Vidal was
            probably</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">frowning behind her. The smirk deepened as she strode down the hallway, savoring the
            small victory in a game that was becoming more intriguing with each move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't entirely sure of the rules yet, but she knew one thing: she was
            determined to win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neath the Wooded Shrine</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People always assumed Agatha went into law for power, and sure, that was partly true.
            But the reality was simpler.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha liked boundaries.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She liked the law because, while its interpretation could be fluid, its roots ran
            deep-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">immovable and grounded in centuries of precedent. It could sway, but it never broke.
            It was steady, predictable, and Agatha thrived on that steadiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was accurately aware that she was a walking contradiction. A living, breathing
            oxymoron.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Outwardly, she was known for being wild, untethered, and completely unpredictable.
            That was her brand-what made her feared and respected in equal measure. But deep down,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha craved structure. Rules kept the chaos at bay, gave her control in a world
            that thrived on disorder. She needed boundaries-clear lines to draw and redraw as she saw fit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as Agatha eyed the Red Light bar from the safety of her town car, she knew that
            she was about step into a world far outside her carefully controlled boundaries. The vibrant crowd and the
            unapologetic energy-it didn't take a genius to see what the Red Light was-a gay bar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only a gay bar would host a "Game of Thrones Drag Night," and only a place
            like this would have such an eclectic crowd gathered outside. Men in everything from skimpy outfits and
            stilettos to jeans and boots. Women in skin-tight dresses or rocking masculine wear with a swagger. Every
            damn letter of that acronym, LGBTQIA+, was out there in full display-an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">alphabet soup she could hardly keep up with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it wasn't just the terminology that tripped her up. Out there was a world she
            didn't know how to navigate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Give her a courtroom, a boardroom-hell-even a men's club, and she could walk in
            like she owned the place and leave owning it. But here-outside this place, with its carefree happiness, its
            freedom-it was like stepping into a scene from her worst nightmare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared out at the crowd, her fingers tapping anxiously against her leg. She
            didn't want to go outside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of stepping into that world, where everything seemed so loose, so free-it
            unsettled her in ways she wasn't comfortable acknowledging. It wasn't the kind of place she
            belonged, and the idea of being in the middle of it made her stomach tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she knew she had to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She refused to still be sitting in this car when Vidal arrived. Refused to let her
            see even a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flicker of hesitation. Vidal would be walking into this place like she owned it,
            slipping into the chaos effortlessly. And Agatha couldn't afford to show a crack in her armor, to show
            Vidal she was uncomfortable. It was a point she wasn't willing to concede this game they have been
            playing with each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So with a deep heavy sigh that did nothing to settler her nerves, she shrugged off
            her coat, because this was definitely not the kind of establishment that had a coat check, and she'd be
            damned if she was going to hang her designer jacket over a barstool. Her Hermes purse stayed in the car as
            well; she wasn't to risk that in there. She grabbed only the essentials- cash, credit card, phone-before
            throwing her hair into a messy bun and looked at herself in her pocket mirror to make sure she looked
            acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked nervous, and she snapped the pocket mirror closed with a hiss. She closed
            her eyes, and then, with one final inhale, she opened the door and stepped out into the night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one even looked her way when her heels hit the sidewalk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which was rare-Agatha commanded attention when she walked into a room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But here?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was just one among many.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you're sharing space with a 6'5" drag queen, sporting a full beard,
            flawless makeup, and a barely-there dress, well... you're not exactly the center of attention
            anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For once, Agatha wasn't the shiniest object in the room. It was full of
            personalities, larger- than-life people with confidence radiating from every corner, and-dare she admit
            it-some even larger than hers. But as she stepped through the door and into the bar, it felt oddly</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">refreshing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice, even.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not being recognized.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not having every eye on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few appreciative glances came her way-mostly from impeccably dressed men who eyed
            her designer clothes and a couple from women who seemed to appreciate how well she wore said clothes. But
            for the most part, she was just another person at the bar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god, did she need a drink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or ten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha slid onto an empty barstool, her eyes scanning the room before landing on the
            bartender approaching her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman was striking-blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail, strong, angular
            features framed by a pair of circular glasses. She was dressed in tight black pants and a sleeveless black
            shirt that showed off toned arms covered in intricate, inky tattoos that snaked down both sides. She had
            that effortless hipster/lesbian vibe down pat-too well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could definitely see the appeal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What can I get you?" the bartender asked, her voice smooth, professional,
            but carrying a subtle teasing quality.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't hesitate, her gaze lingering a little longer than she
            intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The most expensive bourbon you've got," she said, pulling out her
            credit card and slamming it down on the counter with a snap. "And keep it open."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bartender raised an impressed eyebrow as she slid Agatha's sleek black credit
            card off the counter. Without another word, she turned to make the drink, leaving Agatha a moment to scan
            the room. The place was packed, a swirling mass of and if Vidal was here, finding her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">would be like looking for a needle in a glitter-covered haystack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha cursed under her breath, irritated that she hadn't insisted on giving
            Vidal a hard time</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-of making her take an uber. This entire mission to track down Kelcie Baker was
            already off to a rocky start.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as her frustration began to bubble beneath the surface, Agatha heard the clink
            of glass sliding across the bar top. She turned to see the bartender smiling softly in her direction,
            bourbon in hand, pushing it towards her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"One of our finest bourbons, for one of our finest lady," the bartender
            teased with a wink, her voice smooth, with just the right amount of playfulness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha grabbed the drink, smirking to herself. There was no harm in a little game
            while she waited.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I bet you say that to all the ladies," Agatha quipped, raising an
            eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bartender's smile widened, and she leaned in slightly, closing the distance
            between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Actually-no," she replied, her tone dropping to something almost
            conspiratorial. "Not many people that come here can afford a $50 glass of bourbon."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Only $50?" Agatha took a slow sip, exaggerating her grimace a little more
            than necessary. "It tastes like it only cost $50."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bartender chuckled, leaning forward with an easy, knowing smile. "Oh, the $8
            one will really knock your socks off," she teased.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha laughed, surprising herself. For a moment, the tension in her shoulders eased.
            But as her eyes swept over the bar again, the reason she was there tugged her back to reality.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flirting, as nice as it was, could only serve as a distraction for so long.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where the hell was Vidal?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Waiting for someone?" the bartender asked, the curiosity in her voice
            unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, downing the rest of her drink and setting the glass down with a little
            too much force.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's a shame," the bartender said, her lips quirking up in a smile
            that Agatha grudgingly admitted was... effective.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What? That I finished my drink so fast?" Agatha asked, still scanning the
            crowd for any sign of Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bartender shook her head, her eyes locking onto Agatha's with a look that was
            far too knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That you're waiting for someone," she said, the disappointment in her
            tone softened by that same smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind stalled for a moment, thrown by the sheer boldness of the
            bartender's words. It had been a long time since someone had flirted with her so openly, so casually. Of
            course, there was Vidal, but with her, Agatha could never be sure-was Vidal flirting or just testing her
            boundaries? Pushing her, seeing how far Agatha's control stretched before it snapped?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this bartender-this woman-wasn't playing mind games. She was just...
            flirting. Plain</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and simple. And that, oddly enough, was kind of a relief. There were no complex
            motives, no hidden agenda-just pure, uncomplicated interest. And damn if that didn't stir something deep
            inside her, something she hadn't felt in longer than she cared to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened her mouth, the response hovering on the edge of something-flirty, playful,
            she wasn't even sure what. But there was an undeniable pull, a subtle urge to engage, to throw a little
            heat back into the mix. Then, just as the words were forming, she felt it-a hand on her shoulder. At first
            soft, then firm, fingers curling with purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who the hell had the audacity to touch her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She spun around, ready to deliver a cutting remark, her irritation spiking, when a
            voice rumbled near her ear-low, familiar, and entirely too close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There you are, baby," Vidal murmured, her voice laced with teasing edge.
            "Sorry to keep you waiting..." The hand tightened slightly, fingers pressing with deliberate kind
            of possession. "There was traffic."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated the shiver that went through her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated the way her body responded before her mind could catch up, the curl of heat
            that swept through her, and the way her lips parted ever so slightly, just for a second-a split second-
            where she let herself feel Vidal, just like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Jesus, she felt like she was on fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, she snapped back to herself. How she found her control, she didn't
            know, but she did. She turned to face Vidal, standing there in her untucked forest green shirt, dark ash
            pants, sleeves rolled up, the top buttons undone, revealing layered gold chains that caught the dim light
            against the backdrop of the pale skin of her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated how good Vidal looked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated even more how it made her feel-restless, hot, and annoyed all at once.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A fake smile slipped onto her face, the kind that came far more easily than her real
            ones. If Vidal wanted to play this game, Agatha could play it better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, sweetheart," she said, the word dripping with mock affection, heat
            woven into the taunt. She leaned forward, just enough to watch the subtle way Vidal's eyes darkened, her
            jaw tightening as Agatha closed the distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, with her lips barely brushing Vidal's ear, she whispered, low and
            dangerous, just for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Touch me again, and I'll break your hand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had expected Vidal to pull back like she'd been burned, but instead, the
            woman-this infuriatingly bold woman-slowly withdrew her hand, her fingertips deliberately trailing down
            Agatha's arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a spark in Vidal's eyes, a smirk on her lips that screamed: I'm a
            pyromaniac, and I love playing with fire, even if it hurts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her touch lingered, setting Agatha's skin ablaze with a sensation she both hated
            and couldn't shake. Vidal's hand finally dropped, but her gaze stayed, locked with Agatha's in a
            long,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">charged moment that made the air between them thrum with unspoken tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Vidal's eyes flicked past Agatha's shoulder, her smirk faltering into a
            thinner line. "Max," she said, her tone now having a different edge to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, confused, followed her gaze and found the bartender-Max-watching them with a
            raised brow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," the bartender acknowledged, nodding with a familiarity that annoyed
            Agatha more than she'd admit. Max's eyes shifted to Agatha, her earlier flirtation replaced by
            something more subdued, almost apologetic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Another drink?" Max asked, reaching for Agatha's empty glass.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, momentarily at a loss for words, watching as Max turned to prepare her
            drink. The moment stretched between them, leaving Agatha alone with Vidal again, and she could feel the
            tension settling back into place as smoothly as before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning to Vidal, she raised a brow, her voice laced with mockery.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A friend of yours?" she asked, savoring the slight crack-just the tiniest
            tick at the corner of Vidal's mouth-that appeared at her question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of glass sliding against the bar echoed behind them, and Vidal threw Agatha
            a glance before stepping forward. Her body brushed against Agatha's for a fleeting moment as she reached
            around her, fingers curling around a beer bottle that hadn't been there before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's skin tingled where they'd touched, but before she could register it,
            Vidal had pulled back, taking a slow drink from the bottle, her eyes never leaving Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Vidal finally said, her tone calm, detached, like she was closing the
            door on a conversation that Agatha had barely started.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pursed, unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had finally felt the crack, and she wasn't ready to let it go-not when
            she'd finally found a way through Vidal's carefully crafted armor. Her eyes flicked to the beer in
            Vidal's hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't ordered it, and yet it was there, as if summoned. The connection
            clicked in Agatha's mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come here often?" she drawled trying to find another way to slip past her
            defenses, to land another blow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze sharpened, but instead of biting back, she raised the bottle again,
            taking another slow, deliberate sip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha's jaw clenched involuntarily, hating how good Vidal looked with the
            bottle pressed to her lips, framed by the strobing lights from the dance floor. She looked like she'd
            stepped right out of one of those over-sexualized beer commercials-effortlessly tempting, the kind of image
            men-or Agatha, if she had no taste and an unfinished basement-would tack up on the wall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of Vidal's effect on her had Agatha gritting her teeth, irritation
            mixing with something else she still refused to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And judging by the knowing look Vidal threw her way as she lowered the beer bottle
            from her lips, Vidal was well aware of the reaction she was causing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have you seen her yet?" Vidal asked, her eyes never leaving Agatha's,
            not even bothering to glance around the bar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a rush of relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Work. Thank god.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Snapping back to the task at hand, her nerves settled like a gentle rain after a
            storm. She didn't show it, of course-her expression remained as impassive as ever-but the distraction of
            the case was welcome. It gave her something solid to grip onto, something familiar to ground herself
            in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Not yet," she said, her voice cool and controlled, though the shift in
            focus steadied her more than she'd like to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then let's grab a seat," Rio suggested, her voice easy, almost
            nonchalant. "The show's about to start, and we'll have a better chance of spotting her once
            everyone's settled."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, not trusting herself to say anything. She stood up, flicking her hand
            dramatically for Vidal to lead the way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal smirked but didn't push it, as she turned to walk away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha followed, sharply aware of the shift in energy as they moved through the
            crowd. It wasn't so much that people were looking at them-no, they were looking at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was the kind of woman who drew attention effortlessly. Agatha could feel the
            curious glances, the subtle stares of appreciation, but what really caught her off guard was the way several
            women looked at Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those looks weren't just admiration-they were steeped in history.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Longing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something unfamiliar and unwelcome flared in Agatha's chest as she caught those
            glances. She hated how much they bothered her, how much they twisted something sharp inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal led them to a table and, with that infuriating smirk still playing on her lips,
            pulled out a chair for Agatha, eyes glinting with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a glare, refusing to play into it. She grabbed her own chair with
            deliberate spite and sat down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was supposed to be a power move, a silent declaration that she was in control
            here-but instead of backing down, Vidal just snorted, amused, and sat down in the very chair she'd
            originally pulled out for Agatha. She sat down and took a drink, not surprised nor affected by Agatha's
            little display at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damn her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha grabbed her drink, taking a healthy sip, hoping to drown the restless energy
            coursing through her. She hated the way her nerves buzzed under her skin, even more so when she glanced at
            Vidal, lounging back in her chair, casually sipping her beer like they were at some beachside resort. It was
            unnerving how at ease she seemed, how unbothered she was by</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers tightened around her glass, her frustration building. She opened
            her mouth, ready to snap something sharp and cutting, but the words were swallowed by the sudden shift in
            the room. The music faded, giving way to the familiar, dramatic swell of the Game of Thrones theme. The
            lights dimmed even further, casting everything in shadows, as a wave of cheers erupted around them-catcalls,
            squeals, hollers from all sides.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crowd surged like a living tide, the dance floor clearing as people scrambled for
            seats, crammed around tables, or lined up against the walls, their excitement palpable. Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watched with guarded curiosity, unsure of what to expect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the drag show that followed was, quite possibly, one of the most entertaining
            things</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had ever witnessed. She had a secret love for Broadway, and if there was one
            thing she knew, it was how a sprinkle of sex appeal could elevate a performance. These men-no, these
            women-were simply magnificent. The pageantry, the confidence, the humor-it was spellbinding. More than once,
            she caught herself smiling, drawn in by the energy of it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, a queen dressed as a scantily clad Cersei Lannister sauntered by their
            table, her hips swaying in time to the music as she collected dollar bills from the crowd. Agatha, not one
            to be left out, reached into her pocket and pulled out a bill, and without a second thought, she handed one
            over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The queen's eyes widened in shock, her expression turning reverent as she
            dramatically bowed before Agatha, sending a ripple of laughter through the nearby crowd, before moving
            on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal, who had been watching with amused disbelief, finally broke into
            laughter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you just give that drag queen a hundred?" she asked, her voice a mix
            of shock and amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to her with a casual shrug. "It was all I had."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal just shook her head, still laughing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You shouldn't have done that," she said, her eyes gleaming with a
            mischievous glint. Agatha frowned, confused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why not? Isn't that what people do?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal leaned back in her chair, taking a swig of her drink, her grin spreading
            wider.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, you'll see," she said in a teasing, sing-song voice, clearly
            enjoying whatever inside joke she was keeping to herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And sure as shit, nine performances later, the show ended, and Agatha was out a
            thousand bucks. Turns out, drag queens are greedy little things. They kept coming back to her table, their
            eyes lighting up as soon as they saw the woman who'd handed out a hundred like it was pocket
            change.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that Agatha really minded. She'd definitely spent a thousand dollars on
            things far less enjoyable, and watching the queens work the crowd was worth every bill.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, she couldn't help but throw Vidal a sideways glance, seeing the smug
            amusement that had settled on her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enjoying yourself?" Agatha asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm, though
            even she couldn't hide the smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal chuckled, leaning in slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, absolutely. Watching you get worked by the queens? Worth every
            second." Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn't completely stifle her own amusement.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll consider it charity," Agatha quipped, tossing back the last of
            her drink. "A tax write-off."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal smirked at that, but then her eyes flicked past Agatha's shoulder,
            narrowing with sharp focus. The playfulness evaporated, and her entire demeanor shifted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There she is," Vidal murmured, nodding behind Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened. She turned to follow Vidal's gaze, and there she
            was-Kelcie Baker. For a brief moment, during the show, amid the banter and drinks, Agatha had almost
            forgotten why they were there. But seeing Kelcie now, flesh and blood, brought everything rushing
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A different kind of excitement stirred through her-sharp, electric. Like a shark that
            had just caught the scent of blood in the water.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned back to Vidal, their eyes locking, and the atmosphere between them
            shifted. The smirks and teasing exchanged during the show were gone, replaced by something more charged,
            something with weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The drag show had been the opening act. But this?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the main event.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the real show was about to begin.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Tower Reversed</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes studied Vidal, feeling the tension between them shift. This was the
            moment, the one they'd been building toward all night, and the weight of it settled heavily on her
            shoulders. The air in the bar seemed to thicken, the background noise fading as she focused on the task
            ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, this was your plan," she said slowly, her voice straddling the line
            between mocking and serious. "So, what's the grand idea for getting her to talk?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's eyes flicked toward Kelcie Baker, narrowing slightly as she watched her
            sip her drink, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she was being hunted. Then, Vidal turned back to Agatha,
            her expression unreadable, the usual playful glint replaced with something more calculating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She might recognize you," Vidal said quietly, her voice steady, betraying
            none of the nerves that Agatha expected. "Let me handle it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's immediate reaction was visceral. A surge of discomfort hit her chest
            like a punch, and she stiffened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she said sharply, the absurdity of that idea having her nearly bite
            Vidal's head off. "Have you ever even questioned someone before?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal merely shrugged, calm as ever-and gods Agatha both hated and respected
            Vidal's ability to deal with her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she answered truthfully, but looked Agatha in the eye when she spoke
            next. "But this isn't a deposition," she replied, the edge of a smirk pulling at her lips.
            "It's a conversation. Between two lesbians at a bar."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lesbian.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word hit Agatha with a strange, unexpected force. The simplicity of it, the way
            Vidal just said it-like it was nothing. But it wasn't nothing, not to Agatha. It rang in her head,
            making her feel unsettled in a way she hated to admit. Her jaw tightened as she tore her gaze away,
            pretending that the word didn't rattle her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal leaned forward, her voice softer now, more controlled-calculated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"> "Look," she said, drawing Agatha's gaze back to her,
            "Kelcie's not going to open up if she feels cornered. She's here to relax, maybe let her guard
            down. She's not expecting to be interrogated. Let me talk to her. We need her to trust us."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes flicked back to Kelcie, who was still oblivious, chatting with a
            group of friends at the bar. It was true-Agatha's presence would be too much. There was a chance that
            she didn't know who Agatha was, but if she did-if she did know she was the lawyer currently</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">representing Brooke Sinclair and trying to bring down the company she worked for,
            well then there was no way she was going to talk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of letting Vidal take control gnawed at Agatha, a constant, bitter
            tug-of-war between the logic that insisted she let go and the fierce instinct to keep her grip on</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything. The tension in her chest tightened as she stared at Vidal, trying to
            force herself to consider it, but her body seemed to revolt at the very idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't like it," she snapped, the words sharper than she'd
            intended, her voice laced with the frustration she'd been barely holding back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal, unsurprisingly, didn't flinch. She never did.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she just watched Agatha, her gaze steady, as if peeling back layers and
            seeing straight into the heart of her. She tilted her head slightly, a habit that told Agatha she was sizing
            her up, finding something buried there. And then, as if satisfied, Vidal leaned back in her chair, adopting
            that maddeningly laid-back posture that made Agatha want to kick the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chair right out from under her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't have to like it," Vidal said, her voice smooth and calm,
            each word measured but unshakable. Her eyes held a glint, flashing in the strobe lights from the dance
            floor-a barely veiled challenge that was impossible to ignore. "But you do have to let me do
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's teeth ground together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gods-she was right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew it, but knowing didn't make the bitter pill any easier to
            swallow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine," she ground out, the word barely escaping before she felt every
            instinct in her body revolt. The surrender tasted sour, her control clawing its way back up her throat,
            fighting to snatch the words from the air and drag them back, keep them safely under her grasp. But it was
            too late; the words had already slipped, and Vidal was already moving to stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Desperate to reclaim some sense of authority, she shot out a warning. "If you
            mess this up-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal, halfway to her feet, moved with an infuriatingly easy confidence, a grace
            that seemed to mock Agatha's attempt to hold onto any last shreds of control. Her calm was maddening,
            her stride steady as if she had owned this outcome from the start. And just as Agatha forced out the rest of
            her warning, Vidal stopped beside her, then bent down, close enough that her breath was a whisper against
            Agatha's ear, her voice soft, teasing, and maddeningly calm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I got this, boss."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were a soft taunt, and they sent a jolt down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For just a split second, she was frozen, her pulse spiking in response. Vidal's
            breath lingered too close to her skin, and Agatha hated how much it got to her. And then with a smirk that
            Agatha didn't need to see to feel, Vidal pulled away and walked off, moving toward Kelcie like she owned
            the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, watching with a mixture of irritation and curiosity.
            Vidal had swagger, sure, but this was where it mattered-where her confidence would either pay off or
            crumble. Agatha leaned back in her chair, eyes fixed on the scene, watching because that was the only thing
            she could do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kelcie stood in a crowded part of the bar, people pressed shoulder to shoulder. Vidal
            moved smoothly through the throng, slipping between bodies with ease. And then, as if by accident, Agatha
            watched as Vidal fumbled with her phone, letting it dangle carelessly by her side. Just as she passed
            Kelcie, the phone "slipped" from her hand, landing right on Kelcie's foot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kelcie startled, bending down to grab the phone, and Agatha could already see it-the
            bait had been taken. Vidal kept walking, seemingly unaware, until Kelcie called after her, holding out the
            phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look of innocent surprise that crossed Vidal's face was pure gold. Agatha
            almost smirked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a clever move, a casual icebreaker that didn't reek of manipulation-at
            least not on the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nice move, Agatha thought, grudgingly impressed as Vidal turned back, flashing easy
            charm and a practiced smile as she accepted the phone from Kelcie. But this was where it counted- whether
            Vidal could really deliver. Agatha's eyes narrowed as she leaned forward, watching intently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Twenty minutes later, Agatha wasn't sure if she hated the game or hated that
            Vidal was winning it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was obvious-Vidal knew exactly what she was doing. Kelcie was engaged, smiling,
            laughing-hell, was she blushing?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What in God's name had Vidal said to her to get her blushing life like
            that?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure if she wanted to know or if it would just piss her off
            more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did this bother her so much?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal was doing her job-getting Kelcie to open up, to talk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was doing exactly what she had promised, but it gnawed at Agatha in a way she
            couldn't fully explain. Kelcie wasn't just talking; she was hanging on Vidal's every word.
            Laughing at every joke. Smiling at every teasing remark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Vidal laughed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound, bright and carefree, sliced through the noise of the bar like a knife,
            catching Agatha off guard. And for the first time, Vidal's smile wasn't a smirk, wasn't teasing
            or predatory-it was genuine, soft, and... beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, the realization hitting harder than she liked.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal reached out, still laughing, and her hand brushed Kelcie's arm, fingers
            lingering just a moment longer than necessary. The movement was subtle, but it was impossible to
            miss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched as she remembered how those same fingers had felt on her
            hand when the exchanged reports, or when they curled into her shoulder. The thought caused an uncomfortable
            twist in her stomach, and as if she was reacting to the unknown emotion that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">curled inside her, she shoved herself up from her chair, nearly knocking it over in
            the process. The sharp sound of wood scraping against the floor barely registered as she turned on her heel
            and walked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed a fucking drink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha marched to the bar and found an open seat, settling into it with more force
            than necessary. She still made sure she chose a spot at the bar, that she could still see them-Vidal and
            Kelcie. Their heads pressed together now, speaking in low, intimate voices as if the rest of the bar
            didn't exist, and she gritted her teeth and looked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was then she caught the eye of the bartender-Max, who raised a brow in surprise at
            her presence back at the bar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't wait for her to approach. She just held up two fingers, her
            expression flat. Max, thankfully understood and gave a nod and, this time, grabbed the bottle bringing it
            straight over to her. She placed the two glasses in front of Agatha and started pouring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment the first glass was poured, Agatha snatched it and downed nearly all of it
            in one go, wincing as the burn hit her throat, but welcoming the familiar buzz that followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced back at Vidal and Kelcie. Her stomach twisted in a way she didn't
            want to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acknowledge as she watched them huddle even closer, Vidal smiling while Kelcie
            animatedly waved her hands, clearly caught up in whatever they were discussing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She does that," came a voice, breaking Agatha out of her reverie. She
            turned to see Max pushing the second drink towards her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Agatha snapped, turning to see Max, hands raised in a mock
            surrender that practically screamed, Don't shoot the messenger.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max met her gaze calmly, then nodded toward Vidal and Kelcie with a tilt of her head.
            "Rio," Max clarified, leaning easily against the bar. "She's got a knack for pulling you
            in,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">then leaving you high and dry. I swear, the number of tears women have cried over Rio
            Vidal</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">could mop this whole floor clean."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes widened, surprise flickering across her face. Her knowledge of
            Vidal barely extended beyond their work relationship-she was sharp, devilishly smart, and had that
            infuriating confidence that both fascinated and grated on her. But this-this was new territory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Personal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thought of piecing together the fragments of who Vidal was beyond the office
            sent a thrill down her spine. The idea of knowing her better, even understanding her... it was as both
            exhilarating and as it was dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Really? So, what-she's a player?" Agatha's voiced curiously, but
            it was still edged with more bitterness than she'd intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max shrugged, a knowing glint in her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I wouldn't say a player, exactly. She's just allergic to commitment.
            Doesn't hurt them intentionally. She sets her rules upfront. But women fall for her anyway."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip on the glass tightened, the warmth of the bourbon doing nothing to
            settle the growing frustration in her chest. She threw back the rest of her drink, savoring the brief burn
            in her throat, hoping it would numb whatever gnawed at her insides.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, you don't have to worry about that with me," she said, the words
            clipped, sharp-an attempt to shut down the conversation before it could veer into even more dangerous
            territory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max raised an eyebrow, leaning in just a fraction closer, the teasing smile never
            leaving her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You sure about that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's glare was ice-cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes. We're colleagues. That's it." Max chuckled, not at all
            phased.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hmm... so, does that mean you're single, then?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha set the empty glass down with a bit more force than intended, the sound loud
            against the polished wood of the bar and reached for the second one. This woman was tenacious she would give
            her that, but surprisingly she wasn't in the mood for games, and she glared at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't you have a job to do?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max shrugged unphased, still grinning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I haven't taken my 20-minute break yet."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the smoothness of the response. "Just like
            that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just like that," answered Max said, her tone dancing with a hint of
            playfulness, eyes bright with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a slow breath, her mind working through the strange sensations going at
            war</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">within her, and hated that her thoughts immediately darted to Vidal-the very reason
            she was even in this god-forsaken place and feeling whatever these feelings were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to her surprise, Vidal's gaze was already on her, dark and narrowed, the
            playful look she'd worn moments ago replaced with something fierce and smoldering. Her jaw was set
            tight, and Agatha swore she could feel the heat of her gaze even across the room. Then,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost like a flash of lightning, Vidal's eyes flickered to Max, a spark of
            something unmistakable and raw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in a blink, it was gone, as Vidal was forced to engage with Kelcie again.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that was interesting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The uncomfortable, roiling feeling that had been knotting her chest like sour milk in
            the sun suddenly shifted, morphing into something she knew well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Excitement-a thrill, the anticipation of a game worth playing. She turned back to
            Max, letting a sly smirk pull at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know what? You do look tired," she murmured, her voice low.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max raised an eyebrow at the shift in her body language and tone, clearly intrigued.
            "Do I?" Max echoed, a hint of challenge in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mmhmm." Agatha patted the empty seat beside her, her smile widening.
            "You should sit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Take a break."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max chuckled, pausing just long enough to give Agatha a playful look before
            shrugging, a silent, Alright, let's play. She called over her shoulder to announce her break, then
            turned to walk around the bar, moving slowly enough to give Agatha time to steal one more glance at
            Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's eyes were still on her, intense and unyielding, her posture rigid. A
            thrill pulsed through Agatha; she smirked, letting the smirk morph into something that felt like a dare. She
            held Vidal's gaze, savoring the tension, practically daring her to look away first. But just then, Max
            slipped into the chair beside her, and Agatha was pulled back, forcing herself to look away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Around them, the bar pulsed with energy: laughter, clinking glasses, the distant beat
            of music. But Agatha's focus tightened, split between Max's relaxed smile in front of her and the
            slow-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">burn heat she could feel from Vidal's gaze, burning over Max's shoulder like
            a low flame.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max had been talking to her for ten minutes now, but Agatha could barely recall a
            word. Max</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-poor woman-was just a pawn in this chess game between her and Vidal. And Agatha was
            the queen, every move calculated, manipulating the board with a familiar, addictive rhythm- like closing a
            case, like the precise path to victory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she had to do was topple Vidal, and she would win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Max leaned in to speak again, Agatha's eyes drifted back to Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Arms crossed, Vidal stood beside Kelcie, who was still chattering away, unaware. But
            Vidal's gaze flicked back to Agatha, her dark eyes razor-focused, holding Agatha's stare like
            a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This suddenly, didn't feel like a game anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a charged, tenuous line straining to hold, and Agatha's pulse thrummed at
            the thought of it finally snapping. She felt the thrill of risk, a spark of defiance, and decided to push
            it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to Max, leaning in close, her hand lingering on the bartender's arm as
            she traced a fingertip along a tattoo winding around her shoulder and down her arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me about this one," she asked, her tone laced with interest.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max's eyes brightened, launching into the story behind the ink, her excitement
            evident.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded along, smiling, but her gaze kept darting over Max's shoulder,
            searching for Vidal. When she finally looked up again, there she was-watching her with an intensity that
            made her heart jump.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's defiant streak flared. She didn't pull her hand from Max's arm;
            instead, she leaned in closer, her fingers tracing another tattoo thoughtfully as she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this one?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand practically caressed Max's arm, her smile edged with challenge.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers trailed down Max's arm, lingering just enough to toe the line between
            playful and intentional, her smile edged with challenge. Max launched into another story, her enthusiasm
            bright and infectious, and Agatha feigned a laugh, all the while savoring the quiet thrill of Vidal's
            gaze, the awareness that her actions were stirring something in her. She glanced up,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">craving Vidal's reaction, eager to see what she'd make of her lingering
            touches on Max. But Vidal was gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In her place stood Kelcie, grinning goofily as she chatted with her friends.
            Agatha's stomach twisted slightly at the sight. Where had Vidal gone? She scanned the room, eyes sharp
            and searching, feeling a pang of disappointment she couldn't quite place. Just as she was about
            to</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">give up, a familiar hand landed on her shoulder, firm, fingers curling just enough to
            command her attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nearly jumped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha forced herself to turn slowly, drawing out the moment with a lazy, practiced
            ease. She looked up with mock surprise, her tone dripping with feigned innocence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh... hi," she drawled, letting the words linger in the air as her gaze
            met Vidal's, who stood far too close, her expression unreadable but intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's eyes narrowed, and Agatha fought to keep her face neutral, holding back
            the gleeful smirk threatening to break free. She had gotten under Vidal's skin, and that knowledge
            sparked something wild and undeniable in her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You ready to go?" Vidal's voice was low, rough, and it sent a shiver
            down Agatha's spine that she did her best to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha wasn't done playing. She was having too much fun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hmm... no, actually," she said, her own smirk defiant. "Max and I
            were just getting acquainted." Her fingers lingered on Max's arm, her touch almost a dare.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze flicked to Max, then returned to Agatha, unreadable and steady, like
            a storm waiting to break. Her words came out measured, each one laced with tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think you should cash out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, feeling the heat flare between them, igniting something
            fierce and familiar in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness didn't take orders-especially not from a first-year associate.
            Not in her professional life, not in her personal life, and certainly not here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She raised a brow, her voice measured and dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know, what? I'll take that as a suggestion," she said slowly, each
            word a deliberate</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">warning. "Because the only other option for what that was is a line you
            definitely don't want to cross with me-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha-Cash. Out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath hitched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Vidal said her name was something she hadn't expected-something she
            certainly didn't expect to be so... intoxicating. Agatha was used to hearing her name in every
            tone:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">curt, reverent, exasperated-but never like this. Vidal had wrapped herself around the
            syllables, dragging the her name over hot coals, leaving it smoldering in the air between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it wasn't just her name that unraveled her. She should be furious-livid,
            even-that Vidal dared to think she could give her an order.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the truth?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth clawed its way into her chest with brutal clarity: she wasn't angry at
            all. The realization felt like a punch to the gut.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her control-the one thing she relied on, the one constant she clung to-was slipping
            from her grasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what was more unsettling?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't want a choice in this, not right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not with Rio Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze lingered, sharp and searching, before she leaned in close, her voice
            brushing against Agatha's ear in that same low, gravelly tone that seemed designed to unravel
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll be outside waiting."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With one last look, a brief flicker toward Max, Vidal turned and walked away, cutting
            through the crowd with a confidence that didn't need to look back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart pounded louder than the bass reverberating from the speakers, each
            beat unsettlingly out of rhythm. She watched Vidal disappear into the though the door, her pulse drumming
            with an intensity she hadn't felt in-ever?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A touch grazed her knee, jolting Agatha out of her thoughts. She blinked, clearing
            the haze as she realized Max was still there, watching her intently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where were we?" Max's voice was suggestive, her gaze soft,
            inviting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes drifted to the door where Vidal had disappeared, her chest
            tightening with a nameless urgency, a fire that crawled up her spine, insistent and consuming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Cash me out," she said, her voice sounding foreign even to herself, shaky
            and unstable. Max's brow furrowed, the confusion clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fully turning to her now, Agatha's gaze locked onto Max's, the urgency
            driving her words before she could second-guess herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Cash me out," she repeated, the sharp edge unmistakable, as she moved her
            knee out of Max's reach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're... not serious?" Max's eyes widened, disbelief flickering
            across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned in, her breath mingling with the scent of bourbon, fingers gripping the
            edge of the bar as if anchoring herself to something solid. Her voice dropped, slow and deliberate,</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every word carrying weight like a stone sinking into deep water.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't know me very well, but you're about to if I have to repeat
            myself again."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max's face shifted, the playful glint fading as Agatha's words hung heavy in
            the air. She hesitated for just a heartbeat, taking in the weight of Agatha's gaze before she nodded,
            all pretense gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The unspoken message was clear: the game was over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Max turned away to retrieve the check, Agatha's attention drifted to the door
            where Vidal had vanished, her chest tightening with an unfamiliar mix of anticipation and tension.
            The</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">echo of Vidal's command lingered in her mind like an electric hum, impossible to
            ignore, sparking something deep inside her that she didn't even know was there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Left alone, minutes dragged on, each second winding her thoughts tighter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did Vidal's words still pulse in her head, stirring something restless,
            something almost primal?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Max finally returned, Agatha didn't bother looking at the bill, simply
            scribbling her signature on the slip with a practiced flick of the wrist, sliding it back across the bar
            without a second thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought we had something there," Max's voice broke through, a
            teasing edge still lingering in her tone, though it was laced now with something more-curiosity, maybe,
            disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes flicked up, cool and sharp, the heat she felt inside hidden under
            layers of practiced indifference.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm straight," she said, the words biting, dismissive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Max snorted at that, a soft, knowing sound as she slid the card back across the bar
            with a smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sure, you are," she muttered, a hint of amusement curling in her
            voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't respond, she simply picked up her card and turned toward the door.
            The truth settled heavily in her chest, lingering with each step as she left behind the bar and
            Max's</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">knowing smirk. The bourbon hummed in her veins, but it was the thought of Vidal
            waiting outside that ignited something deeper, hotter-something she wasn't ready to face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha Harkness didn't run. Not from anyone, and certainly not from
            herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And All That's Bad is Good</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am going to be gone all day tomorrow for my birthday, so no new chapter will come
            out. To make up for it, here is a double drop. See you Sunday!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped out into the night, letting the crisp air wash over her heated skin.
            She could chalk up her flushed cheeks to the packed bar and the overwhelming warmth of bodies pressed
            close-it was definitely not because of Vidal's voice rumbling against her ear. She inhaled deeply,
            letting the coldness settle in her lungs, grounding herself as best she could.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once she felt decently steady, she scanned the street for Vidal, frowning when she
            didn't see her. Groups of people lingered nearby, smoking or waiting for Ubers, but Vidal was nowhere in
            sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she ditch me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought set her blood boiling again. But then, movement caught her eye further
            down the street, a familiar silhouette slipping into an alley beside the bar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was unmistakably Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stiffened, her frustration flaring anew. She wasn't one to follow people,
            especially not first-year associates who had practically dragged her to a gay bar and then had the nerve to
            order her to cash out. Her cheeks burned hotter, and her irritation grew with every passing second. This
            wasn't just a game anymore; it was something far messier-and it was starting to piss her off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She marched forward, heels clicking sharply, each step feeling like a blow against
            the concrete.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rounding the corner quickly, she stopped short as Vidal stepped out of the shadows,
            blocking her path with an unreadable expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus," Agatha hissed, pulse quickening as she took a half-step back.
            "Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze didn't waver, her calm composure only intensifying with the
            simmering tension in the air. The silence stretched, heavy-tangible, and finally, Vidal broke it, her voice
            dark and gravelly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want to tell me what that was about?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her tone was a deliberate, low rumble that seemed to settle under Agatha's skin,
            leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake. And the question? It wasn't just a demand-it was a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge, one that had Agatha's temper sparking to life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who did Vidal think she was to question her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha crossed her arms, meeting Vidal's unyielding stare with a raised
            chin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What was what?" She asked feigning ignorance as she kept her voice steady,
            steel masking the heat curling beneath her ribs, twisting her insides into something taut and
            unfamiliar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't play dumb. It doesn't suit a woman of your intelligence or
            skill."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The barb nestled itself perfectly within the compliment, and Agatha clenched her jaw,
            refusing to let it unsettle her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I saw you having fun, so I thought I'd do the same. What's wrong with a
            little fun?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were sharp, each syllable landing like a perfectly calculated move in a
            game she was still figuring out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fun?" Vidal repeated, the corner of her mouth curving into a frown.
            "I was working. What you were doing... that didn't look like work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step closer, her eyes never leaving Agatha's. "I thought you were
            straight?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought against the urge to step back as Vidal closed the distance. She gritted
            her teeth at even the urge of retreat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was happening to her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am straight," she shot back, the retort too quick, too defensive,
            betraying the turmoil beneath her icy exterior.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's smirk deepened, her expression bordering on predatory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You sure about that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse jumped, the steady beat accelerating as something flared within
            her-a mix of anger, defiance, and an unsettling desire, that had her fingers twitching at her side.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't," she hissed, the word slipping out before she could leash it.
            She tried to hold onto her composure, but her gaze drifted, caught on Vidal's infuriatingly calm
            expression, her steady proximity. "I was bored. So, I played. End of story."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal cocked an eyebrow, watching her with a maddening hint of amusement that set
            Agatha's teeth on edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If that's what you want to call it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We are not calling it anything," Agatha snapped, her voice tight, cheeks
            flushed as the game slipped further from her control with each exchange. "It was exactly what it
            was."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal held her gaze, her head tilting in that maddeningly calm way, eyes scanning
            Agatha as if she could see past every guarded layer, straight to the parts of her that Agatha kept buried
            deep, out of reach. Agatha's pulse spiked, an urge rising to step forward, to straighten Vidal's
            head herself, to demand that she stop looking at her like that-like she saw straight through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a charged moment, Vidal's gaze lingered, and then, in a subtle motion that
            left Agatha both frustrated and relieved, she took a small step back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's tone was disarmingly smooth, as if she was completely immune to the
            tension winding around them, binding tighter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't like that. It felt too easy, like Vidal was just giving her a pass.
            "Don't say it like that."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze didn't waver, her voice maddeningly calm and controlled, like
            she was merely humoring Agatha's irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Like what?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Like you don't believe me," Agatha's voice was sharp, her stare
            intense as she tried to read something-anything-on Vidal's infuriatingly neutral face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal shrugged, her eyes never leaving Agatha's, and her lips curled into the
            slightest smirk</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-a subtle movement that somehow sent a wave of uncomfortable heat through
            Agatha's body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Doesn't matter what I believe. If you say you're straight, then
            you're straight."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth tightened as her pulse surged, fingers curling at her sides,
            desperate for something to anchor herself-something to shatter the strange, heated tension winding between
            them. She felt as though Vidal had taken control of the very air around her, wrapping her in a web of
            unspoken challenges and easy confidence that left her unsettled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't let Vidal have this kind of power over her. No, she needed to level
            the playing field.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instincts took over, as she she took a step towards Vidal, and leaned in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did it bother you when I flirted with that bartender?" Agatha's voice
            was a sharpened blade, aimed to unsettle Vidal, to throw her off as much as she'd been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't blind-Vidal hadn't liked her flirting with Max, even if it had
            been just a game.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal didn't even blink at the question. Instead, something dark and
            thrilling sparked in her eyes as she held Agatha's gaze, her lips curving into the slightest of
            smiles.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, you admit you were flirting with a woman?" Vidal's voice was calm,
            but her words held a weight that made Agatha's pulse quicken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, masking the flicker of vulnerability with a dismissive shrug.
            "For fun," she corrected, her voice laced with defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal chuckled quietly, a low, easy sound that made something twist deep in
            Agatha's chest. But then she went silent, her gaze locked onto Agatha's as she stepped forward,
            closer than before. The air between them thickened, charged with an energy that was impossible to
            ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Vidal said, her voice a murmur that seemed to echo in the tight
            space between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, taken off guard as the full meaning of that single word sank in. Her
            brain scrambled to catch up, and when it did, she felt the steady rhythm of her control start to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crack. She swallowed, feeling exposed under Vidal's unflinching gaze.
            "Wait... are you saying-?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That I didn't like seeing you flirt with someone else? Yes. I did not like
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's tone was firm, like she was stating a simple fact, yet there was an
            intensity behind her words that turned the air between them into something almost electric.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips parted, her breath hitching as she searched Vidal's face,
            hunting for any sign of hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why?" she finally asked, her voice barely more than a whisper. Vidal's
            gaze softened, her tone gentle, coaxing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why do you think?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence stretched between them, thick and charged, the unspoken tension simmering to
            the surface, leaving Agatha exposed with nowhere to hide. It pressed on her, both thrilling and unnerving,
            daring her to acknowledge it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a breath, her voice barely a whisper as she finally spoke, making the thing
            between them real, forcing Vidal to own it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're attracted to me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air, weighty, undeniable, a challenge as much as a
            confession.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze held steady, her pulse quickening as she watched Vidal's
            reaction, waiting for her to either retreat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal didn't retreat. She simply met Agatha's gaze, eyes dark and
            unwavering. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha drew in a deep breath, struggling to regain her footing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just like that?" she asked, her voice tinged with disbelief. She'd
            never met anyone like Rio Vidal before-someone who could answer something so intimate with such calm
            certainty, without hesitation or shame.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who in the world was this woman?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did she have the nerve to be so direct?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a flicker of something in Vidal's gaze, an intensity that sent another
            shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just like that," Vidal repeated, her voice unwavering, her eyes locked
            onto Agatha's with a confidence that bordered on audacious. The openness in her gaze was almost
            unsettling, like she didn't just want Agatha's attention but demanded it, meeting her defenses
            head-on</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">without blinking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart thudded painfully as she tried to process what was unfolding.
            Vidal was unlike anyone she'd ever met-an impossible mix of audacity and restraint, honesty and
            mystery.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the worst part?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure she wanted to stop her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't worry." Vidal's tone was maddeningly calm, placating even as
            she broke the silence. "I can keep my personal and professional lives separate."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that, had a disbelieving laugh escaped Agatha, sharp and defensive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you kidding me?" she hissed, a surge of frustration slipping through
            the cracks in her control. "You've been pushing me for days-on purpose."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's brow lifted, her gaze sharpening in that infuriatingly self-assured
            way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Noticed that, did you?" Her voice softened, as if she'd hit a nerve.
            "Interesting."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's teeth clenched, every word from Vidal stoking her anger, igniting
            something more volatile beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And what, exactly, do you find so interesting?" she shot back, her voice
            colder than the air outside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal didn't flinch. Instead, her gaze held steady, a flicker of amusement in her
            eyes that only pushed Agatha further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That you noticed," she replied, voice smooth, dangerously controlled.
            "And didn't tell me to stop."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flare of indignation surged through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah, well-I'm telling you to stop now," she snapped, the words out
            before she could rein them in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A tense silence settled between them, the air thickening as Vidal simply held her
            gaze, before nodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Vidal replied, her voice maddeningly calm, each syllable like a
            weight pressing on the already charged silence between them. The single word hung in the air, taunting
            Agatha, daring her to respond, to push back, to confront it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, her frustration mounting at the ease with which Vidal
            had agreed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted more-a reaction, a challenge, something to justify the roiling tension
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">churned inside her. She felt her pulse spike, a fierce thrum beneath her skin that
            defied her usual control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's it?" she demanded,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze didn't waver, but her lips twitched into a knowing, almost
            dangerous smile. "You sound... disappointed."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A quick, defensive laugh slipped from Agatha's lips, her bravado slipping as she
            searched for words that eluded her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Me? No. It's just..." But the sentence trailed off, as if the rest of
            it was lost somewhere she couldn't quite voice without saying too much, without exposing herself.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal took a single step forward, closing the space between them their bodies nearly
            touching now. Her gaze steady and piercing, their bodies may not have been touching, but every inch of her
            presence focused on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you want, Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question cut through the air, landing like a challenge wrapped in silk. It drew
            Agatha forward and pushed her back all at once, her heart pounding, her breath shallow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Her voice wavered, more vulnerable than she'd intended.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you want?" Vidal's repeated, her eyes stayed sharp, not giving
            Agatha a moment's respite. "Do you want me to stop?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat tightened as Vidal's words wrapped around her, pulling her
            in, tempting her to reach out and grip something she didn't fully understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Or-" Vidal continued, her voice low and deliberate, "-do you want me
            to continue?" The word settled over Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Continue?" she echoed, momentarily off-balance. Vidal's eyes
            flashed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Flirting with you," Vidal murmured, her voice a low, teasing drawl. Her
            gaze held a challenge that twisted the air between them. "Pushing you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened at that-not liking that one bit, as she lifted her chin
            defiantly. "I don't like to be pushed."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A glimmer of amusement danced in Vidal's eyes as she took Agatha in, her gaze
            slow and deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think you do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart stuttered, her voice coming out sharper than intended, like armor
            hastily thrown up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't know me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Vidal replied, her voice soft, unbothered, like she'd expected
            the response. "Not</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything. But I can read people." She paused, her eyes lingering on
            Agatha's, unrelenting. "And you-you may hate being pushed, but some part of you craves
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated the shiver that went down her spine at that, and the way her legs
            weakened just a little.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you even talking about?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words slipped from Agatha's mouth, sharper than she'd intended, an
            instinctive defense against the tightening feeling in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm talking about what I see, Agatha." Vidal's tone softened, and
            a hint of something deeper shimmered in her gaze. "You wear control like armor. Always the strong one.
            Always in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">charge. But..." She leaned in, her voice dropping, each word slipping past
            Agatha's defenses, "there's a part of you that's tired. And maybe... a part that wants to
            let go, just for once, to let someone else take over, even just for a moment."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, the words striking a chord she hadn't even realized
            existed. Her pulse pounded, the heat of Vidal's proximity making her feel exposed. She fought to keep
            her voice steady, but it came out ragged, raw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let go... to you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's answer was immediate, quiet, and unwavering, her gaze locked onto
            Agatha's like she'd just laid down a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Agatha shot back immediately, but the conviction she tried to muster
            slipped, her voice failing to sound as resolute as she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal stared at her again, and then gave the slightest nod, almost indulgent.
            "Okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was really starting to hate that word and her frustration spiked, mixing with
            something else she didn't want to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Stop saying that!" she snapped, feeling the control she so carefully held
            begin to fray. Vidal didn't miss a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Stop giving you what you want?" Vidal's voice was soft, mocking, a
            dark gleam in her eyes. "I thought that's exactly what you wanted."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, ready to snap back, but her words tangled, her pulse racing
            under the weight of Vidal's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're twisting my words," she finally managed, though the words
            lacked their usual sharp edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Am I?" Vidal's eyebrow arched in a quiet challenge. Her voice lowered,
            rich and unwavering. "Agatha, I know you like it with I flirt with you, and that's okay. It
            doesn't have to mean anything If you're worried about me kissing you-or anything else-you don't
            have to worry."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. Kissing Vidal hadn't been in her thoughts, not
            consciously. And yet, now, the idea burned through her mind, impossible to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"-I won't kiss you," Vidal continued, her smirk widening, eyes
            gleaming. "Not until you ask me to."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit her like a blow, winding her, her pulse racing in a way that felt
            foreign and maddening. Her next words slipped out, more breathless than defiant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You can't be serious."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's look was steady, telling her everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared, something hot and restless swirling inside her. She gritted her teeth,
            barely holding onto her slipping control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I swear, I've never met someone I want to strangle more."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's eyes glinted with a dangerous amusement, and she leaned in just close
            enough to make Agatha's breath hitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you ask... I'll let you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha recoiled, a sharp gasp slipping out as she stumbled back a step, as if trying
            to escape the vivid image that had just seared through her mind. Jesus Christ. The words left her in
            a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ragged whisper, barely controlled, her fingers tingling with the phantom sensation of
            Vidal's neck beneath them, her hand curled possessively, commandingly around that smirking face.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She blinked hard, pushing the image away, but her pulse thundered, her mind refusing
            to let it go. Vidal hadn't moved, her eyes dark and dangerous, watching Agatha with a satisfaction that
            was almost predatory. That faint, infuriating smirk played on her lips as though she knew exactly what
            Agatha had just imagined-and exactly how much it had shaken her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha forced herself to stand taller, to shake off the fire curling low in her
            stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-" Her voice faltered, betraying her usual composure, and she felt the
            heat rise to her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheeks. She shot Vidal a glare, her mouth pressed into a tight line, hoping it would
            somehow mask the turmoil twisting within her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Careful, Vidal," she managed, her voice barely more than a whisper,
            roughened with an intensity she didn't want to acknowledge. "You don't know what you're
            asking for."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal didn't hesitate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know exactly what I want, Agatha. Can you say the same for you?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched as Vidal's words hit her, taunting her in ways she
            wasn't prepared to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face. Every instinct urged her to brush it off, to laugh in Vidal's face and walk
            away without a second thought. But Vidal's smirk lingered, pushing past her defenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she know what she wanted?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For so long, it had been so clear-success, power, control. But here she was, battling
            an unfamiliar ache for something she never thought she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thoughts shattered as Vidal stepped back, her voice cutting through the charged
            silence. "It's getting late. I think I'll be heading home."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, thrown. "You can't be serious?" Vidal cocked her
            head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you like to talk more?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The challenge was clear in Vidal's eyes, and Agatha gritted her teeth, hating how
            it forced her closer to a line she wasn't ready to cross.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spark flickered in Vidal's gaze, her expression unreadable. She took another
            step back, her voice dropping to that dangerous murmur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you want me to kiss you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched. She bit down against the pulse of heat that surged
            through her, her voice strained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's smirk returned, slow and infuriating, as if she knew Agatha's
            resistance was hanging by a thread.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay then-in that case, I'm going to go home," she said, leveling
            Agatha with a look that stole the breath right from her lungs. "Remember-you just have to ask,
            Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glared, the denial on her tongue fierce and defensive. "I won't
            ask."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's grin spread knowingly, and Agatha felt the words forming in Vidal's
            mouth before she could even speak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't you dare say 'okay,'" she hissed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal only smiled, her eyes flashing with amusement. "Goodnight,
            Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, she turned and walked away, leaving Agatha standing there. She watched
            Vidal's silhouette fade, her heart racing in a way that defied every carefully constructed wall
            she'd built around herself. Desperate to regain her footing, she seized the one thing that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">always grounded her-business.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait-what did you get out of Baker?" she called.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal stopped, glancing back over her shoulder, and a playful, almost sheepish smile
            tugged at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh... nothing yet. She clammed up about work." She paused, a glint of
            mischief sparking in her gaze. "So I have a coffee date with her tomorrow. I'm going to press
            harder then."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A date?" Agatha's voice sharpened, the word twisting uncomfortably in
            her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's grin widened, as if sensing her frustration, and this time, she threw her
            a wink-a real, genuine smile that sent a strange thrill through Agatha, leaving her breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"See you in the morning, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood in the alley, her heartbeat still racing, every instinct screaming at
            her to chase</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">after Vidal, to demand answers, to regain the control Vidal had so effortlessly taken
            from her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The alley fell silent, the distant hum of the city fading into the background,
            leaving her alone with the quiet realization that everything she thought she understood about herself had
            shifted</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-and for the first time in a very long time, Agatha Harkness felt out of
            control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I Stray Not From the Path</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha finally crawled into bed, exhaustion tugging at her, sleep wouldn't
            come. Every time she closed her eyes, Vidal's voice echoed, looping through her mind with maddening
            clarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you want, Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question rippled through her, reverberating deeper with each replay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Maybe... a part that wants to let go, just for once, to let someone else take
            over..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words haunted her, slipping beneath her defenses, teasing out questions she
            wasn't ready to answer, taunting her in the quiet dark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of letting someone else take control-it was foreign.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unthinkable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was always in command with sexual partners, always the one setting the pace,
            dictating every step from the first touch to the last breathless moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It suited her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It kept her comfortable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the men she'd been with expected it, welcomed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was known for her professional dominance, and the men she was with weren't
            really surprised when then that same dominance carried into the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was who she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or... was it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question snuck up on her, seizing her in a moment of raw, startling
            clarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it the control she craved, or what it the easiness that came with keeping her
            control?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shifted uncomfortably, feeling the weight of it settle, heavy and intrusive,
            as her mind raced in ways she couldn't quiet. The answer loomed before her, unsettling, as she
            replayed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">each moment she'd taken the reins, every move she'd calculated to secure her
            power. But here, in the stark quiet of her bedroom, the control she'd held so fiercely didn't feel
            like true strength.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like armor-layer upon layer that shielded and insulated her, something
            she'd never questioned. But, as if it were real armor, it suddenly felt-weighted. And now, for the first
            time in her life, she could feel the pressure of it, the toll it took.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she let it go?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question stirred something in her chest, unsettling and foreign. She didn't
            like the thought at all-it wasn't who she was. But her mind turned it over, breaking it down like a
            case, examining it from every angle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then a factor surfaced she hadn't considered before-gender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she surrender to a man?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought twisted something deep inside her, but not with any thrill. Instead, it
            pulled at her with a discomfort that bordered on disgust. The idea of letting a man take charge, to dominate
            her, felt about as enticing as rubbing one out with sandpaper. She could almost laugh at the absurdity of
            it-there was no appeal, no thrill, only the stark repulsion that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reminded her exactly why she kept men at arm's length in every sense of the word.
            But a woman...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that stirred something different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Exciting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Safe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought, foreign and strangely electrifying, sent a shiver racing down her spine,
            igniting something deep within her. She couldn't ignore the way her pulse quickened at the image: a
            woman, self-assured and confident, taking her by surprise, challenging her in ways that went beyond words.
            The allure was undeniable, clashing with everything she thought she knew</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">about herself, but it was there, daring her to explore the idea further. The more she
            dwelled on it, the more vivid the image became.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dark hair, dark eyes, that infuriatingly confident smirk... the rasp of a voice that
            teased, pushed, drew her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman in her mind had taken on a form she couldn't deny-Rio Vidal. Agatha
            clenched, a gasp catching in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She suddenly became painfully aware of the heat building inside her, of how her body
            reacted to the thought of Vidal's control, her touch, her words coaxing her past every boundary
            she'd carefully constructed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mere idea of Vidal leading her to release, guiding her in ways she'd never
            allowed... it had Agatha biting her lip, a moan slipping free as her hips moved instinctively. Without
            thinking, her hand drifted downward, and the instant she touched herself, her breath hitched</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-she was already drenched, the lightest touch sending a wave of pleasure coursing
            through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A low groan escaped her as her fingers circled slowly, building herself up with
            deliberate pressure. Her mind filled with vivid flashes of Vidal-her hands curling into Agatha's
            shoulder, that scent of forest around her, the brush of her lips low against her ear. Each image tightened
            the coil inside her, and she could almost feel Vidal's presence, her voice a dark</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">whisper in her ear, coaxing, daring, no doubt murmuring filthy words of
            encouragements.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The release crashed over her like a tidal wave, her body arching, shuddering, as
            every nerve lit up with a raw, electrifying intensity. Her fingers moved in tight, rhythmic circles as
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rode the high, soft gasps filling the quiet of her room. As the sensation ebbed, her
            chest heaved with ragged breaths, and she sank back into the bed, basking in the lingering tremors that left
            her tingling, weightless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her wet hand fell to her side, body still pulsing from the aftershocks, and she
            pressed her other to her forehead, letting out a shaky exhale. She could hardly remember the last time
            she'd come this hard-if ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd always known her body, knew the paths to release, yet it still took her
            time to reach her peak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But tonight?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tonight was something else entirely. And she had to face the truth of why.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was lying here, breathless, legs still weak, utterly undone... all from the
            thought of Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fucking Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just the fantasy of her-dark eyes, that infuriating smirk, the quiet control in her
            voice-had sent Agatha spiraling into an intensity she hadn't even thought herself capable of. The thrill
            of it left her heart pounding, the dark edges of temptation sinking deep into her chest, making it hard to
            breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as she laid there staring up at the ceiling, the weight of it all crashing down
            on her, pressing heavily against the silence. Her body still hummed from the aftershocks, but her mind began
            to settle, clarity creeping in with an unsettling force.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What the hell am I doing?" she whispered, her voice barely more than a
            breath. There was no denying it now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal was a problem. A big fucking problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's steps echoed through the quiet hall, the morning air still heavy with
            the remnants of her restless night. She hadn't truly slept-Vidal's words had haunted her like a
            persistent shadow, trailing her into every crevice of her mind. Every time she tried to find peace, tried to
            silence her thoughts, she'd found herself back there, in that dark alley, replaying Vidal's voice,
            those teasing eyes, that maddening, unyielding confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when she'd finally drifted off, of course Vidal had invaded her dreams too,
            each</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">encounter twisting the knife deeper, fueling the inferno she couldn't seem to
            escape. Now, walking into the office, the very place where Vidal would be, her nerves were raw, frayed
            beyond recognition.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She braced herself as she stepped through the main doors, the familiar scent of the
            flowers in the lobby and coffee doing nothing to steady her. Her fingers twitched, her pulse quickened as
            memories from the previous night clawed their way back to the surface-the thoughts she'd surrendered to
            alone in the dark, letting herself unravel to the idea of Vidal's hands- Vidal's voice-Vidal.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had her unmoored, rattled in a way she'd never been before. How the hell was
            she supposed to look her in the eye today?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal read her like an open book, picking up every detail, every tremor beneath her
            facade. Would she notice?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she tell that Agatha got herself off last night thinking about her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gritted her teeth, feeling her thoughts spiral and hating every second of it.
            She needed something, anything to cut through the haze of confusion clouding her mind. Just then, a
            third-year associate came around the corner, his head buried in a report, oblivious to her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">approach. The moment he nearly collided with her, her restraint snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, so sorry, was I in your way?" Her voice dripped with mock sweetness, a
            sharp smile</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forming as she watched the him fumble for words. "No, really-why would a senior
            partner be strolling in her own office? Clearly, you've got far more important places to
            be."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The poor man looked up, paling as he realized his mistake. Jefferson was actually one
            of the good ones here. She actually found him decent to work with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jefferson to his credit, tried to mumble an apology, but Agatha wasn't
            done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me guess," she continued, crossing her arms, "you're going to
            dazzle us all with your 'astounding work ethic' and 'commitment to excellence' while you
            can't even manage the radical responsibility of watching where you're walking?" Her voice
            lilted on every word, wrapping disdain in a faux-polite bow. "Here's a little free advice: if I
            can't trust find your way around a hallway, how in the hell am I supposed to trust you to find your way
            around a courtroom."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The associate stammered an awkward "Yes, ma'am," backing away, but she
            gave him a pointed look, rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, spare me the 'yes, ma'am,'" she bit out, her tone dripping
            with disdain. "Grow a spine, Jefferson. Develop some self-awareness, and get out of my
            sight."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The associate's face paled, and he nodded, practically tripping over himself to
            escape. The office descended into an even sharper silence, a tension so thick you could slice it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone knew the signs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha cut down someone she actually respected, it was a clear warning: the rest
            of them had better watch their step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swept through the office, her gaze icy, catching sight of the war room. It was
            empty-no sign of Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure if that made her feel more relieved or irritated. She wanted
            her here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, she didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But yes, she did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gritted her teeth as Billy fell into step beside her, briefing her on her day as
            he handed her coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an endless list of meetings, calls, and negotiations, and by the third item,
            Agatha's patience was on a knife's edge. But she let Billy continue, keeping her face impassive as
            she shrugged off her coat, tossing it his way. He caught it with a deftness she couldn't help but</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">appreciate, maintaining his steady cadence through her schedule. She had to give him
            credit for that, at least; Billy could take it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Settling into her chair, she took a sip of coffee, a small flick of her hand sending
            him on his way. Her eyes flicked to the war room again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where was Vidal?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was always punctual, if not early.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spark of irritation flared. Did she think she could waltz in whenever she
            pleased?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, she'd muttered the thought aloud because Billy paused in the doorway,
            glancing back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She called this morning," he said, with a hint of hesitation, "said
            she had an early interview for the Vanguard case-told me you knew about it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched as she connected the dots, Vidal's words from last
            night echoing in her mind:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've got a coffee date with her tomorrow. I'm going to press harder
            then."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The twist in her chest tightened, and she couldn't shake the heat that flared
            each time she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">replayed that scene from last night-Vidal's hand on Baker's arm, the laugh,
            the smirk that looked too real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of Vidal doing it all over again, maybe even getting Baker to open up in
            ways Agatha couldn't imagine...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hissed under her breath, the irritation spiking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Get me last quarter's reports. All of them," she snapped, more
            forcefully than she intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy, unfazed, nodded and slipped out of her office, giving her the space she needed
            to wrangle her thoughts back under control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This had to stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to focus, to work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clenching her jaw, she grabbed her phone, forcing her attention onto her first client
            meeting of the day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe they'd bring a problem big enough to drown out the thoughts of Vidal in a
            coffee shop with Baker, smiling in that infuriatingly easy way that made her feel-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped the thought in its tracks, and took a deep breath. She dialed the number
            and resolved to bury herself in work until she couldn't remember why her hands were still
            shaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tackled call after call, sinking into the rhythm that kept her mind occupied.
            One client wanted to put two lawsuits to bed quietly; another was wrangling with an SEC investigation over
            questionable stock buys. The requests kept coming-urgent, frantic, and complex</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough to occupy her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She relished these questions-the "How can I legally get away with this?"
            that bordered on ludicrous but kept her sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was mid-sentence, explaining patent law to a client with an overly ambitious
            vision, when the war room door opened across the hall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of instinct, she turned, and the words stalled on her lips. Vidal stood in the
            doorway.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a dress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip tightened on the phone as her gaze swept over Vidal, taking in the
            elegant, form-fitting forest green dress that clung to her frame. It was simple but devastatingly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">effective, hugging her in all the right places and ending just above the knee,
            showing just enough to draw eyes and keep them there. Her dark hair was loose, cascading over her shoulders
            softening the look even more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Uh, Agatha? Are you still there?" her client's voice crackled through
            the phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, snapping back to reality, catching herself before the pause could
            stretch too long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she managed, forcing her voice into its usual, crisp
            professionalism, though she felt anything but in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the client rattled on, she made herself turn away, swiveling her chair to face the
            skyline, gripping the armrests with white-knuckled intensity. She couldn't turn back around-not yet. The
            image of Vidal in that dress was seared into her mind, and the low, throbbing tension she'd spent the
            entire morning trying to shake was now back tenfold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She finished the call, her responses automatic, as she pushed the phone from her ear
            and set it down. The city's hum outside her window was meant to ground her, to refocus her, but it did
            nothing. The only thought that registered clearly was the sight of Vidal in that dress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without giving herself another second to doubt, she stood and made her way to the war
            room, steps purposeful, as if this were any other meeting, any other case. But the truth was, she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to see Vidal up close-wanted to see how the soft fabric of that dress shifted
            with her movements.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha entered, Vidal had her back turned, a hand poised against the whiteboard,
            her marker moving quickly in her barely legible writing. She finished a final note and turned,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">catching sight of Agatha and grinning. Her dark eyes sparkled with an excitement that
            made her look even more striking, and it took Agatha a moment to register that she was speaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was right," Vidal said, her voice sharp, laced with barely contained
            excitement as she held the marker. "Kelcie and Brooke were involved. Brooke was closeted, and
            they'd been seeing each other for six months. Kelcie finally opened up about it over coffee
            today."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's voice cut through the room, but Agatha's attention was already split
            between what she was saying and how god damn good she looked. The fabric hugged her figure in a way
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">felt both powerful and dangerously close to alluring, outlining her arms with a
            refined</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">elegance, then skimming down to a subtle slit that flirted just within the bounds of
            office propriety. The dress's dark forest green color only heightened the effect, sharpening every
            curve, every line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal set the marker aside and took a step forward, her hands moving with an energy
            that matched the gleam in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Right before Brooke died, she mentioned a cargo report that had accidentally
            landed on her desk," Vidal continued. "The ship was called The Meridian Star. Brooke told Kelcie
            that the items on board couldn't be tied to any payment or contract records. It set off alarms for her,
            and she was planning to confront her boss the next day."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's gaze grew darker, her excitement tempered by a new edge. "That was
            the last time Kelcie saw Brooke alive."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air, heavy with gravity, but Agatha's mind was elsewhere.
            The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension. Agatha struggled to process what Vidal was
            saying, her thoughts spiraling chaotically around the implications of the case while simultaneously being
            drawn back to the sight of Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every part of her was on fire, igniting the filthy thoughts that had haunted her
            since she touched herself last night. It was all muddled together, and for a moment, she felt paralyzed,
            trapped in this strange whirlwind of desire and duty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?" Vidal's voice cut through the silence sharply, a hint of
            impatience in her tone as she caught Agatha's eye. "Did you hear me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question hit like a splash of cold water, jolting Agatha back to the
            present.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Agatha replied, her voice steadier than she felt, fighting to bring
            her attention back to the case details she'd almost missed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal was looking at her, not just looking-seeing her, and Agatha could pinpoint
            the exact second Vidal's excitement over the case shifted, the spark in her eyes darkening into</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">something sharper. That smirk, knowing and infuriating, curved at Vidal's lips as
            she stepped closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You look..." Vidal murmured, her words timed to her slow, deliberate
            steps. Each syllable stretched, matching the rhythm of her approach, and Agatha's breath hitched as she
            realized just how close Vidal was coming. With those nude heels, Vidal was taller than her now, leaning in
            as if savoring her new height advantage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...flushed," she finished, her gaze dropping just a fraction, her tone a
            velvet purr laced with a hint of feigned concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you feeling okay?" she asked, her question innocent, but her eyes far
            from it, a glint of knowing amusement flickering there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha forced herself to stand straighter, but the lingering heat from last night
            simmered to the surface, traitorous and relentless. Vidal's presence, so close she could practically
            feel the warmth radiating from her, made it impossible to shut out the images from her mind. Her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">response teetered on her tongue, a mix of denial and challenge, but words failed her
            in the face of Vidal's unrelenting gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she finally managed, though her voice betrayed her, carrying more
            breath than defiance. "I'm fine."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal's smirk deepened, her gaze unwavering, promising with unspoken certainty
            that she knew exactly what she was doing-and exactly what it was doing to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mmm..." Vidal murmured, the low hum sending a shiver through Agatha, as if
            she could see each crack her presence caused in Agatha's carefully built armor. Her mouth opened, poised
            to say something else, no doubt another push, another nudge toward that dangerous edge of control Agatha
            felt slipping away with each word, each glance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Panic clawed up her chest, raw and disorienting. The tension, the uncertainty, the
            fierce pull Vidal had on her-she needed it to stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word escaped before she could catch it, a slip that felt both reckless and
            vulnerable. "Stop."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were barely out before regret seized her. She wanted to pull them back, to
            say something else-anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Vidal's eyes flickered, her expression flashing with shock for a fraction of
            a second, and then, with a single measured step back, her entire demeanor transformed. The teasing</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">warmth, the playful smirk-all of it vanished, replaced by a chilling neutrality that
            was almost unsettling in its precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, both irritated and strangely admiring of how effortlessly
            Vidal could switch it all off. Her face may have been blank, but her eyes-they searched Agatha with a sharp,
            careful intensity, reading her, moving over her face as if picking up the pieces of something unsaid,
            something Agatha didn't quite know how to put into words herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, just as quickly, something shifted in Vidal's gaze-a hint of
            understanding. She gave a brief nod, acknowledging the unspoken.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clenched her jaw, frustration simmering under her skin. She'd let the
            words slip and now there was no taking them back.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cursed herself for it, for the way her heart twisted at Vidal's sudden
            distance, for the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flicker of regret she refused to acknowledge. Saying she wanted it to stop was one
            thing, a moment of vulnerability she could almost excuse-but admitting she didn't actually want it to
            stop?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was unthinkable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the silence between them, Vidal's carefully unreadable face, felt like a
            wall. And that was worse. Agatha's pulse pounded as her mind raced, part of her wanting to reach out and
            tear down the wall she'd just thrown up between them, to make some kind of move that would prove she
            hadn't lost her edge, her control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal just watched her, waiting, that calm gaze unwavering, her expression blank,
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">complete opposite of Agatha's own tangled thoughts. Somehow, that was the hardest
            part- how easily Vidal respected Agatha's request without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finding her voice, though the words tasted sour as she forced them out, Agatha
            managed to say, "Comb through everything and find all references to The Meridian Star. Find me
            something."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal nodded, the acknowledgment almost too simple, too composed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded back, feeling the weight of it settle uncomfortably between them. She
            turned, intent on leaving, desperate to escape the tension in the room. The silence thickened, stretching
            taut as she reached for the door and yanked it open, ready to step away from</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">whatever held her back, but something stopped her. She looked back.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vidal was already bent over a box of documents, already working, her focus sharp and
            steady, displaying no adverse reaction to Agatha ending the game between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like she completely let it go. But Agatha couldn't let it go.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something in her needed to say one last thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she said, the name slipping from her lips with surprising weight,
            her voice soft but loaded. It was the first time she'd used her first name, and she could see the impact
            of it immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head snapped up, her eyes meeting Agatha's, a flash of something
            unmistakable-want, desire-before it dulled into composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good work on this," she murmured, her words feeling like a bridge
            stretched across the tension. It wasn't much-a compliment from her mouth was rare-but it felt
            insufficient against everything that hung unsaid in the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, her voice quiet but warm. "Thank you."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her gaze for a second longer, feeling the pull of it before she tore
            herself away, needing the distance more than ever. With a final, silent nod, she turned and walked out, her
            steps echoing down the hallway, leaving that charged silence-and Rio-behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Circle Sewn With Fate</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at the ceiling of her bedroom, her hands folded on her stomach, feeling
            the weight of her own thoughts pressing down on her. The morning sun filtered in through her bedrooms large
            glass windows, painting the ceiling in its light.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence of the morning felt heavier than usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a sigh, frustrated and unwilling to admit how much her current state
            grated at her. It had been four days since she'd told Rio to stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Four days since she drew the line in the sand between them and said, "don't
            cross it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, in true form, Rio had done just that-no smirks, no lingering touches, no
            flirtatious banter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was all professional now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Impeccably, maddeningly professional. And it was torture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tension that had once buzzed between them had disappeared, replaced by a stark
            void that left her feeling unbalanced. Their once-charged exchanges now felt lifeless, as if she was
            speaking into a mirror instead of the spark that had lit her up in ways she'd refused to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acknowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened as she thought of the moments when a fleeting smirk or a word
            laced with hidden meaning would've changed her for the entire day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like staring at a starry sky covered in thick, impenetrable clouds. The spark
            was still there, but it was hidden beyond Agatha's reach now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clenched her hands into fists, resisting the urge to curse herself for every
            confused thought she'd wrestled with since Tuesday. She'd made her choice, demanded her boundaries.
            And yet, she couldn't shake the dull ache that had settled within her, each day feeling a little greyer,
            each interaction a little emptier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even the progress Rio had made on the Vanguard case-work that was undeniably
            impressive-held any real satisfaction for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could hardly focus on the details anymore, too wrapped up in what had been lost
            between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn't help that each night, as she undressed, brushed her teeth, and prepared
            to sleep, the tension in her body would unfurl in waves, stirring up memories of Rio's dark, intense
            gaze, the graze of her hands, the low, gravelly timbre of her voice teasing at the edge of Agatha's
            self-control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd clenched her jaw, already knowing where her thoughts would drift, the same
            way they had every night since the professional distance had settled between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And no matter how hard she tried to ignore it, her resolve would eventually
            falter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind would helplessly replay the sound of what had once been Rio's voice,
            that low, teasing murmur; the flash of her smirk; the feel of her hands, imagined but vivid, lingering like
            a phantom touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each time, breathless and aching, Agatha would surrender, slipping her hand beneath
            the band of her silk pants, chasing a release that always came too quickly, leaving her spent and satisfied,
            yet, still haunted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because now, even in the quiet aftermath, Rio never left her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somehow, the woman had burrowed beneath her skin, her presence lingering long after
            the warmth of release faded, like an echo she couldn't silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was rooted in her, deep and undeniable, as if each whisper of her memory
            declared, "I live here now."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wanted to scream.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was forty-eight, for Christ's sake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was far too old for a... sexual awakening? An identity crisis?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A kink revelation?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or whatever the hell this actually was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet here she was: Nearly fifty, more confused than she'd ever been in her
            life, so insatiably frustrated, and so ridiculously, impossibly turned on, she quite literally could not
            think straight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal, a woman 16 years younger than her, had stepped into Agatha's carefully
            constructed Jenga-tower of life, circling it like a hawk. With each pass, she probed at</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's core pieces, searching for any weakness, any tremor, before methodically
            slipping them away with chilling precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel each absence, a hollow ache expanding within her, revealing
            emptiness she hadn't known existed until Rio showed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio didn't just take-she was also rebuilding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Layering unfamiliar, thrilling pieces onto Agatha's foundation, forcing her to
            sway on the edge of everything she thought she understood. Every extracted piece, every newly added layer,
            left her precarious, teetering in a dizzying balance between fear and exhilaration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio-she stood there, just watching, never once looking away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's held her gaze with an intensity that felt like a dare, inviting Agatha to
            give in-to fall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let me break you, those dark eyes seemed to say, and then I'll put you back
            together in a way you never thought possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha laid there in the quiet of her bedroom, Rio's unyielding gaze haunting her
            mind and let out a long, frustrated sigh and threw back the covers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky wouldn't be back until after school on Monday, which meant two entire days
            with nothing but herself-a version she was barely recognizing in the mirror lately. She didn't want to
            spend another minute alone in this house, trapped with someone she hardly knew</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anymore, and the questions that Rio brought out in her followed her around like a
            ghost she couldn't shake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what did she do?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to the one thing that had never let her down. The one place she could bury
            herself so deeply that her mind would eventually, finally quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In less than twenty minutes, she was dressed. Her hair pulled back in a messy bun,
            her makeup softer than usual-a look that still felt polished but relaxed. She slipped into a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chunky sweater, designer leggings hugging her figure, heeled boots, and threw on a
            trench coat, the tailored fabric adding a touch of her usual sharpness, before heading out the door.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped off the elevator, the music loudly blaring between her ears. She had
            slid her AirPods in the second she left her apartment, drowning herself in a playlist that moved from Lizzo
            to Noah Kahan, Nicki Minaj to Taylor Swift, and finally, the rich notes of Queen. Each step brought her
            closer to a quiet morning of burying herself in emails and uncompleted work from Friday, a welcome respite
            from her relentless thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So far, the office was blissfully quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not a single soul.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could practically feel the relief creeping over her as she neared her office
            door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then she caught movement from the corner of her eye and halted. Her gaze drifted
            over to the war room, and, as if the universe were playing some kind of twisted joke, Hozier's Take Me
            to Church began playing in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was there, head down reading a report.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nearly turned right back around, tempted to walk straight out the door, but of
            course, just as she considered retreating, Rio looked up, their eyes locking through the glass.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's brows raised, and Agatha could practically feel the current between them
            intensify.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as Rio's gaze dipped, taking in her casual outfit with a quick,
            appreciative look that seemed almost reflexive. But just as quickly, she caught herself, her expression
            shifting, and forced her eyes back to Agatha's with a steadier, more professional focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the heat of Rio's gaze like a live current, but she steadied herself,
            willing her feet to move forward. The urge to stay, to let herself linger in that heavy, charged silence,
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost overwhelming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she'd come here to regain her control, not to surrender it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a deep breath, she straightened her shoulders, forced a dismissive look, and
            walked toward her office, each step feeling heavier than the last. She could sense Rio's gaze trailing
            after her, but she didn't look back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she strode into her office, shutting the door behind her with a calmness
            that belied the turmoil roiling inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence in her office was an immediate relief. She set her purse on the desk,
            shrugged off her coat, and took a long, steadying breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting down at her desk, she logged into her computer, the familiar glow of the
            screen bringing a sense of purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could do this-she could bury herself in work and let the hours pass, let herself
            escape in tasks that required no emotional investment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the quiet of her office, she could almost forget that Rio was only a few rooms
            away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She worked as the sun drifted across the sky and disappeared, leaving an inky
            darkness pressing against the glass walls of her office. Every email she answered, every report</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reviewed, every typed-out brief or signed document settled her frayed nerves, calming
            the tempest inside her piece by piece.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But like a temptation she couldn't shake, her gaze kept drifting toward the war
            room, her eyes betraying her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was still there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tenacious, focused, working her way through the boxes that they hadn't yet combed
            through.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whiteboard filled with notes and connecting lines, evidence of her relentless
            mind at work, and each time Agatha glanced up, she was there-opening another box, writing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">another note, marking down another discovery. She moved with an ease that felt almost
            hypnotic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was wearing black denim pants, a blue button-up with a crisp white T-shirt
            underneath, and white tennis shoes that looked worn but intentional. Her dark hair framed her face in</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">loose waves, more relaxed than usual, and Agatha didn't miss the aviators sitting
            on the table beside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The casual look shouldn't have suited the office, but it worked on her with an
            effortless elegance, as if Rio owned the space just by being in it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as Agatha observed her-more often than she wanted to admit-she felt an odd
            kinship.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here they were, two people in outfits that didn't belong in the office, tethered
            to this place on day when they should have been anywhere else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She forced her gaze back to the file folder in front of her, reminding herself with a
            fierce mental mantra that she was here for one reason: work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She picked up one of the final file-the last loose end on her desk, her last task to
            complete before calling it a night. She opened the folder, hoping for a dense report or a legal puzzle,
            something complex enough to keep her rooted here a bit longer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But inside, there was only a simple expense report, just awaiting her signature. No
            notes, no analysis-just an empty dotted line.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a reluctant sigh, she signed it and set the folder aside, officially out of
            things to occupy her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that filled the room felt too final, too pointed, and she wasn't
            ready to face the night ahead or the restless thoughts she knew would haunt her the second she walked
            through her door. She could practically feel the weight of the last four nights pressing on her-the
            lingering tension and frustration she couldn't shake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clenching her jaw, she stood and crossed to the small liquor bar tucked into the
            corner of her office. Pouring herself a generous glass of bourbon, she took the bottle back with her to the
            desk, sinking into her chair and swiveling it to face the city skyline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was easier to stare at the glowing lights of the city than risk glancing back
            toward the war room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bourbon was smooth, its warmth spreading through her with each sip as she sat
            there, staring out into the night, feeling a familiar ache that even the good bourbon couldn't quite
            numb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sharp knock on glass broke her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned, her gaze landing on Rio standing by the door, a folder in hand, eyes
            expectant. Despite the turmoil churning within her, Agatha nodded, her instinct taking over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stepped inside, crossing the room with an ease that only amplified Agatha's
            tension, before setting the folder on her desk. Agatha set down her bourbon, took the file, and opened it,
            scanning the pages with a practiced eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The document inside was a report Rio had been combing through, uncovering details
            about</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Meridian Star, the cargo ship that Brooke had mentioned to her girlfriend.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she read, her fingers tightened around the paper. The report detailed anomalies in
            the shipping manifest-items listed under ambiguous codes, weights that didn't align with standard cargo,
            and no matching invoice or record to account for the items. There was also an unusual frequency of dockings
            along the Eastern Seaboard, the locations changing each time, almost like someone was intentionally making
            the ship's path difficult to track.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each page revealed more discrepancies, the pieces stacking up into something much
            bigger,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">something deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed the folder and set it on her desk, nodding as she drummed her fingers
            lightly on its cover.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is good work," she murmured, her gaze fixed downward on the file,
            refusing to betray the storm brewing beneath her calm exterior.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They weren't at the finish line yet, but they were closer than ever before. And
            she knew the difference-it was Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was relentless, methodical, always pushing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There's got to be more," Rio said, her voice low and steady, a hint of
            resolve that echoed through the silence. "I'll keep pulling the string."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded again, her fingers still tapping the folder, grounding herself. She
            didn't look up, couldn't meet those eyes that no longer looked at her with that spark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them was thick, teetering between familiar and unsettling.
            "Goodnight, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a simple farewell, delivered without warmth or edge. Flat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But for reasons Agatha couldn't begin to untangle, those words burrowed deeper
            inside her than any smirk, taunt, or glance Rio had ever given her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The neutrality of it twisted within her, winding tighter and tighter, until it felt
            like something inside her snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's voice cut through the quiet, and she looked up and watched as her words
            landed. Rio stopped, turning back, her expression blank, unreadable, as if she were just... waiting.
            Waiting, watching with that calm detachment that felt like an insult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated that look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated the emptiness in it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated the way Rio could stand there as if she hadn't the very person who
            dismantled</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything Agatha thought she knew about herself, forcing her onto this twisting,
            relentless journey of self-discovery with no end in sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could she just step back now, as if she hadn't taken a hammer to Agatha's
            sense of self? Just walk away?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That simmering anger rose, propelling her next words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Stop looking at me like that," she snapped, her voice laced with an
            intensity she could barely contain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't so much as blink, her composure as steady as ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't understand," she said, her voice maddeningly calm. "Did I
            do something to offend you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers tightened around the edge of her desk. Every part of her wanted
            to scream, to demand an answer, but the words lodged in her throat, caught between frustration and
            vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, actually," Agatha snapped instead, her voice slicing through the air
            sharper than intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's brow arched, a glimmer of something in her eyes-curiosity, maybe
            surprise-before it quickly vanished. She tilted her head slightly, her tone gentler than Agatha could
            stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What did I do?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A hollow laugh escaped Agatha, cold and brittle, she stood up, needing to level the
            playing field-needing to look her in the eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What haven't you done?" she bit out, each word dripping with barely
            contained frustration. "You've completely ruined me. Do you even realize that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held her gaze, the weight of her own silence enough to stoke the embers of
            Agatha's anger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's face softened, but she didn't look away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she stepped closer, her gaze steady, unflinching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ruined you?" she echoed, her voice low, a touch of sadness laced within
            her usual calm. "How exactly have I ruined you, Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat tightened, and her fingers curled, grasping for control she no
            longer had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You made me question everything I thought I knew about myself," she
            whispered, almost to herself. "You've made me want things I can't have, things I never even
            thought I'd want."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze remained unwavering, a quiet intensity simmering in her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why can't you have them?" she asked, her voice barely a murmur.
            "I told you Agatha, all you had to is ask?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simplicity of it-just asking-sent a surge of frustration through Agatha, mingling
            with a longing so strong it felt like a physical ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a bitter, breathless laugh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just ask?" she repeated, a tremor in her voice. "What exactly would I
            even ask for?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze softened, her lips curving into a faint smile, one that held a
            thousand unspoken promises.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That depends. What do you want, Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question hit her like a wave, crashing into the carefully built walls she'd
            surrounded herself with. And in that moment, the weight of her own vulnerability was almost too much to
            bear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt a sting in her eyes-tears, actual fucking tears-and she swallowed hard,
            willing them away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence thickened, and Rio stepped closer again, closer than they've been in
            days.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me what you want," she whispered, her voice a quiet invitation,
            filled with a tenderness Agatha hadn't expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse thundered in her ears as she stood there, feeling the weight of
            Rio's words settle over her, wrapping around her like a tether both binding and freeing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew it, felt it in every nerve, every tremor of her racing heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was that precipice-the moment before a jump, the second a skydiver teeters on the
            edge of the open door, staring down at the dizzying drop, caught between two choices: retreat back into the
            safety of the plane or leap forward into the unknown, letting gravity pull them into a freefall they
            couldn't control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind spun, half-tempted to pull herself back, to escape the raw vulnerability of
            the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her body-the way it leaned ever so slightly closer to Rio, her breath quickening
            in anticipation-betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Needed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she had to do was say the words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze remained steady, unwavering, her patience a quiet, unspoken invitation
            that dared Agatha to step forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a tremor roll through her as she stood there, feeling each of her
            defenses fall away, piece by piece, under the weight of that stare. Her lips parted, words struggling to
            surface, but they caught, hesitating on the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want..." She started, her voice barely a whisper, her hands twitching at
            her sides as if searching for something to anchor her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words evaded her, slipping through her grasp, and she gritted her teeth in
            frustration, fighting against everything she had always known herself to be-controlled, precise,
            unshakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked away, drawing a breath to calm herself, but the admission clawed its way
            out before she could stop it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want..." Her voice broke, and with it, the walls she had carefully built
            around herself cracked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, with a certainty that both terrified and thrilled her, she turned back and
            met Rio's gaze, feeling something snap inside her-a release, raw and undeniable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung between them, alive and irrevocable, vibrating in the silence.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't take them back, and in that moment, she realized she didn't even
            want to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pleased rumble that sounded in the back of Rio's throat at her words sent a
            violent shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want me?" Rio's voice was low and intimate, each word igniting a
            spark that traveled through Agatha's entire body. Her gaze held an intensity that smoldered, a heat so
            unrelenting that Agatha had to fight the urge to shift under it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every nerve seemed to stand at attention as Rio studied her, her eyes dark and
            expectant, pushing Agatha to commit fully, to double down on her admission.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even now, this woman was still fucking pushing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Agatha forced out, a mix of frustration and surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The single word hung in the air, electric, and Rio's lips curled into a slow,
            devastating smile. There was confidence in that smile, a knowingness that danced on the edge of cocky but
            felt earned, undeniable, and rooted in certainty. It was the look of someone who knew exactly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">what she wanted-and had no intention of accepting anything less.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, close enough that Agatha could feel her warmth, every word
            slipping from her lips like a caress but with a firm undertone that made Agatha's pulse spike.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How do you want me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question twisted through her, unraveling any remaining composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frustration flared in her chest, mixing with an undeniable desire that she wasn't
            prepared to face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You can't be serious," Agatha hissed out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, and her eyes, sharp and unreadable, traced over
            Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When it comes to your wants and needs, Agatha... you will find that...I am
            always serious."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze held Agatha's, penetrating, almost searching, as if inviting her to take
            the leap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Words matter," she pressed, the intensity of her voice wrapping around
            Agatha, drawing her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She held Agatha's gaze, each word deliberate, leaving no room for retreat. Her
            eyes darkened, studying Agatha's reaction, taking in every flicker of hesitation, the way her breathing
            quickened, how the tension tugged at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How do you want me?" she repeated, her tone steady, waiting, demanding.
            "Tell me." The room felt thick with tension, a living, breathing thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat tightened as she looked away, her chest rising and falling, her
            pulse erratic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't make me say it," she whispered, each word a struggle.
            "It's too much. You're pushing for too much."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed was heavy, fraught with the weight of unspoken things, with
            the steady thrum of Agatha's heartbeat filling her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked away, out into the night, needing that distance, that small
            retreat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The city lights blurred into a haze as Agatha stared out into the dark, the vast
            night a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">comforting emptiness compared to the intensity she felt burning in front of her. She
            clung to that inky black, hoping-no, begging-for Rio to ease up, to give her even a sliver of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reprieve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Admitting that she wanted her had cost her every shred of pride she could
            muster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anything more would shatter her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, there it was-the soft, ghostly graze of fingertips along her jaw, so
            delicate at first it was almost a question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, a raw, needy sound slipping from her lips, escaping
            before she could catch it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound was so foreign to her own ears, so unlike anything she'd ever let
            anyone hear, that she wanted to sink into the ground, to take it back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could she have made that sound?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From just a single touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had never once made a sound like that in her life, not even in the depths of
            pleasure. And now, here she was, trembling beneath the feather-light touch of Rio's fingertips on her
            jaw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze remained locked on the skyline, refusing to meet Rio's, terrified of
            what she'd find</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-some mixture of smugness or satisfaction that would only make the moment
            worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio's fingers pressed a bit more firmly, her touch insistent, wordlessly
            coaxing her to turn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha resisted, pressing back against the pressure, her defiance sparking to life, a
            last-ditch attempt to shield herself from the vulnerability clawing at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's voice cut through the air, low, firm, carrying a tone Agatha had never
            heard from her before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gone was the playful teasing, the soft patience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No-this was something different. Demanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Exact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And threaded with a warning Agatha couldn't ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath stilled as she felt Rio's fingers trail from her jaw,
            slipping beneath her chin and curling there, gripping just enough to make her pulse spike.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bite of Rio's hold was gentle but undeniable, an unspoken command that had
            her pulse roaring in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look at me." Rio's voice was quiet but heavy, the words as steady as
            her grip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a subtle, insistent tug, Rio guided her gaze away from the comforting blackness
            outside, pulling her back to the charged, shadowed depths of her own eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relief washed over Agatha as she didn't find mockery in Rio's gaze, instead
            there was nothing but a quiet thrill, the kind that felt as dangerous as it was alluring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers loosened their grip on her jaw, but they didn't leave; they
            lingered, ghosting up the side of her face, mapping the lines and angles with a touch so soft it felt like
            fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes fluttered shut as Rio brushed a stray strand of hair that fell
            against her face, tucking it gently behind her ear, leaving a trace of warmth where her hand had
            been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright," Rio murmured, a slight ache of disappointment weaving through
            her tone, as if she had hoped Agatha would have said something, anything. Her hand shifted to cup
            Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheek, thumb brushing over her cheekbone, a simple, slow caress that somehow felt
            charged with unspoken promises.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How about I tell you what I want," she whispered, her voice a low, throaty
            hum that reverberated through the small space between them, heavy with intention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes stayed fixed on Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you like that, Agatha?" Rio's voice was silk and steel, so
            gentle it seemed to cradle her yet edged enough to make her breath catch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers glided from Agatha's brow to her temple, a touch steeped in
            tenderness, but her voice whispered of something far deeper, a controlled intensity that wrapped around
            Agatha like a slow-burning fuse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you like to know," she continued, her breath warm against
            Agatha's skin, "what I want to do to you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, sharp and involuntary, as Rio's words sank in,
            lingering like an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">electric pulse in her veins. Her eyes flew open, meeting Rio's steady, unwavering
            gaze, and</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">she felt a flush creep up her neck, warming her skin under the weight of that look.
            Every inch of her felt hyper-aware, from the soft press of Rio's fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Agatha breathed, her voice barely more than a whisper, but charged,
            carrying the word like a confession she'd held back too long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt her pulse racing, a drumbeat that seemed to echo in the small space between
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth curved into a slow, almost predatory smile as her thumb lingered on
            Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cheek, tracing light circles that made her skin tingle. She leaned closer, her face
            just a breath away, her voice a dark murmur that seemed to seep through every barrier Agatha had put
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to break down every wall you have," Rio's voice dropped low,
            the words pulling</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha in, one by one, each sharper than the last. "I want to push you to the
            edge, make you fight me, challenge me-make you feel every second of it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips brushed close to Agatha's ear, breath warm and dangerously close,
            setting Agatha's nerves alight. She fought to keep steady, but a shiver betrayed her, running down her
            spine like a live wire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to taste you," Rio murmured, her voice rich, layered with a hunger
            that made</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's skin flush. "To feel the softness of your lips, to know the way you
            shudder when my mouth meets yours."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her defenses crumbling under the weight of Rio's
            words. She felt herself leaning in, her heartbeat drumming hard and unsteady against her ribs. She wanted to
            say something, anything, but the intensity in Rio's gaze held her captive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers moved to her cheek, thumb tracing a slow line along her jaw, so
            gentle it made her ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've imagined it," she continued, her words a dark promise. "The
            warmth of you... how your lips would part... how you'd give in... how your breath would catch as I
            pulled you closer."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's head spun, each word pulling her deeper, her skin tingling, her
            whole-body tense with anticipation. She could feel herself tremble, her resolve slipping with every
            syllable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to know the sound you make," Rio's voice softened, her mouth
            curving in that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wicked, knowing smile, "when there's no space left between us. When it's
            just you and me... and nothing held back."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A soft, involuntary noise escaped Agatha, her pulse roaring in her ears. Her skin
            burned where Rio's fingers touched, every inch of her on edge, desperate for more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And I want more than to just touch you," Rio continued, her voice a low,
            seductive hum that wrapped around Agatha like a warm current. "I want to map you. Learn every spot that
            makes you weak, every place that makes you come undone. I want to draw out every gasp,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every moan, every surrender."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth parted, a soft gasp escaping her. The world around them felt dim
            and distant, her focus consumed entirely by Rio's words and touch, the way they slipped under her skin,
            making her feel raw and unguarded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"To unravel you... slowly... until you have nothing left to hide."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze never left hers, every word hitting deeper and deeper, pulling her
            into an intimacy that felt almost unbearably close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt exposed, fragile, like Rio had found a place no one else had ever
            touched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's what I want, Agatha," Rio said, her voice steady, relentless,
            each word dropping like an anchor. "I want to find every limit you didn't know you had... and push
            you past it, until there's nothing left but you, laid bare."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hand drifted down, fingers grazing the line of Agatha's neck until her
            thumb found the frantic beat of her pulse, pressing into it-a quiet, unyielding claim that felt both
            grounding and utterly consuming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips parted, her breath coming in shallow, uneven pulls, each heartbeat
            pulsing beneath Rio's thumb, betraying her completely, stripping away any last pretense of
            control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned in, her lips brushing so close that Agatha could feel the warmth, the soft
            hint of a tease, just shy of a kiss. The closeness, the ache, made her dizzy, like every nerve was</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reaching out, drawn to Rio in a way that left her bare and exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now," Rio murmured, her voice a soft, delicious command, "tell me
            what you want, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her pulse pounding beneath Rio's thumb as she felt
            every word slip through her defenses, like a key turning in a lock she'd tried to keep shut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind whirled, struggling to hold on to a shred of composure, a piece of herself
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn't crumbling under Rio's touch, her gaze, that voice that seemed to pull
            her into a place where she was no longer in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to hold on, to stay steady, to keep something of herself guarded. But the
            weight of Rio's thumb pressing over her pulse, the barely-there touch of her lips-so close, so</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">maddeningly close-left her feeling exposed, open, raw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A wave of need crashed over her, pulling her under, and her hands trembled as she
            fought the pull of surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mouth went dry, her voice catching in her throat as the words pushed to the
            surface. She couldn't look away, couldn't pull herself from the dark, inviting depth of Rio's
            eyes, the steady gaze that felt like an invitation and a command all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Swallowing, she felt the admission spill out, soft, aching, and honest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to kiss you," she whispered, barely more than a breath, her voice
            carrying every ounce of the need she'd tried to hide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words felt like a surrender and a release, leaving her feeling weightless, as
            though in that one, vulnerable confession, she'd given in entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned in, her resolve crumbling as the need to feel Rio's lips against
            hers became overwhelming, a quiet ache turning sharp. Her hand moved up to rest on Rio's arm,
            fingers</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">curling into her sleeve as she closed the distance, breaths mingling, the warmth
            between them almost too much to bear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as her lips were about to meet Rio's, she felt the pressure of Rio's
            hand tighten around her neck, a firm but gentle restraint that stopped her in place. Rio pulled back just
            enough to catch Agatha's gaze, her eyes filled with that same dark, commanding intensity that sent a
            shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her heart racing beneath Rio's thumb, her lips parted with the
            expectation lingering in the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's voice dropped to a soft, relentless challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ask."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A surge of frustration coursed through Agatha, hot and insistent, blending with a
            thrill she couldn't deny.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated the way it stripped her bare, the way it made her feel as if she had no
            defenses left.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as if Rio could see right through her, unraveling her layer by layer, drawing
            out her desires without permission, pulling her wants and needs straight from the core of her with an
            infuriating ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words slipped out before she could stop them, a soft, urgent confession she could
            no longer hold back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I kiss you?" she asked, her voice low, edged with desperation.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was too far gone, too caught up to feel the sting of embarrassment now, though
            she knew it would come later, would haunt her when she thought of this moment-how she had caved, how she had
            let herself surrender without a fight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But right now, she didn't care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was breathless, open, every inch of her drawn toward Rio, as if nothing else in
            the world mattered but this-the thrill, the ache, the need burning between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes flashed, her gaze sparking with satisfaction, a wicked gleam that sent
            a tremor down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That pleased look alone made Agatha's knees weak, and she felt Rio's grip
            soften, fingers gliding along the side of her neck before slipping into her hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched as Rio's fingers threaded through the strands,
            pressing and scraping against her scalp, grounding her in a sensation that was both intense and achingly
            tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A low groan escaped Agatha as Rio's hand tightened, fingers curling at the root,
            pulling her head back just enough to remind her who held control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tension thrummed, a tantalizing ache that wasn't pain, but something far more
            consuming-a release.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio guided her forward with a control that radiated dominance, each movement precise
            and deliberate, until Agatha felt the soft, warm press of Rio's lips against her own, a touch that stole
            her breath entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's instinct was to surge forward, to close the gap and lose herself in the
            kiss, but Rio's fingers held her in place, firm and unyielding, keeping her right where she wanted
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every second felt like a slow burn, the tension building, stretching, leaving Agatha
            helpless to do anything but yield, to feel every inch of Rio's control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, instead of the kiss she craved, she felt Rio's words, whispered against
            her lips, each one a soft, taunting caress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good girl," Rio purred, her voice a low, reverent murmur that seemed to
            sink into Agatha's very bones, igniting something that had been buried, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, Rio closed the distance, claiming her in a searing kiss that left no
            question, no hesitation, branding those words into Agatha's soul in a way she knew she'd never
            forget.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Burn and Brew</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good girl."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words echoed in Agatha's mind, and she hated the way her body reacted. Her
            brain</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">resisted, every rational part of her reminding her that she was a grown woman-she
            wasn't a girl, and she sure as hell wasn't good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words seared through her body like fire, as a heat sent a shiver up her
            spine, making her knees weak, making her heart pound hard against her ribs. It was as if her body was
            staging a rebellion against her mind, responding to Rio in ways she couldn't control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could even analyze why it affected her so deeply, Rio's lips were on
            hers. And any irritation or coherent thought she might have had dissolved instantly, melting into the
            kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't completely unprepared for kissing a woman. She'd kissed them
            before- usually in college, often while halfway through a bottle of cheap vodka. Even through the haze of
            drunken bravado, she remembered the difference-the softness, the gentleness, the way women seemed to know
            exactly how to kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those moments had been fleeting but memorable, etched into her mind as something she
            sometimes recalled in the dark, the quiet. Especially lately, when she found herself alone in her room, her
            hand slipping under the waistband of her pants, as she imagined what it would be like to kiss Rio-to feel
            her lips, to taste her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would it be like those moments back in college? Soft?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gentle?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apparently, no. Not even close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shouldn't have been surprised, really.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio did everything with a kind of ruthless precision. She worked with focus and
            intention, every detail under her command. And it turned out that when it came to kissing, she was no
            different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second their mouths met, Rio dismantled her, piece by piece, leaving no part of
            her untouched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was soft, in a way-deliberate and unhurried-but also hard, with a passion that
            nearly stole the breath from her lungs. Rio's lips moved against hers with a control that was
            unnervingly exact, knowing exactly when to press deeper, exactly when to pull back just enough to make
            Agatha ache for more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse hammered, her hands finding their way up to Rio's shoulders,
            holding on as if she might float away under the intensity of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio wasn't just kissing her-she was consuming her, learning her every response,
            as if memorizing the exact way Agatha shivered when her lips brushed her own. Agatha's thoughts
            scattered, overtaken by sensation, and every nerve seemed alive, tuned into the way Rio's mouth moved
            over hers, hungry yet restrained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A soft moan slipped out, and Agatha hated herself for it-the sound of surrender, of
            need. But it was too late to pull it back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it seemed the effect wasn't just hers to bear; Rio's breath hitched, a
            slight stutter against Agatha's lips, and the hand buried in her hair tightened, pulling her just a
            fraction closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a small thing, but it sent a thrill through Agatha, grounding her in the
            knowledge that she wasn't the only one unraveling. Rio was affected too, and that realization was both
            intoxicating and strangely satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, she felt it-the soft, teasing brush of Rio's tongue, just grazing her
            bottom lip, gentle yet still demanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely had a moment to process before she found herself opening, surrendering,
            parting her lips without a single thought of resistance. The speed with which she gave in, how easily she
            welcomed Rio in her mouth should have unnerved her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, it felt right, inevitable, as though her body knew exactly what it wanted,
            even if her mind struggled to keep up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's tongue moved against hers in a slow, calculated rhythm, each touch a
            deliberate exploration, tasting and savoring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's body responded instinctively, leaning in, closing any remaining space
            between them as if she could somehow disappear into the heat of Rio's mouth. The kiss deepened, becoming
            a hungry, consuming pull, and her hands clutched Rio's shoulders, fingers digging in, desperate for
            something solid as the intensity washed over her, grounding her in the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">electric closeness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's tongue slid into her mouth with a bold, almost filthy stroke,
            brushing over every sensitive inch. Agatha gasped, her mouth opening wider in surrender, and Rio took
            advantage, her tongue curling and trailing along the roof of her mouth, grazing her teeth, leaving her
            groaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hand tightened in Agatha's hair, a brief, possessive grip that sent a
            shock through her, making her press closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just as suddenly as she'd taken control, Rio released her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back with an unnerving precision, her hand slipping from Agatha's
            hair, leaving her breathless and dazed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha staggered, feeling the cold air rush into the space Rio had filled only
            moments ago, the sudden absence striking, leaving her unsteady and aching for more, as if she'd just
            been torn from a world she hadn't realized she was lost in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her snapped her eyes, and in the hazy aftermath, it hit her just how ragged her
            breathing had become. Each inhale was shaky, unsteady, and her legs felt weak beneath her, barely holding
            her up. She fought for some semblance of control over herself, over the chaotic heartbeat thrumming in her
            chest, over the way her body seemed to betray her so eagerly, giving in at the first opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, Rio was standing there, watching her with that dark, intense gaze that
            saw</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything. A smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth, smug, knowing, and so damn
            pleased</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">with the state she'd left Agatha in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That expression alone was enough to stir a fresh wave of heat beneath Agatha's
            skin, making her want to wipe that look off Rio's face or, against her better judgment, lean into
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enjoying yourself?" Agatha managed, the words coming out steadier than she
            felt, though the slight quiver in her voice betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, her gaze never leaving Agatha's as she murmured.
            "More than you know."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach tightened, hating how Rio's words sank into her, unraveling
            her composure even as they stirred something deeper, something reckless. They left her feeling both
            weak</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and strangely bold, and the frustrating contradiction curled hotly in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted control back, to steady herself, to get back on level ground instead of
            letting Rio leave her undone like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she forced herself to lift her chin, her voice sharpened with a challenge as she
            snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then why did you stop?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched Rio carefully, hoping the question would land, would somehow turn the
            tables. But it didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio simply held her gaze, looking entirely unaffected, her smirk still firmly in
            place, the look in her eyes only deepening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because," Rio said, her voice low and maddeningly calm, "your office
            is literally surrounded by glass-and I figured you wouldn't appreciate someone seeing...
            this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flicked briefly over Agatha, making her feel acutely aware of her own
            disheveled state, her breath still heavy, her skin warm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The answer left Agatha flustered, and she clenched her fists, fighting the instinct
            to look</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">away, to hide the flush creeping up her neck. Instead, she met Rio's gaze
            head-on, frustration burning in her chest, both at Rio and at herself for being so easily caught off
            guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze sharpened, her smirk deepening as she looked at Agatha with a glint of
            satisfaction, leaning in just enough to close the space between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why, Agatha," she practically sang, voice soft but teasing, "did you
            not want me to stop?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, her immediate reaction a sharp glare. But the words she
            wanted to fire back caught in her throat, refusing to come out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it-hated how her silence betrayed her, how she could feel her cheeks
            warming even as she tried to steel herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that she didn't answer was an answer all its own. And, of course, Rio
            saw it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She read the hesitation, the flicker of vulnerability like she was reading her
            favorite book, page by page, understanding every line with infuriating clarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk grew.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Didn't think so," she murmured, her voice almost a purr, thick with
            satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched, the weakness Rio's kiss had instilled in her body
            slowly fading, and in its place, something more familiar-old pieces of herself, solid and unyielding-began
            to slot back into place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anger. Control.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The absolute need to even the playing field.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't know exactly where she found the courage, but she did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning her back to Rio, Agatha snatched her phone off the desk. Her fingers shook
            slightly as she tapped the screen, but she ignored it, typing the message to her driver with focused intent
            before hitting send and tucking her phone into her purse. She moved with purpose, heading to the cabinet for
            her jacket, slipping her arms into the sleeves and feeling the weight of control settle over her like armor.
            She logged off her computer, each action deliberate, a small defiance against the chaos Rio had left in her
            wake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally turned back around, her purse slung over her shoulder, she found Rio
            watching her with a frown, no longer wearing that smug smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A twisted sense of satisfaction flared in her chest at the sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had unsettled her, even if only a fraction. It was a start.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha walked past Rio, feeling her gaze on her the entire way, like a silent
            pull.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she stopped in the doorway, casting a glance over her shoulder, letting a small
            smile curve her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you coming or not?" she asked, voice steady, issuing the challenge as
            if daring Rio to step up to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt right-perfectly, deliciously right-to be the one in control now, to feel the
            shift in power, to make the first substantial move in this game.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she saw it, that brief flash of surprise in Rio's eyes, her slight widening
            before she could rein it in. And then something else glimmered there, something almost like respect, a glint
            of acknowledgment as if Rio recognized-and appreciated-the game Agatha had just set into motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze sharpened, and a new thrill of anticipation ran through Agatha,
            knowing she had just turned the tables.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That smirk was back in place, and Rio stepped forward-of course-meeting her challenge
            head on, as she gestured out of the office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Lead the way," she murmured, her voice carrying a thrill that matched
            Agatha's heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was many things, but unaware of herself?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Absolutely not.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was, as the kids today would say, a "Self-Aware Queen." She knew her
            faults-more than she cared to count.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew her strengths-probably too well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she knew her weaknesses, which she could name without hesitation, simply because
            there weren't many of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The biggest, the one that could be both curse and crown, was her inability to back
            down from a challenge. Agatha could make a case that it was a strength just as much as a flaw, a trait that
            had shaped her into the relentless force she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she knew it was a weakness based solely on its knack for landing her in
            unbelievably tight spots.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The scar on her elbow was proof enough-a lasting reminder from when she was eight
            years old, and the neighborhood boys had goaded her, claiming she'd never make it over the Grand
            Canyon-sized ditch outside their trailer park.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every kid in the neighborhood had tried and failed. But not Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pedaled harder than her little legs could manage, threw caution to the wind, and
            fucking flew.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cleared it-of course, but the landing was less than graceful. Her front tire
            caught on a rock, sending her flying over the handlebars and straight into a barbed-wire fence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Twenty stitches later, she'd earned her first scar and her mother's
            fury.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was on that day, at eight years old, that Agatha Harkness developed an
            addiction to proving people wrong, no matter how much it hurt, no matter what it cost her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, sitting in the back of the town car on her way to her condo, Agatha traced the
            raised edge of that scar on her elbow through her sweater, her mind wandering back to it-to the first mark
            she earned and all the ones that she collected along the way, both visible and unseen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not all scars were physical.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some cut deeper, hidden under her skin, the psychological marks left behind by
            every</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge she'd taken head-on, every time she refused to back down. They'd
            shaped her, sharpened her into who she was today, and as painful as they'd been, she wore each one with
            a fierce sense of pride.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then her gaze drifted to the woman beside her-the newest challenge life had
            thrown in her path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal sat there, so impossibly calm that Agatha wanted to kick her out the door.
            But instead, she kept her hands busy, her fingers tracing absently over the old scar on her elbow, while her
            pulse quickened, her thoughts unwillingly shifting to this new challenge beside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was unlike anyone Agatha had ever encountered-a challenge that left Agatha torn
            between charging forward and retreating. And somewhere deep down, she felt it-knew it with a bone-deep
            certainty-that this one wouldn't just pass.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't going to make it through this one without a mark. Rio Vidal was going
            to carve herself into Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the scar she was going to leave in her wake, was going to be just as deep and
            just as enduring as the one on Agatha's elbow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had been riding in silence for fifteen minutes now. It was a Saturday night, and
            traffic on the Upper East Side was thick, relentless. From the moment Agatha had settled into the leather
            seats and felt Rio slip in beside her, she'd felt that familiar hum of tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, she'd thrown down this challenge herself, hadn't she? She'd
            goaded Rio to jump the ditch, and Rio hadn't even blinked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, here they were, side by side in the close, uncomfortable silence, the
            leather seat creaking each time they hit a bump. But if Agatha was on edge, Rio was anything but. She sat
            there as composed as ever, exuding calm, as if the silence were the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then out of nowhere, Rio's voice cut through the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We should set some ground rules," she said smoothly, breaking the silence
            and almost startling Agatha out of her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to find Rio watching her, a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth,
            her gaze keen and unrelenting, as though she'd caught the flicker of surprise that Agatha had
            barely</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">allowed to show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She sets her rules upfront," the bartender's words about Rio from the
            Red Light echoed in Agatha's mind, sharp and fitting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line, determined not to give Rio the satisfaction
            of a reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rules?" she repeated, the word slipping out with a hint of
            skepticism.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, her head tilting just slightly, as though she were
            assessing Agatha from a new angle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she replied, her tone light, almost teasing. "If we're
            going to do this, then setting expectations seems wise...that way, we both know what to expect. Keeps things
            clear."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flicker of irritation flashed through Agatha-of course, Rio would twist a challenge
            into a negotiation. Agatha hated rules, especially ones she hadn't written herself. But there was
            something in Rio's gaze, that steady, unshakeable confidence, that kept her rooted to the spot, despite
            the itch to push back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unless, of course," Rio continued, her tone laced with a quiet challenge,
            "you'd rather stop now, before this goes any further."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung between them, daring Agatha to respond. She could feel the implication
            settle around her, the slightest smirk tugging at Rio's lips as if she already knew Agatha's
            answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, that familiar flare igniting in her chest-the undeniable
            urge to rise to the challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See this is why it is a weakness, she thought bitterly, feeling the rise take over,
            already pushing words to her lips before she could think them through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who said anything about stopping?" she shot back, her chin lifting
            defiantly, the question slipping out with all the conviction she couldn't quite hide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only deepened as she gave a small nod, her gaze steady as she turned
            fully to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face Agatha. For a long moment, she simply looked at her, studying her with an
            intensity that made Agatha's skin prickle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but wonder what the first rule was going to be. Something
            predictable, no doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably the usual, "Don't fall in love with me," she thought,
            suppressing the urge to roll her eyes at the cliché.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze held steady, lingering on Agatha, as if she were savoring the charged
            silence,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting to see her reaction. Finally, she spoke, her voice low, carrying a weight
            that seemed to settle deep into Agatha's bones.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Before we get into rules," Rio began, her tone soft yet unyielding.
            "I have a question."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes and flicking her hand impatiently, a gesture urging
            her to get on with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile spread, slow and wide, her teeth flashing in an almost predatory grin
            that instantly set Agatha on edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever was coming, she knew it was going to throw her completely off
            balance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can you cum multiple times," Rio asked, her voice casual, as if she were
            inquiring about Agatha's favorite color, "or just once?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth fell open, words failing her. The audacity of this woman.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How-what-why..." she stammered, tripping over half-formed thoughts.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How was she even supposed to respond to something so bold, so casually
            delivered?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, her gaze intensifying, focused in a way that made Agatha's
            heart hammer against her ribs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she murmured her voice like velvet, edged with command.
            "Tell me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved closer now, her fingers dragging slowly up Agatha's leg, each inch an
            intentional, maddening tease. Her hand traced along the inside of Agatha's thigh, moving higher
            until</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught again, her nerves on fire. Just as Agatha's head
            lulled back, a</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">traitorous sigh escaping her lips, Rio withdrew her hand, her breath warm against
            Agatha's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can you cum multiple times, or just once?" she repeated, her tone laced
            with dark amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse thudded as her eyes slipped shut against the sensation, her head
            pressing back into the leather.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why...why do you need to know that?" she managed, her voice barely steady.
            Rio chuckled, low and rich in her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because, Agatha-it tells me exactly how I should treat you," Rio murmured,
            her voice a slow, tantalizing drag that seemed to slip under Agatha's skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back and looked Agatha in the eye at her next words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Should I take my time with you..." she murmured, her words were deliberate
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">calculated. "Pull it from you, inch by inch, bringing you closer and closer to
            the edge until I decide to let you fall?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers were back on Agatha's, sliding up once more this time not stopping,
            just barely grazing her the fabric of her leggings with a featherlight touch that made Agatha's whole
            body tense. She gripped the door with white-knuckled intensity, struggling to keep her breath steady.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Or..." Rio continued, her voice dark and rich, "can I push you over
            again and again, until you have nothing left to give?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, just as her hand reached the place Agatha's pulse was hammering for,
            she withdrew, leaving Agatha breathless and reeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind raced.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With men, she typically only came once-twice was rare, reserved for the few lovers
            who knew her body well enough to bring her there. But on nights when she was alone and feeling especially
            frustrated, she had managed to push herself over the edge a couple of times.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, technically, she knew she was capable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt Rio's fingers tap impatiently against her thigh, a silent reminder to
            answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, feeling a flush creep up her neck, and opened her mouth, her voice
            coming out softer than she'd intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Multiple," she said, hating the breathlessness in her own voice.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The smile that overtook Rio's face was nothing short of predatory. She leaned
            back, her gaze assessing, as though seeing Agatha in a whole new light-like a child with a new toy
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't wait to explore, to test, to push every button.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio settled comfortably into the seat and turned fully toward her, that smirk still
            in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright," she said smoothly. "Onto the rules. And you know this
            one," she teased, her voice dripping with amusement. "Rule Number One: If you want something, you
            just have to..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes, cutting her off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes-I know," she hissed, feeling both annoyed and flustered. Rio chuckled,
            the sound low and dark.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good. Rule Number Two: Pick a safe word." Agatha's eyes widened
            slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus-why would I need a safe word? What exactly do you plan on doing to
            me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile deepened, and she leaned in just enough to murmur, "As many
            things as you'll let me. Hence, the need for a safe word."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated the thrill those words sent through her. "Fine," she said,
            clearing her throat. "Stop."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded approvingly, a flicker of intensity in her gaze. "Easy
            enough."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shifted, holding Agatha's gaze with a seriousness that made her heart
            skip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay... Rule Number Three: When we get to your place. You are not in charge.
            When I ask you to do something-you'll do it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio interrupted, her voice steady, cutting through her protest.
            "At work, you're the boss. You're in control. But here... when we're like this, you're
            not the boss anymore. I am."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, her mind scrambling for a retort. "You can't
            honestly expect me to just-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I expect you to listen." Rio's tone was firm, her expression
            unyielding, leaving no room for argument.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She meant every word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flare of defiance sparked in Agatha's chest, a resistance that Rio had to have
            known would surface sooner or later. She understood Rio wanted her to surrender, but this-this felt
            like</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">too much, like a line she wasn't ready to cross.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And if I don't?" she shot back, her tone heated, nearly mocking.
            "What are you going to do, spank me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words had barely left her mouth and she already regretted them. She saw the glint
            in Rio's eyes, that familiar look of interest shifting into something sharper, hungrier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you like me to spank you?" Rio asked, her voice dropping, threading
            the question with dark amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse spiked, her cheeks warming under Rio's intense gaze. She
            opened her mouth to fire back a retort, but nothing came. Her throat was dry, her mind scrambling to reject
            the idea, but her body betrayed her, a faint shiver running down her spine. She forced herself to meet
            Rio's eyes, feeling both exposed and cornered, as though Rio had peeled back a layer she hadn't
            meant to show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she managed to mutter, "I didn't say that," but her voice
            lacked conviction, sounding far more uncertain than she'd intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile spread, slow and knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, you didn't. But you didn't exactly say no, either."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused, her gaze holding Agatha's with an intensity that felt almost
            suffocating. When she finally spoke, her tone was like steel, unyielding and final.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The rules are non-negotiable," she said, her voice low but unshakable.
            "If you can't accept them, then we shouldn't continue this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her anger flare, the heat rising swiftly in her chest. The idea that
            everything hinged on her giving up complete control felt like an impossible demand-one she wasn't
            willing to swallow so easily.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"All because I won't let you boss me around?" Agatha shot back, her
            voice laced with sharp defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze remained unwavering, calm yet simmering with an intensity that made
            Agatha's pulse quicken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio answered, her tone almost exasperated, as if Agatha was
            missing the point of what she was trying to say. "I don't want to just boss you around. That's
            not the point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll find that even when you are completely vulnerable to me, you still hold
            every ounce of your power that you've always had-especially over me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the silence stretch, allowing the weight of her words to hang in the air
            between them. Rio leaned in just enough to blur the space between them, her voice softening, coaxing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just think about it, Agatha," she murmured, each word a quiet pull as she
            reached up and touched Agatha's face, cradling it like it was something precious. "You've
            carried power so well-commanded it, shaped it into something fierce, something no one else dares to
            touch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes searched Agatha's face, intent, unwavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But here... with me... what if you didn't have to hold onto it so
            tightly?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath came shallow, her heart pounding as Rio's words settled into
            her, dismantling her defenses one careful piece at a time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to resist, to summon the sharp retort that would restore the distance
            between them. But there, under Rio's hand, with her thumb brushing a tender line across her cheek, she
            found herself unable to move, unable to break away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes held hers, deep and steady, drawing her further in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Letting go doesn't make you weaker, Agatha. It gives you room to experience
            something beyond what you've allowed yourself to feel."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice softened, almost a caress itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What would it be like to surrender, just for a moment? To feel freedom instead
            of weight?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's head spun, her usual resolve faltering as Rio's words seeped into
            places she hadn't known were vulnerable. It was terrifying and magnetic, a thrill and a threat, every
            word</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">coaxing her toward a choice she'd never considered. Rio tilted her head, her gaze
            never wavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You'd still be you, Agatha. Powerful. Resilient. But you'd also know...
            what it feels like to let someone else shoulder it, to give you something in return."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, her fingers slipping slightly down Agatha's neck, her touch gentle
            but relentless. "Will you let me give that to you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, the weight of Rio's question pressing into her like a
            force she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't ignore. Her mind scrambled for footing, her usual defiance rising up
            instinctively, but each time she tried to summon it, Rio's unwavering gaze and steady hand kept pulling
            her back, leaving her teetering on the edge of surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel every inch of Rio's presence, the subtle strength in her fingers
            tracing along her neck, the intensity in her eyes, as if Rio could see through every wall she'd ever put
            up, every line she'd ever drawn to keep herself in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And somehow, the idea of letting those walls fall, even just a little, sent a shiver
            of anticipation down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse hammered in her chest, her mind still reeling but finding
            something solid in Rio's words, in the promise beneath them. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling
            Rio's hand steady against her, grounding her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally opened her eyes, there was a flicker of something raw, something
            unguarded that she couldn't fully mask. She didn't have all the answers-didn't even understand
            the full extent of the pull she felt-but something inside her had shifted, loosening, breaking apart the
            edges of her usual resolve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright-fine," she said, trying to keep her tone dismissive, as if this
            wasn't a big deal, as if she weren't trembling inside. She fought to sound unaffected, to pretend
            her heart wasn't pounding, her defenses wavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll... try," she added, a touch of reluctance slipping through, as
            though she couldn't quite surrender to the thought of surrendering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze softened, a glint of something both satisfied and understanding
            crossing her face, as though she recognized exactly how much it had cost Agatha to say those words.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The car came to a gentle stop, and Agatha recognized the familiar view of her
            high-rise</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">condo building outside the window. She needed something-anything-to cut through the
            intensity hanging thick between them, to leave the car with something lighter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Any other rules, master?" she mocked, quirking an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a snort, shooting her an unimpressed look, though the slight curve of her
            lips betrayed a flicker of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah-one more. Rule Number Four: Don't fall in love with me."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second the words left Rio's mouth, Agatha laughed, unable to resist.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cliché was almost too predictable, falling right into the box she'd
            expected. This rule, she could handle with ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No problem at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way in hell she'd fall in love with this woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This-whatever this was-it was purely physical, purely sexual, nothing more.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her laughter continued as she opened the door and stepped out, ducking down to meet
            Rio's gaze. She caught the subtle quirk of Rio's lips as she moved to follow, clearly amused
            by</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Rio could step out, Agatha smirked, leveling her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Trust me, darling," Agatha drawled, savoring this moment. "That
            won't be an issue."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, she shut the door, cutting off whatever response Rio might have
            had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning, she strode toward her building, laughter still bubbling up as she heard the
            car door open behind her, the unmistakable sound of Rio stepping out, her footsteps close behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't have to look back to know Rio's eyes were likely narrowed, her
            stare burning into Agatha's retreating form.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd probably pay for that little move later, but at this moment, it was worth
            every second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her amusement faded, though, as she stepped into the lobby, the familiar walls of her
            high- rise suddenly closing in, as reality settled in. She pressed the elevator button, tapping her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers against her purse, her mind racing as she thought of what might wait for her
            up in her condo. Of what Rio was going to do to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Had she underestimated this game with Rio? Pushed just a little too far?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elevator doors opened, and she stepped in, only to turn and see Rio follow her
            inside, moving in close, her gaze never leaving Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the doors closed, Agatha caught Rio's eyes, dark and steady, a smirk lingering
            on her lips, but her gaze held a certain challenge, a quiet promise that made Agatha's pulse
            skip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doors sealed shut, and Agatha swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry as Rio's eyes
            bore into her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She might've miscalculated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I Hold Death's Hand in Mine</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here is 7,000 words of the dirtiest words I've ever written. Enjoy. Also, the

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha slid her keys into the lock, pushing the door open and stepping inside,
            acutely aware of Rio slipping in behind her and closing the door with a soft click. Her condo, usually her
            sanctuary, suddenly felt charged and uncomfortable under the weight of Rio's presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was her home- her haven , the one place she could unwind. But now, it felt
            different, as though every corner had eyes, watching and waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She locked the door behind her, setting her purse on the entry table and hanging her
            coat in the entryway closet. Bending down to unzip her boots, she placed them to the side without looking
            back, though she could feel Rio's gaze fixed on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Straightening up, Agatha moved down the hallway, which felt longer than usual. The
            quiet sounds of Rio removing her shoes echoed behind her until she stepped into the open-concept kitchen and
            living area. Making a beeline for the top shelf, where she kept the liquor out of Nicky's reach.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She then went to grab a glass, and contemplated only grabbing one out of spite alone,
            but grabbed two instead, setting them on the counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was mid-pour on the second glass when she heard an impressed whistle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Looking up, she caught Rio's gaze lingering at the threshold, her casual attire
            seeming slightly out of place yet oddly fitting in Agatha's home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's condo was anything but the typical whitewashed, lifeless space common in
            the building.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, it exuded a character, just like her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Deep, dark wood paneled the walls, while wrought-iron accents framed the tall,
            floor-to- ceiling bookshelves brimming with well-loved books. Plush leather armchairs and a wide sofa
            created an inviting atmosphere, and a grand iron chandelier cast warm, flickering shadows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The space felt both opulent and lived-in, distinctly homey -a sanctuary for her and
            Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze drifted around the room, taking in every detail before landing back on
            Agatha, her brow lifting when she noticed Agatha already drinking, the second glass waiting beside
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an infuriating ease, Rio stepped forward, crossing the dark hardwood floors with
            a confidence that made it look as if she'd been here a thousand times-as if she owned the place.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached for the glass Agatha had poured, lifting it to her lips and taking a slow
            sip, her eyes never leaving Agatha's, every movement deliberate, holding Agatha's gaze with an
            intensity that left no room for escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even in her own fucking home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They drank in silence, the weight of it pressing heavily on Agatha, who found herself
            drumming her fingers against the countertop, feeling her irritation build. Meanwhile, Rio seemed completely
            at ease, standing there like she was in her own space, every sip deliberate, every glance measured.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind raced, wondering how exactly one was supposed to turn an awkward
            silence into... whatever this was supposed to become.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clearly, she wasn't supposed to be in charge here-right ? Shouldn't it be
            Rio, then, who decided when to start...this?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when Agatha finally glanced up and caught Rio's gaze again, she felt a flash
            of realization.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was watching her with that maddening smirk, her eyes gleaming over the rim of her
            glass as she took another slow sip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was doing this on purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was letting the silence drag, deliberately letting the tension build, because she
            knew it was making Agatha uncomfortable, throwing her off balance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a game-a silent, calculated play to keep Agatha on edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And damn it, it was working.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gritted her teeth, downed the rest of her drink in a single go, and set the
            glass down with a loud clink against the granite, the sound echoing through the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, are we doing this, or what?" she demanded, her eyes narrowing at Rio.
            The agitation inside her flared, fueling her next words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Or do I need to ask for permission?" she spat, her tone laced with
            mockery. Rio didn't flinch, didn't so much as blink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held Agatha's gaze, calm and unruffled, before taking another slow sip,
            savoring the tension. When she set her glass down, it landed softly beside Agatha's, the quiet gesture
            radiating a control that only heightened the simmering electricity between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, Rio walked across the floor and into the living room, settling
            onto the middle of the couch that faced the kitchen. She leaned back, arms draped casually over the
            backrest, exuding a relaxed confidence, unaffected and-to Agatha's reluctant admission- very
            sexy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha watched, Rio tilted her head, her dark eyes seeming even darker in the
            faint light, her gaze holding a quiet intensity that rooted Agatha in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, her voice rougher than before, Rio gave a simple command. "Come
            here."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At Rio's command, a shiver ran down Agatha's spine, her body responding
            instinctively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But old habits die hard-and defiance flared just as hot as desire, leaving her
            feeling trapped</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-caught between the control she wasn't quite ready to set sacrifice and the
            insistent pull of her body, practically begging to be the sacrificial lamb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Agatha reached for Rio's abandoned glass, the one with a splash
            of very expensive bourbon left, and brought it to her lips, drinking as if the liquor could force her past
            this internal tug-of-war, as if it might silence the part of her that rebelled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the room, Rio's eyes narrowed, a dark edge flashing through them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she said, her voice a warning, laced with a challenge. "If
            you're struggling with something this simple, then you're going to have a very long night ahead of
            you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit hard, a quiet promise that left Agatha's pulse racing, her nerves
            fraying and her instincts telling her she was in way over her head. She finished off Rio's drink in a
            single gulp, setting the glass down with a clink, the liquor making her feel reckless as she leaned</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the countertop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You promise? " she mocked, her tone daring. That one landed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She saw it in the subtle shift in Rio's face, the tick of her jaw, the flare of
            her nostrils.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Agatha felt like a wildlife photographer admiring the beauty of a grizzly
            bear- right before it mauled her to death.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stood there, wondering how this would unfold, how Rio would handle her defiance.
            Maybe part of her was doing this on purpose, just to test the boundaries, even if it was dangerous.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't move; she just held her gaze, a quiet storm simmering behind her
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you know I have total recall?" she asked, her question abrupt,
            seemingly out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she thought about what Rio said, it wasn't entirely surprising. The way Rio
            moved through massive stacks of paperwork without missing a detail, connecting things that even Agatha
            missed-it made sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What didn't make sense is why she was telling Agatha this now. Rio's leaned
            forward, her eyes locked on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can recite word for word the shipping report I read yesterday," she
            continued. "I can tell you by memory alone the report I wrote on blue whales in fifth grade. And I can
            still</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remember the exact color, taste, and texture of the birthday cake my abuelita made me
            on my thirteenth birthday."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised a brow at that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I already figured you had something-photographic memory or close to it,"
            Agatha replied, though a prickling sensation warned her that Rio was leading her somewhere with this
            monologue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned in closer, her gaze steady, unyielding. The silence thickened between
            them, and suddenly, Agatha's 4,000 square foot condo felt as tight as a closet. Rio's presence, calm
            and controlled, filled the room, and Agatha could feel her pulse thrumming in response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you knew I have a memory like that," Rio said, her voice a quiet,
            deliberate murmur,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"then why are you already pushing me on something as simple as asking you to
            come over here...knowing I won't forget it? "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question lingered, heavy and challenging.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had to give it to her-game recognizes game.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal not only knew how to choose her words but also how to set the stage, to
            weave tension so skillfully it felt like a physical force. Agatha could already picture her in a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtroom, drawing in the jury and opposing counsel alike, leading them through her
            story with the same calculated ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Swallowing, Agatha felt the weight of Rio's words sink in-the subtle promise and
            warning layered beneath them. A shiver ran down her spine, and for once, she felt completely, deliciously
            outmatched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha found herself moving forward, each step deliberate, and yet, she told herself,
            it was her choice. Not because Rio had asked, but because a fierce curiosity had ignited within her. She
            wanted to know where this was going, wanted to see if Rio really could handle her-if anyone could.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With every step, her condo seemed to stretch, feeling endless as Rio's eyes
            tracked her movement, unrelenting and heavy. The space between them seemed to thicken, each footstep like
            walking through quicksand, her pulse pounding louder with each inch closed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, finally, she was there, close enough to feel Rio's calm, steady
            presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stopped just short of reaching out, her heart hammering as she looked up to
            meet Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved to sit down, but Rio's voice stopped her in her tracks. "No,"
            Rio said, her voice calm but firm, tapping her thigh. "Here." Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her
            eyes widening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want me to straddle you?" she asked, disbelief edging her tone.
            Rio's eyes narrowed, her gaze never wavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want you to listen," she replied, her voice carrying an unspoken command
            that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every part of her bristled at the order, but the pull was undeniable, leaving her
            caught in a silent war between mind and body. She stood there, resisting, a flicker of defiance still
            holding her in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio warned, her tone low and measured, "I am exactly three
            seconds away from getting up and walking out that door."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wouldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held her gaze, unwavering, her face deadly serious. "Three."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spark of panic flared in Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, maybe she would.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Two."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio placed her arms down by her side, as if ready to push herself up. Agatha clenched
            her teeth, already hating this game.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay, fine!" she exclaimed, stepping forward and settling herself across
            Rio's lap, one leg on either side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flush of embarrassment crept up her neck, her pride prickling at the
            position.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Straddling a lover was nothing new-she'd done it countless times, always as a
            power play, her way of showing she was in charge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't chosen this position; Rio had forced her into it, demanded it. And
            Agatha had answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated herself a little for it, that stubborn pride twisting in her chest.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trying to salvage what was left of her control, Agatha put an overtly fake sexual
            look on her face as her eyes locked onto Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is this the part where you tell me I've been a bad, bad girl?" she
            taunted, her tone raspy and mocking. She needed to put on a front, to claw back some piece of control,
            anything to level the playing field.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio rolled her eyes at Agatha's dramatis, though the faint flick of a smile
            betrayed her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">feigned annoyance. Without a word, she extended her hand between them, her gaze
            shifting back up to meet Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Give me your hand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, surprised by the request.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd expected Rio's next move to be something more overtly sexual, something
            she'd need to brace herself against.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this-this was different, disarming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her curiosity got the better of her, and before she could second-guess it, she placed
            her hand in Rio's, letting the moment settle just as deeply as Agatha's bottom onto Rio's
            lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched, transfixed, as Rio focused entirely on her hand, her touch
            featherlight as she traced lines over the back of her hand, from the tips of her fingers to her wrist.
            Rio's gaze never left Agatha's hand, her expression intense, almost reverent, as though she was
            mapping each line, committing every detail to memory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally flipped Agatha's hand over, her touch shifted, her fingers
            pressing a little more firmly, massaging the tension out of each muscle with slow, deliberate
            pressure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt herself let out a shaky breath, fighting the urge to lean into the
            feeling because,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">damn, it felt really good .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simplicity of it, the care in Rio's touch, was disarming in a way she
            hadn't anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your hands," Rio murmured, her voice soft, almost to herself, "were
            the first thing I noticed about you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She continued, her fingers moving along Agatha's palm, pressing into the base of
            each finger, her attention so focused it was as though nothing else existed in that moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers worked methodically, pressing into the contours of Agatha's
            hand with focused care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have beautiful hands, Agatha," she murmured, her thumb digging into a
            particularly sore spot, sending a wave of relief through Agatha's palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The compliment, paired with the sudden release of tension, pulled a tiny moan from
            Agatha before she could stop herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully, Rio didn't react-she just kept massaging, her concentration
            unbroken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They're restless," Rio continued, her tone matter-of-fact.
            "They're always moving. You talk with them as loudly as you do with your mouth-and that's
            saying something."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed, a reluctant smile tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave the smallest of smiles but didn't look up, her focus still on the hand
            she held. She worked in silence for another minute before gently setting Agatha's hand down and holding
            her own hand out, palm up, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't say a word, didn't glance up, but her expectation was
            clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And damn it, without hesitation, Agatha placed her other hand into Rio's, hating
            the way she didn't even question it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers began the same ritual, tracing the back of her hand, then flipping
            it over, massaging the tension out with a slow, steady rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Even when you're sitting," Rio continued quietly, her voice dropping,
            "they tap, flick, and twirl."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them grew thick again as Rio worked her fingers over every
            muscle, each movement deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, her voice softened, almost a whisper. "It's...enticing to watch.
            The power in them."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers lingered, then traced a light path down Agatha's middle finger,
            slowing as she reached the tip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And when I watch them move, I can't help but wonder," she murmured,
            drawing out each word, "what these fingers would feel like inside me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, a gasp escaping before she could stop it, her pulse
            pounding, heat flaring to life under Rio's slow, unrelenting gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers moved slowly, deliberately, trailing over Agatha's in a way
            that made her words resonate even deeper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each touch, each drag of Rio's fingers painted an image that seared into
            Agatha's mind. In every fantasy, she'd always imagined what Rio would do to her, the way Rio would
            take</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">charge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, with Rio's soft invitation hanging in the air, Agatha found herself
            caught in a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wholly new picture-one where she was the one leaving Rio breathless, pulling her to
            the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought shot through her, a blazing heat flooding her body, and she gasped, the
            intensity so consuming that, without thinking, she pulled her hand back, as if it were Rio's touch and
            not her own imagination that had burned her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before she could escape, Rio's fingers tightened around her hand, her grip
            firm, her eyes snapping up to meet Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those dark eyes drew her in, deeper and deeper, and any defiance or control she clung
            to vanished in the weight of Rio's gaze, leaving her bare, breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned closer, her voice barely a whisper, her words threading into Agatha's
            very pulse. "Are you picturing it, Agatha?" Rio asked, her tone deceptively calm, though the
            intensity in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">her gaze matched the fire searing through Agatha's veins. "Imagining what it
            would be like to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">bury these fingers inside me... to curl them, feel me tighten around you as I
            came?" Agatha was never-ever-at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, under Rio's unyielding gaze, with that question hanging thick in the
            silence, she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forgot how to breathe, let alone speak. Words, normally her weapon and shield, had
            slipped far out of reach, leaving her utterly defenseless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A faint smirk curved Rio's lips, a flicker of predatory satisfaction in her eyes
            as she took in Agatha's reaction, the silent surrender written across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me, Agatha," she continued, her voice smooth, almost too casual,
            "have you ever fucked a woman?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A ragged breath escaped her, filling her lungs with air that felt like fire.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shook her head, her response instinctive, almost childlike in its simplicity.
            Rio's grip tightened around her hand, the pressure firm and commanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Use your words, Agatha," she said, her voice a velvet command that left no
            room for defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse raced, a small whimper pressing against her throat, threatening to
            escape. This was too much-her body already felt like it was on fire, and all Rio had done was touch
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">hands. She'd never experienced anything like this, a desire so intense it left
            her trembling. "No," she managed, her voice a broken whisper.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile deepened as she glanced back down, her fingers tracing slow,
            deliberate patterns over Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hmmm..." she murmured, still massaging, still playing with Agatha's
            fingers as though weaving a spell. "I think you'll like it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, lost in the scene Rio was setting, the steady, relentless seduction
            pulling her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, watching Rio's
            fingers glide over her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio looked up again, her gaze piercing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because you like power," she said simply. "And the most powerful
            feeling in the world... is having a woman come undone around your fingers, your tongue-or other things we
            can</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">explore later."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words hung heavily in the air, but the other things lingered higher, painting
            vivid images that had Agatha closing her eyes, as if trying to shield herself from the vision Rio had woven,
            a vision that felt almost tangible in the air around them, pulsing with each beat of her heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt Rio set her hand aside, felt her shift beneath her, and then the
            featherlight brush of fingertips along her jaw. Then Rio's hand came up, cupping her face fully, her
            thumb tracing a line across Agatha's cheek with a softness that made her eyes flutter open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was watching her, eyes dark and intent, and Agatha felt Rio's hand slide up,
            fingers curling around the back of her neck, guiding her forward with the gentlest tug.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god, Agatha didn't need any more encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She surged forward, crashing her lips into Rio's with a hunger that had been
            building with every touch, every word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt the faint curve of a smile on Rio's lips, but she was too far gone to
            care, too</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">consumed by the need to pour every ounce of heat, every bit of tension, into that
            kiss-to satisfy the relentless fire burning inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their mouths met in a collision, surprising Agatha with how Rio didn't
            immediately take control, didn't steer the kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she let Agatha lead, let her pour every ounce of tension, every need
            she'd kept pent up, into the kiss. It quickly turned messy, all tongue and teeth, both of them groaning
            into</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">each other, feeding off the intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands moved up, slipping into Rio's hair for the first time, fingers
            sinking into the silky strands. She raked her nails along Rio's scalp, and the low groan that rumbled
            from Rio in response sent a thrill through her, her hips instinctively rolling forward, pressing into
            Rio's lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gasped as she felt Rio's hands slip under her sweater, the first touch of
            her fingers against bare skin sending a shiver through her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hands moved deliberately, tracing the lines of her back, fingers exploring
            her skin in a way that felt both soothing and electrifying. Her touch spanned from light and teasing to firm
            and commanding, until finally, nails dragged down her spine, pulling a moan from Agatha that Rio swallowed
            with her kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, just as she was losing herself to the sensation, Rio's hands left her
            skin, shifting to the hem of her sweater.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their eyes met for a heartbeat, a silent understanding passing between them. Agatha
            didn't hesitate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled her hands free from Rio's hair, lifting them over her head to let Rio
            strip the sweater away, exposing her to the cool air and to Rio's intense, unwavering gaze. Rio's
            eyes traveled over her, lingering on her chest, her breasts clad in deep purple lace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look of barely restrained hunger on Rio's face made Agatha's breath
            catch, sparking a thrill that left her wanting more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, moving to close the space between them with another kiss, but Rio
            stopped her with a firm hand pressed to her chest, splayed right between her breasts, holding her
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a breath, her gaze dropping to see Rio's hand where it touched
            her, feeling the heat of it against her skin. She looked up, noticing the subtle struggle in Rio's
            expression</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-the way her breathing deepened, her jaw clenched, her control barely held in
            check.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Rio seemed to center herself, her eyes meeting Agatha's with a
            smoldering intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice was low, controlled. "Take off your pants."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha should have felt a flush of embarrassment at how quickly she moved to obey,
            practically scrambling off Rio's lap. Her fingers hooked into the waistband of her leggings, ready to
            pull them down, but the second she glanced up and caught Rio's gaze, she froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio watched her-intense, dark, unyielding-sent a thrill racing through her
            that made her pause, her breath catching. She hadn't lost her power. It was right there, simmering, and
            she could feel it waning under Rio's gaze, even her skin prickled with vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finding that steady edge, Agatha took a slow breath, then slid her leggings down,
            peeling them off inch by inch, her movements deliberate. She stepped out of them, kicked them to the side,
            and stood before Rio in nothing but her bra and underwear, both lace, both purple-her favorite.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And gods, the way Rio looked at her. She couldn't recall a single time anyone had
            looked at her like that, with a reverence and hunger that made her heart stammer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory of Rio's words in the town car floated to the surface, echoing in her
            mind as she stood there, exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You'll find that even when you're completely vulnerable to me, you
            still hold every ounce of your power that you've always had-especially over me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt it now, that balance of control and surrender, as Rio's gaze held her
            in place, appreciating her, worshipping her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time, she understood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vulnerability didn't strip her of power; it transformed it, turning it into
            something more potent, something that demanded acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't weakness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standing there, bare before Rio, she felt a strength that both terrified and thrilled
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hadn't asked her to submit out of dominance alone; she'd asked because
            she wanted Agatha's choice, her consent, her unguarded self.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a partnership, a balance of power where each surrender was met with reverence,
            not conquest. She could see it in Rio's eyes, the weight of responsibility that came with her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">command, the respect woven into each word and touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her confidence surge, grounding her, steadying her, even as her pulse
            raced. She wasn't diminished here, wasn't made small.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was being seen-fully, completely -and every inch of her power was still hers to
            wield, even in surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio murmured, her voice softer, almost a breathless whisper,
            stripped of its usual control. "You are... stunning."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words sent a fresh wave of warmth through Agatha, the sincerity in Rio's tone
            striking her deeper than she expected. It wasn't a compliment tossed lightly, wasn't an empty
            praise. It felt raw, almost reverent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And God, Agatha felt beautiful in a way she hadn't before-powerful, desired, and
            entirely herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come here," murmured Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a second's hesitation, Agatha stepped forward, closing the distance
            between them, and lowered herself into Rio's lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio took Agatha's hands, one by one, guiding them to the back of the couch over
            her shoulders, positioning them with a calm certainty. Then she looked up, her gaze holding Agatha's
            with a tenderness that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do not move your hands," Rio said, her tone almost tender. "Can you
            do that for me?" The request so gentle, so deliberate, that Agatha's stomach tightened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't known what to expect when Rio took control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd anticipated something dirtier, rougher-Rio pinning her down, demanding,
            taking . And while that thought had its appeal, this... this was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was soft yet charged, electric, and it made her body respond in ways she
            hadn't imagined. She could feel the dampness pooling in her underwear, the ache of wanting Rio to touch
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every movement, every word, was building, stacking moment upon moment, until she felt
            she might break-and Rio had barely laid a hand on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, she wanted her to touch her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, then caught herself, realizing Rio would want her to say it aloud. She
            swallowed, as though needing to brace herself, to prepare her voice for a single word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio's eyes darkened at her response sent another thrill through her, as
            if she recognized the commitment in Agatha's answer, the surrender to the game they were playing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good girl," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there it was again- those damn words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wanted to hate them; she really did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the way they made her body respond, the way they sank into her like a spell, left
            her unable to deny the effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned in, her fingers wrapping around Agatha's hips, anchoring them both, as
            if steadying herself as much as Agatha. She brought her lips to Agatha's chest with the softest of
            touches, so light that Agatha felt more breath than kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her fingers digging into the couch fabric as she fought
            the urge to reach for Rio, to thread her fingers through her hair, to pull her closer to the exact spot
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">needed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was going to be fucking torture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha knew that this is exactly what Rio wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth was everywhere, her lips firm, her tongue joining in to tease and
            torment. She kissed along the tops of Agatha's breasts, traced a hot line across her collarbone with her
            tongue, and then sucked hard where her neck met her shoulder, leaving a mark that felt both possessive and
            reverent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it wasn't just her mouth. Rio's hands roamed over her, palming
            Agatha's breasts, her thumb brushing tantalizing circles over her nipple through the lace, fingers
            gripping handfuls of her ass, squeezing with a possessiveness that made Agatha gasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each touch felt like an exploration, Rio mapping every inch of her, cataloging every
            shiver, every gasp, every roll of Agatha's hips. It was as if she was constructing an intimate knowledge
            of Agatha's body, filing away each response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nearly let out a breathless laugh at what she was doing-Rio was building a
            case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal v. Agatha Harkness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she was winning, effortlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hand slipped forward, tugging one cup of Agatha's bra down with
            deliberate slowness, exposing her nipple to the cool air. Then, without hesitation, Rio's mouth closed
            over it, her lips warm and soft, tongue swirling before her teeth grazed the sensitive skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's head fell back, a groan escaping her lips as her fingers dug into the
            couch for support, her legs trembling at the sensation. Every touch, every pull of Rio's mouth was
            calculated, an artful mix of pressure and release that had Agatha's body pressing closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's own groan hummed against her, sending a fresh wave of heat through Agatha
            as she felt Rio's other hand palm her ass, squeezing with greedy intensity. She couldn't resist; her
            body moved on instinct, grinding into Rio's lap, each roll of her hips building her up more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio bit down, just enough to send a sudden jolt through Agatha's entire
            body, an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">electric charge that made her hands fly to Rio's hair, fingers tangling in the
            soft strands as her control slipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response, she felt the sharp crack of Rio's palm against her ass, the sting
            immediate, sharp, and fiercely delicious. The slap, combined with the heat of Rio's mouth on her nipple,
            was intoxicating-overwhelming .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A moan tore from her, deep and needy, echoing through the room. Agatha's eyes
            flew open in surprise, her pulse racing from the intensity of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pulled back, releasing her nipple with a soft, lingering pop , her gaze flicking
            up to meet Agatha's with a glint of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They held each other's stare, the air between them charged and heavy, and then
            that damn smirk curved over Rio's lips. Her hand, still resting on Agatha's ass, rubbed over the
            freshly marked skin, a soothing yet possessive touch that sent another thrill through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," Rio murmured, her voice low, amusement dancing in her eyes as her
            fingers pressed firmly into the spot she'd just slapped. "I guess that settles our question from
            earlier."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a breathless laugh, the sound a mix of surprise and
            exhilaration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Rio raised a brow, and Agatha instantly knew what she was asking. With a
            huff of mock annoyance, she slid her hands out of Rio's hair and placed them back on the couch,</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">following the unspoken command.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile softened, her hand lifting to cup Agatha's face, her thumb
            brushing lightly across her cheekbone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're being surprisingly good," she murmured, voice warm with a hint
            of pride. Agatha rolled her eyes, but the effect was softened by her own smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can follow directions. I just don't like to." Rio let out a quiet
            snort, her eyes gleaming. "That, I can believe."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha became acutely aware of Rio's other hand tracing a slow path down her
            body, starting at her neck, then down her collarbone, her ribs, each touch making her shiver. The warmth of
            Rio's palm on her cheek, steady and grounding, contrasted with the teasing path of her other hand as it
            ventured lower.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What about a reward system?" Rio asked, her tone almost playful, but the
            glint in her eyes held something more. "You listen... you get a prize."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, though she couldn't stop the slight tremor that ran through her
            as Rio's fingers skimmed down her side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What--you're going to give me a sticker? Maybe put it on the fridge next to
            my kid's artwork?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled, her hand flickered down from her cheek, and Agatha could feel her
            hand</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped around her neck, feel the press of her thumb just a little more firmly into
            Agatha's pulse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I think I can come up with something a bit more memorable than a
            sticker."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers drifted lower, slipping beneath the edge of the waistband of Agatha's
            underwear, making her breath hitch as the thrill of Rio's "reward " settled over her.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hips twitched instinctively, and she managed a shaky nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Deal," she murmured, her voice barely a breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, her hand dipping lower, teasingly slow, until her fingers
            slipped through Agatha's heat with ease. Agatha's eyes snapped shut, a deep, guttural groan escaping
            her as the sensation overtook her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus, Agatha," Rio whispered, her tone a blend of surprise and pleasure,
            as though even she hadn't anticipated the extent of the effect she had on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers moved with a slow, deliberate rhythm, and the sounds that spilled
            from</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips were raw, unfiltered-sounds she didn't even recognize as her
            own. Every touch, every glide of Rio's fingers sent waves of pleasure through her, unraveling her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">composure piece by piece.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel her control slipping; she wasn't going to last long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio's fingers finally brushed over her clit, Agatha let out a loud,
            desperate moan, her hips grinding instinctively into Rio's hand, chasing the intensity that built with
            every passing second. The pressure, the rhythm, Rio's steady gaze on her-it was sensory overload,
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's body responded eagerly, almost mindlessly, surrendering fully to the
            pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The release was so close, Agatha could feel it gathering inside her, building to the
            point</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">where each whimper that escaped her lips grew louder, needier. She was right on the
            edge,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ready to fall-and then, suddenly, Rio's fingers withdrew entirely, leaving her
            aching, empty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A raw, frustrated whine tore from her throat, quickly replaced by a growl of anger.
            Her eyes snapped down to Rio, her shoulders heaving as she tried to catch her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why?" she demanded, her voice thick with desperation and
            irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio looked up at her calmly, bringing her hand to her lips, her fingers glistening
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's wetness. With deliberate slowness, she licked each finger clean, one by
            one, her gaze never leaving Agatha's. The sensual display sent a fresh wave of heat through Agatha,
            nearly enough to tip her over the edge even without being touched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could do nothing but just sit there and watch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Rio finished, she leaned back casually against the couch, her head resting
            with a relaxed ease, as though Agatha wasn't trembling on top of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What is rule number one, Agatha?" she asked, her tone maddeningly calm, as
            if her mouth wasn't full of Agatha's taste, as if Agatha weren't about to combust right on top
            of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath came in ragged bursts, her mind racing, replaying Rio's words
            until the meaning snapped into place. She could almost hear Rio's voice in her ear even though she sat
            there silently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, if you want something, you just have-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Realization dawned, and her nostrils flared in defiance. She knew what Rio was asking
            for, and it grated against every ounce of her pride.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am not begging," Agatha ground out, her voice thick with defiance, even
            as her body betrayed her with a slight tremor, her chest heaving with each ragged breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyebrow lifted, an infuriating hint of amusement glinting in her eyes.
            "Then you're not cumming."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A low growl slipped from Agatha's lips. Her fingers dug into the couch, gripping
            it so fiercely that she could feel the fabric begin to strain and twist beneath her nails.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Seriously?" she spat, frustration simmering just below the surface, her
            body wound so tight. Rio remained perfectly calm, a slight smirk dancing at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want your reward ," she murmured, her tone almost mocking, "then
            you follow the rules."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, a last flicker of rebellion flashing across her
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can always get myself off," she hissed, jaw clenched, her words carrying
            a mix of stubborn pride and challenge. "Give myself my own reward."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused, her gaze holding Agatha's in a way that made the air between them
            feel heavy,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">charged. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, she reached back, took one of
            Agatha's hands, and brought it forward, dropping it firmly into her lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have at it," Rio taunted, her voice low and sultry, her eyes gleaming with
            dark satisfaction as she leaned back, arms crossed, watching Agatha with an intensity that sent her
            pulse</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">racing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked down, her hand hovering uncertainly in her lap, her skin still tingling
            with the memory of Rio's touch. The tension between them thickened, each second stretching impossibly
            long as Rio's gaze pinned her, both a spectator and the very source of her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you going to do, Agatha?" Rio asked softly, her voice a gentle
            push, a challenge simmering beneath her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart pounded as she wrestled between two impossible choices: to beg or
            to get herself off in front of Rio. Both options left her feeling exposed, vulnerable, her heart hammering
            harder at the thought of either. She turned slightly, looking away from Rio,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeling the weight of her expectations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could work up the nerve to touch herself right here in Rio's lap, but she
            didn't want her own touch-not this time. She'd been doing that for days, and the ache inside her had
            become too consuming, too deep. She needed Rio's touch, needed her to be the one to pull her over the
            edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ache spread wide and open within her, and she knew she couldn't walk away,
            couldn't bear the thought of never knowing what Rio's hands felt like pushing her to the
            brink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated the decision even as she made it, but she turned back to Rio, her voice
            coming out softer, more vulnerable than she'd intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Please."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word felt foreign on her tongue, raw, but instead of mocking her or dragging it
            out with a smug "please what," but Rio simply met her gaze, understanding flickering in her
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, she reached out, took Agatha's hand, and lifted it back up, and Agatha
            waited for it to come back to the couch, but instead, Rio guided her to the back of her head, encouraging
            her fingers to tangle in her hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, without hesitation, she leaned in, capturing Agatha's mouth in a
            searing kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha melted into it, returning the kiss with equal hunger, and just as her thoughts
            began to blur, she felt Rio's hand slide back down, slipping under her panties once more, fingers
            gliding through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then when Rio entered her with two fingers, the precision and intensity of her
            touch had Agatha gasping into her mouth, the sensation overwhelming, like Rio was finally giving her
            everything she'd been holding back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved instinctively, riding Rio's fingers, their mouths crashing together
            as she groaned, her breaths coming in ragged gasps against Rio's lips. Every thrust, every curl of
            Rio's fingers sent her closer to unraveling, her whole body trembling under the skillful</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rhythm of Rio's hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's it, baby," Rio murmured against her mouth, her voice dark and
            coaxing as Agatha began to shudder, her quiet whimpers giving way to broken, needy sounds.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled back, breaking the kiss as her hips ground into Rio's hand, her
            forehead pressed to Rio's, her breathing ragged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-please- just please," she choked out, barely recognizing the sound of
            her own voice, thick and desperate. Somehow, that single "please" had unlocked something in her,
            the word slipping out over and over as Rio's fingers met every roll of her hips, matching her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rhythm perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's thumb found her clit, pressing and circling with devastating
            precision. Each pass, each curl of her fingers brought Agatha higher, closer, her body taut with
            anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've got you," Rio whispered, her voice a steady anchor in the storm,
            and that was all it took.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a final surge of pleasure, Agatha shattered, her body arching, a moan tearing
            from her throat as she fell over the edge, completely and utterly undone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's body shook, waves of pleasure rippling through her, every nerve ignited
            as Rio held her, steady and sure, her fingers still moving with a slow, grounding rhythm, drawing out</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every last tremor. Agatha's grip on the couch tightened as her breath came in
            ragged bursts, her forehead still pressed against Rio's, unable to move, barely able to think. She
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weightless, floating, lost in the intensity of it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's other hand moved up, fingers brushing tenderly along Agatha's cheek,
            her thumb stroking in soothing circles. The gentle touch grounded her, bringing her slowly back down, and
            she could feel Rio's eyes on her, taking in every lingering shiver, every heavy breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha finally opened her eyes, her gaze met Rio's, and she saw a warmth
            there-a blend of satisfaction and something softer, unspoken. The silence stretched between them,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">charged yet comfortable, and for a moment, they stayed like that, foreheads pressed
            together, sharing the stillness after the storm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into a slow, knowing smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Gold star sticker for you," she teased, her voice low, like she was proud
            of just how completely Agatha had unraveled for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a breathless laugh, her heart still racing, her voice rough but laced
            with humor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you actually try to give me a sticker, I'll hit you," she said, the
            exhaustion mingling with a heady high.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pouted playfully, her eyes gleaming as if Agatha had spoiled her fun. Then, with
            a small grin, she placed her hands on Agatha's hips, gently gesturing for her to move aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a groan, Agatha found the strength to shift, flopping to the side like a dead
            weight, sinking into the couch. She closed her eyes, her body still tingling, pulses of pleasure lingering
            in her nerves. She could barely recall ever feeling so thoroughly undone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just as she settled into the cushion, she heard movement. She cracked one eye
            open, just in time to see Rio reposition herself, on her fucking knees, in front of the couch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, you thought we were done?" Rio asked, grabbing each of Agatha's
            legs and hooking them over her shoulders, flashing a devilish grin. "No, Agatha-we're just getting
            started."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before Agatha could even process, Rio's mouth dipped down, her tongue gliding
            through her, and every ounce of breath left Agatha's lungs as she arched off the couch, her eyes
            slamming shut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," she moaned, one hand instinctively tangling in Rio's hair as
            pleasure surged through her, raw and consuming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha surrendered to the relentless waves of pleasure coursing through, one thing
            became crystal clear in her mind:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal had to be death personified, because this woman was definitely trying to
            kill her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We Carry On</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha drifted into awareness slowly, each sensation sharpening bit by bit.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first thing she noticed was that she'd definitely been drooling into her
            pillow. She went to wipe it away, but her muscles protested, aching as if she'd just run a 5K.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then-her eyes flew open. She was naked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting up abruptly, she shoved a wild mess of curls from her face, blowing at the
            stray strands that clung to her forehead as she looked around her bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Empty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything looked exactly the same. But flashes of last night came flooding back, and
            her hand instinctively moved to her chest as she felt her breath catch, heat rushing up her neck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every detail replayed in vivid clarity: Rio's hands on her, putting her into
            whatever position she wanted, drawing from her sounds she'd never made, sounds she didn't know she
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">capable of. The way Rio had taken her to the edge, over and over again, until she was
            a shaking, gasping mess.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How many times had she come last night?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure; she'd lost count.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even remember falling asleep. She had a distinct memory of Rio still
            on top of her, coaxing her through another climax when Agatha had muttered that she couldn't take any
            more. And Rio, with that smirk, had simply told her she could-and somehow, she did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, feeling a fresh flush creep over her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she really just pass out on Rio afterward?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't deny it: Rio had quite literally fucked her into oblivion.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha's mind cleared further, a new realization hit her like a bolt of
            lightning:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hadn't even taken a single piece of clothing off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd been fully dressed-socks and all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another hot flush of embarrassment crept over Agatha, her face heating at the
            thought. Rio had completely unraveled her, reduced her to a naked, trembling mess, while she herself</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remained composed, put-together, not a hair out of place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had to be purposeful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was making a point-a deliberate, calculated move to show her who was in control.
            A subtle power play, a reminder that Rio could strip Agatha bare, lay her open in every way, without so much
            as removing a single piece of her own clothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pushed herself up, her muscles protesting every movement as she swung her legs
            off the bed and stood, heading toward the bathroom. She hissed softly as the ache deepened, a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">full-body reminder of last night's intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She worked with a personal trainer three days a week; she was in shape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why in the hell did she feel like she'd just survived an ironman?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another flush of heat crept over her as she registered that her soreness wasn't
            limited to her muscles. There was a more intimate ache-a sweet soreness that reminded her exactly how
            thoroughly Rio had wrecked her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She made her way to the bathroom, flipping on the light, and caught her breath as she
            approached the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As her gaze traveled over her body, she let out a low, shaky breath, her eyes
            narrowing at the dark hickey right where her neck met her shoulder. And there, on the top of her breast-was
            that a bite mark?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even remember that happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She examined her reflection, half-relieved and half-disappointed to see that the rest
            of her skin bore no visible signs, though her body still felt marked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as if Rio's hands, her mouth, her tongue-hell, even her teeth-had seeped
            into her muscles, leaving traces only she could feel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gripped the edge of the sink, steadying herself, and lifted her gaze, meeting her
            own eyes in the mirror. She let out another shaky breath, trying to process the enormity of it all.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd just had the best sex of her life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At forty-eight years old. And it was with a woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she stared into the mirror, something shifted. She'd danced around this
            realization before, but here it was, undeniable, hovering right in front of her:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe she was a little bit gay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't a jarring epiphany, not a thunderous shift, but rather a soft
            acknowledgment she'd kept buried for too long. It wasn't even surprising, but it was the first time
            she'd really let herself recognize it, to own it fully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked herself in the eye, and for a moment, it was as if her own reflection had
            something to say back. If her inner self could crawl through that mirror, she'd probably shake her for
            taking this long, for resisting something so deeply true. And for all her resistance, here she was, staring
            herself down, a wry smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn't the grand revelation she might have expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was simply her own truth, finally acknowledged, finally allowed to exist without
            the usual defenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked herself in the eye, letting that quiet acceptance settle deeper within
            her, a strange comfort wrapping around her like a warm blanket. For the first time, she felt at peace inside
            her, a sense of knowing that felt right, like slipping into a pair of well-worn shoes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, a new thought crept in, making her breath hitch as a startling realization
            hit her with the force of a cold shower:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How in the hell was she supposed to look Rio Vidal in the eye on Monday?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arrived at the office long before sunrise, telling herself it was to get a
            jump on the day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had nothing to do with having to walk past the war room to get to her
            office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She definitely wasn't avoiding the possibility of running into Rio first thing,
            of catching that piercing gaze before she'd even had her morning coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, well before the world outside had begun to stir, Agatha was already settled at
            her desk. The office was silent, peaceful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was nice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened her laptop, glancing over her calendar for the day. She'd wrapped up
            most of her tasks on Friday, which meant she could ease into things, take her time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She started by reading through some of the latest Supreme Court rulings and opinions,
            digesting the legal reasoning with interest. A particularly lengthy dissent caught her attention, and she
            couldn't help but underline a few sharp, pointed comments she found brilliant. She moved on, reviewing
            updates on pending cases, even making a few notes on the procedural quirks in recent case law that she found
            compelling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let herself sink into the quiet, diving into a few scholarly articles on legal
            ethics, making notes and jotting down thoughts. She even scrolled through a few industry</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">newsletters she'd been putting off, skimming new developments in tech and their
            potential legal implications.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The click of footsteps broke the early-morning quiet, and Agatha glanced up to see
            Billy standing in the doorway, his eyes widening in shock as he took in the sight of her already at her
            desk. She fought the smirk that threatened to surface, pleased to have thrown his no doubt meticulously
            planned morning slightly off track.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good morning, Ms. Harkness," he managed, holding out a coffee with a
            slightly unsteady hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She grabbed her coffee and shooed him away with her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Billy, the office slowly began to fill, the hum of controlled chaos gradually
            building around her. Phones rang, conversations overlapped, and the steady influx of colleagues</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">created the usual whirlwind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, however, kept her focus on her work, ignoring the commotion with
            practiced</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">indifference. She scanned through an email from a client, engrossed in the details
            and noting a few follow-up points, until a familiar presence caught her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her focus shifted, almost involuntarily, and she looked up to see Rio walking into
            the war</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room. She hated how quickly her attention diverted, how an email that had commanded
            her focus a second ago now felt like white noise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moved with that same unhurried confidence, her gaze sweeping over the room as
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">entered. Agatha tensed, resisting the urge to sink lower in her chair, and tried to
            look back at her screen. But her eyes betrayed her, darting up just as Rio glanced in her direction, a
            subtle, knowing smirk playing at the corner of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her pulse quickening as that smirk triggered a
            cascade of memories-Rio's face hovering over her, that same smirk lingering just after she'd come
            undone beneath her. Heat flared in her cheeks, and she forced herself to look back down at her computer,
            eyes fixed on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words blurred, every line dissolving into meaningless shapes. She wasn't
            absorbing a single thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, unmoving, as she fought to steady herself,
            pushing back the memory, the flush that came with it, the way her skin still seemed to tingle at the thought
            of Rio's touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today was going to be a long, fucking day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She usually was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She barely survived the day but for a different reason then she thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of being unraveled by Rio, Agatha's clients decided to do it for
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first involved the " golden child "-a client's privileged son
            caught with enough drugs to land him a felony. Forcing Agatha to wade into the depths of the crowded
            criminal court, navigating the throngs of people for a quick bond hearing and then an even faster
            negotiation with the prosecutor to sidestep a criminal record.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated these cases, especially for petty, non-violent crimes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courthouse was packed, bodies pressed shoulder-to-shoulder, all waiting with
            various levels of exhaustion and resignation etched into their faces. Ninety-nine percent of these people
            would rely on court-appointed attorneys, overworked and overwhelmed, and far too many would find themselves
            steamrolled by a system already stacked against them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was the side of the law Agatha despised-the tangled, inequitable mess where
            justice had little to do with fairness, where the scales tipped heavily against those without the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">resources to fight back. The whole place reeked of brokenness, the kind of brokenness
            that only showed itself when you peeled back the polished veneer of courtroom dramas and legal
            ideals.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she did her job-the golden child out on bond, no problem. And after a few blunt
            negotiations with the prosecutor, she'd arranged a deal that would lead him straight to community
            service and rehab, effectively wiping his slate clean.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as she wrapped up at the courthouse, Agatha was called across town for another
            so-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">called emergency. This time, it was one of her largest clients-a prominent investment
            group whose offices were currently being combed through by the FBI, courtesy of a freshly minted warrant.
            Agatha wasn't surprised. She knew the game; all investment groups played dirty to get ahead. Her job was
            to make sure none of that dirt stuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Corporate law was her domain, her specialty. She liked it for precisely that
            reason-no pretenses of fairness, no illusions. Everyone in the game had deep pockets, and everyone knew the
            stakes. There were no unjust systems, just players with endless resources and the right team to back them
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She arrived just as the FBI agents were starting to dig in, and she almost laughed
            when she saw their faces fall as she stepped off the elevator.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They knew her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They knew her reputation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they knew they were in for an uphill battle now that she was here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she stepped into the office, she took control, keeping the agents
            meticulously within the bounds of the warrant, blocking them the second they overstepped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't resist poking holes in their case wherever she found them, asking
            pointed questions and spotting inconsistencies just for fun, watching with satisfaction as their confidence
            wavered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time Agatha finally made it home the company thankfully survived the search-
            barely but the exhaustion had settled into her bones, a heavy weariness from a day that had been relentless
            from start to finish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was at least one silver lining: she hadn't had to spend a single second
            at the office with Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't had to look into those sharp, knowing eyes, or see the expression of a
            woman who'd seen her completely undone, exposed in every possible way. She didn't have to face the
            smirk she knew Rio would wear-that insufferable, knowing smirk. The same one that had lingered over her as
            she'd come, that had teased from between her thighs, that had pressed into her shoulder when Rio had
            taken her from behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a smirk burned into her body and mind, embedded in every touch and every
            look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could almost feel the ghost of it now, heat prickling her skin as the memories
            simmered just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at least tonight, she didn't have to face it in person. She'd escaped-for
            now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she opened her door, balancing a pizza box in one hand, she stepped inside and
            braced herself for the familiar sound of quick footsteps pounding across the floor. Sure enough, a split
            second later-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The exhaustion that had clung to her all day evaporated, replaced by a warmth that
            only one person in the world could bring out in her. She nudged the door shut with her foot, just in time to
            see Nicky rounding the hallway corner at full speed, a whirlwind of energy and joy barreling straight toward
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had learned from experience, so she tightened her grip on the pizza box with
            both hands and braced herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oomph!" Agatha grunted as Nicky collided into her, his small arms wrapping
            tightly around her waist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was all boy-rough and tumble on the outside, but with a heart so tender it made
            hers ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gods, she'd missed him, and the simple joy of having him home was enough to
            dissolve any remnants of her exhausting day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once she steadied herself, she balanced the pizza box in one hand, reaching down to
            ruffle his dark curls, smiling down at him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, baby," she murmured, cupping his face and leaning down to kiss the top
            of his head. "How was school?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He launched into a mile-a-minute recap, still latched onto her like the world's
            sweetest leech, as she made her way to the kitchen and set the pizza on the countertop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Sonya, Nicky's nanny since he was a
            baby, waving as she put on her coat and headed toward the door. It had been their routine for nearly six
            years: Agatha would walk through the door, Sonya would hand things over to her, and Nicky would take center
            stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky kept talking as Agatha got out the plates, splitting a slice onto each before
            carrying them both to the table. She barely had time to sit down before he clambered into her lap, grabbing
            his slice, his stories tumbling out between mouthfuls as he relayed everything that happened in his
            classroom, excitement pouring out of him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wrinkled her nose at his enthusiastic, slightly messy chewing but didn't
            correct him. He was excited, and he'd missed her, just as much as she'd missed him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a bite of her own pizza, nodding along as he shifted topics-from the
            classroom drama to the types of clouds he'd learned, naming each one and its meaning with startling
            precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was smart-sometimes scarily so.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His teachers had already marked him as gifted, though he struggled emotionally,
            especially when he got frustrated. He had a tendency to run- literally bolting when things didn't go his
            way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could almost picture her ex-husband's exasperated look whenever they got a
            call from the school about Nicky's "getaway stunts," his face silently screaming:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where do you think he gets this from?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had just taken a bite of her pizza when Nicky blurted out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Daddy has a new girlfriend. Amanda. She's nice. She took me to the
            zoo." She froze mid-chew.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, James is seeing someone-again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her ex-husband had gone through a rotating lineup of women since their separation,
            most of whom came and went before she even had the chance to meet them. And, like a cliché of</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wealthy divorced dads, James didn't exactly date in his age group. Agatha had met
            one or two over the years, all of them at least twenty years his junior.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James was fifty-two, for God's sake. It was ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky kept talking, oblivious to her thoughts. "Daddy is happy. He smiles
            more."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He took another bite of pizza, then paused, his small brows drawing together as his
            nose scrunched up in that familiar way he did when he was thinking hard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha braced herself, recognizing that look all too well. Her son had a habit of
            speaking with the brutal honesty only a child could wield.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He reached up, pressing his greasy, pizza-stained fingers to her cheek, looking at
            her with a curious expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't smile a lot."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ow.  Agatha winced inwardly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is amazing how kids could unknowingly bury daggers in their parents' hearts
            with their blunt, innocent observations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She managed to keep her composure, setting her pizza down as she wrapped her arms
            around him, holding him close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I smile," she insisted softly, and then, with a mischievous grin, she
            tickled him, smiling as he burst into giggles and squirmed in her arms. "See? I smile all the time with
            you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the tickling subsided, Nicky's laughter faded, and he looked at her with
            that same serious, searching gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But what about when I'm gone? Do you smile when I'm gone?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damn it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This kid was trying to kill her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, ready to give him a reassuring lie-something simple.
             Of course, I smile when you're not here, even though the truth was far from it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before she could speak, Nicky's eyes lit up as though he'd had the best
            idea in the world. "Maybe you can get a girlfriend like Daddy-so you can smile even when I'm not
            here."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha laughed at that, a startled, genuine laugh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You mean a boyfriend, honey," she corrected gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Nicky only shrugged, as if it made no difference to him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You didn't smile with any of your boyfriends."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stilled, her breath catching as she absorbed his words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't realized Nicky had been watching her so closely, hadn't known
            he'd picked up on the things she kept so carefully hidden. She'd thought she'd shielded him from
            her own disappointments, put on a brave face as she tried to navigate dating again after the divorce.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet here he was, perceptive in that unfiltered way only her child could be, seeing
            through her mask to the truth she hadn't even fully admitted to herself: that the men she'd dated
            hadn't made her happy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the divorce three years ago, she'd tried to move forward. She'd gone on
            plenty of dates, a few even turning into short-lived relationships, but none had ever clicked. She even
            introduced Nicky to one or two men she'd thought might last.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They hadn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hadn't liked them, and she hadn't blamed him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, she'd barely liked them herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her attempts at dating had all felt empty, like trying to force pieces into a puzzle
            that just didn't fit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, meanwhile, picked up his slice again and took a big bite, chewing thoughtfully
            before looking back up at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Maybe you need a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend," he said, words
            muffled around his mouthful but clear enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught completely off guard by the innocent but strangely perceptive
            comment. She forced a small, wry smile, hoping he'd move on to a less jarring topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Nicky just kept looking at her, waiting, his wide eyes expectant and
            curious.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a breath, her mind racing through the events of the past few days, the
            revelations she'd had, and her unexpected, undeniable connection with Rio. Her son's words lingered,
            pressing gently but insistently against the parts of herself she'd barely started to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acknowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she gave a small shrug, her voice softer than usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Maybe, kiddo," she murmured, reaching out to ruffle his hair with a
            gentleness that felt like both a reassurance to him and a grounding touch for herself.
            "Maybe."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky grinned, clearly pleased with her response, and dove back into his pizza,
            blissfully unaware of the quiet stirrings within his mother's heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Earthly and Divine</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next few days were, in every way, a gauntlet Agatha could never have anticipated.
            It was like some cruel twist from a TV show Disney would make-where the heroine must face an endless string
            of trials to reach her goal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only, in this version, Agatha's prize wasn't a throne or treasure at the end,
            but the chance to make it through each day with her dignity intact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No client emergencies, no pressing meetings; it was as if the universe itself had
            aligned to trap her in Rio's orbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No escape routes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No distractions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just Rio, haunting her like a ghost she couldn't banish. And Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was impossibly, unbearably turned on. And Rio- damn her -knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flicker of awareness in those dark, relentless eyes, the curve of her smirk that
            teased but gave nothing away, made Agatha's skin prickle with an intensity she hadn't felt in
            years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't push too hard-she was far too clever for that. Her gestures were
            maddeningly subtle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had found new ways to murmur Agatha name, her tone so low and deliberate
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse raced. She brushed against her with the smallest touch, the barest
            graze of fingers when handing her a file or slipping a pen across her desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">None of it was overtly sexual. But to Agatha? It was everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that she knew the sharp precision of Rio's hands, the control held within
            those strong, capable fingers, her mind flooded with images of what they could do. She knew the wicked skill
            of her tongue, the way those dark eyes could blaze with something wild, almost feral, when Agatha finally
            gave in and came undone beneath her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The flicker of memory alone was enough to leave her breathless, pulse quickening, her
            muscles tightening with a need that was impossible to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After three days of utter, unrelenting torment, Agatha found herself lying awake,
            staring at the ceiling of her bedroom. Even her own bed-her sanctuary-had become a shrine to Rio Vidal.
            She'd washed the silk sheets, sure, but the memory of Rio was impossible to cleanse. No matter how many
            times she stripped the linens, the ghost of what Rio had done to her here lingered, as vivid and stubborn as
            ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gritted her teeth, frustrated and desperate, fingers trailing to where she
            thought she could find relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was just... okay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing could match the real thing, and the ache only deepened, pulsing stronger with
            every touch that couldn't quite measure up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she even realized it, Agatha grabbed her phone and typed a quick message to
            Billy. Her finger hit send almost instinctively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Get me the phone number for Rio Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reply was nearly instant-Billy was nothing if not exceptional at his job.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">830-557-2136.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She made a mental note to give him a generous holiday bonus this year.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now that she had the number staring back at her, mocking her from the screen...
            did she have the courage to actually send the text?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought alone had her gritting her teeth. When had she become so...
            hesitant?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So wound up over a simple message? She was Agatha Fucking Harkness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was time to start acting like it. Rio Vidal would not turn her into some flustered
            schoolgirl. With forced confidence, she typed out a message.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did you finish that discovery request like I asked?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Real brave.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glared down at her phone, almost as if she could will the text back into
            oblivion. But her brows shot up when she saw the familiar dots of a reply appear on her screen, followed
            by:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pursed her lips, already irritated. So she fired back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No. It's God. Just checking in."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then another message, quickly followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes. Of course it's me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The typing bubbles popped up again, and Agatha held her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's on your desk."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course it was. She hadn't been expecting it until tomorrow at the earliest; it
            would take any other associate that long to finish. But of course, Rio had completed it in half the time.
            Agatha's fingers tightened around her phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hmmm... I'll have to read it tomorrow then."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hit send and sighed, wondering how to take this any further. Rio had to know she
            wasn't reaching out at this hour just to check in on paperwork she hadn't expected until the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">following day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost as if reading her mind, another message appeared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is that all you needed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at the words, feeling the smirk behind them, the confidence that
            radiated through the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't help herself but rise to the challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Send me your address."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Direct.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A clear enough signal without laying it all out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then the message sat there-read, with no response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five minutes crawled by, each second stoking the embers of embarrassment in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she threw her phone aside, squeezing her eyes shut as if it could somehow
            shut off the heat of being left on read.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, a buzz.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated herself for nearly dove across the bed, grabbing her phone with a
            swiftness that surprised even her. She clicked the message open, holding her breath as she read the single
            word:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ask."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After securing the nighttime nanny for Nicky and notifying her on-call driver, Agatha
            found herself parked outside Rio's building. Surprisingly, Rio lived close-just 20 minutes away in
            Chelsea.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was... unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did a first-year associate afford a place in this neighborhood?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The building itself, like most in Chelsea, brimmed with character: a vintage charm
            mixed with modern edges, bricks that had weathered decades, ivy curling along the edges, and tall windows
            reflecting the city lights.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stepping out into the cold, brisk night, Agatha glanced back at her driver and told
            him she'd call when she was ready. He'd likely assume she was here for a client emergency. It
            wouldn't be the first time she'd left her home in the middle of the night to manage some
            crisis.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped under the brick archway leading into the entry, her eyes scanning the
            old- fashioned buzzer system. Rio's apartment number was listed at the bottom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without hesitating, she pressed the button.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The response was immediate-a soft buzz, followed by the sound of the door unlocking.
            Agatha grabbed the door, pulling it open and stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio lived on the fifth floor-the top, and of course, this building had no elevator.
            She let out a breath, then started up the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The building was quiet, every creak and echo a reminder of where she was going and
            who was waiting at the top.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Halfway up, she silently thanked herself for choosing sensible footwear-this
            wasn't a night to be hiking up stairwells in heels. By the time she reached the top, her breath was
            slightly uneven, but she recognized it wasn't just from the climb but from the anticipation pooling in
            her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached Rio's door, raising her fist to knock. For a moment, she hesitated,
            her hand hovering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was an unfamiliar feeling, standing on someone's doorstep like this,
            feeling... exposed. But she was here. She wasn't about to turn back now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knocked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door swung open almost instantly, and there was Rio, phone pressed to her ear.
            She gave Agatha an apologetic look and gestured for her to come inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't move, instead her gaze traveled over her-hair thrown up in a messy
            ponytail, loose gray sweatpants, and a faded 3/4-sleeve T-shirt that read, "Bohner Family Reunion:
            Pitch a Tent."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was absurdly casual, ridiculous even , but somehow Agatha hated how good Rio
            looked in it. There was a rawness, a realness to her like this, and her heart gave a sharp, unexpected
            lurch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a side of Rio she hadn't imagined-one that felt strangely
            intimate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, catching Agatha's gaze lingering, and it was only then
            that Agatha realized she'd been staring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fighting the flush that crept up her neck, she stepped inside, keeping her expression
            carefully composed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door clicked shut behind her, sealing them into a space that was nothing like
            she'd expected. The apartment was sleek, modern, but certainly eclectic, with accents and unexpected
            bursts of color.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what really threw her was the sheer amount of plants.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They covered nearly every corner and surface, greenery spilling over in every
            direction, transforming the space into a kind of urban jungle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Along the far wall, a glass door opened onto a rooftop patio, where a frosted glass
            greenhouse stood amidst even more plants and a cozy seating area.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal had a green thumb?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha would never have guessed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even momentarily thrown, Agatha found herself thinking it was strangely... charming
            .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kept taking it all in, trying to reconcile this side of Rio with the one she knew
            professionally, and somewhat personally. Her gaze roamed around the room, until Rio's voice pulled her
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, Rio was speaking, and Agatha nearly snapped her neck turning toward the
            sound of her rapid-fire Spanish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd known Rio was bilingual-it was right there on her HR profile-but hearing
            her speak this way, with a different tone, a distinct cadence, and a warmth she hadn't heard
            before?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That she wasn't prepared for. The way her voice sounded. Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was starting to think she'd miscalculated coming over here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Between Rio's casual outfit, the surprising setting of her apartment, personal
            effects scattered everywhere, and now hearing her speak in Spanish, this felt like an entirely different
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was not the tightly controlled woman she'd thought she was beginning to
            understand. Yet somehow, this version of her felt right, more complete.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha's heart gave an unexpected stutter at that thought. Suddenly, the
            spacious apartment felt uncomfortably tight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without looking back at Rio, she made her way out to the patio, feeling her eyes on
            her but unable to stay in that room another second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Outside, she stepped directly into the small greenhouse. The temperature was still
            warm, clearly heated to stave off the creeping autumn chill.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha immediately took off her jacket the heat from both inside her and outside her
            becoming too overwhelming as she draped it over chair, and she took in her surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The greenhouse was different than what she'd expected, filled not only with
            greenery but with vibrant flowers in a kaleidoscope of colors-deep purples, soft pinks, bright
            yellows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was undeniably beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha found herself drawn to a single white bloom near her, its petals open in full,
            soft and delicate against the stark green of its leaves. She reached out, fingers brushing gently over the
            velvety petal, and felt a bit of her tension begin to unwind, if only slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she heard the door creak open behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to see Rio walking toward her, two beers in hand. Rio extended one to her
            with a soft, apologetic smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sorry about that," she murmured, her gaze tracing over Agatha. "My
            abuelita doesn't care about time zones."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't quite sure how to respond to that, but she accepted the beer
            anyway. She didn't drink beer often, but at this point, she'd drink straight gasoline if it took the
            edge off her nerves. She took a few quick sips, grimacing slightly at the taste, catching Rio's smirk
            from the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, thankfully, Rio didn't push- yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew it was only a matter of time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, Rio settled into one of the chairs, casually tossing her legs up on the low
            table between them and lifting a brow at Agatha, a silent challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ball's in your court.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha threw her a look and took another drink, then crossed to the couch opposite
            Rio, lowering herself into it. The silence that settled between them was heavy, almost tangible, charged
            with the words they hadn't yet spoken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio just watched her, patient, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took another sip- Jesus , the beer was going down fast-as her gaze drifted
            over the greenhouse again. Soft fairy lights wove across the ceiling, casting a warm, almost ethereal glow
            over the room. She felt herself relax, just a little, drawn in by the unexpected beauty of the space.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning back to Rio, she broke the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't peg you as a 'plant person,'" she said, gesturing
            around her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave a casual shrug, glancing around the greenhouse as she took a slow pull from
            her bottle, her eyes eventually finding their way back to Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I come from a family of migrant farmers," Rio said, her tone softened by a
            hint of nostalgia. "I grew up working in the fields with them. I find it comforting, having dirt under
            my nails. It feels like... home ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ease with which she shared something so personal, as if it were the most natural
            thing in the world, surprised Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd expected walls, mystery, maybe a casual deflection-but this openness? It
            was... unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha found herself at a loss for words, but Rio seemed to sense it, her gaze
            shifting as she watched Agatha's reaction. The warmth in her expression from moments before softened,
            morphing into something sharper, something that made Agatha's pulse quicken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The softness was gone, replaced by that familiar, predatory glint.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why are you here, Agatha?" Rio's voice dropped to a low, almost
            teasing murmur, her head tilted with that smirk that never quite left her face. "Do you... need
            something ?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated how easily Rio could slip into this game, how quickly she could turn the
            mood with a single look-with a subtle shift in her tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effect was immediate, visceral, and Agatha loathed how it put her on edge-yet she
            was acutely aware of the thrill that came with it, the way it made her senses sharpen, made her heart beat
            just a little faster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, she was also now painfully aware of the fall that would come after.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a steadying breath, determined not to let it show, but Rio's gaze was
            unwavering, her eyes dark and knowing. There was something almost maddening in her confidence, as though she
            knew exactly the effect she was having and enjoyed every second of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her cheeks warm, and she forced herself to hold Rio's gaze, refusing
            to be the first to look away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them was charged as Rio's fingers drummed lazily against the
            arm of the chair, her eyes never leaving Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, steadying herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know why I'm here," she said, attempting a deflection she knew Rio
            wouldn't accept but grasping for it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only deepened, a glimmer of amusement flickering in her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do I?" Rio's tone was dripping with feigned innocence, her gaze
            steady, unyielding. Agatha's heart hammered in her chest as she looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here it was-the precipice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had two choices: she could say why she was really here, lay herself bare, and
            finally get what she wanted, or she could lie, turn around, and walk away, resigned to living in this</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">endless state of frustrated longing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio seemed to sense her hesitation, the way her resolve wavered. Her feet slid
            down from the table, her body leaning forward, closer, every inch of her focused on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Say it," Rio murmured, her voice softer, lower, coaxing Agatha to cross
            that final line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her gaze locked on Rio's, the weight of the moment
            pressing down on her, the choice hanging between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And finally, she let herself give in, her voice barely a whisper. "I came here
            because... I need you."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio licked her lips at that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Need me how?" Rio pressed, her voice smooth, her gaze unrelenting.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, knowing the push was coming but feeling the impact of
            it all the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio couldn't just let things be-couldn't let her stay in the safety of
            ambiguity. She always had to push, to strip Agatha raw.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her gaze, trying to steady herself, but her mind betrayed her, filling
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything she craved: she needed to kiss Rio, to feel her hands on her skin, her
            fingers tracing lines over her body. She needed Rio's mouth, her fingers-everything she had to give,
            every touch, every whisper. She wanted to be undone by her all over again, in every way that
            mattered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But how could she say that?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe she could- at least some of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were there, tangled somewhere in her chest, yet saying them felt
            impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated how Rio did this to her-how easily she could chip away at her confidence,
            leaving her vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frustration and nerves simmered inside her, and Agatha wished she could somehow throw
            Rio off balance for once, to push back, to make her rise to the challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then an idea sparked-a bold, terrifying idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something she'd thought about in vivid, private detail over the past few
            days.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Words she never intended to say it out loud, but it would certainly even the playing
            field, let her take control, make Rio respond to her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her pulse quickened as she leaned forward, her voice coming out a touch softer than
            she intended, betraying her nerves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't get to touch you," she murmured, feeling a blush creep up her
            cheeks even as she held Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Rio's face was unreadable and then-her steady composure slipped
            just slightly as Agatha's words sank in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tension between them felt like a tightrope, and for once, Agatha was the one
            holding the balance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned back in her chair, her gaze flicking over Agatha, her lips curving into a
            slow, uncharacteristically uncertain smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could see her processing, that ever-present confidence wavering just enough to
            give her a flash of something new-a vulnerability, an edge of surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want to touch me?" Rio replied, her voice quieter, her tone still
            challenging but softened by a hint of intrigue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a slow, steadying breath as she leaned forward, inching closer, savoring
            the thrill of finally turning the tables.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You told me you imagined what my fingers would feel like inside you," she
            said, her voice stronger, bolder now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze traced over Rio's face, catching the slight widening of her eyes, the
            flare of her nostrils as she exhaled a slow, measured breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Agatha saw Rio's composure waver, and the satisfaction that surged
            through her was exhilarating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now she understood why Rio played this game-why she pushed, why she teased her. There
            was power in holding someone's desire, of watching them unravel beneath it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emboldened, Agatha pushed further, her gaze unwavering as she met Rio's
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've had days to think about what you said," she continued, letting
            her voice dip lower. "And now...I want to know what it feels like-to be inside you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes darkened as her words landed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel the tension winding between them, taut and electric, and this time,
            she was the one daring Rio to close the distance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio opened her mouth, and Agatha saw it instantly-the moment she was trying to
            wrestle back control. The smirk began to curl at the corner of her lips, her eyes shifting from surprise to
            that familiar, daring gleam.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew exactly what she was about to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ask.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she beat her to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I touch you?" Agatha murmured, her voice soft but unyielding.
            "Will you let me do that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth hung open mid-sentence, her expression frozen in a rare flash of
            surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a heartbeat, she was speechless, and Agatha savored every second, watching Rio
            struggle to respond.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a triumph-Agatha was still playing her game, following Rio's rules, but
            turning it around, using her own rules against her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was addicting .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rush surged through her as she watched Rio's resolve slip, her smirk faltering,
            her control cracking just slightly. She held her breath, taking in every flicker of Rio's expression,
            knowing that for once, she held the upper hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And gods -Rio had two choices now: let Agatha keep it, surrender it to her, or make a
            move to reclaim it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A win-win in Agatha's book.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart pounded, anticipation thrumming through her as she waited to see which it
            would be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze locked onto her, really looking at her, assessing, holding her in that
            focused stare that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine. She took a long pull from her beer, her eyes never
            leaving Agatha's, then set the bottle aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched, feeling the shift in the air, the way everything held its breath as
            Rio finally made her decision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Rio stood and walked around the small table separating them, stopping
            directly in front of her. She looked down, her gaze piercing, unwavering, and then-without a moment's
            hesitation-reached under her shirt and pulled it off in one smooth motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a breath, heart pounding at the boldness of it, at how perfectly,
            confidently Rio claimed the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze drifted down, taking in the sight of Rio in low-slung gray sweatpants and a
            black sports bra, her toned stomach, her collarbones, the curves of her shoulders. Agatha had imagined what
            she looked like under her clothes, had felt those muscles as Rio held her, moved with her-but seeing her
            like this, stripped down, was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as Agatha's eyes mapped every inch of newly exposed skin, Rio held her
            gaze, unflinching, and reached under her sports bra, sliding it up and off with the same easy</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her gaze drawn, almost helplessly, to Rio's bare
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd never really understood men's obsession with breasts, never quite
            grasped the appeal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting here, with Rio in front of her, exposed and so effortlessly confident, she
            finally understood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes traced over Rio's skin, taking in the soft curve, the way her
            collarbones led down to the surprsing fullness of her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal naked form the top up, was an artful kind of beauty, something strong and
            feminine that demanded attention, and Agatha found herself captivated, feeling her pulse quicken in</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt an almost magnetic pull-to touch, but instead she curled her fingers into
            her pants, and then met Rio's gaze-daring her to take it further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smile tugged at the corner of Rio's lips as she noticed Agatha's
            challenge, a hint of satisfaction flickering in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a steady gaze locked onto Agatha's, she hooked her thumbs into the waistband
            of her gray sweatpants, already hanging low on her hips, and slowly, deliberately, dragged them down.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a ragged breath, her pulse hammering as she realized-Rio wasn't
            wearing anything underneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind went blank, and for a moment, she could only stare, taking in the sight of
            Rio standing bare before her, bold and unflinching. Every inch of her was captivating, raw and beautiful in
            a way that felt almost surreal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth went dry, her heart pounding as she struggled to process the sheer
            intensity of the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's confidence was undeniable, almost intoxicating, and as she stood there, a
            small, knowing smile playing on her lips, Agatha felt her own control slipping. She felt vulnerable and
            powerful all at once, entranced by the woman in front of her and by her own longing that didn't know
            what to do with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sudden wave of nervousness washed over her. Rio was calling her out, clear as
            day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You want to touch me? Then touch me , her gaze seemed to say, steady and
            unwavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And fuck -Agatha wanted to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to touch, to taste, to let herself finally give in to everything she'd
            been holding back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But how?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew how , of course, but she didn't know how to do it without trembling,
            without her hands betraying the unsteadiness she felt, without making it look as though this was her first
            time touching another woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha despised being uncertain-or god forbid-bad at anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart raced, anticipation mingling with a sudden vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio just watched her, waiting, and Agatha realized she'd never felt quite so
            exposed and she wasn't even the one naked this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio seemed to make the decision for her, closing the distance in one fluid
            motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched as Rio-this fucking woman-climbed into her lap, knees
            bracketing either side, her weight settling intimately against Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely managed to pull her hands free, instinctively finding Rio's hips,
            her fingers curling the moment they touched her bare, warm skin. She felt the smoothness beneath her palms,
            grounding her, sparking something deep and electric inside her. Rio's gaze stayed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">locked on hers, daring her, steadying her, as if reminding Agatha that she was
            exactly where she wanted her to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a heartbeat, they stayed like that, Agatha's pulse racing, her uncertainty
            dissolving as the reality of the situation pressed against her-quite literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't lost on her that they were in the same position as before, but with the
            roles reversed. Now Agatha was fully clothed, with a naked Rio in her lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She should feel powerful-and in some ways, she did. But that didn't mean she held
            any true power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could see it in the way Rio looked down at her, the steady confidence in her
            gaze. Agatha knew, even now, Rio was still holding all the cards.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naked, exposed, vulnerable-none of it shook her control. Rio wore it
            effortlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, a spark of mischief in her eyes as she reached up, placing
            her hands on Agatha's shoulders and sinking even further into her lap. She raised an eyebrow, a
            silent</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge that was unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You asked for it. Now, here I am, her look seemed to say, daring Agatha to follow
            through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands tightened instinctively on Rio's hips, feeling the smooth
            warmth of her skin beneath her fingers. Every nerve in her body was on edge, every breath laced with</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anticipation, yet she couldn't tear her gaze away from Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That raised brow, the amused tilt of her lips-she was testing her, seeing just how
            far Agatha was willing to go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Swallowing her hesitation, Agatha let her hand slide slowly upward, her fingers
            trailing over Rio's ribs, feeling the slight shiver that followed her touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She noticed, with a thrill, the way Rio's smirk wavered, just barely, as
            Agatha's hand</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">continued its ascent. She bypassed her breast-not quite ready to go there just
            yet-her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers drifting higher, brushing along Rio's collarbone, tracing up her neck,
            until her hand found its place behind Rio's head. With a gentle but unyielding tug, she drew Rio
            forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To her surprise, Rio didn't resist. She didn't make her ask.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She simply leaned in, meeting Agatha halfway, closing the distance with an easy
            confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their lips met, and Agatha felt everything else fade-the tension, the nerves, the
            unspoken power struggle-all of it dissolved in the warmth of Rio's mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their kiss started slowly, unhurried, as if neither of them felt any need to rush.
            Agatha moved carefully, her initial hesitance mingling with a rising confidence. She felt Rio's lips
            soft</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against hers, warm and inviting, but she could sense that Rio wasn't about to
            push-she was letting Agatha take the lead, letting her set the pace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as though Rio had thrown down the gauntlet, daring Agatha to make each choice
            deliberately, intentionally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers tightened slightly in Rio's hair, pulling her closer as she
            deepened the kiss, savoring each delicate press, each slow shift of Rio's mouth against hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was electrifying, every second of it-this freedom to go slow, to let herself fully
            explore, to be the one in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio, for her part, didn't rush her, didn't push forward, didn't try
            to take control-yet at least.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let herself melt into Agatha's touch, responding with quiet, patient
            intensity. Agatha felt Rio's hand slide up her shoulder, resting lightly, a grounding presence that
            added to the quiet heat building between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With each gentle movement, Agatha felt the tension between them unwind, layer by
            layer. She could feel the anticipation simmering below the surface, waiting,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They kissed for several more minutes, a slow burn that neither seemed in any hurry to
            rush.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand rested on Rio's hip, feeling the warmth of her skin beneath her
            fingers, her thumb tracing idle circles as their mouths met and parted in a gentle, unhurried rhythm.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, as if sensing that Agatha was holding back, Rio shifted slightly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without breaking the kiss, she reached down, taking Agatha's hand from her hip
            and guiding it up, higher, until it settled over her breast.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched at the contact, feeling the softness of Rio's breast,
            and the way her nipple pressed against her palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand moved tentatively at first, her fingers tracing along the curves of
            Rio's breast, feeling the warmth beneath her palm. She pressed slightly, experimenting, absorbing every
            subtle reaction, every slight gasp Rio let slip into her mouth. Each movement, each</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">adjustment in her touch, was met with a soft, breathy sound from Rio, encouraging
            Agatha, guiding her without words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't know how long she lost herself like this-exploring, tracing, learning
            the way Rio responded to her touch, the little shifts and sighs that told her she was doing something
            right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the heat inside her began to build, pooling low and insistent, curling tighter
            with each passing second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, unable to resist any longer, Agatha pulled her mouth from Rio's,
            breathing heavily as she looked down, taking in the sight of Rio's bare skin, flushed and
            inviting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one swift, instinctive motion, she wrapped her arms more securely around Rio,
            pressing her close, before lowering her head and kissing her breast.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The softness, the warmth-it was intoxicating, and she let her lips explore, her mouth
            brushing over Rio's skin, tasting, feeling the way Rio's breath hitched and her hands tightened in
            Agatha's hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips found Rio's nipple, her tongue flicking over it as she felt
            Rio's body respond, arching into Agatha's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened at the sound of Rio's voice-low, breathy, completely
            unrestrained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-yes," Rio groaned, her hands weaving into Agatha's hair, holding
            her in place. "Just like that."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words sent a bolt of heat through Agatha, and while she wasn't surprised that
            Rio would be vocal, nothing had quite prepared her for just how incredibly hot it would be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio urged her on, her voice rough and raw, added a new layer to the
            experience, fueling Agatha's confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feeling emboldened, Agatha moved her mouth slowly, deliberately, taking her time as
            her lips and tongue traced across Rio's breast, drawing out each gasp, each moan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every sound from Rio was its own reward, an intoxicating encouragement that left
            Agatha wanting to give her more, to push her further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha continued, she felt Rio's hands tighten in her hair, guiding her with
            the faintest pressure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Rio's voice broke through, soft but unyielding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You can use your teeth... yeah, just like that," she murmured, her voice
            low and rich, her breathing heavy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck- more ," she urged, her body responding instantly as Agatha followed
            her lead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With each direction, each whispered command, Agatha could feel herself learning
            Rio's playbook, discovering exactly what made her shiver, what made her exhale in those soft, breathless
            moans.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands and mouth obeyed, tracing every line, every curve as Rio's
            body moved in rhythm with her, arching, trembling, giving her constant, subtle feedback.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes... that's it," Rio breathed, her voice dropping into something
            almost reverent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio rolled her hips into Agatha and the movement jarred her enough to break her
            focus. Agatha looked up, caught in the intensity of Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she saw took her breath away-Rio's dark eyes watching her with a heat that
            was almost overwhelming, and the sight was so incredibly sexy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fairy lights above cast a soft halo around Rio, creating a stunning contrast
            against the darkness of her eyes. It highlighted every curve, every subtle movement, transforming the moment
            into something ethereal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio looked at her, while sucking on her nipple, was intoxicating, and Agatha
            felt herself drawn deeper into the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"God-you look so fucking good like this," Rio growled, the words vibrating
            through Agatha and hitting her squarely in the chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The roughness of Rio's voice sent a thrill coursing through her, igniting a fire
            of desire that pooled low in her belly. Agatha felt a rush of exhilaration at the compliment, each
            word</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapping around her, pulling her in closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a validation she didn't know she craved, and it fueled her to explore
            further, to give Rio everything she had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could second-guess herself, Agatha slid her hand down Rio's body, her
            eyes never leaving Rio's face. She watched as Rio's breath hitched, her chest rising and falling
            in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anticipation with each inch that Agatha's hand traveled lower, every moment
            stretched between them, taut and electric.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then... Agatha touched her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's reaction was immediate, visceral. Her entire body tensed, a shudder
            rippling through her as she let out a low, throaty moan, her fingers clenching in Agatha's hair. Agatha
            felt a surge of satisfaction at that response, feeling the heat of Rio's desire in a way that was
            tangible, undeniable. She kept her touch gentle but firm, letting her fingers explore, learning every
            sensitive spot, every place that made Rio gasp or tremble.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze remained locked on Rio's face, savoring the way her expression
            shifted, how her eyes fluttered closed, only to reopen and meet Agatha's gaze with a look of pure,
            unguarded need.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was powerful, seeing Rio like this, feeling her react so openly to her
            touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With every small movement, every shift and stroke, Agatha felt her own confidence
            build, fueled by the sounds Rio made, by the way her body responded, arching, pressing closer, silently
            urging Agatha for more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha continued exploring, her fingers moving with a newfound confidence, feeling
            every tremor that ran through Rio's body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Rio's hand joined her own, guiding her lower, pressing her fingers
            exactly where she wanted them. Rio's lips brushed Agatha's ear as she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Inside."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The quiet command, coupled with the firm pressure of Rio's hand over hers, gave
            Agatha the push she needed. She let her fingers slide inside, feeling the heat and tightness that greeted
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a sharp breath as Rio groaned, her body reacting instantly, pressing
            down, taking her fingers deeper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was warm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And-god, it felt so right .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hips rolled, grounding down on her hand, a loud, unabashed moan slipping
            from her lips. She reached up, her hands tangling in Agatha's hair, pulling her into a kiss that was
            wild and searing-messy, all tongues and teeth, groans and gasps swallowed between them as</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved her fingers in sync with the pace Rio set.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha curled her fingers experimentally, feeling the way Rio's body responded, a
            deep, guttural moan escaping Rio as her mouth tore away from Agatha's, breathless and
            unrestrained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-I knew you'd be like this," Rio moaned into Agatha's mouth,
            her voice thick and raw. "Feel this fucking good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each word ignited something primal in Agatha, a heady combination of pride and desire
            that drove her movements further, each stroke and curl of her fingers pulling more gasps, more needy sounds
            from Rio. It was intoxicating, knowing she could unravel Rio like this, and she couldn't get
            enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a delicate rhythm, one that Agatha quickly found herself lost in, letting
            herself be guided by Rio's every reaction, her every whispered breath and trembling gasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved with purpose, her fingers thrusting deeper, harder, each movement
            answered by Rio's hips meeting her hand with an intensity that left her breathless. Rio's voice
            spilled out in between moans, her words low and rough, urging Agatha on, each phrase laced with heat.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, just like that... fuck. Don't stop," she gasped, her hands
            clutching Agatha's shoulders, holding her close. "You feel so fucking good-just... keep
            going."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The encouragement, the way Rio's body moved with her, spurred Agatha past any
            lingering hesitation, her fingers working tirelessly, even as the ache in her hand began to set in. She
            ground her palm against Rio's clit, savoring the way Rio shuddered, her head falling back, lips parted,
            her breath coming out in broken moans.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" God, Agatha ," Rio groaned, her hips bucking harder, her body pressing
            down, desperate,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every motion filled with raw, unrestrained need. Agatha felt the pressure build, felt
            the telltale tension in Rio's body tightening, reaching that edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a final curl of her fingers, angled just right, she felt Rio's entire body
            seize, a strangled moan tearing from her throat as she tumbled over the edge. Agatha watched, captivated, as
            Rio unraveled in her arms, her own breath coming out in shallow pants, fingers still inside as Rio's
            climax washed over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha held Rio, watching her slowly come down, her mind flickered back to
            something Rio had said before-how she'd thought Agatha would like fucking a woman, savoring the power
            that came with guiding someone over the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could still hear those words, spoken with that knowing smirk, that casual
            confidence, as if Rio had seen straight through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha liked power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had known this instinctively. And god, she had been right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something undeniable, something electrifying, about the control she'd
            held, about being the one to unravel Rio, to push her into this state of pure plaesure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watching Rio surrender, feeling her responses, knowing she'd been the one to
            bring her there</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-it was intoxicating, a thrill that coursed through Agatha in waves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers traced gently along Rio's side, her mind still reeling with
            the intensity of the experience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't just want to do it again; she'd craved it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked up at Rio, her own heart still racing, and saw that same gleam of
            satisfaction in her eyes, as if Rio knew exactly what Agatha was thinking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like a drug, Agatha was was addicted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without hesitation, she reached up, grabbing Rio's face and pulling her into a
            kiss that started as something fierce but softened unexpectedly, lingering for a moment before she pulled
            back, her voice a low murmur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can you go again?" she asked, needing more, chasing the feeling, craving
            that rush of power again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words landed with a weight she could feel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's body stilled for a second as she looked at her, studying her, and then,
            like one of the delicate flowers surrounding them, a slow, radiant smile spread across her face, unfurling
            petal by petal until it was in full bloom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart lurched at the sight-because Rio Vidal's smile was so fucking
            beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was in that moment, with Rio naked, in her arms, smiling in a way that was so
            genuine, so unguarded, that Agatha felt something shift inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A quiet, undeniable realization settled over her, warm and unsettling all at once.
            Because this wasn't just attraction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just the thrill of power or control, or the excitement of toeing the
            line without ever fully crossing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was something deeper-something more-curling inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal had somehow reached inside her, and like the plants she nurtured so
            carefully, she'd taken root within Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as Rio's fingers traced gently along her jaw, pulling her in for another
            kiss, Agatha felt that shift deep inside-a realization, a vulnerability she hadn't anticipated.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was in trouble.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maiden, Mother, Crone</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday morning found Agatha at the office, a stack of papers in front of her and a
            headache building as she read through a brief one of the second-year associates had submitted. It was,
            without a doubt, garbage. She scribbled in red ink, her frustration mounting with each line, making a mental
            note that she'd have to seriously reconsider this associate's future here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once she'd finished tearing it apart, she set the brief aside, spinning her chair
            to face the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">window. The city skyline stretched before her, a vast expanse of silver and glass
            that used to offer her a few precious moments to shut off her mind, to breathe and just not think.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now... every time she looked out at it, every time her mind drifted from work,
            like a rubber band, it snapped back to one thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One person.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which wouldn't be a big deal if it were purely sexual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Agatha could limit her thoughts to all just Rio's naked body pressed against
            hers, the way her hands and mouth ignited every nerve, the way Rio had a knack for pushing her past every
            comfort she thought she had, until Agatha found herself surrendering in ways she never imagined.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it were just about the way Rio's voice moaned in her ear, urging her on as
            Agatha touched her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or the way Rio tasted when Agatha finally worked up the courage to go down on her,
            the sounds she made, the way her fingers gripped Agatha's hair, trembling under her touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could handle sexual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it turned her on, leaving her part frustrated, part blissed-out mess, but
            that was fine</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- just that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sexual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People were sexual beings. It was natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What wasn't simple was the way her mind now replayed moments that had nothing to
            do with sex and everything to do with Rio herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kept seeing the color of her eyes, dark and earthy, like rich soil, matching the
            plants surrounding Rio's home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or hearing Rio's voice as she spoke Spanish, her tone lighter, her words flowing
            with an ease that Agatha could listen to all day without understanding a single word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered Rio's laugh- her real laugh -and how it was, to her surprise, her
            favorite sound to come out of her mouth, more than any moan or whispered filth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that damn smile -the one Rio had given her, soft and naked in her lap,
            post-orgasm-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that smile made Agatha's heart stutter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew exactly what it was, even if she refused to fully acknowledge it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was one thing to recognize that she was attracted to a woman. To let herself
            explore that attraction in the privacy of Rio's capable hands, to indulge in the kind of intimacy that
            she always had always felt out of reach for her, reserved for someone else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hell- even embracing this newfound pull toward dominance and submission- especially
            on the submissive end, which she never would have thought herself drawn to-was somehow manageable, almost
            freeing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But developing actual... feelings?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feelings were messy, unpredictable, uncontrollable. They tangled around reason and
            obscured lines.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, she could feel them lurking, a nagging pull that had wrapped itself around
            her, subtle but insistent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rule Number Four: Don't fall in love with me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's final rule echoed in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered the way indignation had flared up when she'd first heard it, a
            mixture of disbelief and defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had laughed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually laughed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of her, Agatha Harkness, falling in love?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had seemed so absurd, so unnecessary-Agatha couldn't imagine herself ever
            doing that. After all, she didn't really believe in it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Love was too messy, too chaotic, too unpredictable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had her life carefully mapped out, every choice measured and weighed. Love simply
            just didn't fit into her life.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only exception was Nicky, whom she loved fiercely, as any good mother would. She
            loved him with the kind of love that would make her step in front of a bus without a second thought, the
            kind of love that overruled logic and self-preservation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd cared, somewhat , for the people she'd been with over her lifetime, but
            the closest she'd ever come to love was with James-and look how that had turned out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No-love wasn't real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or if it was, it existed for everyone except her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that thought-her mother's words echoed in her mind, sharp and relentless,
            clawing at her from the past. Words she hadn't allowed herself to think of in years but that lingered,
            buried deep down inside her where old wounds lingered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Something is wrong with you, Agatha. Inside. From the moment you clawed your
            way out of my body, I knew there was a darkness in you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The venom in her mother's voice still rang in her ears, filled with the kind of
            cruelty that still cut her to the core.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother was to put it plainly- a monster -a religious hypocrite who spat vicious
            words like scripture, yet truly believed she'd secured a seat in heaven for herself by attending</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">church three times a week.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's childhood had been a literal nightmare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the outside, their trailer had been well-kept, surrounded by carefully planted
            flowers, one of the nicest homes in the park. Her mother baked pies everyone adored, was the friendly teller
            at the local market, and, with the nearest ' doctor ' miles away, was regarded as the town healer.
            She knew every home remedy and folk cure and was the person people went to when they were sick or
            hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora Harkness was the town matriarch. Respected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Loving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To everyone but Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thousands of dollars of therapy, and Evanora Harkness still haunted her, like a ghost
            lurking in the shadows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was broken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Incapable of loving anyone but herself-of putting someone else's needs above her
            own. Agatha would always be selfish-cruel-unlovable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is what her mother had said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, here she was, feeling things that skated dangerously close to something that
            felt suspiciously like-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No , she told herself firmly. This wasn't love.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was sex, nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A knock sounded on her door, snapping Agatha out of her thoughts. She turned
            slightly, and of course , it was Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She waved her in and shifted her chair to face her, giving her full attention.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stepped inside, not saying a word, but Agatha had started to understand her body
            language.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could tell- just from the spark in Rio's eyes -that she was excited about
            something.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today, Rio was wearing a light gray tailored pantsuit, complete with a vest and a
            skinny black tie, giving her a vintage edge that somehow looked devastatingly good. She stopped in front of
            Agatha's desk, slipping her hands casually into her pockets, her stance confident, and then, as if to
            seal Agatha's fate, Rio's lips formed that rare, pleased smile- the real one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That familiar curl of anticipation stirred in Agatha's chest because Rio had this
            look for only two reasons: either when she was about to touch Agatha, savoring the thrill of destroying her,
            or when she'd found something substantial on the Vanguard case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I found something. Something big ," Rio announced,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely processed the words. That smile alone had her heart doing a frantic,
            unsteady rhythm in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck, fuck, fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, she scolded herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stop that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her heart beat to its own rhythm, ignoring every command she tried to give it.
            She felt completely out of control, a sensation that only intensified as she saw Rio's expression shift
            slightly, her eyes softening with worry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?" Rio's voice was gentler now, pulling her out of her thoughts.
            "You good?" She asked, her tone dipping, genuinely concerned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That only made Agatha's heart race faster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gritted her teeth, keeping her expression impassive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no way Rio could know what was happening to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hell , Agatha didn't even know what was happening to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she managed, finding her voice. "Tell me what you've
            found."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's worried expression lingered a moment longer, but she shifted back to
            professional, and Agatha felt her heart settle, though not completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me show you," Rio said, nodding back over her shoulder toward the war
            room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a nod, Agatha rose, hoping her face remained unreadable as she fell in step
            behind Rio, forcing herself to refocus on the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as they walked out of her office, she couldn't shake the unsettling feeling
            that her heart had slipped out of her chest and was trailing after Rio like a loyal dog on a leash,
            tugged</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">along by some invisible thread that she couldn't control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a seat in the war room, her gaze sweeping over the space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been nearly a week since she'd last been here, and she was stunned by the
            sheer amount of work Rio had completed in that short time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A second whiteboard now stood next to the first, covered in lines and connections, as
            if tracing a web of hidden links. Stacks of paperwork, tabbed and labeled, covered the table, each pile
            organized with sticky notes marking exactly what they were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the second whiteboard, three faces stared back at her-three men, none of whom she
            recognized.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell had she found?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio walked straight to the board with a glint in her eye, and turned to Agatha,
            diving right in. "Vanguard isn't dirty-the company itself, I mean," she explained. "For
            the most part, it's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clean: the books, the people, everything checks out. But these three?" she
            paused to indicate to the pictures with her hand. "They're your dirt. These are the
            players."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked at the pictures for a moment, before turning back to Rio.
            "Explain."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pointed to the first man's face on the board.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Bad Guy #1:Brandon Vanguard, the grandson of the CEO and founder, William
            Vanguard. He's technically listed as VP, but it's purely a figurehead position. No real
            responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, he's a complete fuck-up-DUI arrests, drugs, barely scraped his way out
            of college. But his name and position alone gives him some authority in the company."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved to the next man.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Bad Guy #2:Harrison Smith. College roommate of none other than," she
            paused before pointing back to the first picture, "Brandon Vanguard."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smirked as she started connecting the dots.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Harrison, unlike Brandon, is actually smart. Comes from a middle-class family,
            no influential connections on his own. He works in logistics, and about five years ago, he was promoted to
            head of the department, thanks to his good buddy Brandon-despite there being far more qualified
            candidates."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Rio pointed to the last man on the board, an older man with a severe
            expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Bad Guy #3: James Hughes. Head of Security at Vanguard. Ex-military, special
            forces. He's been all over the world, breaking up terrorist organizations, operating in covert ops. He
            has</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">an intimate knowledge of how these organizations work, who the players are, and, most
            importantly, he knows the shipping lanes and paths closely monitored by the U.S. government. He knows the
            ports, the ins and outs of every security loophole-and how to get around them."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed as she took in the details, her mind racing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, we have a figurehead with influence, a logistics head with access to
            everything that goes in and out, and a head of security with the knowledge to bypass military and port
            security?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, loving that Agatha was following the bread trail se was leaving.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Exactly. This trio creates the perfect storm. Individually, they're
            scattered, inconspicuous</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">even. But together? They're capable of moving just about anything they want,
            completely off the radar."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing-seeing it, but she had to poke holes. If
            she didn't the defense certainly would.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can you tie them together?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Rio moved to the table, picking up a thick stack of documents bound
            with tabs and sticky notes. She flipped through them until she landed on a page with highlighted sections,
            then held it out to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Take a look at this," Rio said, her tone shifting to something like
            restrained excitement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Financial records. Hughes has a bank account that's linked to a series of
            shell companies- none of them under Vanguard's official control, but all with quiet ties to their
            logistics chain. Harrison Smith authorizes the transactions, and Vanguard's name lends them
            legitimacy."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio then pointed to another document-a shipping manifest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Here. These are shipments with items listed as 'security hardware' and
            'logistics supplies,' on the Meridian Star authorized by Harrison but signed off by Hughes. And
            Brandon? He's got his name on a series of transfers that look suspiciously like payments-probably to
            keep this under the radar."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scanned the documents, her heart pounding as she realized what Rio had
            uncovered. "So, they're funding and moving... something . Under the guise of Vanguard's
            operations." Rio nodded, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Likely weapons. And they've covered their tracks well enough that it only
            shows up in bits and pieces, but when you look at the whole picture..." She gestured to the whiteboards
            and stacks of paperwork.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but feel a rush of admiration for Rio's work. This was
            meticulous, intelligent, and dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whole web of deception that Agatha always knew was there was starting to unravel
            before her eyes, and she knew, with Rio by her side, they might just have the leverage they needed to take
            them down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio-this is really good," Agatha said, nearly speechless. They had a case-
            a real case , with actual evidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled at the compliment, and Agatha ignored the familiar lurch in her chest at
            the sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Rio's expression shifted, the brightness dimming into something serious,
            almost cautious-and Agatha immediately picked up on it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have one more thing," Rio said, her tone darkening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sudden gravity in her voice set Agatha on edge. "Show me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, moving to her laptop. After a few clicks, she turned the screen toward
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A CCTV video filled the display-black and white, nighttime footage of a quiet
            street.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could make out cars parked along the curb, a few passing pedestrians, a couple
            of people walking down the sidewalk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What is this?" she asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is CCTV footage from a convenience store on Brooke Sinclair's
            street," Rio explained. "The police ruled her death a suicide, so they never pulled the footage.
            But the store owner was willing to share it. He liked Brooke. Her house is out of frame, but this is her
            street."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay?" Agatha replied, still unsure where this was going. Rio pointed at a
            car parked on the left side of the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look at that car."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed as she focused on it-a black Cadillac. It didn't seem
            unusual. Brooke was well-paid, and nice cars on her street wouldn't raise suspicion. She shot Rio a
            look, urging her to get on with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pressed a button, shifting to view after view, as time stamps flew by indicating
            different days.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That car-same license plate-was parked on Brooke's street every night for
            four days before her death. Same spot, every time. And it hasn't been back since."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brows knitted together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Suspicious, but random cars on New York streets aren't exactly
            rare."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, acknowledging her point, but then clicked to change the timestamp in the
            corner to the night Brooke died.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Watch the car."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha did, eyes trained on the Cadillac as the seconds ticked by. Nothing happened
            at first, and just as frustration began to creep in, the driver's door opened, and a shadowed figure
            stepped out. The quality was poor, and the figure was a murky silhouette, nearly indiscernible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as they walked down the street, they passed under a streetlight, casting their
            face briefly into clarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused the footage, and Agatha's breath caught.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was James Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had actual evidence that Vanguard's Head of Security was seen on Brooke
            Sinclair's street the night she died.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holy fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She actually did it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't just build a case- she built a case that Agatha could actually
            win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked up at Rio, feeling the shock written all over her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio... this..." she started, her voice barely above a whisper, as if the
            magnitude of what Rio had done was almost too much to believe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's what you needed, right?" Rio replied, stepping forward, her
            confidence radiating in a way that was undeniably magnetic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped just in front of Agatha, her eyes gleaming with pride. "Does this
            mean we can go to trial?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rose from her seat, meeting Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We can go to trial," she echoed, the words seeming to hang in the air
            between them. A smile broke across Rio's face, bright and unguarded, and it was beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha hated the way her heart lurched at the sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rode the high of their breakthrough well into the afternoon. She'd tasked
            Rio with securing affidavits from every source where key pieces of evidence had been gathered, and once she
            had those in hand, she'd be ready to submit the paperwork to the judge. It was on her mind all day, and
            she was almost grateful for the distraction. The thrill of finally taking down her white whale helped temper
            the edges of her unexpected-and still very much unacknowledged-feelings for Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few client meetings took her out of the office, and by the time she returned, the
            workday was nearly over. Knowing Rio, she expected to find the affidavits already finished and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">waiting neatly on her desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she stepped off the elevator, a giddy excitement buzzed within her, the familiar
            rush that always came before a trial. Only this time, it was heightened because this case was poised to be
            the biggest of her career, a game-changer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step into the office, ready to dive into the paperwork, when she stopped
            dead in her tracks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy was standing by her office door, posture stiff, eyes wide with a rare kind of
            anxiousness she thought she'd trained out of him by now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she snapped, feeling an unsettling weight settle in her
            stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There's... a new security officer downstairs-he didn't know,"
            Billy stammered. Agatha blinked, not understanding a word of his cryptic explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speak plainly, pet," she demanded, her patience already thinning. Billy
            swallowed hard, his eyes darting to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your mother," he said, wincing as if he already expected the fallout.
            "Your mother is in your office."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words landed like a punch and Agatha went cold. What?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had cut her mother off completely when Nicky was born.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd made a deliberate choice to keep Evanora Harkness far, far away from her
            life. This especially rang true when Nicky was born. She refused to let her mother's toxicity seep into
            his life the way it had poisoned hers. It was rule number one in the Assistant's Handbook:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora Harkness was never to be in contact with Agatha-not a phone call, not an
            email, and certainly never in the damn building.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she whispered, her voice deadly quiet, every nerve in her body
            coming alive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy flinched, visibly regretting every second of this as he stammered out his words
            at a rapid pace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was making copies, and she... she was just there. I didn't know what to
            do. She refused to leave, and I didn't want to call security and make a scene. I'm
            sorry-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held up a hand, silencing him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't thought of her mother in years. And of course, the day she actually
            gives her a single thought-it was like she somehow summoned her from whatever hell she lived in now to
            Agatha's life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a split second, she considered turning around, walking out the door, and leaving
            her mother sitting there waiting. But then a sharper thought came to her. She had never backed down from a
            fight, and leaving now would mean surrendering her power to that woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she wasn't a child anymore; she wasn't under Evanora's control.
            Evanora Harkness didn't get to hold power over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully, the office was beginning to empty as she made her way down the hall,
            which meant fewer eyes on her-or whatever was about to unfold in her office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother was... unpredictable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was unpredictable, too, but hers was a calculated kind, honed to her
            advantage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora, however, was unpredictable like a spark near gasoline-volatile, with a
            destructive potential.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And based on past experience, Agatha was always the one who got burned worst.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She strode purposefully toward her office, passing the war room, catching a glimpse
            of Rio typing on her laptop. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio's gaze snap up, her eyes locking
            onto Agatha, narrowing as if immediately sensing the tension radiating from her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either Agatha looked as unsettled as she felt, or Rio was getting far too good at
            reading her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha didn't stop. She couldn't because if she did stop, she didn't
            know if she could continue walking again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached her office, taking a deep breath before entering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She caught sight of her mother out of the corner of her eye, seated on the couch like
            she owned the damn place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha refused to acknowledge her presence, not yet. She needed to treat this like a
            client negotiation, like a high-stakes game.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to be sharp, unreadable-she needed to win, for the sake of her soul.
            Moving to her desk, she could feel Evanora's eyes on her, scrutinizing, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat down, finally lifting her gaze to look at her mother, studying the face
            she hadn't seen in over twenty years. The last time had been at her law school graduation, when
            she'd told Evanora she was moving to New York and wasn't coming back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora to put it lightly was pissed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">New York, in her opinion, was a "cesspool of godless heathens," a place
            where only the lost and the damned could thrive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that Agatha thrived here was all Evanora needed to prove that she was right,
            that Agatha was everything she always said she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother looked older, of course, but that severity in her eyes hadn't softened
            a bit. The lines around her mouth had deepened, making her look even more disapproving. She sat primly on
            the couch, her hands folded in her lap, taking in the office like the very air</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">offended her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she said, her voice as cold as ever, drawing out the name with
            that same familiar bite.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met her gaze evenly, refusing to let a single flicker of discomfort
            show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi Mom. What are you doing here?" Her tone was professional,
            indifferent-she hoped impenetrable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was in the city for a church conference. Thought it would be... appropriate
            to stop by and see how my daughter is faring in this den of vice."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice dripped with the kind of sanctimonious condescension Agatha had long ago
            learned to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, as you can see," Agatha replied coolly, gesturing around her with a
            smirk, "I'm faring quite well."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A faint, disapproving smirk tugged at the corner of Evanora's mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you?" she asked, looking around the office, taking in the luxury with
            a raised brow. "Still chasing power and money, I see. Still choosing darkness over light."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, keeping her face impassive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm choosing a career that I've built on my own terms," Agatha
            replied, her voice carefully measured. "I don't think that qualifies as
            'darkness.'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora shook her head slowly, a look of deep disappointment settling on her face.
            The gesture was painfully familiar, a move that Agatha had learned to brace herself against, even as a
            child.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A career," Evanora echoed, drawing out the word with a heavy layer of
            scorn. "And what good is that? Does it soothe the emptiness inside you? Because I can see it, Agatha.
            No matter how much you have, you're still hollow, rotten to the core, just like everything you
            touch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words sliced through Agatha, landing with brutal accuracy, but she bit back a
            response, refusing to let the hurt show. She knew Evanora wanted to see her flinch, to see the words sink in
            and take root.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't going to give her the satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you're here to judge, save your breath," she replied, her tone icy.
            "You'll find that I still don't care about your approval."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora's lips twisted into a smirk, her eyes gleaming with something dark,
            something almost triumphant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, I'm sure you don't," she said, her voice low, dripping with
            cruelty. "But it's not about my approval, is it? It's about the truth. You can pretend all you
            want, but that darkness inside you, that rot? It seeps into everything you touch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the words like a weight settling over her, pressing against old
            insecurities, old doubts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora's gaze was piercing, her expression cold and unyielding, and she held her
            pause deliberately, savoring the tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I worry for that poor boy you're raising," she continued, her voice
            softening, adopting a feigned look of concern that only deepened the cruelty behind her words.
            "Nicholas, isn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother's words landed like a knife to the chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her control slipping, a hot wave of anger and protectiveness rising in
            her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Leave Nicky out of this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Evanora's smirk only grew wider, her satisfaction intensifying as she pressed
            forward. "Oh, I wish I could. But if he came from you... well, rot has a way of spreading."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit Agatha like a punch to the chest, but Evanora wasn't finished.
            Seeing the crack in her daughter's composure, she went for the heart- like she always did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I heard he was sick a few years back," she continued, her tone almost
            mocking, the faintest hint of feigned sympathy twisting her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each word hit Agatha like a lash, dragging up pain she'd buried so deep she
            almost believed it couldn't touch her anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as Evanora's voice twisted into that mocking, feigned sympathy, Agatha felt
            old scars splitting open, raw and bleeding. Her mother's words seeped into her like poison, feeding on
            every doubt and fear she'd worked so hard to silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Cancer, wasn't it?" Evanora's tone dripped with faux concern, and
            Agatha's stomach twisted violently, a familiar sickness creeping up her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fought to keep her composure, but it was like she was a child again, helpless
            under her mother's scrutiny, feeling like a mistake, a failure in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened, and for a moment, she couldn't breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered the sleepless nights by Nicky's bedside, the prayers she'd
            whispered to her mother's all-powerful god, desperate, terrified he wouldn't survive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, hearing Evanora spin that agony into something ugly, something hateful -she
            could feel her heart breaking all over again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me, Agatha," her mother's voice slithered into her thoughts,
            prying at her worst fears, "did it ever occur to you that perhaps God was punishing you through
            him?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, and her vision blurred. The suggestion pierced through
            her, flooding her mind with every terrible thought she'd had, every moment she'd doubted herself,
            every time she'd feared she wasn't good enough for Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Maybe it would have been better if you'd just let that illness take
            him," Evanora whispered, her voice twisting around Agatha like a serpent, squeezing tighter, mocking
            her deepest love, her most fragile place. "While he was still innocent, while he still had a place in
            heaven."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was cruel, beyond anything Agatha could have prepared for, and she felt the old
            wounds of her childhood reopening, the shame, the fear, the awful feeling that maybe her mother had been
            right all along.That she was cursed, destined only to bring ruin to those she loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breaths turned shallow, and she could feel the cracks forming, her
            carefully</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">constructed armor that years of therapy helped her build were now splintering under
            the weight of her mother's words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He still has a chance at salvation, Agatha," Evanora continued, her voice
            softening to a mockery of gentleness, each word deliberately placed to hurt. "A chance to escape this
            life you've built. But you couldn't even let him have that. No, you had to drag him into this sin
            with you, to share in the rot you've let fester."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, eyes narrowing with vicious satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"One day, he'll be just like you. Hollow. Godless. Destined for ruin.
            "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words seared into Agatha's mind, reigniting every terrible thought she'd
            had in the darkest hours of the night. That she'd tainted Nicky, that maybe she was unfit to be his
            mother, that her own brokenness was a curse she'd unknowingly passed on to him. She could feel
            Evanora's gaze, cold and dissecting, peeling away her defenses until she was exposed, vulnerable, the
            child she'd been, desperate for a love that was never given.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was a difference now. Agatha wasn't that child anymore. Her
            mother's cruelty couldn't own her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, and she forced herself to meet Evanora's gaze,
            letting the simmering anger take root, filling the hollow ache her mother's words had left
            behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She released her grip on her hands, feeling the sting of her nails in her palms.
            "Get out," she said, her voice steady, steely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no tremor, no weakness in her tone, even though it raged through her
            body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And don't ever come back."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flicker of irritation crossed Evanora's face, but she masked it quickly, rising
            from her seat with a stiff, disdainful elegance, as if leaving were her choice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She adjusted her coat, casting Agatha one final look of pure scorn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enjoy your hollow little kingdom, Agatha," she sneered, her voice dripping
            with contempt. "It will crumble. And when it does, there will be nothing left of you- or the boy . I am
            done praying for you. Let the devil take you. It is where you belong."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the door closed behind her mother, Agatha felt her heart pounding, each beat like
            a heavy drum in her chest. Old wounds reopened, raw and aching, spilling over with pain she thought
            she'd conquered long ago. A wave of helplessness surged within her, her breaths coming in shallow, shaky
            bursts as her mother's words circled in her mind, taunting her, gnawing at her deepest
            insecurities.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She blinked back tears, her vision blurring with frustration. She was forty-eight
            years old.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Forty-eight , and still, her mother's words could reach inside her and twist,
            leaving her feeling stripped bare, exposed, like a frightened child.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated that her mother still had this power over her. Hated herself for letting it
            happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, her office felt small, suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air felt thick, pressing down on her, and she couldn't bear another moment in
            this room where her mother's presence still lingered. She needed to escape, to get away from the walls
            that felt as though they were closing in on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another thought, she headed for the door, moving quickly, her heels striking
            the floor in hard, purposeful steps.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She barely registered Rio calling her name, her voice edged with concern, but Agatha
            didn't stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't hear anything but her mother's voice, those words echoing in her
            mind, haunting her, pulling her under.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clung to Nicky the moment she got home. He seemed to sense that something was
            off, that she needed this, and he didn't pull away. Instead, he leaned into her, letting her hold</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">him, allowing her to be close in a way she hadn't needed to be since he was
            sick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since she'd walked through the door, a single phrase had been running through her
            mind like a mantra, grounding her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kissed Nicky's forehead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She helped him with his homework, patiently going through each problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She read him Harry Potter , her voice shifting for each character, drawing giggles
            from him when she exaggerated Hagrid's deep gruff tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stayed with him long after he'd fallen asleep, fingers stroking his hair,
            feeling his small, steady breaths beneath her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a long time since she'd stayed the night in his bed. Not since the
            days he'd been sick, when she couldn't bring herself to leave his side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, here she was, curled up in his Buzz Lightyear bed, cramped and uncomfortable,
            yet unwilling to move, unwilling to let him go. The tightness in her chest slowly began to ease, soothed by
            the gentle rise and fall of his breathing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother, she told herself again, her fingers brushing gently over
            Nicky's cheek. And in the quiet of his room, she almost believed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tears spilled down her face, and she quickly wiped them away, careful not to let them
            fall onto him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her phone vibrated in her pocket, the suddenness breaking the silence. She pulled it
            out, blinking back the last of her tears to read the message.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was from Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are you okay?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a breath, feeling the words catch in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She started to type, her fingers moving and typing out instinctively: I'm
            fine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she hesitated before hitting send, staring at the words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They felt hollow, too much like the carefully constructed lie she told the world. She
            wasn't fine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother had left her feeling shattered, vulnerable in a way she despised. Evanora
            had done what she always did-cut her down, left her questioning everything she'd fought to believe in
            herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha deleted the message, her thumb hovering over the screen as she considered what
            to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a long pause, she finally typed, and before she could second-guess it, she hit
            send.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as the message was delivered, the one word carrying a surprising
            vulnerability that Agatha had never really shared with someone before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A moment later, her phone vibrated again. Rio's response was swift, almost as if
            she'd been waiting, and her words made something tighten in Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do you need?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at the screen, her heart pounding as she read the message over and
            over, feeling the weight of the question. It was so simple, yet so open-a lifeline she hadn't
            expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers hovered, hesitant. She wasn't used to being asked this, to having
            someone who genuinely wanted to know. The urge to reply warred with the fear of vulnerability, of letting
            someone see the cracks she worked so hard to keep hidden.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she took a shaky breath and typed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Got any remedies for unresolved childhood trauma and a mother straight from
            hell?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was honest, with just enough bite to mask the rawness beneath. Her phone buzzed
            again, and Rio's reply flashed on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A second later, another message came through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Come open your front door and find out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart skipped. She gently untangled herself from Nicky, quietly padding
            out of his</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room, closing the door softly behind her. She made her way to the front door,
            hesitating just a moment before peeking through the peephole.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sure enough, there she was-Rio, standing outside, arms crossed, her expression
            unreadable. Agatha opened the door, a mix of surprise and relief tightening in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood outside her door, wearing sweatpants and orange faded Texas Longhorn
            hoodie. "What are you doing here?" Agatha asked confused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio looked her, her gaze locking in on Agatha's face, no doubt noticing the red
            eyes and tear stains.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was worried about you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shifted, her voice coming out sharper than she intended. "I'm
            fine."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, you're not." Rio's response was calm, cutting right through
            the façade with a simplicity that left Agatha feeling raw and exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, feeling the words catch in her throat. She didn't know how
            Rio always managed to see her so clearly, to slice through every wall she put up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me in," Rio said, her tone gentle but firm. Agatha's breath
            shook.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her first instinct was to say no, to shut this down, to send Rio away before she let
            herself fall apart any further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My son is home," she whispered, her voice barely above a murmur. "And
            I'm not... I'm not in the mood."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held her gaze, unrelenting, her eyes locked on Agatha. "Let me in
            anyways."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something in Rio's tone, a calm insistence that made Agatha's
            resistance crack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt like more than just a request to step inside her home-it felt like a request
            to step inside Agatha, beyond her walls-to let Rio in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And after a long, hesitant pause filled with want and fears battling within her,
            Agatha stepped aside, allowing Rio to enter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't sure what to expect when Rio stepped into her home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what she certainly didn't expect was for Rio to walk in, kick off her worn
            tennis shoes, and head deeper into the house without a word-as if she already had a plan in mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, ready to demand what the hell Rio thought she was doing, but
            the thought of waking Nicky stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she just followed, her curiosity and frustration growing with each
            step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha trailed Rio down the hallway, passing Nicky's door and continuing to the
            very end of the hall-to Agatha's room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't hesitate for a second. She turned the doorknob and walked right
            in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, staring at her open bedroom door, completely thrown by Rio's
            audacity-the sheer gall of the woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A surge of irritation and disbelief moved her feet faster, ready to confront Rio
            about whatever bold assumption she was acting on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when Agatha stepped into her bedroom, she found it empty. Confused, she looked
            around, her brow furrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then she heard it-the sound of running water.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned her head toward the master bathroom, the door slightly ajar. She stared
            at it, baffled.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell was she doing?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stormed toward the bathroom, her mind set on calling Rio out, on demanding to
            know just what she thought she was doing. But as she stepped through the doorway, the words</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">froze on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was Rio, kneeling in front of the free standing bathtub, her hand testing the
            water. She reached up, grabbed one of the bottles on the shelf, poured a small amount into the water, and
            carefully placed it back where it belonged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Immediately, the scent of lavender filled the air, soothing and familiar. For a
            moment, Agatha could only stand there, watching Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't expected this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even know what to do with this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tested the water once more, making a small adjustment before turning to face her
            fully. She held Agatha's gaze in that steady, grounding way of hers, then extended her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, her feet rooted to the spot, an unspoken tension tightening in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes softened at Agatha's hesitation, and she took a step closer, her
            hand still outstretched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," she said again, her voice gentler this time, "please...
            come here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word please landed with surprising weight, sending a rush of warmth through
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her chest tighten further, the smallest crack forming in her resolve, and
            before she could stop herself, she took a step forward, reaching out and slipping her hand into
            Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pulled her closer, before moving her hand moved up to cup Agatha's cheek, her
            thumb brushing softly against her skin, as if she could wipe away the lingering traces of tears that had
            long since dried. Her touch was so gentle, so full of unspoken understanding, that it made something fragile
            and unguarded stir within Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Rio's hands moved lower, her fingers reaching the top button of
            Agatha's silk blouse. She undid it with the same care, slowly working her way down, each movement
            respectful, unhurried. There was no intent beyond tenderness, no motive beyond offering a moment of
            comfort.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened, not from desire but from the overwhelming unfamiliarity
            of being handled so carefully, as if she were something precious. It felt strange to be stripped bare this
            way, emotionally and physically, without the barriers she so often clung to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, she didn't resist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She allowed Rio to gently peel away the layers, until she stood bare in front of her,
            exposed but somehow not vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha was free of her clothes, Rio held out her hand again, guiding her to the
            edge of the tub. She helped her step into the warm water, steadying her as she sank down, feeling the
            soothing embrace of the lavender-scented bath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave a small, knowing smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I trust you not to drown yourself in there?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha managed a weak chuckle, the unexpected question disarming her enough to
            respond honestly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not suicidal... just sad."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words slipped out, surprising them both, a small truth admitted in the quiet
            safety of the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's face softened, a sadness in her gaze that mirrored Agatha's own, and
            she leaned down, pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha's brow. The tenderness of it left Agatha feeling as if
            she'd been held, if only for a heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good night, Agatha," Rio murmured softly against her skin, straightening
            and preparing to leave.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as Rio pulled back, a hollow feeling surged in Agatha's chest, filling the
            space where Rio's touch had been. She closed her eyes, a sudden panic tightening her throat of being
            left</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">alone, and before she could second-guess herself, her hand shot up from the water,
            fingers closing around Rio's wrist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stopped, looking down at her, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. "Don't
            leave," Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hesitated, her gaze lingering on Agatha's face as if searching for an answer
            she wasn't certain of.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a quiet resolve, she pulled her hand away and reached under her hoodie,
            slipping it off, stripping away her layers one by one. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha, steady and
            unwavering, as she undressed until there was nothing left between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, she moved forward, placing a gentle hand on Agatha's shoulder, a
            gesture for her to shift forward in the water.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha did, her pulse racing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt the warmth of Rio's body as she lowered herself into the bath behind
            her, settling into the water. And then, without hesitation, Rio's arms wrapped around her, pulling her
            back until Agatha was nestled against her, the weight of her hands resting protectively around her
            middle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha sank back into Rio's embrace, a surprising surge of emotion unfurled in
            her chest, warm and unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simple act of being held like this-of being cared for so completely-was
            unlike</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anything she'd allowed herself to experience in a very long time, if ever. She
            had built her life on self-reliance, on walls so carefully constructed that even moments of closeness felt
            foreign, almost forbidden.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But here, with Rio's arms wrapped around her, those walls felt softer, less
            necessary. The warmth of Rio's body, the steady beat of her heart against Agatha's back, and the
            quiet</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weight of her hands resting protectively around her were somehow exactly what she
            needed, even if she hadn't known it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, as soft as a whisper, she felt Rio's lips brush against her shoulder,
            and then her neck. The kisses weren't charged with desire; they were something else
            entirely-gentle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A new wave of tears began to slip down her face, fast and unstoppable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't even sure what she was crying about anymore-the wounds her
            mother's words had reopened, the pain of years of self-imposed isolation, or maybe the overwhelming
            feeling of safety that being held like this brought her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's arms tightened just slightly knowing she was crying, her presence steady
            and unwavering, as if telling Agatha without words that she was safe here, that she didn't have to hold
            everything together on her own.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in her entire life, Agatha let herself believe it.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Summary</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are multiple moments in this chapter that literally had me kicking my feet
            smiling. I hope you guys enjoy those moments as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also I went back and renamed the lawyers of the Salem Seven to be clever. I
            introduced them first in Chapter 4.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have renamed them to: Fox, Ratcliff, Coyotl, Wise, Crow, Orm, and Swarmen. (Fox,
            Rat, Coyote, Owl, Crow, Snake and Bugs)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also I can't stress this enough, I am not a lawyer or work in the law. So I
            don't know if what I am writing is accurate. I took some moments, lines, and dialogue from some of more
            favorite law/cop tv shows and movies to try and mimic what a case at least on the tv looks like. I know
            it's not accurate, but I think it paints a decent picture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, I know I have been cranking out these chapters. I don't know how long I can
            keep pace. I've been really slow at work and have been writing for like 6-8 hours a day lately.
            Eventually I will have to return to reality, and updates may slow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanks for sticking with me. Enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind was back in her bathtub, to the way she'd crumbled in Rio's
            arms. Her tears had fallen from her eyes, and with each drop, she'd felt the weight of years of pain
            begin to surface, like a countdown, ticking toward the inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, finally, she couldn't hold back anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tears had reshaped into deep, wrenching sobs-sounds she barely recognized as her
            own</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-broken and raw, spilling from her mouth no matter how she tried to choke them
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd tried to muffle them, bringing her hand to her mouth as if that could
            somehow contain it all, as if she could silence the flood of sorrow and rage and fear that surged up from
            somewhere deep in her soul.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was no stopping it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sobs-they just kept coming, tearing through her, each one leaving her feeling
            more wrecked, more stripped of the carefully constructed sense of self she had worn for so long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was one thing to break down; she hadn't truly done it in years, not since
            Nicky had been sick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even before that, crying was something she avoided, something she
            despised.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated the feeling of vulnerability it left in its wake, the way it made her feel
            exposed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">raw. It was like ever nerve was exposed-every insecurity she'd buried beneath her
            carefully crafted armor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had always bottled it up, pushing it down because to her, tears meant weakness,
            and weakness was something she could never allow herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even in private.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to break down like that in front of Rio...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could still feel the warmth of Rio's arms around her, steady and grounding
            as she came undone. Rio hadn't flinched, hadn't looked away, hadn't let go. She'd simply
            stayed there, holding Agatha as pain poured out, raw and unchecked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips had brushed softly over her shoulder, her neck, murmuring gentle,
            soothing words into her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've got you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She repeated the words like a mantra, each one sealed with a tender kiss, as if she
            could somehow mend the fractures with nothing more than her voice and touch. Each kiss, each</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">whispered reassurance felt like Rio was trying to fill the cracks in Agatha's
            heart, slowly and carefully, as if piecing her back together with a gentleness Agatha hadn't known she
            craved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio drew Agatha even closer, wrapping her arms around her fully and reaching down to
            take Agatha's hand, cradling it against her own at Agatha's stomach. She held her firmly, grounding
            her as Agatha's chest rose and fell between breaths and broken sobs beneath their intertwined
            hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's okay, baby," she murmured softly into her ear, her voice a steady
            anchor. "I've got you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama-did you hear me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's voice broke through her thoughts, pulling her back to the present.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha startled, her mind snapping out of the memory and focusing forward, on the
            diner booth where Nicky sat across from her, his face etched with concern. He held a forkful of pancake
            halfway to his mouth, syrup dripping onto the table as he looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mindlessly Agatha reached for a napkin, leaning forward to wipe up the sticky mess
            before he set his sleeve in it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry, honey. I was thinking about something at work," she lied
            smoothly, giving him a warm smile she hoped would reassure him, even if it didn't quite reach her eyes.
            "What were you saying?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky studied her for a moment, his brow furrowed in that way he got when he was
            thinking hard about something. Then-only like a child could-the worry eased, and he returned to his food,
            putting the pile of pancakes in his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was just wondering if you were going to the office today?" he asked
            around the mouthful of pancakes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scrunched up her nose in disgust at his manners but thought about his
            question. It was Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually, work was a toss-up depending on what was happening. Should Agatha be at the
            office, prepping for the Vanguard case? Absolutely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But would she be going in, knowing that Rio was likely there also prepping the
            case?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Absolutely not.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of facing her after last night, after breaking down in front of her, felt
            impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she'd thought looking Rio in the eye after sleeping together had been hard,
            this felt like a whole new level of vulnerability she wasn't ready to confront.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She managed a small, reassuring smile, focusing on Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No work today," she said, reaching over to ruffle his hair. "Just
            us."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky beamed at her, syrup smeared on his cheek and chunks of pancake hanging out of
            his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky," she feigned a gag, rolling her eyes dramatically. "Chew your
            food! Goodness -who raised you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He swallowed, his eyes sparkling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Umm... you did," he said, pointing his fork at her, as if presenting solid
            evidence. Agatha put on an exaggerated expression of surprise, holding back a smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did I?" she mused, pretending to think hard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a mischievous glint, she grabbed her fork and reached across the table,
            stealing a giant bite of his pancake and forced it into her mouth. She chewed it dramatically, speaking
            around the mouthful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am certain- I would've taught -you to chew your- food before talking.
            " Nicky erupted into giggles, his face lighting up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama!" he protested, barely able to contain his laughter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she asked, feigning innocence, still chewing obnoxiously. "Do
            I have something in my teeth?" she asked, opening her mouth and showing him the chewed up
            pancake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky squealed with laughter, his giggles filling her heart. Agatha's chest
            swelled at the sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wished she could live in this moment forever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mother's words still haunted her, but they were quieter now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She also knew Monday would come, that she couldn't outrun Rio forever,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But right now, with Nicky's laughter echoing around the diner and his face bright
            with happiness, she let herself sink into the present, holding tightly to this small, perfect moment for as
            long as she could.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rested her chin in her hand, elbow propped on the table, and opened her mouth to
            show Nicky the chewed-up food again. He squealed in delight, covering his face with his hands but still
            peeking through his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a warmth spread through her, watching his pure, unfiltered
            happiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck you, Evanora, she thought, the words settling into her heart like a quiet,
            reassuring truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am a good mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha spent the entire weekend with Nicky, letting him set the agenda. She tagged
            along to every place he wanted to go, soaking up his laughter, his boundless energy and joy. They</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">went to the museum, the park, the zoo. They played board games at home, watched his
            favorite movies, and ate way too much junk food.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn't care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He'd be with his father after school tomorrow, and she wouldn't see him for a
            week. She was determined to fill every moment with his smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On Monday morning, she saw Nicky off to school. He gave her an extra-big hug, his
            little arms squeezing her tightly before he bolted from the car and towards the building.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"See you next week, Mama! Love you!" he called over his shoulder, his voice
            bright. Agatha blew him a kiss, watching until he'd made it safely inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lingered for a moment, feeling that familiar emptiness settle in-the ache that
            always crept in when he was gone. With a sigh, she rolled up her window and leaned back into the leather
            seat, closing her eyes and letting out a deep breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't afford to linger in that feeling. She had to switch gears, to
            focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterall, she had a white whale to harpoon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Opening her eyes, she pressed the intercom button. "To the office,
            Dan."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Ms. Harkness," her driver responded smoothly, and the town car pulled
            away from the curb, heading towards a day that somehow both thrilled her and made her want to throw
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha walked briskly through the office, her heels clicking with purpose. She
            didn't go straight to her office. Instead, she veered left, heading directly to the war room. If she was
            going to reclaim her footing, she needed to do it immediately, on her terms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was already there, as she'd expected, looking over documents pinned to the
            board, a pen tucked behind her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked up as Agatha entered, her expression as calm and unreadable as
            ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No pity, no softness-just Rio being Rio, a touch of cockiness in her gaze but
            otherwise cool, professional.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as if nothing had happened, and Agatha clung to that professionalism Rio was
            extending towards her like a lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you secure those affidavits?" Agatha asked, keeping her tone steady,
            controlled-not letting any of her internal anxieties seep through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, her expression impassive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They're on your desk."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Agatha replied, stepping forward to study the board-needing the
            distraction. Her gaze landing on the photo of Brooke Sinclair at the center of the board.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took in the young woman's face, her features frozen in time, and felt a
            sharp, uncomfortable pang.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke had been so young-just four years younger than Rio was now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That thought had a painful ache echo through her chest, but Agatha forced it aside,
            focusing her thoughts back on Brooke's case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke Sinclair had an entire life ahead of her, stolen without a second
            thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't bring her back, couldn't undo the grief that had swallowed
            her family.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Death was one battle even she couldn't win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she could make those responsible pay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt that familiar, steely resolve settle over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had deep pockets, a reputation built on its wealth and power-and she was
            determined to see every cent of it go toward making sure Brooke's death wouldn't be
            forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt Rio step up beside her, both of them facing the board in shared silence.
            After a few moments, Agatha turned to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You ready?" she asked, her voice steady but, laced with the thrill that
            always came with taking a case to court.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio met her gaze, her expression unwavering. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a nod, Agatha strode over to the door, opening it and calling out into the
            hallway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Billy! Get me a status hearing scheduled with Judge Marks on the Vanguard case.
            ASAP."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as Billy scrambled into action, a sense of satisfaction blooming in her
            chest as the wheels began to turn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to Rio, feeling the familiar rush that always hit when a case was
            about to go live in court. Any lingering anxiety about them had vanished, as the feeling rushed through
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now," she smirked, her eyes gleaming with anticipation, "the real fun
            starts."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curled into a matching grin, her energy mirroring Agatha's.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were on the same page, and Agatha could feel it: they were ready for war.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The town car cruised through the city streets.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat back against the leather, the courthouse growing closer with each passing
            block, her gaze steady but the flicker of excitement sparking inside her. She could feel the shift in
            energy, the familiar rush that always came before a courtroom showdown.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside her, Rio watched her, curiosity evident, her fingers tapping thoughtfully
            against her leg.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So," Rio broke the silence, her voice low but curious, "what's
            the plan?" She leaned in, her eyes sharp but curious, as she stared at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We still need to depose their witnesses, right? Get an idea of their defense
            before we request trial."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned, a slow, predatory smile forming on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That is typically how it's done," she replied, the tone measured,
            almost teasing. Rio's eyes narrowed, sensing something off on Agatha's choice of words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Typically ...meaning?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk deepened, a glint of challenge in her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are very smart, Rio," she said allowing the compliment to leave her
            mouth. Rio deserved that much. "You're a natural at pulling apart documents, at tracing every
            single thread in a web until you find something valuable. Your report writing is impeccable and your
            knowledge of case law is far beyond someone of your age and rank."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, letting her words sink in, her eyes never leaving Rio's before
            reeling the overconfident rookie back to earth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But this job is more than paperwork. It's more than strategy. It's
            showmanship ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the car slowed, Agatha tilted her head toward the courthouse, the large building
            coming into view.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She raised her chin, her gaze drifting to the entryway as if picturing the stage that
            awaited her inside the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she continued, her voice gaining an almost electric intensity that
            mirrored the feeling inside her, "is theater. What separates the good lawyers from the great isn't
            a well-written brief or even a solid cross-examination. It's the ability to control the narrative. To
            own the</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">courtroom. To create a story out of every detail, every witness, every piece of
            evidence. And to do all of that while staying two steps ahead of opposing counsel."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, relishing in the way Rio's eyes were locked on her with an
            intensity. "From the moment you step into that courtroom, you must command it," stressed
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment hung between them, and then slowly Rio's lips curled into a smirk, her
            gaze dancing with amusement, a spark of something that Agatha recognized all too well in her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think I'm pretty good at commanding- as you well know ," she
            murmured back easily. Agatha felt her breath catch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She really couldn't bother to be upset about it. She had literally set Rio up for
            that one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But today, Agatha felt just as emboldened, with the thrill of the case that laid
            ahead coursing through her, feeding her confidence. She met Rio's gaze, allowing a dangerous smile to
            creep onto her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, you are," she said, her tone cool, layered with a hint of playful
            intensity. "But this-this is different."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper, soft and charged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This isn't the bedroom, darling. This is my arena. Here, I am in
            control."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She heard Rio suck in a breath at that, momentarily thrown by Agatha's
            words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha taking advantage of the rare feat, reached up and touched Rio's cheek
            lightly, before leaning in, purposely turning her tone turning low and intimate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Watch mama work, and take notes," she murmured into Rio's ear, before
            pulling back and looking at her and giving Rio's cheek a mocking pat. "There will be a quiz
            afterward."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she felt the car come to a stop, she released her and pulled herself gracefully
            from the car, stepping onto the pavement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heels clicked against the stone steps as she moved toward the courthouse doors.
            She didn't look back, trusting that Rio would follow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat in the chair, tapping her fingers rhythmically on the desk as she waited
            for the judge to arrive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sat beside her on the right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha cast a glance to her left, where two members of the Salem Seven were seated,
            eyes sharp and unreadable as they scanned the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Madeline Fox and Greg Ratcliff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were stationed out of her firm's New York office, both seasoned litigators,
            and Agatha knew well enough not to underestimate them. She didn't need to be conceited to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acknowledge good lawyers when she saw them-these two were skilled, calculated.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox, especially, had a reputation for ruthlessness that Agatha respected, even if she
            didn't like it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox was the real threat here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cunning and meticulous, Fox moved like a predator in the courtroom, dangerous because
            she didn't let ethics cloud her strategy. She would exploit any weakness without hesitation, making her
            both effective and morally bankrupt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ratcliff, on the other hand, was a glorified paper-pusher, but he was annoyingly
            sharp when it came to case law. If there was a loophole, he'd find it. If there was a technicality to
            exploit, the little rat would certainly sniff it out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"All rise," called the clerk, snapping Agatha's attention forward as
            she stood. "The Honorable Judge Harrison Marks presiding."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks entered the courtroom and walked up the steps to the bench, his
            expression as impassive as ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she first filed the lawsuit against Vanguard three years ago, securing Judge
            Marks had been a quiet victory. Like many New York judges, he leaned liberal, but more importantly, he had a
            well-known aversion to favoring billionaire corporations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's record was clear on his stance: while he upheld corporate rights,
            but he also believed corporations should also bear the same moral and legal responsibilities as
            citizens.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His previous rulings, often forced companies to account for their impact on people
            and communities-a philosophy that worked in favor for her on Vanguard case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What didn't work in her favor, however, was Judge Marks - was not of a fan of
            hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The man had a memory like a steel trap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had earned herself ONE contempt of court citation from him eight years ago in
            a particularly contentious case where she may have called a dirty police officer an "racist
            asshole" during questioning, and he hadn't let her forget it since.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Judge Marks settled into his chair, Agatha and the others took their seats. He
            reached for the case file, skimming it with a frown.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This matter is here for a status hearing," he began, flipping through the
            pages. "I was under the impression that this matter was closed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes narrowed at the details.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Am I reading this right? The suit was originally filed in 2021." Agatha
            expected this, and stood.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, your honor," she replied smoothly, "and it's taken us this
            long to get through the discovery process-courtesy of the defense's, let's say," she paused to
            side long a glance at a smirking Fox, " extensive cooperation after you granted our initial
            request."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's gaze flicked up at her, one eyebrow arching skeptically.
            "Three years... for discovery?" he said, skepticism lacing his voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The defense discovery dumped us with over 5 million documents," Agatha
            replied, maintaining her composure. "We particularly enjoyed the 40 years' worth of holiday cards
            they sent along with their documents."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This time, Agatha didn't hesitate to turn and fix Fox with a look, her gaze
            narrowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nothing quite brings a festive spirit to the review process like reminiscing
            about Vanguards yearly cheer," she mocked smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox didn't even blink, but Agatha could see the satisfaction in her own
            reflection. She knew Fox had enjoyed burying her under all that irrelevant nonsense-she could practically
            see the smirk hidden behind Fox's professionally impassive expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks sighed, a long-suffering sound, his gaze flicking between the two lawyers
            with a look that suggested he already knew this status hearing was going to be far from
            straightforward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a moment, he settled his eyes on Agatha, gesturing for her to continue.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a flicker of irritation at being nudged along but kept her expression
            smooth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Our firm has finally completed the exhaustive review of every document
            submitted, and we are- at long last -ready," she said, measured with a certain dramatic she
            couldn't help but use.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she paused, her mind running over the strategy she'd mapped out over the
            weekend</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">with Nicky as they played a few rounds of Catan. The game required a deft hand at
            blocking opponents before they even had the chance to get their footing. And today, she had her own plan to
            throw the defense off balance from the very start.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced at Rio, catching her eye with a quick, confident wink before turning
            back to the judge, her expression sharpening with resolve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We call ready for trial."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt Rio stiffen beside her, and she didn't bother hiding the satisfaction
            that swelled as she watched Judge Marks's eyes widen, the barest flicker of surprise crossing his
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the aisle, Madeline Fox shot up from her chair as if Agatha had pulled the
            lever herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait-what?!" Fox's voice faltered, and the crack in her usual cool
            confidence was music to Agatha's ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox quickly gathered herself, drawing a steady breath as she fixed Agatha with a
            pointed glare before addressing the judge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, we're not ready for trial," she protested, her tone firm
            but just shy of desperate. "We deposed their witnesses three years ago. They have deposed none of
            ours."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox fell right into Agatha's trap, and Agatha relished every second of it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How can you possibly not be ready?" Agatha's tone was dripping with
            incredulity, her eyes locked on Fox. "What have you been doing for the past three years? You
            wouldn't perhaps- I don't know -be sitting on your hands-hoping my firm would just go bankrupt
            trying to get through the mountain of discovery you dumped on us?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox opened her mouth, but Agatha didn't give her the chance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let's stop wasting the court's time, shall we?" Agatha cut in, her
            gaze fixed on Judge Marks, her voice calm but charged with finality. "We call ready for trial, Your
            Honor."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A silence settled over the room, thick and heavy. You could've heard a pin
            drop.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's eyes narrowed as he absorbed her statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is a dangerous game you're playing, Ms. Harkness," he said, his
            tone carrying both warning and intrigue. "You haven't deposed a single one of their
            witnesses."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shrugged, a hint of a smirk on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't need to. I have a pretty good idea what they're all going to
            say," she replied confidently, her voice as unwavering as her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another blanket of silence covered the courtroom for a moment, before Judge Marks
            leaned forward, his gaze locked onto Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just so we're clear, because your reputation does precede you, Ms.
            Harkness, and I will not have my courtroom turned into some kind of reality TV spectacle," he said, his
            voice firm. "Are you truly ready for trial? Right now. Today ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced down at Rio, who was watching her with an expression that bordered on
            awe, barely daring to breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked back up at Judge Marks , her voice steady. "Yes, Your
            Honor."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks leaned back, a mixture of shock and reluctant admiration crossing his
            face. He sat there, weighing her words, before slowly turning his gaze to Fox.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mrs. Fox?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Madeline Fox looked like a fish out of water, her mouth opening and closing as she
            struggled to find her words, before she finally sputtered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is ridiculous," gesturing at Agatha with visible frustration.
            "This is a purely a stunt, Your Honor."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside her, Ratcliff stood, pushing his glasses up his nose with an air of smug
            superiority that made Agatha's hands itch to knock them clean off his face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," he said, his tone oily, "Ms. Harkness is alleging
            negligence against Vanguard, which necessitates further discovery with respect to duty of care."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Duty of care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Trust the little rat to cling to that particular lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ratcliff glanced at Agatha, his smirk practically daring her to try and sidestep the
            technicality.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And naturally, that will take time."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha drummed her fingers on the desk, her mind working furiously. She'd
            anticipated pushback but hadn't expected them to find a parachute so quickly. She felt a quick tug on
            her sleeve, and turned to see Rio looking up at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned down, and as soon as she did, Rio spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We could go after them for conspiracy," she suggested, her tone careful
            but excited. "It's a harder case to prove, and it opens us up to a counter-suit, but if this is the
            road you want to walk, then we need to shift from negligence to conspiracy."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes lit up at the idea, as the thrill of a new tactic settled into her
            bones.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio and her big, beautiful fucking brain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Straightening up, Agatha faced the judge with renewed confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Very well, Your Honor," she said, her voice steady and razor-sharp.
            "Let's forget negligence then. We'll pursue wrongful act and conspiracy."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reaction was immediate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Fox and Ratcliff shot up, their faces flushed with anger as they began talking
            over each other, their voices a mixture of outrage and panic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, this is absurd-" Fox started, her voice shrill.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This wasn't in the original pleadings!" Ratcliff protested, his hands
            waving in disbelief. Judge Marks banged his gavel, silencing the room as he gave them all a hard
            look.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha kept her expression calm, but inside, she savored the chaos. The judge's
            gaze turned to her, pinning her with a steady, scrutinizing look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness, I want to ensure I understood you correctly. You're willing
            to waive your negligence claim against Vanguard?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's correct, Your Honor," she replied confidently. Judge
            Marks's eyebrows rose, clearly taken aback.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That is your strongest case, Ms. Harkness. Not to mention, pursuing conspiracy
            without negligence opens your firm up to a potential litigation suit should you fail."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha drew in a steadying breath, already imagining the look on Jen's face when
            she heard about this decision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I understand, Judge," she replied, her voice unwavering. "We will
            still be pursuing a conspiracy case against Vanguard."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look of shock on Fox and Ratcliff's faces was priceless. Fox's expression
            shifted from surprise to outrage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're really willing to waive the negligence claim?" she demanded,
            disbelief ringing in her voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave a theatrical flourish of her hands, her tone calm and almost amused.
            "I believe I just did."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning her attention back to Judge Marks, she took a moment before speaking, letting
            her words settle over the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The defense says Brooke Sinclair took her own life," she began, her voice
            steady, clear. " They claim the stress of her work caused a decline in her performance, which led to
            disciplinary action and, ultimately, to her alleged suicide."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her tone sharpened as she thought about Brooke, about the injustice to this young
            woman, and how the gaping hole her murder has left in her parent's lives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We say Brooke Sinclair didn't kill herself. We allege that she uncovered
            evidence suggesting Vanguard was illegally shipping weapons overseas. When she reported her findings to her
            supervisor, they disciplined her for the first time in her five-year career. And when she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">refused to back down, they had her killed to cover up their illegal
            acts."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room was thick with tension, Agatha's accusation hanging heavy in the air.
            Fox and Ratcliff sat their faces stoic, not even blinking at her accusation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's gaze stayed on her for a moment longer before he turned to the
            opposing counsel, one brow raised in question-a silent prompt for their response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox and Ratcliff immediately put their heads together, whispering urgently. Agatha
            drummed her fingers on the table, waiting with feigned patience as the seconds dragged into minutes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Judge Marks's expression was turning impatient. "Counsel," he said
            his tone edged with warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox and Ratcliff murmured a few final words before Fox rose to her feet, her gaze
            flicking to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The challenge in her eyes was unmistakable, and Agatha felt a flicker of
            satisfaction. She knew what Fox was going to say even before she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," Fox said, her voice steady, "we also call ready for
            trial."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks leaned back in his chair, momentarily taken aback by the unexpected turn
            of this status hearing. But then he seemed to collect himself, before gesturing to his court clerk.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Call down for a voir dire panel, Beth," he ordered. "Look like we
            have a jury to pick." The weight of his words settled over the room, and Agatha felt a surge of
            victory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was it -the case was officially moving forward, and every inch of her was ready
            to fight like hell.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paced the length of her kitchen, unable to shake the pulse of energy still
            thrumming through her veins.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The car had dropped her off nearly two hours ago, but the thrill of the day was
            alive, buzzing in every nerve of her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd won today. She knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hell, even Fox and Ratcliff knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio- god, the way Rio had looked at her afterward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She definitely knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory flashed through her mind, as vivid as if it were happening again. When
            they'd finally slipped into the privacy of the town car, Rio had looked at her like she was debating
            between pulling Agatha close, pressing her against the leather seats, or getting on her knees right
            there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha would have gladly taken either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always felt this way after a victory-this buzzing, restless energy that demanded
            release.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good sex, the kind that left her wrecked, was the only thing that came close to
            calming her down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd barely kept it together in the car as they pulled up to her building,
            turning to Rio with an uncharacteristic desperation she didn't even bother to hide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come over tonight?" she asked, her voice soft but intense, making sure to
            follow Rio's rules and ask.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes darkened, that unflinching gaze full of unspoken promises as she
            nodded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I need to go home first, get a few things straightened out," she replied,
            her voice rough, low. "But I'll be by as soon as I can."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something about Rio's voice, raw and edged with heat, that shot
            straight through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Agatha had an inkling that the woman had nothing pressing to handle. Knowing
            Rio, she was probably just letting Agatha stew-making her sit while being impossibly turned on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha would take anything Rio offered right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was that desperate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nodded, moving to get out of the car, but Rio's hand wrapped around her arm,
            halting her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do not even think about touching yourself before I get there," Rio warned,
            her voice low and commanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words sent a jolt through Agatha, her heart thudding hard in her chest. She
            hadn't planned on it, but now that Rio had forbidden it, the idea was suddenly, achingly
            tempting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes narrowed, reading the mischief brewing in Agatha's gaze.
            "Agatha," she warned, her tone steely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, slipping out of Rio's grasp with an air of nonchalance.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay-fine!" she said, throwing her hands up in mock surrender, sounding
            almost like a petulant teenager being told they couldn't go to a party. "No pre-game before the
            game. Vibe killer. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">True to her word, she didn't touch herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she was now on her third glass of bourbon and had hit her 10,000-step goal
            just pacing her apartment like a caged tiger. Every time she glanced at her phone seeing the clock</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- of valuable time being wasted -her anticipation flared hotter, her patience wearing
            thin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally-a knock at the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she scramble embarrassingly fast to answer it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she pause outside the door to take a couple of steadying breaths so it
            wouldn't look like she'd just sprinted across the room?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, yes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once composed, Agatha swung open the door and took in the sight of Rio. She was
            wearing dark jeans and a sleek black jacket, her casual look somehow only heightening the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anticipation building in Agatha. But then her eyes narrowed as she noticed something
            unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She raised an eyebrow, her voice laced with mockery as she crossed her arms and
            stared at Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why are you wearing a backpack? What are you, twelve?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyebrow arched at the question, and that familiar, predatory smirk spread
            across her face, making Agatha's confidence waver ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was beginning to recognize what that look meant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell did Rio Vidal have planned for her tonight?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was hoping to get to the steamy part in this chapter, but I already hit 5,000+
            words by the end, and I really want to do the next sexy scene justice and not rush it ;)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peep the newest tags for what to expect in the next chapter ????</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Primal Night</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Summary</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The world is falling a part, so here is my little attempt at trying to provide
            something to make the day better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat on her bed, nursing her drink, her eyes fixed on Rio standing in front of
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a certain dramatic flair to Rio tonight, a kind of quiet performance that
            felt both irritating and magnetic. Agatha couldn't help but wonder if her little speech from the town
            car -about commanding the "theater" of a courtroom, about wielding power through</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">presence-had somehow inspired Rio to lean into her power even more, to become bolder,
            a little spicier than usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As always, Rio had entered Agatha's home like she owned it, gliding through the
            doorway and making her way straight to the bedroom without a word. Agatha followed because she knew if she
            didn't, Rio would just stand there waiting for her anyways.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she entered the room, Rio's expression was unreadable, but the raised
            eyebrow and subtle tilt of her head said it all: Go sit down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had rolled her eyes but complied, making her way to the bed, sinking down with
            her drink, her patience already wearing thin. She sat there, drink in hand, watching Rio's every
            movement, the restless energy in her making it impossible to stay silent for more than twenty
            seconds.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an exaggerated sigh, Agatha flicked her hand sharply, signaling her silent
            command:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well? Get on with it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't the least bit surprised when Rio didn't budge, didn't even
            blink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She simply stood there, gaze unwavering, meeting Agatha's impatience with steady
            calm. The silence stretched, lingering until Agatha realized the play, Rio was making it painfully clear
            -Agatha wasn't in charge anymore, and would not be dictating when they started.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pressed together, frustration simmering beneath the surface. She
            busied herself with her drink, taking a slow sip as if the act itself could distract her from the tension
            Rio was creating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it , but she knew- unfortunately -that this was the game she'd agreed
            to play with Rio, and tonight, she was on Rio's terms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rio moved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slipped the black backpack off her shoulder, and with a calculated toss, let it
            sail through the air and fall onto Agatha's bed, landing beside her with a heavy thud that seemed to
            echo through the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze dropped to the bag, the weight of whatever Rio had brought settling
            heavily beside her-not just in its contents, but the energy of the moment she was creating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked up, meeting Rio's gaze, feeling her own curiosity twist with a hint
            of challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio's face betrayed nothing-there was however, a dark satisfaction in her
            eyes, almost smug, as though she was savoring the fact that Agatha was out of the loop, missing something
            important.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell was in this bag?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a split second, Agatha wondered if she was missing some secret signal, some
            unspoken code.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, after what felt like an eternity of silence, Rio gave a small nod toward the
            bag, her eyes never leaving Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Open it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were calm, almost too casual, but they landed with the weight of a
            challenge that hung heavy in the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced down at the bag, then back up at Rio, hating the thrill that shot
            through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel the deliberate drama Rio was weaving around her, each second ticking
            by with excruciating slowness. Curiosity clawed at her resolve, gnawing away until she couldn't help
            herself. She reached out, grabbing the bag, feeling its weight in her hands-not heavy, but something
            .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, she slid the zipper open, the sound slicing through the silence as she peeled
            back the fabric and peered inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart lurched as she realized what she was looking at, and then both a dark
            thrill laced disbelief moved through her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked up at Rio, who was watching her intently, those dark eyes fixed on her
            like a predator waiting to savor every flicker of reaction crossing Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, her fingers lingering on the bag before she set it aside, leaving
            it open. She took a slow, sip of her drink, trying to gather her scattered thoughts, steady her pulse, and
            find the right words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What did one even say to that ?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she arched an eyebrow, her voice not as steady as she would have liked but
            made sure to lace with extra dry humor to mask it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Isn't that a bit... redundant?" she said, gesturing dismissively
            toward the bag. "If I wanted</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that , wouldn't I just... fuck a man?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, one brow arching as she met Agatha's challenge with a
            maddeningly calm expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You like penetration, Agatha," she replied, her tone dry and factual as if
            she were citing case law that was built on rock solid precedence. In this case, the precedence, being the
            sheer amount of times Agatha has cum while Rio's fingers were buried inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her skin flush at that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Most women do," she shot back, finishing her drink and realizing too late
            that her glass was empty. She stared at it, as if sheer willpower might summon more, because god, she was
            going to need half a bottle to get through this damn night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So... what's to say you won't enjoy this too?" Rio asked, her
            voice low, her gaze flickering to the bag and then back to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips curled into a wicked smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can you imagine it? Feeling me inside you like that , while I still have both
            hands free... nothing holding me back?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words, spoken with Rio's signature confidence, sent an involuntary shiver
            down Agatha's spine. Her mouth went dry, and her defiance wavered under Rio's steady gaze. She
            wanted to roll her eyes, to snap out a dismissive retort-but her mind betrayed her, already filling with
            images of exactly what Rio was describing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words wouldn't come.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat was tight, her breath caught. This wasn't what she'd
            expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was still getting used to normal lesbian sex-with Rio's finger and mouth
            sending her over the edge, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This felt like a leap into something deeper, more consuming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could certainly feel herself drawn toward it, and yet the vulnerability-of
            allowing Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that much control over her-caused an uncomfortable pull in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio seemed to read the turmoil on her face, as if Agatha's thoughts were
            projected for her to see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The smirk faded, her expression softening as she stepped forward. The intensity in
            her eyes remained, but it was gentled, like she was setting aside her predatory edge for something more
            sincere.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Remember-you hold all the cards here, Agatha," Rio murmured, her voice
            warm and reassuring as she closed the distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached out, taking the empty glass from Agatha's hand and setting it
            carefully on the nightstand, never once breaking eye contact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she turned back, she cupped Agatha's cheek with a tenderness that stole the
            breath from Agatha's lungs, her thumb gently stroking her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I will never- ever -do anything to you that you don't want," she said
            softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Say the word, and the bag goes away."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced down at the bag, the contents still an undeniable presence between
            them. She swallowed hard, images of what she'd seen inside flickering in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It just seems...like a lot," she muttered, cringing slightly at how
            hesitant her voice sounded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated sounding vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's above average," Rio replied smoothly, without missing a
            beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took Agatha a second to register Rio's words, and when she did, a snort
            escaped her-an unexpected laugh breaking through her tension. She could feel the knot in her chest loosen,
            just a little .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't help the smile that crept onto her face, as she swatted playfully at
            Rio's hip. "I didn't mean the size, you asshole ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into that smile- the real one -and Agatha's heart was
            hammering for a very different reason now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without breaking eye contact, Rio reached down, hooking her finger gently under
            Agatha's chin, tilting her face up to meet her gaze. Dark eyes searched hers, steady and calm, a
            softness in them that sent a wave of warmth through Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would it be easier for you," Rio murmured, her voice soft, "if you
            were the one wearing it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes widened, new images flooding her mind, and the suggestion caught
            her completely off guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus-this woman was truly trying to kill her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mouth opened, but the words didn't come immediately, lingering as she
            grappled with her own surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she managed, "You'd honestly let me do that to you?" she
            asked, her tone dripping with skepticism.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to test Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To call out what had to be a bluff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then that smile reappeared, that confident- real -knowing smile, and Rio's
            fingers traced a light path along Agatha's jaw, sending a shiver down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Oh, Agatha ," Rio murmured, voice soft and low, like a promise.
            "There is very little I wouldn't let you do to me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened, Rio's words wrapping around her, sinking into her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio looked at her, like she'd hand over her control to Agatha without
            hesitation, sent both thrill and disbelief coursing through her. Agatha swallowed, trying to keep her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">composure, but the weight of Rio's gaze made it nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel Rio's fingers still gently tracing her jaw, grounding her, and yet
            making her feel like she was teetering on the edge of something unfamiliar and thrilling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath came a little faster, the last shreds of her defiance slipping as she felt
            herself leaning into Rio's touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're serious about this," Agatha finally managed, voice barely
            steady. Rio gave her a look, that subtle smirk coming back.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have you ever known me not to be serious when we're like this?" Rio
            murmured, leaning in close, her voice a low, intimate rasp, lips hovering just a breath away from
            Agatha's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you want to be control, Agatha..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were a challenge and a promise, slipping into Agatha's skin like
            heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then you can be in control."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back slowly, meeting Agatha's gaze head-on, her eyes daring,
            intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is that what you want?" she asked, her voice dropping even lower, a velvet
            softness that seemed to coil right around Agatha's heart- squeezing .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart beat faster, as if both fighting against Rio's hold on and
            responding to the question that hung in the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Rio, she wouldn't have hesitated, wouldn't have even considered
            another option. Control was her armor, her currency, her way of keeping the world and everyone in it exactly
            where she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, she hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio watched her intently, her gaze unwavering- waiting .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel that familiar thrill bubbling up, the one Rio always seemed to draw
            out of her, making her question the rules she'd lived by, the rules she'd made to protect
            herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Control had always been her safe place-the one thing she could rely on, the thing she
            trusted above all else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, now as she actually thought about it-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart tightened, a startling realization settling over her like a revelation she
            wasn't prepared for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had suddenly become a safe place for Agatha too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, feeling the weight of her decision settle over her, heavy and
            thrilling all at once. She looked up, her voice steady but low.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's nostrils flared slightly as she exhaled, her eyes darkening with a new kind
            of understanding. She knew exactly what Agatha's answer meant-the trust-the power she was offering
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Rio said softly, her voice low and steady. "Do you want me to
            get rid of the bag?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes dropped to the backpack- of what was inside it , and a wave of heat
            surged through her, this time flooding every nerve, pooling low in her abdomen. Her pulse quickened, and
            with another steady breath, she let go of the last thread of caution.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held Agatha's gaze for a long, silent moment, as if giving her the chance to
            change her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when Agatha stayed silent, that feral smirk began to spread across Rio's
            lips, her eyes darkening with a gleam that made Agatha's breath catch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she murmured, reaching up and touching Agatha's cheek with a
            gentleness that was a complete contradiction to her predatory look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swiped her thump a couple times across Agatha's cheek, before taking a
            single, measured step back. She folded her arms across her body and tilted her head as she looked at
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Open the bag," she said, her voice low and steady-each word deliberate.
            "And take it out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, her pulse quickening, but she rose to the challenge, her fingers
            steady as she reached for the bag. She reached through the opening, her fingertips brushing against a smooth
            strap. She curled her fingers around it, lifting it from the bag, feeling the weight settle into her hand as
            she pulled it free.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha lifted it from the bag, the strap-on caught the soft glow of the bedroom
            light,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">revealing every detail. A set of sturdy black leather straps with metal buckles
            glinting faintly under the light. Centered in a steel ring sat a sleek, black silicone dildo slightly
            curved,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">attached securely to the harness. Agatha wasn't a prude.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd used sex toys before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterall, she had a perfectly reliable one in her nightstand right now. But this-
            holding it in her hand , feeling the weight of it, was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As her fingers wrapped around it, and she took in its size, noting the thickness and
            length. She raised her eyes, arching a brow at Rio, and narrowed her eyes into a glare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Above average , my ass," she snarked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, completely unbothered, her eyes shining with amusement.
            "Why?" she drawled, raising a brow in challenge. "Worried you can't take it?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flush crept up Agatha's neck, her grip tightening slightly around the
            toy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you want me to throw this at you?" she shot back, voice dripping with
            sarcasm but also a legitimate threat. "Because it feels like you want me to throw it at
            you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's grin only widened, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shook her head slightly, looking down at the harness in her hand, examining
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weight of it. She could understand the appeal-at least for herself. But something
            still nagged at her. She glanced back up, curiosity overcoming her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why do you even want to do this?" she asked, her tone genuine.
            "It's not like you actually... feel anything from this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, her smile turning thoughtful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't feel anything when I'm inside you with my fingers, either, but
            that doesn't stop me from wanting to do it... over and over again ," she said softly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't fault the logic there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a fluid confidence, Rio stepped forward and took the harness from
            Agatha's hands, her movements so sure assured, it was clear she was familiar with the toy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That realization stirred something in Agatha-a flicker of jealousy, a wondering about
            the other women who might have been here before her, who have been in the exact position.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before Agatha could even process it, Rio took her hand, guiding her fingers to
            the back of the harness where the base of the dildo connected. She pressed Agatha's fingers to a small,
            textured ridge there, her touch steady, intentional.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You feel that?" Rio asked, her voice low.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When I'm wearing it, this part lines up just right," Rio murmured, her
            gaze locking onto Agatha's, her voice thick with promise. "So that I feel it too."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh," Agatha murmured, understanding dawning in her eyes. It made more
            sense now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed, feeling the weight of the it all settle around her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio placed the harness back in Agatha's hand, a quiet, deliberate move that left
            no doubt: the power, the choice, was quite literally in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel the quiet intensity of Rio's gaze, waiting, unyielding, giving
            her all the space to decide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha finally looked up, Rio's voice was soft but steady, direct as
            ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you say, Agatha?" Her voice dropped, her words a whisper that
            seemed to curl through the room. "Will you let me wear this and fuck you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bluntness, the unwavering confidence in Rio's tone, struck Agatha hard. By
            now, she should have been used to Rio's directness, but somehow, it still took her breath away, cutting
            through every last defense she thought she had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse hammered as she held Rio's gaze, and after a beat, she found
            her voice. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word was barely out before Rio's mouth claimed hers in a fierce, consuming
            kiss, giving no space for doubt or hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands moved instinctively to Rio's shoulders, fingers digging in as
            she pulled her closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They tumbled back onto the bed, Rio settling on top of her, the strap momentarily
            pressing between them. But as Rio's tongue swept into Agatha's mouth, Rio reached between them,
            grabbing the harness and tossing it aside, fully pressing her body into Agatha's, chest to chest</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-heat to heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their mouths collided again, and Agatha's mind spun as Rio's hands tangled in
            her hair, tugging just the way Agatha loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio practically devoured her-biting, licking, leaving Agatha breathless and wanting
            more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely had time to process the intensity of the kiss before Rio pulled back,
            hovering just inches above, lips wet, breaths heavy, her dark eyes practically black with desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, and without a second's pause, ducked down, her mouth attacking
            Agatha's neck, trailing heated kisses and bites, her lips finding that one sensitive spot that made
            Agatha's breath hitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes slammed shut, and moaned, the sound vibrating in the space between
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somewhere in the whirlwind, her shirt and bra had vanished, and in the next blur of
            movement, Rio shed her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their bare skin was pressed together, and the heat radiating from Rio's body as
            their chests met was like fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers found Rio's back, digging into the firm muscles, feeling
            them flex under her touch as Rio worked her over, mouth and hands relentless, winding Agatha tighter and
            tighter until every nerve was raw and exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was in that moment, Agatha knew-she'd never get used to this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The feel of Rio's skin against hers, the way Rio knew exactly how to unravel her,
            leaving her feeling helpless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth moved lower, her lips and teeth working over Agatha's breasts
            with an intensity that left her gasping, every bite, every lingering kiss drawing Agatha deeper and deeper
            into the haze of need.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands fisted in the sheets as Rio continued, leaving her skin marked and
            tingling, leaving a roadmap down Agatha's body where her mouth had been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she felt Rio's hands slip to her hips, fingers hooking into the waistband of
            her pants.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On instinct, Agatha lifted her hips, surrendering fully as Rio dragged her pants and
            underwear down in one smooth motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cool wave of air washed over her, her skin erupting in goosebumps as she lay there
            completely bare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a moment-one of complete silence-and Agatha looked up, her breath catching
            at what she saw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes roamed over her naked body, taking her in with a hunger that was
            almost palpable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shivered, her skin alive, hyper-aware of every inch that Rio's gaze
            touched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was in that moment, Agatha became acutely aware of the precision of how Rio's
            mind worked. The way Rio could remember every detail with crystal clarity, even years later.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, as Rio's eyes roamed over her, Agatha couldn't shake the thought
            that Rio was purposely committing every freckle, every scar, every inch of her to memory, imprinting her
            completely onto that beautiful brain of hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it wasn't just a look, either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the way Rio looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stared at Agatha with an intensity that was almost reverent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, the weight of Rio's gaze making her feel utterly
            bare, not just in her body but in her soul.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just then, Rio's eyes snapped up to meet hers, locking them in place, and in that
            split second, something flickered across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something Agatha hadn't seen before-a softness, an unguarded tenderness
            that looked an awful lot like...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then in a blink of an eye it was gone, as Rio moved, almost diving between
            Agatha's legs with a determination that left no room for Agatha to process that look any further.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mouth found its mark, landing exactly where Agatha needed her most, and the moan
            that tore from Agatha's lips was primal, raw, her body arching off the bed as Rio's mouth worked her
            over with an intensity that bordered on worship.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually, Rio made her wait-made her beg, teased her until she was right on the edge,
            but tonight was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tonight, Rio was relentless, her tongue working over Agatha with expert precision
            that showed no sign of stopping.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, just as Agatha thought she couldn't take any more, she felt Rio's
            fingers slip inside her, filling her and then a second later already working inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands snapped down to Rio's hair, and her legs wrapped around her,
            heels pressing in Rio back, pulling her closer as she practically screamed at the sheer intensity.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't pause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't ease up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those unrelenting fingers curled just right inside Agatha and her tongue flicked over
            her clit with perfect precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the combination sent Agatha spiraling over the edge, her release hitting her like
            a fucking car crash.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Fuck! " Agatha groaned, her voice ragged, thighs trembling around
            Rio's head as waves of pleasure bombarded her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hands tightened in Rio's hair to the point it had to be painful, but Agatha
            was barely aware, as every nerve ending in her body felt like it was on fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, after what felt like an eternity of toe-curling, breath-stealing orgasm, Rio
            pulled away, leaving Agatha sagged and limp against the mattress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breaths came fast and uneven, her head spinning as she tried to make sense of the
            overwhelming sensations still coursing through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had never come so quickly or so hard in her life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It left her feeling like she couldn't catch her breath, her body still trembling
            as the aftershocks rippled through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shut her eyes, focusing on grounding herself, trying to steady her pulse as
            her heart beat frantically in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was dimly aware of movement at the foot of the bed, feeling the mattress dipping
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">releasing as Rio shifted, but the intensity of her orgasm had left her so
            overstimulated that she could barely process what was happening to her own body, let alone what was
            happening</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">around her in the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After what felt like minutes but was probably only a few seconds, Agatha finally
            began to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">regain control over her body. Her senses slowly returned, sharper now-and she picked
            up on a faint sound that tugged at her attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A light metallic clink, then the unmistakable pop of a lid opening, followed by the
            quiet squirt of liquid.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her curiosity snapped her out of her haze. Agatha lifted herself onto her elbows, her
            gaze tracking to the source of the sound and-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Holy hell.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had barely reclaimed her breath, and now it was stolen from her all over
            again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd imagined the strap-on might look ridiculous on Rio, a part of her
            half-expecting to laugh the first time she saw it, because, well-it was a rubber cock strapped to her
            body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Need she say more?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, as Agatha laid there, watching as Rio stood at the foot of the bed, leather
            buckles secured around her hips, the dildo standing at attention, what should have looked absurd instead
            looked-hot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really fucking hot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth went dry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to make it worse- or better , she wasn't sure- Rio was fucking stroking it ,
            coating it in what looked like lube, and the sight, the sheer confidence and intensity of Rio's
            hand</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">working the lube into the silicone, ignited something deep in Agatha's core. Rio
            froze mid-stroke, her hand stilling as if she could feel Agatha's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, she looked up, meeting Agatha's eyes, her head tilting slightly, a smirk
            ghosting over her lips as her dark eyes locked onto Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only deepened as she turned fully toward Agatha, moving with a
            steady, predatory grace. She climbed onto the bed, her movements fluid, calculated, as the mattress dipping
            beneath her weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes couldn't help but zero in on the way the strap-on swayed
            between Rio's legs, with each shift of her hips, and the sight sent another ripple of heat through her,
            making her body ache, clenching around nothing but anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moved with a slowness, crawling up Agatha's body, her gaze never leaving
            Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face. The air between them was thick, almost humming, and Agatha could feel every
            inch of space Rio claimed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Rio settled between Agatha's legs, her weight resting just enough to
            tease, their bodies barely touching but close enough for Agatha to feel the firm press of the silicone
            against her inner thigh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anticipation was electric, Rio's body hovering just above her, radiating heat
            and power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Rio took Agatha's hand and guided it down, wrapping her fingers around it.
            Their eyes held, and in that shared look, Agatha understood exactly what Rio wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha inhaled a shaky breath, her pulse quickening as she took control, aligning Rio
            with herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, she moved, guiding Rio forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anticipation thrummed between them, a tension that snapped the second they
            connected</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-as she felt Rio press into her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her hand snapping up and gripping Rio's arm.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stretch was intense, a mix of pleasure and pressure that had Agatha gasping, her
            fingers tightening on Rio's arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's thumb traced over Agatha's jaw, her expression fierce yet soft, a
            contrast that made Agatha's heart stutter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel the control in Rio's body the way she slowly eased into her,
            eyes tracing over Agatha's face as if watching for any hint of discomfort, any flicker of
            hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't painful, not at all-Rio had made sure of that, with the lube and the
            way she'd already pushed her over the edge, almost as if priming her for this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this... this was fucking intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fullness that was almost too much, and it sent shocks of sensation through
            her with each inch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt Rio's hand slipped from her chin, and move down to her neck, the touch
            light. "You look good like this," Rio murmured, her voice dark and rough, each word coiling</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">tension through Agatha's body, making her pulse race and clench around the length
            stretching</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">her more and more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath stuttered as Rio pressed deeper, her movements slow, as though
            savoring every second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She squeezed her eyes shut, overwhelmed by the intensity, by the way Rio was filling
            her so completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Like what?" she managed, her voice barely above a whisper, almost
            desperate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moved again, each inch deliberate, until she was fully inside her, hips flush
            against Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then hand moved around Agatha's neck, fingers pressing on each side firm-
            possessive</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That had Agatha's eyes flying open, meeting Rio's gaze pinning her in
            place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intensity in Rio's eyes left no room for escape-no space for anything but the
            raw, consuming moment hanging between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Like you're mine," Rio growled, her voice a deep, possessive
            rumble-and before Agatha could even process the words, Rio rolled her hips back, thrusted deeply, forcing
            the air from Agatha's lungs, as raw, breathless moan reverberated from Agatha's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth descended then, swallowing every sound, every gasp, each roll of her
            hips radiating a single intent-to claim Agatha completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Body and soul .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had no idea how long they'd been at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything blurred together-Rio pinning her to the bed, twisting her into every
            position imaginable, tearing one orgasm after another from her until she was nothing more than a breathless,
            trembling heap in the middle of her bed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio wasn't faring much better, which gave Agatha a flicker of
            satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew every time Rio came, the way Rio would moan, hiss and growl, as she thrust
            into Agatha at just the right angle-providing that grind in just the right way that sent her over the
            edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, they lay tangled together, both struggling to catch their breath, bodies
            drenched in a sheen of sweat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the thought moving felt impossible, let alone of going another round.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was sprawled on her stomach, her cheek pressed into the mattress, barely able
            to keep her eyes open, when she heard movement behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soft rustle of straps being undone, followed by the dull thud of silicone hitting
            the floor. "Just give me a minute for my legs to start working, and I'll leave," Rio's
            voice came, low</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and rough with exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha managed a grunt in response, summoning what little strength she had left to
            turn her head and look at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was wasted effort it seemed, as her was vision blurred by the mess of her own hair
            and she cursed under her breath, too drained to even reach up and brush it aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, she felt Rio's hands on her, carefully pushing the hair away from her
            face, clearing her view bit by bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room came back into focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As did Rio, who was staring at her with a tenderness that was starting to be less and
            less a surprising as she smoothed her hair back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can't have you suffocating under there," Rio teased, laying on her
            side, facing Agatha. "My DNA is all over this bed."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a dry look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's flashed her a tired grin, as her fingers lingered brushing a stray lock
            back behind Agatha's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't pull her hand away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, her gaze stayed on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha caught it again- that look -but this time, Rio didn't blink away. It
            lingered, as if Rio wasn't even aware she was doing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was hard to describe the way Rio was looking at her. No one had ever really looked
            at her like this before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like she was someone worth seeing-all the way through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever that look was, it reached somewhere deep inside Agatha, a place she
            hadn't realized was untouched, unguarded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This look on Rio's face-it did something to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something she couldn't quite name, but felt all the same, a warmth spreading
            through her chest that softened edges she thought she'd hardened for good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to stop this, because Agatha couldn't allow herself to get used to
            that look. They both knew what this was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she did what she always did-she deflected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How many gold stars did that performance get me?" she asked, her voice
            dripping with sarcasm, snapping Rio out of whatever had taken over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, her hand snapping back, that look vanishing as if she'd realized
            what Agatha was doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A tired, wicked smile replaced it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"At least a couple," she replied, falling back into the game.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A couple?" Agatha huffed, feigning outrage as she glared up at her without
            a hint of real heat. "That last position alone should've been worth at least three. I'll be
            feeling that in my</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">back for days."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio arched an eyebrow, a tired smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If your back's the only thing sore, then I clearly didn't do what I set
            out to do tonight," she teased, her voice still holding a rough, playful edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a exhausted laugh, the sound rolling out, husky and low. That ache she
            felt was definitely going to follow her for a couple of days. Rio didn't need to know that
            though.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Closing her eyes to avoid Rio's gaze, she exhaled deeply, letting the exhaustion
            settle over</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">her like a warm, heavy blanket.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room fell into a thick, comforting quiet, and Agatha let herself sink deeper into
            the silence, her eyelids heavy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when she opened her eyes again a few moments later, they widened slightly as she
            realized Rio had drifted off beside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked... peaceful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her usual smirk was gone, her face soft and unguarded in a way Agatha had never seen
            before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked... beautiful .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That familiar ache was back in Agatha's chest, and Agatha fought against the urge
            to smack Rio awake with a pillow just to get this feeling out of her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she should still wake her up-they didn't do sleepovers. They had always
            maintained that clear line between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even still, Agatha felt a strange reluctance to wake her up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's own exhaustion was pulling her under, and she knew Rio would wake up
            eventually and slip out, leaving before dawn crept over the city.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she let her eyes drift closed, telling herself there was no harm in letting Rio
            stay. Just this once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll Wander High and Low</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of you have been asking for a Rio POV in the comments. Unfortunately, I do not
            plan on changing the POV for this story. It will stay Agatha POV from beginning to end. Once this story is
            finished, I do plan on writing a long one-shot from Rio's POV from the beginning to the end of this
            story, so you guys can't get a glimpse into her mind in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every chapter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hope you enjoy this chapter. My outline had to be adjusted, so peep the extra
            chapter added. Don't be surprised if the expected chapters keeps bumping up. I have the outline</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">completed, and some future chapters already written, but it is hard to squeeze
            everything I want into some of these "planned" chapter without it feeling rushed. I want to
            respect</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and maintain the pacing that I have built.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha slept well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always did after a night with Rio, but this sleep felt different-deeper, more
            restful, as though some quiet peace had settled over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stirred slightly as a delicate tickling sensation danced across her nose, pulling
            her from the depths of sleep. Breathing in deeply, she was greeted by the rich scent of earth and pine-
            fresh, and unmistakably reminiscent of a forest after rain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A smell she immediately recognized.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes snapped open, and her vision was met with black, silky strands of
            hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It dawned on her with a start that her face was buried in the back Rio's neck,
            her body curled up against her back. Agatha's arms were wrapped securely around Rio's middle, and
            she felt the gentle rise and fall of Rio's breath against her chest, their legs tangled together beneath
            the soft sheets.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's froze for a moment, before pulling her head back and looking at the back
            of the woman's head with wide eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was not one for cuddling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She liked her space in bed, the freedom to stretch out without feeling trapped or
            smothered. And yet here she was, her body pressed tightly against Rio's, her arms wrapped around her in
            what could only be described as a near-death grip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tightened her grip, half-consciously, realizing how oddly natural it felt.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In response to Agatha's tightened grip, Rio let out a deep, contented sigh, her
            body melting further into Agatha's embrace. Without even seeming to wake, Rio's thumb absently
            grazed along Agatha's arm, a slow, gentle motion before stilling and falling back into the deep
            sleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart clenched at that, a wave of something warm and unsettling washing
            over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind raced, but her body refused to move, torn between instinctively pulling away
            and savoring the quiet, unfamiliar comfort of having Rio in her arms</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt Rio's slow, steady breathing against her, grounding her in a way that
            made everything else fade-her walls, her rules, her carefully guarded heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn't supposed to happen. They didn't do this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't do this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This felt dangerously good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heavy emphasis on dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With that unsettling thought, Agatha took a steadying breath, then reached forward
            and gave Rio's shoulder a gentle shake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio, wake up," Agatha murmured, her voice low and steady, not wanting to
            startle her-but needing to end this before it went too far, before the urge to stay became
            overpowering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio grumbled in her sleep, a soft, reluctant sound that somehow made Agatha's
            heart lurch again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had always pictured Rio as a morning person-someone who seized the day the
            instant she opened her eyes. Yet here she was, wrapped around Agatha, heavy and completely out of it. The
            realization stirred something warm in her chest, and Agatha gritted her teeth,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">frustrated by her own reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio, seriously," she said, louder this time, shaking her shoulder with
            more intent. "You're lying on my arm. I can't feel it. Get up ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't stir immediately, but then, in an instant, Agatha felt her shift as
            awareness flooded her, her muscles tensing and then-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shot up, sheets pooling around her waist, bare-chested. Agatha's eyes
            instinctively moved down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can you blame her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then she forced her eyes up, taking in Rio's face as dark eyes moving around
            the room, as the woman was trying to will it to be her own, before her gaze moved down, landing on</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, her expression stunned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mouth dropped open slightly, genuine surprise flickering across her face.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with the tangle of emotions stirring in Agatha's chest, the side of her that
            delighted in poking at Rio couldn't resist the opportunity. She leaned back, one brow arching, letting a
            sly smile play on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Good morning, darling ," she purred with exaggerated warmth. "Did
            you sleep well?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, regaining her composure almost immediately, though a faint blush dusted
            her cheeks, and God -Agatha reveled in that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't mean..." Rio started, her words faltering as she searched for
            what to say. She took a breath, her face smoothing back into a neutral mask so quickly it was almost
            unnerving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a pang of disappointment at how easily Rio regained control, shutting
            down</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">whatever vulnerability had slipped through. The sheer strength of her emotional guard
            was almost terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry," Rio said, the words so steady and practiced they barely
            registered as an apology. She held Agatha's gaze for a brief moment before glancing away, sweeping the
            sheets aside and standing up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio scanned the floor for her scattered clothes, grabbing her pants and slipping them
            on before turning to find her bra and shirt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shifted, feeling the awkwardness of just sitting there watching Rio hurriedly
            get dressed. She climbed out of bed herself, wincing as her muscles ached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Rio pulled her shirt over her head, Agatha's gaze caught on something lying on
            the floor: the strap-on, the source of the lingering ache between her legs. She reached down, suppressing a
            grimace as her body protested, and picked it up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio finally pulled her head through her shirt, she froze, her eyes widening just
            slightly as she took in the sight of Agatha-standing there naked, holding the strap-on aloft with tip of her
            finger a teasing smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't forget your toy," Agatha sang, her tone laced with playful
            challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew she was pushing it, but honestly, she wasn't a fan of the blank-faced,
            overly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">composed version of Rio. She needed that spark back, the one that made Rio's
            expressions dance on the line between control and intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes met hers, lingering for a second before they dragged down, slowly,
            tracing the lines of Agatha's bare body. Agatha noticed the way Rio's jaw tightened, a flicker of
            tension</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">slipping through her carefully constructed mask. First crack.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, enjoying the moment, letting her own gaze stay steady, challenging.
            She felt a surge of satisfaction as Rio's composure wavered, her hand balling into fists at her side, as
            trying to hold back the temptation to touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio took a breath, visibly reining herself back, slipping the strap-on from
            Agatha's finger with a practiced nonchalance, though her eyes held a darker gleam.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thanks," Rio said, her voice steady, though Agatha caught the flicker of
            heat simmering just beneath her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha savored it-the subtle shift, the way she could unsteady Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered the first time they met, how she wanted to unravel this woman, to see
            her break. Now, that desire had transformed, evolved into something deeper, something that thrived on the
            challenge of making Rio falter, to push her just as hard as Rio pushed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step closer, watching as Rio's posture tightened, her breath hitching
            almost imperceptibly, a sharp exhale betraying the tension simmering between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, completely bare, while Rio stood fully dressed-a dynamic that should make
            Agatha feel vulnerable, but in that moment, she felt so fucking powerful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached up slowly, giving Rio every chance to pull away, to stop her, to say
            anything that would end this silent dare. But Rio stayed still, waiting, eyes darkening with
            anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With deliberate slowness, Agatha hooked her fingers under Rio's chin, tilting her
            face up in that familiar way Rio so often did to her. The power shift was electric, a charged echo of</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every moment Rio had held her there before, but this time, it was Agatha's
            turn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned in, watching as Rio's eyes fixed on hers, unwavering, and stopped
            just shy of letting their lips meet, savoring the hitch in Rio's breath that spilled against her
            own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You should get going," she murmured, voice low and teasing. "Your
            boss doesn't seem like the type that tolerates being late."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She caught the brief flick of Rio's tongue over her own lips, and it took every
            ounce of restraint not to close the distance, to taste her right then and there. But instead, Agatha</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">straightened, locking eyes with Rio one last time, a wicked grin playing at her lips
            before she released her hold, stepping back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, she turned and strolled toward the bathroom, every inch of her
            aware of Rio's gaze, the heat from her stare lingering over her bare skin, igniting every nerve as she
            walked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the bathroom door, Agatha paused, glancing back over her shoulder, a wicked smile
            playing at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unless, of course... you somehow manage to make your boss late with you,"
            she murmured, her tone a soft, dangerous tease. "Then she can't really punish you for that...now
            can she?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She held Rio's gaze, letting the words hang in the charged silence, her challenge
            unmistakable, before disappearing into the bathroom, leaving the door just barely open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped into the large glass shower, twisting the handle until the water
            cascaded down, a heavy, soothing rhythm that drowned out any hint of sound from beyond the bathroom door.
            She let the warmth seep into her muscles, easing away the lingering tension from last night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thoughts drifted back to Rio, to the silent challenge she'd left hanging in
            the air, knowing the ball was now in Rio's court.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio could easily walk out the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wouldn't be surprised-maybe disappointed, but she'd understand.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio wasn't the type to stay, not when she wore that armor of control, that air of
            detachment. There was a hardness to her, a perfectly sculpted mask of someone who could have anyone, then
            walk away without a second thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed to embody the phrase fuck them and leave them with her rules, her tight
            grip on every emotion, her ability to separate action from feeling like it was nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Agatha remembered how Rio had looked at her last night, that dark intensity
            in her eyes, as if every feeling Rio kept locked away had found its outlet in that moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way she'd claimed Agatha, her touch possessive, as if needing to imprint
            every inch of her into memory. But there was a contrast to it too-the brutal passion followed by the almost
            reverent gentleness-that left Agatha feeling as if she'd glimpsed two versions of Rio, locked in
            constant battle of how she wanted to treat Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That Rio , the one who seemed torn between control and vulnerability, had imprinted
            herself deeper than Agatha wanted to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, she couldn't help but wonder - which Rio would respond to her
            challenge?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Rio who needed to be in control would leave, would prove that she was the one
            calling the shots, that no one could unsettle her. That Rio would walk out, leave Agatha with ache between
            her legs, a reminder that she'd been there but wouldn't be held.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the other Rio...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened at the thought, her chest tightening with
            anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Other Rio , the one who held her with quiet tenderness after the intensity, the one
            who looked at her like she was something precious-that Rio affected Agatha in ways she didn't want to
            name, in ways that made her ache for something she hadn't even known she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the steam thickened around her, Agatha caught the faintest sound-a soft, almost
            hesitant creak from beyond the bathroom door. She held her breath, the warmth of the water paling</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the heat simmering in her chest, anticipation prickling her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, a few seconds later, the glass shower door opened, and Agatha turned,
            momentarily breathless at the sight before her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood there, bare and beautiful, her dark eyes locked onto Agatha's, filled
            with a blend of intensity and something softer, unguarded. She stepped into the shower, her gaze
            never</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wavering, a hesitant smile playing at the corners of her mouth before she deadpanned.
            "You couldn't have asked me to join you before I got dressed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart fluttered at that, a smile breaking across her lips as Rio closed
            the distance, sliding her arms around Agatha's waist and pulling her close under the stream of
            water.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha brought her hands up, fingers tracing over Rio's shoulders before
            threading through her now-damp hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now, Rio," she murmured, voice a low hum as her nails raked gently along
            Rio's scalp, her lips hovering just a breath away. "Where's the fun in that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned in, her lips brushing over Rio's in a teasing whisper before deepening
            the kiss, feeling Rio huff against her, exasperated yet smiling as she kissed back, her grin never leaving,
            until she pulled back abruptly and looked at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio reached up, her fingers trailing softly along Agatha's face, tracing the
            steady paths where water streamed down her skin. Her touch was reverent, lingering, her gaze filled with a
            raw intensity that Agatha could feel down to her bones.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she whispered, voice barely audible above the rush of water.
            "What are we doing?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, her pulse quickening as she met Rio's gaze. Agatha
            stared back at Rio, momentarily speechless.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was asking her ?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if Agatha had the answers, as if she knew what they hell they doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't have a fucking clue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened her mouth to speak, to say something, anything, but the words tangled in
            her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly her heart lurched painfully, betraying her, the weight of feelings she'd
            been keeping at bay crashing forward, flooding her chest, threatening to spill out in ways she wasn't
            ready to face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shut her mouth, swallowing hard, forcing those unruly emotions back
            down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't bring herself to say it, to admit how Rio had begun to burrow past
            the casual, past the physical, into something she hadn't wanted to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was terrified -terrified of exposing the truth of what this was becoming for her.
            Agatha could give Rio power over her body-but her heart?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is where she drew the line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Agatha did what she always did when emotions threatened to consume her-she
            ran.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is where Nicky got it from.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The urge to retreat, to push back when feelings got to intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But instead of rushing out of the shower, she ran back to the beginning-back to the
            simplicity of how it was when they started this game and and what she desperately needed them to continue to
            be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha slid her hands down to Rio's hips, applying just enough pressure to guide
            her back, one slow, deliberate step at a time, until Rio's back pressed firmly against the wall, her
            body caged by Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio watched her, eyes moving across her face-searching, waiting .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held Rio's gaze, a fire simmering in her own, before slowly, deliberately,
            dropping to her knees.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in an instant- that vulnerability Rio had shown moments ago vanished. Her eyes
            hardening, guarded-reading Agatha's move for what it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha answered Rio's question not with words, but with actions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was about sex.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what it started as, and that's what it needed to stay. She had to keep
            it simple, keep it controlled.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, Rio had set the rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don't fall in love with me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is what Rio had said to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had understood then, and she reminded herself now-if feelings got involved,
            she'd end up breaking Rio or vice versa- Rio would destroy her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she dropped her gaze from Rio's eyes-pushing down that ache in her chest, and
            leaned forward, her mouth moving between Rio's legs, feeling Rio's moan ripple through her.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers tightened in her hair, her breath coming in quick, uneven bursts,
            but Agatha focused on her own control, on the movement, on the rhythm. She ignored the whispers in her mind,
            the pull in her heart that wanted more, that wanted the impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because this- this was safer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was familiar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was what they both needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were late to work. Rio, naturally, arrived even later, having to stop by her
            own</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">apartment first. Agatha briefly considered making a show of Rio's near-hour-late
            entrance- she could almost see the look on her face-but thought better of it. After all, Agatha was the
            reason for Rio's tardiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio finally slipped into the war room, she moved seamlessly, prepping files for
            the trial, and everything seemed to fall back into place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or so Agatha thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as the day went by Agatha started noticing something unsettling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was still Rio-sharp, quick-witted, with that cocky edge-but something felt off.
            Her smiles seemed dimmer, her teasing-forced.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And most noticeable, and something Agatha zeroed in on immediately, Rio had stopped
            doing something that had always set Agatha on edge: she no longer looked her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took Agatha 5 minutes during a prep meeting for voir dire to notice it. And once
            she noticed it, it was glaring.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha made it through nearly an hour in the war room without once feeling Rio's
            gaze on her. Rio took notes, flipped through documents, spoke to her as if everything were perfectly
            normal-but didn't look up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then there was the most glaring sign that something was wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hadn't touched her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No casual graze of a hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No slipping into her space, daring Agatha to react. And most importantly- no
            sex.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Agatha thought it might be a game. Maybe Rio was keeping her on edge,
            building tension so that the next touch, the next moment, would be all the more intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then one day slipped to one-then two, and then three. And then last night
            happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha decided to take matters into her own hands and asked for Rio to come
            over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She actually fucking asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she watched the moment Rio read her message. And then-it just sat there just like
            that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing but silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fucking left Agatha on read.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha would love to think she didn't stare at that message for ten straight
            minutes, willing a reply to appear. She'd like to pretend she didn't toss and turn in bed all night
            , jolting awake at every phantom vibration, only to find nothing but silence staring back at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next morning, Agatha felt every restless minute of her sleepless night weighing
            her down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd slept like shit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, she stood gripping the countertop, leaning over it with a heavy sigh,
            fighting the urge to check her phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the urge won out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her head and stared down at it, finally reaching over, tapping the screen
            to bring it to life. Her fingers moved automatically, entering her code and opening her messages.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her message to Rio still sat there, unanswered, glowing up at her mockingly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A painful lurch twisted in her chest, sharper and more unsettling than anything
            she'd ever felt with Rio before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn't the usual thrill or tension she could lean on to keep her somehow
            both on edge and steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, this was a raw, anxious ache coiled inside her, making her stomach flip. Her
            hand came up instinctively, pressing against her chest, and she felt her heart hammering beneath her
            fingertips, each beat pulsing with that unfamiliar, relentless ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a sharp breath, and ripped her hand from heart like she was burnt and
            flipped her phone over, as if that could somehow make the feeling go away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked up, meeting her own gaze in the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she stared at herself, the anxiety in her chest shifted, hardening, transforming
            into something hotter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was playing a dangerous game. With a very dangerous woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was a storm from the moment she stepped into the office. The office's
            Defcon levels rose steadily with each passing hour. By midday, they were at Defcon 3-multiple associates
            hiding tears behind closed doors, Jen glaring at her from behind the safety of her glass door, and Billy
            visibly trembling every time he entered her office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only person unfazed, of course, was the one she most wanted to crack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio barely batted an eye when Agatha shredded her meticulously crafted witness
            preparation report, throwing it back with a scathing remark about her "sudden lack of
            competence."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Agatha nearly threw her a stack of contracts into Rio's hands-tasks
            she'd usually hand off to a contract specialist, given how grueling the work was. And not only that, she
            demanded they be completed by the end of the day, fully aware it was an impossible deadline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio only frowned slightly at the pile in her hands, and Agatha didn't miss the
            way her gaze lingered somewhere over her left shoulder, deliberately avoiding eye contact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Rio turned and walked back to the war room without a word, Agatha felt her jaw
            tighten, her teeth grinding as irritation flared inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned her chair away, staring out at the city skyline, her fingers tapping
            restlessly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the armrest. She barely managed twenty seconds of silence before a knock
            tapped on the glass behind her. Already bristling, she snapped, "WHAT?" before even turning
            around, only to find Billy standing there, swallowing nervously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your reservation at Carmine's with Summit Ventures is confirmed for 7:00
            PM. I just wanted to check if you still wanted the emergency call set for an hour into the
            meeting?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Summit Ventures-Agatha had almost forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The annual client meeting with her absolute least favorite group. Not because they
            engaged in any worse behavior than the average investment firm-they were plenty ethically questionable
            actions, but no more so than the rest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The real issue was the team itself: a pack of overgrown frat boys who inevitably got
            drunk and spent the night making passes at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her own personal nightmare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why she'd established a longstanding plan with Billy: an
            "emergency" call precisely one hour in. For five years running, they hadn't caught on. By the
            time she made her exit, they'd always be too blissfully drunk to notice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was about to confirm the usual plan when, out of the corner of her eye, she
            spotted Rio in the war room, brow furrowed as she stared down at a stack of contracts. Agatha could see she
            wasn't struggling, per se, but Rio was clearly out of her element, and the frustration showed on her
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A thrill sparked in Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Rio wanted to play with her emotions, then Agatha would return the-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-suddenly, an idea struck her, bringing a wicked smile to her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered the look Rio had given her when she was casually flirting with a
            bartender back at the Red Light when they went to that drag night looking for Kelcie Baker. She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remembered the dark, possessive look that marred Rio face that screamed that the
            woman didn't know if she wanted to fuck Agatha right then and there or punch the bartender in the
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that had been before they'd ever slept together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thrill that shot through her now was almost enough to overpower the ache Rio had
            left her with after ignoring her message.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned back to Billy, who had stopped in his tracks, wide-eyed at the sudden
            wicked smile on her face. He'd seen that look enough to know it meant T-R-O-U-B-L-E.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she said. "No call this time. I think it's time I give my
            full attention to Summit Ventures."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy blinked, visibly thrown off but nodded. He turned to leave, but Agatha held up
            a hand, stopping him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell Rio Vidal she'll be attending the client meeting with me," Agatha
            said smoothly, picking up a random sheet of paper on her desk and feigning interest in it. "The
            contracts can</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wait till tomorrow. It's time she gets her feet wet in client
            relations."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha heard Billy leave and pretended to study the already-approved report in her
            hand, holding the act for a few seconds before dragging her gaze up toward the war room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy was standing in front of Rio, speaking to her, and Agatha didn't miss the
            exact moment he mentioned the client meeting. Rio's posture shifted, her shoulders stiffening, and after
            a heartbeat, she flicked her gaze toward Agatha's office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in days, Rio met her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha-refused to look away. She held Rio's gaze, tilting her head slightly and
            jutting her chin forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look she gave Rio said it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You want to play? Then put a fucking helmet on, because this is going to be a rough
            ride.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the moment Agatha met Rio Vidal, it was as if she'd been set on a path- a
            road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crafted to challenge her at every turn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first forced her to confront her own sexuality, a part of herself she'd long
            buried in shadows, never believing it would come to light.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came the test of control, surrendering pieces of herself to someone else,
            allowing Rio to push her beyond her preconceived limits.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd barely made it through those first two trials. But once she'd cleared
            them, the freedom and peace she discovered on the other side made every moment of turmoil worth it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as though this road was giving her parts of herself she hadn't known were
            missing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, as she stood outside the dark wooden door marked with a golden number 4, she
            recognized the weight of the next trial.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like before, she knew she had a choice-face it or turn around and walk away. But
            this one- Agatha could feel it in her bones -was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This trial was bigger than the others, more dangerous , and if she was honest with
            herself, far more terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every step on this road felt like she was gambling a part of herself. And this
            one?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This one had the power to completely unravel her. To break her in ways she'd
            never risked before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she stood there, staring at that unassuming golden number on the door, her heart
            hammered, and for the first time in a long time, Agatha felt genuinely afraid. It wasn't just her pride
            or her carefully constructed walls at stake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was her entire sense of self, everything she had worked to build and
            protect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, she was on the edge of a precipice, facing a choice that could either deepen
            the peace she'd found within herself-or destroy it entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha made her decision last night. There was no backing down. Sink or swim, she
            was doing this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that thought, Agatha squared her shoulders and moved to raise her hand to
            knock, only to realize with a frustrated sigh-that her hands were full.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rolled her eyes at herself, mentally kicking herself for her own lack of
            foresight. "Fuck it," she muttered, straightening up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a quick flick of her leg, she rapped the toe of her boot against the door
            in a few sharp, determined knocks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then-she held her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">12 hours earlier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's emotions were like jagged shards of glass, sharp and relentless, cutting
            deeper with every second she spent beside Rio in the back of the town car. Rio didn't so much as glance
            her way. Instead, she sat stiffly, her body angled away, fingers absently tracing the hem of her
            sleeve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was as if the air around Agatha had grown toxic and Rio couldn't bear to
            breathe it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time they arrived at the restaurant, the silence was so thick it felt
            suffocating. Not a single word passed between them as they were led to their table, nor as they took their
            seats. Rio's eyes roamed everywhere but toward Agatha, and her face was a perfect, unreadable
            mask.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the server finally approached, breaking the silence, Rio ordered a water, her
            voice calm and detached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll have a double bourbon," she said smoothly, her tone masking the
            raw edge she felt inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the server left, Agatha kept her gaze fixed on Rio, who seemed suddenly engrossed
            in the menu, her eyes skating over the options with a practiced indifference. She didn't flinch,
            didn't so much as react to the way Agatha's eyes bored into her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a game, Agatha reminded herself-a game Rio had chosen to play. And if Rio
            thought she could keep Agatha at arm's length and leave her questioning, raw and aching, she was sorely
            mistaken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha unable to help herself, leaned back, folding her arms, her voice dropping to a
            low, dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's impressive," she murmured, "how committed you are to
            pretending I'm invisible."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio barely flinched, but Agatha saw the subtle signs-the tight clench of her jaw, the
            way her fingers gripped the edges of the menu just a bit harder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wanted to push further, but the loud, brash laughter from the front of the
            restaurant pulled her attention away. Her eyes darted instinctively toward the source of the noise. She
            recognized it immediately. Five men walked in, their voices filling the space as they made their way toward
            the dining area.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The founding members of Summit Ventures.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each of them was dressed in sharp, tailored suits, their hair and beards perfectly
            groomed. They were handsome, in that polished, almost-too-perfect way-if you didn't know them, you might
            think they were the kind of men Agatha would be interested in. But she knew better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were absolute assholes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three out of the five wore wedding rings, and those three were the worst
            offenders-always the first to hit on her, with an overconfident smirk and a line that felt like it belonged
            in a frat house.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the sound of laughter, Rio's head lifted, her gaze following Agatha's to
            the group of men approaching their table. Agatha watched Rio's face as she took them in, reading them
            with those sharp, dark eyes, immediately sizing them up and seeing them for what they were.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, just as quickly, her gaze snapped back to Agatha's, and for once, she held
            her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't flinch, meeting Rio's gaze head-on, her expression unyielding,
            confirming what Rio must have suspected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes , her eyes and smug smirk seemed to say, that's why I brought you
            here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha saw the moment Rio understood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She waited, expecting that familiar spark of anger to flicker in Rio's eyes, for
            that dark possessiveness to ignite, to rise to Agatha's challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But instead, a second passed, and then another. Rio's expression didn't
            harden or flash with anger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Rio blinked, and something shifted-a quiet, raw hurt settled behind her eyes,
            unguarded and vulnerable, stealing the breath from Agatha's lungs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the realization hit her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't expected that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd anticipated anger, maybe even a defiant spark or a subtle challenge. But
            this?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This flicker of hurt, so raw and unguarded, caught Agatha entirely off guard. It
            lingered in Rio's gaze, as if, just for a moment, Rio lost that iron grip over her emotions. And once it
            slipped free, she couldn't push it back behind her usual emotionless mask.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Agatha's mind went blank.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had orchestrated this whole setup as a way to push Rio, to make her feel the
            tension she'd been feeling, to draw out some reaction. But she hadn't accounted for the possibility
            that her little game might cut deeper than she intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her pulse quickening as she took in Rio's
            expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Abruptly, Rio looked away, reclaiming her control piece by piece as her mask slid
            slowly back into place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha found herself at a loss of words. She still parted her lips to
            speak-though what she intended to say, she couldn't quite grasp. Her heart hammered against her ribs,
            each beat urging her to tell Rio to leave, to go home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't needed here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First-year associates didn't attend client meetings, and Agatha had only brought
            her along to force her hand, to draw her into this twisted game. She made a mistake by asking Rio to</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">come here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her hesitation became her downfall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha!" a voice called from across the restaurant, and the Summit
            Ventures men spotted her, their voices loud and brimming with confidence as they strode toward the table.
            Agatha forced herself to look away from Rio, swallowing down the emotions that threatened to rise, and
            slipped on her professional mask as she stood to greet them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood as well, though the men's attention was locked solely on Agatha, grins
            plastered on their faces as they approached. Each one went in for a hug, which Agatha reluctantly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">accepted, masking her discomfort with a carefully measured smile. One of the more
            forward men leaned in, pressing an all-too-familiar kiss to her cheek, punctuated by a wink as he pulled
            back and took his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She managed a polite smile, but every nerve in her body buzzed with irritation-and
            somewhere beneath it, that ache in her chest where Rio's pain now lived.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dinner went exactly as Agatha had expected. Business talk was minimal, confined
            to a few perfunctory remarks about the upcoming quarter and vague mentions of "big</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">opportunities." Drinks, on the other hand, flowed freely, with each man ordering
            another round as soon as his glass was even halfway empty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With each refill, their voices grew louder, their laughter sloppier, and their
            tongues looser. Compliments became more brazen, slipping from polite to suggestive, punctuated by looks that
            lingered a little too long and gestures that edged just past appropriate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha kept her smile carefully measured, her gaze level, deflecting the comments
            with practiced ease. It wasn't her first Summit Ventures dinner, and it wouldn't be the last. But
            tonight, with Rio seated beside her, silent and observing, every comment grated just a bit more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel Rio's presence, her quiet watchfulness. Out of the corner of her
            eye, she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">caught the way Rio's jaw tightened each time one of the men leaned a little too
            close or let his hand brush Agatha's arm. Yet, Rio stayed silent, her expression unreadable, offering no
            reaction beyond that simmering tension just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's own irritation flared with each passing moment, her patience wearing
            thin. She had thought bringing Rio here would spark something-a reaction, a confrontation, something- but
            now, it was a test of endurance, each second stretching longer as she navigated the dinner and tried to
            ignore the ache lingering just beneath her ribs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Rio rose from her seat, murmuring a quick, polite excuse before heading to
            the bathroom. Agatha's gaze followed her, the ache in her chest growing with every step Rio took away
            from the table, like a storm building within her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she caught it-a flicker of movement as one of the men leaned back in his chair,
            his eyes following Rio's departure, lingering shamelessly on the curve of her ass.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something inside Agatha snapped, a hot, possessive anger flaring to life and
            consuming the ache that had been simmering just beneath her ribs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She clenched her jaw, forcing herself to keep her expression neutral, though she
            could feel her pulse racing, every instinct screaming to put him in his place. She took a slow, deliberate
            breath, her eyes narrowing as she turned to the man, her voice steady but cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is there something particularly interesting about my associate's
            departure?" she asked, her words laced with an edge sharp enough to cut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The table went silent, the laughter and casual remarks evaporating as Agatha's
            words sliced through the air. The man she'd called out raised his hands in mock surrender, a smirk
            tugging at his lips as he gave her a look that all but say, c an you blame me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers curled into fists beneath the table, the urge to wipe that smug
            expression off his face pulsing through her. If these men didn't collectively manage a portfolio worth
            fifty million dollars, she wouldn't have hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she kept her expression cool, her eyes fixed on him with a warning that said
            enough. After a moment, the man cleared his throat, a slight blush creeping up his neck as he quickly</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached for his glass, avoiding her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the table shifted awkwardly, some of the men exchanging glances-not
            expecting Agatha to call them out. She never had before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought to steady her emotions, but control was slipping through her
            fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh...how the tables had turned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd brought Rio here tonight to provoke her, to make her jealous, maybe even
            possessive. Yet here she was, seething with the urge to tear that man apart for daring to look at Rio like
            that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a tight breath, she tossed her napkin onto the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Excuse me, gentlemen," she murmured, standing and striding away from the
            table, her steps quick and purposeful. But as she neared the bathroom, her pace slowed, the reality of
            Rio's presence on the other side of the door suddenly pressing down on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitated just outside, fingers flexing at her sides. She could still feel the
            men's eyes on her from across the restaurant, watching, expectant. She couldn't exactly turn back
            now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gritting her teeth, she pushed the door open and stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't know what she was about to walk into, but the moment her heels clicked
            from wood to tile, she froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door swung shut behind Agatha with a soft thud, cutting off the restaurant's
            noise and leaving her enveloped in a silence that felt thick, pressing, almost suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart pounded, every nerve on high alert, as her eyes landed on Rio, standing at
            the sink, dabbing carefully beneath her eyes with a tissue. Rio looked up, catching Agatha's reflection
            in the mirror. Her eyes widened briefly before she quickly looked away, crumpling the tissue in her
            fist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was... she was crying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart didn't just lurch-it felt like it cracked open, the sharp pain
            so unexpected it left her paralyzed, as if her blood had turned to ice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio..." she started, but her voice trailed off, the words slipping away
            before they could fully form.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw clenched, a flush rising to her cheeks as she looked anywhere but at
            Agatha, clearly not expecting her to walk in and definitely not wanting to be seen like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't give yourself too much credit," Rio murmured, her voice soft but
            echoing in the quiet room. "This isn't just about you-I'm just...frustrated with myself.
            That's all."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind went blank. She didn't know what to say, didn't know if she
            even remembered</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">how to speak. She stood there, frozen, staring at Rio like a complete fucking
            idiot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she managed to snap out of it, but instead of replying, she reached into her
            purse, pulling out her phone. She unlocked it with a few quick taps, then brought it to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment the person on the other end picked up, she spoke, her voice quiet and
            steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Bring the car around," she said softly, then ended the call and slipped
            the phone back into her purse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a step forward, her gaze locked on Rio, even as Rio tried to salvage the
            last shred of vulnerability she hadn't meant for Agatha to see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," Agatha said again, her voice steady this time, with no hesitation.
            Rio surprised her by looking up, meeting her head-on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go to the car," Agatha said, not as a command but as a quiet offer, an
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sucked in a breath, clearly understanding what Agatha was giving her-a way to
            escape without saying a word. She stared at Agatha for a long moment, as if weighing her decision, before
            nodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved to step around her, but Agatha's hand instinctively reached out,
            fingers pressing gently into Rio's arm, stopping her by her side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio kept her gaze lowered, but Agatha could hear the shaky breath that escaped her.
            "I'm sorry," Agatha murmured, the words surprising even herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't apologize often.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To apologize meant admitting she was wrong, and Agatha prided herself on rarely- if
            ever</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-being wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But here, she'd misread everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't once even considered that Rio's silence wasn't some calculated
            game to mess with her but something Rio needed for herself, her own space to deal with whatever she was
            going through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers softened against Rio's arm, and for a long moment, Agatha simply
            stood there, heart heavy, torn between the urge to reach bring her closer and the instinct to let Rio
            go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Agatha lowered her hand, and it was as if that single gesture was all Rio
            needed. The moment her hand fell, Rio slipped away, crossing the room and disappearing through the door. The
            sounds of the restaurant flooded into the bathroom briefly, then faded again as the door swung shut, sealing
            Agatha back into the thick, pressing silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a heavy sigh, planting her hands on her hips and tilting her head
            back, staring up as if the answer to how she'd managed to mess this up so badly might be written
            somewhere in the ceiling tiles. She could be a self-centered piece of shit sometimes, and she</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew it. The moment Rio had gone quiet, she'd taken it as a personal affront,
            never once stopping to consider that maybe-just maybe-it wasn't about her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are we doing, Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's question from that morning in the shower echoed in her mind, growing
            louder, taking on a haunting, almost ghostly presence that lingered in the silence of the bathroom.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to the mirror, her gaze hardening as she took in her own reflection.
            Outwardly, she looked the same-impeccably put together, her sharp suit pristine, her makeup flawless. But
            beneath that polished exterior, she could see the cracks, the strain she worked so hard to hide. Her heart
            hammered against her ribs, pulsing with a relentless urgency that seemed to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">echo through her entire body, demanding her attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let herself really look this time, she saw the tension in her jaw, the faint
            shadows beneath her eyes, the guarded look she gave even to herself. This was more than just exhaustion;
            it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">was the weight of choices and regrets.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as she stood there, Agatha couldn't escape the feeling clawing its way to the
            surface-an insistence, almost a plea, urging her to confront the truth she'd been so carefully
            avoiding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thing between her and Rio was rapidly evolving into something else, something
            dangerous-feelings were getting involved. Clearly, based on Rio's reaction these past few days, they
            already were. And, Agatha could admit, reluctantly, that it wasn't one-sided.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the real question was, what were they going to do about it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are we doing, Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she'd returned from the bathroom, she feigned being on a call, flashing the
            men an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">apologetic smile as she claimed she'd been called in for an emergency meeting.
            She'd handed her credit card to the waitress, instructing her to keep the tab open, which the men</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">appreciated. Thankfully, none of them had tried to touch her as she left, likely
            remembering the warning glare she'd shot their way before excusing herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha made her way out of the restaurant toward her waiting town car. Dan was
            already there, holding the door open for her. She slipped inside, and he closed the door firmly behind her,
            sealing her into the quiet, confined space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sat next to her, eyes fixed out the window, her posture tense, clearly intent on
            ignoring Agatha's presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within seconds, the car pulled smoothly away from the curb, leaving the
            restaurant-but the unresolved tension was alive and well now in the back of the car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers tapped anxiously against her leg as she searched for a way to
            begin. How did one start a conversation with a fuck buddy turned... something more?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She found the words several times, her lips parting to speak, but doubt crept in each
            time, silencing her, uncertainty twisting her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Minutes dragged on, the silence twisting inside Agatha like a knife wedged deep, each
            beat of her heart driving it further in. She could feel the weight of it pressing on her chest, and</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">finally, unable to stand it any longer, she blurted out the first thing that
            surfaced.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio..." Her voice, softer and more vulnerable than she ever intended,
            sliced through the quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head turned slightly, just enough to show she was listening, though her
            gaze remained distant, her expression unreadable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, feeling her pulse hammering in her throat. "Rio...
            please."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were raw, stumbling out before she could catch them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That got Rio's attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her head fully, her dark eyes finally meeting Agatha's, piercing,
            unyielding. Agatha felt herself unravel under that gaze, and her usual defenses crumbled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their eyes locked, the weight of everything unspoken hanging between them, thick and
            suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just... tell me what to do," Agatha whispered, a thread of desperation
            slipping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't just asking-she was pleading.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me what to do, and I'll do it," Agatha said, her voice breaking,
            the words spilling out with a rawness she could barely contain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For once in her life, Agatha was completely out of her element. She didn't know
            how to bridge this rapidly increasing gap between them. The fear of losing Rio, of having damaged something
            that had quietly, deeply rooted itself inside her, made her feel exposed in a way that utterly terrified
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio looked at her, her face softening, yet tinged with a sadness that cut straight
            through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can't, Agatha," Rio said quietly, her voice almost a whisper.
            "I can't tell you what to do, because I don't know what to do either."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, the full weight of Rio's words pressing down on her.
            Rio was just as lost as her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no script, no easy way forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stood at the edge of something unknown, a place where power and control had no
            hold, a fragile, uncertain space that neither of them knew how to navigate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha needed a sign, something to assure her that she hadn't destroyed this
            beyond repair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, hesitantly, she moved her hand forward, her fingertips brushing against
            Rio's where it rested beside her. The contact was delicate, tentative-almost as if Agatha were
            questioning whether she even had the right to reach out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the instant Agatha's fingers touched Rio's, Rio clasped them tightly, her
            grip instinctive and fierce, as if she feared Agatha might pull away and slip out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a breath she didn't even realize she was holding, as she held
            Rio's hand back with just as much intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They rode in silence, hands entwined, the quiet pressing around them. Agatha was
            acutely aware that they weren't talking, weren't solving anything-but they were still holding each
            other's hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That had to mean something, didn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stillness stretched on until Rio's voice broke through it, low and almost
            detached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When people first hear how my mind works, they think it's a gift," she
            murmured, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, as if she were speaking to the air in front of her. "It
            really isn't. I think... I think it's a curse."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to her, caught off guard by the statement that seemed to come out
            nowhere, but Rio didn't look back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could see the tension in Rio's grip, the way her fingers tightened as if
            she were holding on to Agatha's hand as a lifeline, as if she needed it to keep going.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha squeezed back, silently urging her forward, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When I was thirteen," Rio began, her voice steady but laced with a strain,
            "my parents and I were driving back from one of my soccer tournaments. We were hit head-on by a drunk
            driver. My dad... he died instantly."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, a tremor passing through her voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My mom, though... she was hurt badly. I could see her, but I couldn't get
            to her-my legs were pinned."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze drifted, as if the memory were pulling her back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched as Rio's free hand drifted to her knee, fingers tracing slow,
            restless patterns back and forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sitting here, in this car," Rio continued, her voice soft, hesitant, like
            she was speaking from a place buried deep within, "I can feel it, like I'm back there all over
            again. The weight pressing down on my legs, the tightness in my chest... the panic clawing its way up, the
            helplessness..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice trailed off, and she pressed her head back into the leather seat, squeezing
            her eyes shut, her jaw clenched so tightly Agatha swore she could hear her teeth grinding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And I can still hear her breaths," Rio gritted out, the words strained, as
            if they were physically painful to release. "Each one... so wet, so- pained ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a quiet breath, her chest tightening in response to the raw pain
            laced in Rio's voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why was Rio telling her this? Why was she putting herself through the agony of
            reliving it? A sharp ache bloomed in Agatha's chest as a startling realization hit her- she hated
            this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1"> Seeing Rio in pain, watching her struggle through memories that tore her apart
            piece by piece. Catching Rio quietly wiping tears away in the bathroom had been hard enough, but this...
            this was so much worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio wasn't finished. It was as if she were determined to reach the end, to
            push through this painful memory, as though it held something she needed Agatha to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My mom, she... she turned toward me," Rio continued, her voice trembling,
            thick with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">emotion. "Even then, I could tell she was barely holding on. I knew- somehow, I
            just knew</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-that she was going to die. And there was nothing I could do to stop it."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, her jaw clenched as tears gathered in her eyes, shimmering in the
            dim light of the car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest ached as she watched Rio struggle to hold back the flood of
            emotions, her grip tightening around Agatha's hand in a borderline painful grip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And then," Rio's voice broke, barely more than a whisper now, yet so
            loud in the quiet car. "She told me... ' Close your eyes, mija ,' she said. ' Close your
            eyes and cover your ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can you do that for me, baby? '"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the words crawled painfully out of her mouth, she shook her head, as if trying
            to shake the sound of her mother voice from her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't understand why she was asking me to do that," she continued
            quietly, her voice trembling. "But I was terrified, so I did what she asked. I closed my eyes, covered
            my ears,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and sat there in the back seat, surrounded by darkness and silence that felt like it
            would go on forever... while she died just five feet away from me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened painfully, the weight of Rio's words sinking
            deep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's words lingered in the silence that followed, as if the weight of them took
            on a tangible presence, filling the car-pressing against them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her breath, watching as the tears finally slipped form her eyes and down
            Rio's cheeks, silent but devastating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat tightened, as she felt the urge to say something, to reach out
            and wipe them</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">away, to offer words of comfort, but nothing seemed adequate-she was trapped in this
            story just as much Rio was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio took a shaky breath, wiping her cheek with the back of her hand, though her grip
            on Agatha's hand didn't loosen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It wasn't until later, at the hospital that I realized why she told me to
            do that. She asked me to close my eyes and cover my ears," Rio continued, her voice fragile,
            "because she knew I'd never forget the moment she died. She knew that memory would haunt me. So,
            she tried to shield me, even then. She died still trying to protect me- protecting me from own mind
            ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart ached at the depth of Rio's pain, her fingers tightening
            around Rio's hand in silent support. This wasn't just a story-this was Rio's way of opening a
            door to her heart, showing Agatha something she kept hidden from everyone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"After that, I learned to keep everything separate," Rio said, her gaze
            distant, lost in the past. "To keep my eyes shut and my ears covered-to keep my emotions apart from the
            memories. It was the only way I know how to survive... to stop them from consuming me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha became dimly aware of the car slowing to a stop, catching a fleeting glimpse
            of Rio's street outside the window, but she couldn't tear her focus away from Rio. She was
            entirely</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">caught up in the raw, unfiltered honesty spilling out before her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hesitated, her hand tightening around Agatha's, then loosening, then
            tightening again, as though she were battling with something buried deep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha braced herself, sensing that whatever came next was going to be harder
            still-though she couldn't imagine how Rio could possibly bear to share something more painful.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a deep, aching sigh, Rio finally turned, lifting her gaze to meet Agatha's.
            Her eyes shone with a vulnerability so raw that it made Agatha's heart skip a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time since she'd begun speaking, Rio looked her directly in the
            eye, and Agatha understood-whatever came next held everything Rio had been holding back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But I can't keep my eyes closed with you, Agatha," Rio whispered, her
            voice breaking, the words trembling on the edge of something raw and unguarded. Her gaze held Agatha's,
            as if searching for a safe place to land.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around Agatha's as though trying to
            ground herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It just hit me out of nowhere. And suddenly I... I feel everything ," she
            admitted, her voice barely above a whisper, thick with emotion. "And I don't know how to shut it
            off."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The confession hung between them, raw and unguarded, a truth that reached deep,
            exposing wounds that had never fully healed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave Agatha's hand a gentle squeeze, her lips curving into a sad, bittersweet
            smile-and before Agatha could even process it, Rio was pulling her hand away. Agatha's fingers twitched,
            the impulse to reach out, to hold on, almost overwhelming. She wanted to pull Rio's hand back to where
            it felt like it belonged, but something in that smile, that quiet</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">resignation, held her frozen. It was a smile that spoke of-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She realized with a start and Agatha sucked in a breath, panic tightening in her
            throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No. No. No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Completely oblivious to the panic rising in Agatha, Rio let out a ragged breath, her
            sad smile wavering, cracking at the edges.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't think we should see each other like this anymore," Rio said
            softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's world went still, her heart plummeting into a cold, hollow ache.
            Rio's words settled over her like a lead weight, a punch that left her breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know this isn't what you signed up for," Rio continued, her voice
            wavering slightly. "It wasn't what I was expecting either. But this..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gestured vaguely between them, her hand falling away helplessly. "I
            can't... I don't know how to do this ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't think, couldn't speak, couldn't fucking breathe.
            Rio's words seemed to echo in her mind, each one driving deeper, leaving her raw and defenseless. She
            opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Her throat felt tight, as if it sealed itself off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She searched Rio's face, desperate to find some hint of doubt, some sign that
            this was just a momentary lapse, something that could be fixed, salvaged. But Rio's gaze was steady,
            painfully resigned, and it tore through Agatha in a way she hadn't expected, hadn't prepared
            for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's insides twisted painfully, a voice screaming from somewhere deep within
            her,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just tell her! Just tell her you have feelings too. Tell her this isn't a game
            for you, either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart pounded, beating wildly against her ribs, demanding she do something,
            anything to keep Rio from walking away. Every nerve was on fire, the urge to close the gap, to reach out, to
            lay it all bare pounding through her veins.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her lips stayed pressed tightly together, the weight of her pride, her fear,
            chaining her to silence. She could feel herself cracking under the pressure, every instinct screaming to
            speak up, to stop Rio from slipping through her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she swallowed, forcing down the ache in her throat.
            "Rio..."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice trembled, her resolve slipping. "I-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words caught, tangled in all the walls she'd so carefully built. The
            truth lay just on the edge, a confession ready to be spoken, but she couldn't get it out. Her hand
            hovered in the space between them, reaching, but afraid to close the distance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Say it!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">H er mind roared, a desperate chant in her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tell her you have feelings!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tell her she's more than you ever expected! Tell her she matters!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But all that came out was silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held Agatha's gaze for a moment, her eyes darkening with a sadness that
            seemed to settle deep within her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took Agatha's silence for exactly what it was, her shoulders slumping ever so
            slightly as she nodded, resignation washing over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, she reached for the door handle, fingers wrapping around it
            with a sense of finality that made Agatha's chest ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good night, Agatha," she murmured, her voice barely audible, soft and
            weighted with hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before Agatha could summon the courage to respond, Rio was slipping out of the
            car, leaving her alone in the silence, her unspoken words echoing painfully in the empty space where Rio had
            been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that night, Agatha lay in bed, staring up at the dark ceiling, her mind
            replaying every</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">agonizing moment of her conversation with Rio. The silence in her bedroom felt
            suffocating, thick with everything she hadn't said, everything she'd let slip away. Her chest felt
            hollow, the ache sharper now in the quiet hours of the night, each regret slicing deeper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to push the memory back, but her mind clung to it stubbornly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could still see Rio's eyes, filled with sadness and hurt, the finality in her
            voice as she'd said, "Good night, Agatha," as if she were closing a door on them both.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You should've just told her, her mind whispered, relentless. You should've
            just said it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fists clenched in the sheets, frustration bubbling up inside her. She
            was Agatha Harkness for fucks sakes , a woman who never let anyone take control of her, who never</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">faltered. Yet when it mattered, when she needed to let her guard down the most,
            she'd let her own fear and pride silence her. And now, lying alone in the dark, she felt the weight of
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">choice crushing down on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you so afraid of?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question echoing in her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But deep down, she already knew the answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was afraid of what Rio had unearthed in her, the vulnerability, the need, the
            feelings she'd long buried under layers of control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But tonight?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tonight, had shown her something else too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her walls didn't protect her-they just left her more alone than ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rolling over, Agatha buried her face in her pillow and wanted to scream into it, only
            to be hit by the unmistakable scent of forest and pine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She froze, inhaling sharply, then reared back, staring down at the pillow as if it
            had attacked her. She'd washed the sheets, but not the pillows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had slept on this pillow, and it still smelled like her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A wave of emotions crashed over her, tightening her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached out, fingers brushing over the fabric as though if clinging to the
            remnants of Rio's presence would ease the ache stirring inside her. But instead, the scent just made the
            loss feel sharper, more real, leaving her staring at the pillow in helpless frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, suddenly, tears filled her eyes, hot and unwelcome, pooling with a
            frustration that ran bone-deep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not at Rio, but at herself -at her own stubborn pride, her own inability to say the
            things that mattered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swiped at her cheeks angrily, as if denying the tears could somehow erase the
            regret churning inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was no use.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ache in her chest swelled, pressing against her ribs, and she felt helpless under
            the weight of it. She'd let Rio slip away, let her silence push away the one person who'd ever made
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">feel something real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind drifted back, replaying their time together, how Rio had disrupted
            her life in ways she'd never expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The very idea of being with a woman had once seemed absurd to her, like a door
            seealed shut. But Rio had blasted Agatha's closet door right of the fucking hinges, bringing out a side
            of her she hadn't even known existed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thought of giving up control in the bedroom? Letting someone else lead? That
            had felt even more ridiculous... until Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, the idea that this thing between them could be something more, something
            real- that notion seemed the most outlandish of all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But somehow, against all odds, Rio made her want it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she laid there, staring at the pillow, new tears started to spill. Hot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frustrated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Angry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When had she become this hesitant, this unsure?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd built her life on bold moves, on taking exactly what she wanted without a
            moment's hesitation. Second-guessing had never been in her nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, she'd let Rio take the lead, allowed herself to surrender parts of herself
            she'd kept locked away. But that didn't mean she had to stay on the sidelines, didn't mean she
            had to let Rio dictate the terms of this... whatever it was between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was Agatha fucking Harkness, for Christ's sakes -a woman who'd built her
            reputation on control, on confidence, on always knowing exactly what she wanted and exactly how to get
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never waited, never hesitated, never let anyone force her by the hand. Rio's
            question echoed in her mind: What are we doing, Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, it twisted into something else, something more pointed and demanding.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you going to do, Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back to the present:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha waited, her heart pounding with anticipation as she stood outside the door. A
            few moments passed in silence before she heard movement behind the door, followed by the soft click of locks
            being undone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door creaked open, and there stood Rio, blinking against the dim hallway light,
            clearly still half-asleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a ragged breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was wearing a pair of skimpy sleep shorts that revealed miles of toned legs and a
            deep green T-shirt that read " Pawnee Parks and Rec Department ." Her dark hair was a mess,
            sticking out in every direction, and she rubbed at her eyes, eyes coming into focus on Agahta, before
            widening with shock.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," Rio sighed, her voice thick with the remnants of sleep as she
            looked down at her watch, then back up, raising a brow in exasperation. Her gaze was piercing, even through
            her disheveled, sleepy expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's seven in the morning- on a Saturday ." Agatha offered a sheepish
            smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know. I couldn't sleep."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio ran her hands through her hair messy locks, and threw Agatha a look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, I was sleeping," she murmured, but Agatha didn't miss the faint
            shadows beneath her eyes, the way her shoulders held a tension that said sleep hadn't come easily to
            her, either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held up a coffee cup.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I brought you coffee," she said, her voice softer than usual, knowing she
            would need this peace offering for the still surprisingly anti-morning Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard, and for a moment, she simply stared at the cup
            as if she couldn't quite believe it. Then, slowly, she reached out, her fingers brushing lightly
            against</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's as she took the cup, her touch sending a small thrill down Agatha's
            spine. Rio looked down at the familiar coffee shop logo, her eyes widening in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You actually went into a coffee shop and ordered your own coffee?" she
            said slowly, as if she couldn't believe the words coming out her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, though a faint blush crept into her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just because I have an assistant who usually gets my coffee doesn't mean
            I'm entirely helpless."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hummed softly, as if she didn't quite believe Agatha's words but was
            willing to let it slide. She brought the cup to her lips, taking a slow, deliberate sip. Her eyes closed
            briefly as</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">she savored the first taste, a quiet, appreciative hum escaping her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Rio took another sip, her gaze softened, and for a brief moment, the guarded look
            faded from her eyes. She seemed to relax, her shoulders loosening, as if Agatha's unexpected gesture had
            somehow dissolved a little of the tension lingering between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the soft morning light, with Rio's hair tousled and her guard lowered, Agatha
            couldn't help but think she looked beautiful in that moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's gaze shifted from Agatha's face to the other thing in
            Agatha's arms-a large, leafy potted plant, hard to miss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought against the faint flush that threatened to creep up her neck as she
            adjusted the plant, holding it a little awkwardly in the crook of her arm before extending it toward
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I... I got you this too," she said, attempting to keep her voice casual,
            though she could feel her composure slipping just a little.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, setting her coffee down on the small entryway table beside her before
            reaching out to take the plant. She looked down at it, her fingers tracing the elegant green-and-white
            leaves with gentle curiosity, her expression shifting to one of genuine surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where did you get this?" Rio asked, her gaze flicking back up to Agatha,
            equal parts touched and suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave a nonchalant shrug, though she knew she wasn't fooling anyone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"At a flower shop downtown," she replied, trying to sound like she
            hadn't just jumped through an inordinate amount of hoops to acquire it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A flower shop that opens before sunrise- on the weekend ?" Rio said with
            disbelief clinging to every syllable, as she raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated, swallowing back her discomfort.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The daughter of a client owns it. I, uh... called in a favor," she
            admitted, her tone more defensive than she liked, but she didn't like being called out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised an eyebrow-and then, a faint smile curving her lips as she looked back
            down at the plant, then back up at Agatha, her eyes filled with something Agatha couldn't quite
            place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is a Monstera Albo Borsigiana," Rio said, the mouthful of a name
            rolling off her tongue effortlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown. She didn't know the first thing about plants,
            let alone what this one was called. All she knew was that it fucking expense, and should be gold plated for
            what she paid for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio sighed, a mix of exasperation and amusement in her tone.
            "Did you just buy the most expensive plant in the store?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her cheeks warm under Rio's knowing gaze. She should have anticipated
            this reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a huff, she threw her hands up in mild exasperation, gesturing at the
            plant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look, I don't know anything about plants!" she practically exclaimed.
            "I figured I'd treat it like bourbon-the more expensive, the better it is."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's mouth quirked into a genuine smile, a small laugh escaping her. She glanced
            down at the plant, clearly touched, her fingers lingering on the leaves before meeting Agatha's eyes
            again, softer now, and just a bit more open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze softened as she looked at Agatha, really looked at her, as if trying
            to piece together what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha- what are you doing? "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a steadying breath, a sly smile creeping onto her lips as she leaned
            casually</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the doorframe, trying to convey enough outward confidence that it convinced
            herself internally that she was doing the right thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh. I am taking back my control," she answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes went wide, surprise flashing across her face, as she looked at Agatha
            in shock. "You're what?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha offered a casual shrug, though beneath the surface, her heart pounded, her
            emotions a tangled mess.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have feelings for you, Rio," she admitted, her voice steady despite the
            storm inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as the words landed, seeing Rio's eyes widen slightly, her breath
            catching in a way that felt like a small victory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And since both of us have been acting like complete idiots," Agatha
            continued, a hint of determination sharpening her tone, "I've decided to take control of the
            situation."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, caught off guard, her fingers tightening at her side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A mixture of surprise, uncertainty, and something else- something vulnerable
            -flickered across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but feel a thrill of satisfaction at having left Rio
            momentarily speechless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're taking control of the situation," Rio repeated, drawing out
            each word with a smirk, before arching an eyebrow and giving Agatha a pointed look. "Just to confirm-am
            I the situation you're planning to take control of?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched, fighting back a grin as her confidence surged. She took a
            deliberate step closer, her gaze locked on Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Rio," she replied smoothly, her voice low and sure. "You are
            absolutely the situation I'm planning to take control of."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes sparkled with a mix of surprise and-thankfully-something darker, her
            lips</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">curving into a faint smirk as she set the plant carefully on the table beside her.
            Crossing her arms, she leveled Agatha with a look, a flicker of defiance lighting her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You couldn't have told me that last night?" she asked, a touch
            exasperated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now where's the fun in that?" Agatha deflected, raising an eyebrow
            playfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio narrowed her eyes, unimpressed. Agatha's confidence wavered for just a
            second, and she took a breath, letting honesty cut through her tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was scared, okay?" she admitted. "But I went home, sorted out my
            shit, and here I am. And I even got you a pretty plant to make up for it." She gestured to the monstera
            with a flourish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised a brow, her expression softening. "I didn't need the plant,
            Agatha. I wanted you ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her breath hitch, Rio's directness catching her off guard in the best
            possible way. She hadn't realized just how much she'd missed this side of Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, now you have me... and a plant," she said, flicking her hands as if
            to say, You're welcome. "Seems like a win-win to me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised a brow, letting the moment stretch out as her piercing gaze held Agatha in
            place. Finally, she sighed, the sound equal parts exasperated and amused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are something else, you know that?" she said, shaking her head just
            slightly. Agatha's smirk returned, the confidence in her voice unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So I've been told."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio rolled her eyes, but a hint of a smile lingered on her lips as she reached
            forward, grabbing the lapel of Agatha's jacket and pulling her close enough that their breaths met in
            air between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Rio tilted her head, to close the remaining short distance, Agatha pulled
            back, just enough to keep Rio waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression wavered, flickering with a hint of confusion as her eyes
            searched Agatha's, uncertain yet intrigued.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a thrill pulse through her, igniting every nerve as she lifted a mocking
            brow, leaning in closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ask," she murmured, her voice a soft but steady command, brushing the
            words tantalizingly against Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt the subtle hitch in Rio's breath, the slight tremor that traveled
            through her as her fingers remained clenched around Agatha's lapels, holding her close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a small, half-exasperated sigh, caught between irritation and amusement.
            She huffed against Agatha's mouth, clearly both annoyed and unable to hide the faint smile breaking
            through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How about..." Rio murmured, her voice low, laced with a teasing defiance,
            as she reached up, her fingers sliding into Agatha's hair, nails scraping deliciously along her scalp.
            She buried her hand in Agatha's hair, holding her in that possessive way Agatha loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How about no more rules," she whispered, her lips brushing against
            Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a ragged breath, her heart pounding at the weight of those words-at
            what they promised, at what they meant. The thrill of it, of shedding every last barrier between them, sent
            a shiver through her, and she knew there was no going back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Deal," she murmured, her voice barely audible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, with a fierce, undeniable certainty, she closed the distance, sealing her
            words with a kiss that held nothing back-no more rules, no more hesitation, just raw, unfiltered
            want.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in that moment, everything else faded, leaving only the heat of the mouths
            pressed together and the thrill of stepping fully into the unknown.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had completed another trial, stepped through it, and felt a piece of herself she
            hadn't known was missing slot firmly into place. With each step forward, she found herself becoming
            something more, something fuller, as if this path were shaping her in ways she'd never
            anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This road would test her- she knew that much.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What lay ahead was uncertain, a mystery she couldn't yet solve. But for now, she
            was exactly where she wanted to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for now-that was enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, so I am sorry for the longer then usual wait time. I have been so sick lately
            that I can barely see straight. Words were hard lol I'm still pretty sick, so I imagine the next update
            will take time too, but we will see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anyways...enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone had told Agatha that at nearly fifty years old, she'd be spending her
            entire Saturday tangled up in sheets, being thoroughly ravished by a woman sixteen years her junior,
            she'd have laughed them out of the room-and then probably sued them for defamation later.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, here she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Face down on forest green silk sheets, her hair and skin damp with sweat, gasping
            into the fabric, as her legs trembled beneath her as yet another orgasm tore through her, leaving her
            breathless and spent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt warm lips press into her shoulder, and then- there it was -the unmistakable
            smirk against her skin, that fucking smirk that seemed to sear right into her flesh. Rio Vidal was branding
            her with it, marking her the way a rancher brands their cattle-with an air of quiet, undeniable
            ownership.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she felt a hand tracing down her spine, each fingertip pressing slowly,
            deliberately, as if counting every vertebra, moving lower over the curve of her ass and lingering there,
            before daring to dip further and slide forward. Agatha's body reacted faster than she thought possible,
            exhaustion forgotten, as she snapped her hand back, gripping Rio's wrist firmly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then in one swift, fluid motion, Agatha rolled, flipping Rio onto her back and
            pinning her there, straddling her with an intensity that left no room for question. The wrist still caught
            in her hand was pressed firmly above Rio's head, while Agatha's other hand wrapped gently around
            Rio's neck-a soft but unmistakable warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened in surprise for a fleeting moment before that smirk returned,
            even deeper than before, as she looked up at Agatha with a glint of satisfaction, clearly savoring this
            unexpected shift in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you have an off button somewhere?" Agatha growled, her gaze roaming
            over Rio's glistening skin, now covered in a constellation of hickeys and marks from Agatha's own
            teeth and nails.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled, a low, throaty sound that Agatha could feel vibrate against her hand.
            "Maybe. Check between my legs," Rio murmured, her voice a teasing purr.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha snorted at that, but that didn't stop her from increasing the grip on
            Rio's wrist and throat slightly, leaning down until their faces were mere inches apart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're exhausting, you know that?" Agatha muttered, though the glint
            in her eyes betrayed her amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pot calling the kettle, dear ," Rio shot back smoothly, a wicked smile
            curving on her lips. Agatha looked down at her, arching an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio- dear . If I don't get something to eat and drink..." Agatha
            began, her voice tinged with warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio opened her mouth, a glint in her eyes revealing exactly the kind of dirty
            response she had in mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clicked her tongue, tightening her grip just enough around Rio's throat to
            cut the words off before they could escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Actual food," Agatha bit out, her tone sharp but laced with a smirk,
            before loosening her grip once more, but not letting go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's devilish smirk faded into a reluctant pout, but after a moment, she
            softened, giving a small nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha started to pull her hand away, but Rio's fingers caught hers, guiding it
            back to her throat and pressing it there, her gaze sparking again, like a fire that never really goes
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We'll be exploring this later, though," Rio murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a split second, Agatha's thoughts scattered, her focus dissolving as she felt
            the warmth of Rio's throat beneath her hand, Rio's dark eyes fixed on her, filled with something
            that made Agatha's pulse race.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thrill of this unexpected role reversal sent a surge of excitement through her
            veins, and she couldn't deny how absolutely beautiful Rio looked beneath her with her fingers wrapped
            possessively around Rio's throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Or now?" Rio teased, breaking Agatha from her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, suddenly aware that her fingers had tightened instinctively, and
            Rio's smirk only widened. That knowing glint in her eyes told Agatha she understood exactly where her
            mind had drifted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, never one to pass up the chance to toy with her prey, leaned down, capturing
            Rio's lips in a kiss that started slow but quickly turned heated. She deepened it just enough,
            letting</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">her teeth graze Rio's lower lip, savoring the little moan that escaped
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a wicked smile, Agatha pulled back, watching the flicker of frustration in
            Rio's eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she murmured, her voice dripping with playful finality. "I'm
            hungry."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Rio could pull her back, Agatha loosened her hold on Rio's throat and
            rolled off, leaving her sprawled across the bed. Settling herself against the headboard, Agatha leaned back
            with a self-satisfied smirk, watching Rio with that teasing glint in her eyes, fully aware of the effect she
            was leaving behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned loudly, not sparing Agatha a single glance as she swung her legs out of
            bed and strode out of the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze immediately zeroed in on her, trailing up Rio's bare back and
            catching sight of the deep, red claw marks running down her shoulder. She felt a surge of satisfaction
            mixed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">with surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even remember making those marks, though, in fairness, the entire day
            had been a blur. They'd been at it for God knows how long .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Rio gone from the room, leaving no distractions-no smirk, no hands, no
            teasing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remarks-Agatha let herself breathe, her mind finally catching up to the whirlwind
            that had been their morning and now afternoon. She sat back against the headboard, staring absently at the
            empty doorway, feeling the magnitude of what was unfolding between them settle in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were actually doing this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No games, no rules, no hidden agendas.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just two consenting adults, tangled up in something that felt more real than anything
            Agatha had allowed herself to feel in years. She couldn't quite believe it-that she'd let herself
            cross this line with Rio, with feelings involved, no less.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This could go two ways: either really, really good, or- God -it could go so, so
            bad.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the weight of that thought settle over her, the uncertainty twisting in
            her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only that-here she was, trying to navigate what could very well be the first
            real</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">relationship of her life-not only with a woman, but with someone sixteen years
            younger than her, and, just to complicate things further, her employee.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was madness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Complete and utter madness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her therapist was going to have a field day with this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She heard footsteps approaching, and then Rio was there, holding out a bottle of
            water.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took it, watching as Rio crawled into bed beside her, eyes quietly assessing,
            a hint of something more in her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Want me to order in, or would you rather go out?" Rio asked, her voice
            casual, but her eyes searching Agatha's with a loaded intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought against the urge to react to that-to keep her face impassive. It was a
            simple question on the surface, yet it carried so much more weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going out together-just the two of them, outside the familiar confines of work or the
            bedroom-was uncharted territory. Up until now, they had worked, they had fucked, and that had been the
            extent of it. Even the night they'd spent together at the gay club could be</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">excused as just another part of their complicated work life as they searched for a
            lead on the Vanguard case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And judging by the way Rio held her gaze, she knew exactly what she was
            asking:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are we keeping this behind closed doors or what?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind raced, her thoughts colliding as she considered the implications of
            Rio's question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going out together, where anyone might see them, where their dynamic would stretch
            beyond the confines of their familiar walls-was she ready for that?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt like peeling back another layer, acknowledging this thing between them in a
            way that wasn't just between them but open to the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, the thought didn't scare her as much as it should have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This really is madness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never one to show her cards too easily, Agatha forced a smirk, leaning back as if
            perfectly at ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think I need some fresh air," Agatha drawled, casting a wry glance
            around Rio's impeccably styled, plant-filled apartment. She gestured toward the greenery surrounding
            them. "Even with your personal rainforest in here, it doesn't quite manage to filter out the...
            lingering scent of sex."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into a knowing smile, that slowly grew into that real one that
            had Agatha's heart hammering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Out it is, then," she said, the finality in her tone leaving no room for
            doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, feeling a thrill shoot through her at the thought. She wasn't
            entirely sure why this felt like such a big deal-New York was enormous, after all. Millions of people lived
            here, and the chances of her running into anyone she knew were slim to none... right?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All worries about running into someone she knew evaporated the moment Agatha stepped
            outside. Anyone who knew Agatha Harkness would never- ever -expect to see her in public wearing gray
            sweatpants and a faded navy hoodie bearing the logo of some random farm in Texas. No one in her social or
            professional circles would even think to glance her way, much less recognize her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hell, she avoided her own reflection every time they passed a mirrored building,
            barely able to reconcile this version of herself with the impeccably polished woman she usually was.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I still can't believe you ripped my clothes," Agatha hissed under her
            breath, shooting a sidelong glare at Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sighed beside her, clearly exasperated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was, after all, not the first-or second, or even third-time Agatha had brought it
            up. This had to be at least the fifth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've already apologized," Rio replied with a dry tone, but the hint of
            amusement in her tone wasn't lost on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She narrowed her eyes at Rio, fighting the urge to hip check her into oncoming
            traffic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman had a death wish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to make matters even worse, Rio was dead set on getting this food truck near
            Central Park.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha honestly couldn't decide what was worse: the clothes, the fact that Rio
            was dragging her to an actual food truck, or the itch of the polyester-cotton blend she'd been forced
            to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wear. Every part of this situation-sweatpants, street food, scratchy fabric-felt like
            an affront to her usual standards.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But wasn't that the point?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio herself didn't fit into Agatha's usual standards.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was everything Agatha didn't expect, didn't plan for, didn't even
            know she wanted. Rio was spontaneous, unconventional, and entirely unapologetic-an impossible contradiction
            to Agatha's carefully structured world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, here she was-standing on a busy city street in sweatpants, about to order
            from a food truck that looked like it had maybe a 50/50 chance of giving her salmonella-all because of
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt Rio's hand slip around her arm, giving it a gentle squeeze, and Agatha
            looked over to find Rio smiling up at her with that genuine, unguarded smile that had an annoyingly
            infectious effect. Despite herself, Agatha felt her own lips tugging into a smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to hate this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Truly, every fiber of her being wanted to loathe the entire situation. The absurdity,
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">casualness of it all-it went against everything she thought she was. But as she stood
            there,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">feeling the crisp autumn breeze against her face, watching Rio scan the food truck
            menu with a bright, eager expression, she couldn't deny that there was something oddly freeing about
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't hate it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, deep down-in a place she rarely allowed herself to even acknowledge, a place
            that should probably stay hidden-Agatha Harkness could almost... possibly ... consider that she was starting
            to lov-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was Central Park. Children were everywhere, and it wasn't the first time
            she'd heard a kid call out to their mother since they have been here. But this voice made Agatha freeze,
            because this particular voice wasn't calling for just any mother.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha immediately whirled around, her eyes scanning the park with a sudden, urgent
            intensity. Her heart pounded as her gaze swept over the busy scene, children playing, people chatting,
            until- there .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She spotted him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky was sprinting toward her, full of boundless energy, his bright smile lighting
            up his face as he tore down the asphalt path at breakneck speed, aimed straight at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was barely a second to process his unexpected appearance before he launched
            himself into the air, a move that made her heart seize in that familiar way. Instinct took over, and she
            caught him mid-leap with practiced ease, pulling him close against her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Warmth spread through her as she held him, feeling his small arms wrap tightly around
            her neck, his laughter bubbling up as if he hadn't a care in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She set him down, and pulled back, running her fingers through Nicky's dark hair
            before cupping his face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, baby," she greeted him, her tone light but her eyes scanning the area
            around him- because why, exactly, was her son sprinting through Central Park on his own? A spark of
            protective irritation flared in her chest. "Who are you here with?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky ignored the question, his small hands coming up to her face, tracing her
            features with the same endearing concentration he'd had since he was a baby.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You were smiling. I saw it," he whispered, like he was sharing a secret.
            Her lips twitched.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Was I?" she replied, feigning innocence as she fought back a smile.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He nodded enthusiastically, his grin widening-until his gaze flicked past her
            shoulder, and his eyes went round with excitement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your mama's pretty work friend!" he practically shouted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, fuck me, Agatha knew exactly who he was looking at. She had to resist the urge
            to wish for the ground to open up and swallow her whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could feel Rio's gaze on her, practically boring into her back. She
            didn't even have to turn around to know that smug, amused smirk was plastered across Rio's
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What's up, I'm Rio," came Rio's low, gravelly voice from
            behind her, casual and confident.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes went wide at that, glancing up at Agatha with a mixture of awe and
            excitement. He tugged on her sleeve, his voice a hushed whisper, though his excitement was
            unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama, she's cool. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stifled a sigh, feeling her cheeks warm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Rio would win over her son in an instant-no effort needed, just that damn
            natural charm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened up, turning to face Rio, who was, predictably, wearing that
            infuriating smirk. But there was something else too-a raised brow, a flicker of genuine surprise in her
            eyes. Agatha opened her mouth, not even sure what she intended to say, when-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicholas!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The universe fucking hates me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha recognized that voice instantly. Turning, she saw James striding down the path
            toward them, all put together-and, naturally, his hand was entwined with that of a young blonde woman who
            looked like she'd just stepped off a runway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Christ almighty, Agatha thought, suddenly all too aware of her own appearance.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her grungy outfit, sweatpants and a faded hoodie, her hair thrown up in a messy bun,
            makeup long-since sweated off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The discomfort was sharp and immediate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned and shot a glare at Rio-because, clearly, this was all her fault. Rio,
            unbothered as ever, barely raised an eyebrow before turning back to the food truck to collect their order,
            her expression infuriatingly casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a long, exhausted sigh, quickly composing herself as she plastered on
            a polite, utterly fake smile and turned to face James and... what was her name again?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James's eyes went wide when he spotted her, and she saw him take in her
            appearance- sweatpants, messy bun, and all. He then shifted his gaze to Nicky, his expression softening as
            he stepped forward and crouched down to Nicky's level, resting his hands on his son's
            shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Buddy, you can't just take off like that," he said, his tone a gentle
            rebuke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky looked mildly chastened but then glanced up at Agatha with a shrug, as if his
            next words would justify everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's just Mom."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's forced smile tightened, and she shot Nicky a look, though she
            couldn't entirely hide her amusement. Only her son could say something like that and manage to make her
            feel simultaneously exasperated and endeared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James chuckled softly, shaking his head, and then stood up, glancing between Agatha
            and Rio with raised eyebrows. He cleared his throat, clearly choosing his words carefully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's... been a while, Agatha. Didn't expect to see you here. With,
            um... friends?" Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes and opted for a more diplomatic
            response.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just grabbing some fresh air," she replied, as casually as possible,
            though her eyes couldn't help flickering over to the woman clinging to James's arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blonde-impossibly young and beautiful, of course-gave Agatha a polite smile, her
            gaze flicking over Agatha's outfit with a look Agatha could only interpret as barely concealed
            judgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Rio turned around, food in hand, meeting James's gaze with a relaxed,
            confident grin. She handed Agatha a plate of what were likely salmonella-infused nachos, then extended her
            free hand to James.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she said smoothly, her tone effortlessly polite but unmistakably
            self-assured. "Nice to meet you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James shook her hand, looking mildly surprised at her confidence and composure.
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watched as Rio's gaze lingered on James just a beat too long, her smirk widening
            slightly, as if she were sizing him up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"James," he introduced himself, glancing at Agatha for some hint of
            explanation, but she gave him nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought the urge to laugh; even now, Rio somehow turned the moment into a game.
            And yet, oddly enough, it eased the tension, if only a little.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," James said, his voice strained but overly polite as he stepped
            back, wrapping a possessive arm around the blonde's tiny waist. "This is Amanda."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blonde gave a graceful nod, her gaze flitting over Agatha with polite disinterest
            as she extended a perfectly manicured hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nice to meet you," Agatha replied shaking her hand briefly, keeping her
            tone warm, aware of Nicky beside her, head on a swivel, watching them all closely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An awkward silence settled over the group, thick and uncomfortable, and Agatha was at
            a complete loss for how to break it. Finally, James cleared his throat, his gaze landing on her with a
            slight frown.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, can I talk to you for a moment?" he asked, tilting his head
            slightly to indicate they should step aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, already dreading whatever conversation James was about to initiate,
            but nodded, handing Rio the death nachos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio grabbed them and tilted her head toward a nearby bench, indicating where she
            would be. James crouched down to Nicky, his tone softer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Buddy, stay here with Amanda, okay? I just need to talk to your mom for a
            moment."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky nodded, glancing between his parents with a faint look of concern, but
            obediently stood next to Amanda.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking a deep breath, Agatha followed James a few paces away, bracing herself for
            whatever he had to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm... sorry about that," he murmured, his voice low and a little
            awkward. "Not exactly how I pictured introducing you to Amanda for the first time."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, folding her arms across her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky mentioned her last week," she said, offering him an easy out.
            "So, I wasn't exactly surprised."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James let out a small breath, visibly relaxing, and they both glanced back toward
            Nicky- who had, surprisingly, wandered away from Amanda and was now sitting beside Rio on the bench.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight stopped Agatha short.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't really thought about Rio interacting with Nicky yet. Sure, she knew it
            would happen eventually if things continued to go well-a thought she'd held onto cautiously, given her
            own track record. But now, watching Rio lean down to whisper something that made</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky stifle a giggle, her heart gave an unexpected lurch. Nicky didn't usually
            take to strangers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither did Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet here was Rio Vidal, somehow bridging a gap neither of them typically allowed
            anyone to cross. And she was doing it with a quiet ease that surprised Agatha even more than she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wanted to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James, meanwhile, had noticed too, a slight frown creasing his brow as he looked from
            Nicky and Rio's easy laughter to Amanda, who was standing awkwardly to the side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is she a coworker?" he asked, glancing back at Agatha. "I don't
            remember her from the firm."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned back to James, weighing her options carefully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Technically, Rio was a coworker, and she could say just that, keeping things simple
            and sidestepping any complications. But a part of her, the part that reveled in defying</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expectations and catching people off guard, couldn't resist the allure of
            honesty. This was too good an opportunity to pass up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Especially after every woman James had trounced in front of her over the past 3
            years. Still, there was a nagging hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she said it out loud... if she actually claimed Rio as more than a coworker, then
            it would be real, wouldn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, as she glanced back at Rio with Nicky, who was now laughing with that
            unguarded joy she rarely saw, Agatha felt the words forming anyway. She looked back at James, a faint smile
            curling on her lips, and took a steadying breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Actually," Agatha began, her voice steady as she carefully tested each
            word, "Rio isn't just a coworker."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James's brows knit together in confusion, and Agatha resisted the urge to roll
            her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was he always this dense?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio is... someone I've been seeing," she said, drawing the words out
            slowly, lifting her chin slightly as she held his gaze, watching his reaction unfold with a certain
            satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, James simply blinked, his expression shifting as the realization
            settled in. He opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it, clearly grappling with the
            unexpected news.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Seeing," he finally repeated, his voice tinged with surprise. "As
            in... dating?" Agatha fought to keep a smirk at bay.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, James," she replied, her tone deliberately calm. "As in
            dating."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as he processed this, glancing back toward the bench where Rio and Nicky
            were still talking, Nicky looking more animated than he had with anyone Agatha had introduced him to in a
            long time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James looked slightly thrown, maybe even a bit unsettled, and it was, Agatha had to
            admit, a rather satisfying sight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a pause, he cleared his throat. "I didn't... expect that."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked at her, then back at Rio, his brows furrowing. "How old is
            she?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms and leveling him with an unimpressed look.
            "Really?" she said, arching an eyebrow. "You're actually asking me that?" James held
            up his hands defensively, his face reddening slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's just... she seems young, that's all."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And your girlfriend, doesn't?" Agatha replied sharply, her gaze
            flicking pointedly toward Amanda, who was scrolling on her phone, oblivious. "What is she,
            twenty-five?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James shifted, looking uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Touché," he muttered, clearly unsure how to respond. James cleared
            his throat, visibly flustered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't know you were..." He trailed off, his gaze shifting awkwardly
            between Agatha and Rio, clearly at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, waiting for him to finish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Didn't know I was... what, James?" she prompted, her voice cool and
            steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He fumbled for a moment, glancing around as if the right words were hiding somewhere
            nearby.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't know you were... seeing someone. I mean, dating someone... like
            that ," he finished lamely, his cheeks coloring slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but smirk, crossing her arms. "There's a lot you
            don't know, apparently."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James looked away, his expression caught between surprise and something resembling
            discomfort.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could see him trying to reconcile the Agatha he thought he knew with the one
            standing in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Get in line, buddy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because honestly?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was still trying to reconcile it herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was new territory-unfamiliar and terrifying in ways she hadn't anticipated.
            Rio had somehow cracked through walls Agatha had once thought impenetrable. And yet, here she was, actually
            owning up to it, openly claiming the woman who had turned her world upside down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Agatha said, clapping her hands together, desperate to wrap up this
            surreal encounter. "Is that all?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James, still visibly processing everything, nodded blankly. But then something seemed
            to click, and he cleared his throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, right. Parent-teacher conference is next Thursday," he added.
            "Nicky brought home a reminder in his bag yesterday."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, a flicker of relief grounding her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Got it," she replied, slipping back into a more familiar rhythm.
            "I'll be there."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced over at Nicky, still animatedly chatting with Rio on the bench, and felt
            an unexpected calm settle over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio looked up, catching Agatha's gaze, and she smiled- that smile, the
            real one, the one that always managed to tug at something deep inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A heartbeat later, Nicky turned and grinned at her, his face lighting up with the
            same warmth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught as she looked at them, side by side. She hadn't
            noticed it before, but they shared the same easy, unguarded smile. And somehow, both of those smiles
            affected her in exactly the same way, stirring something fierce and protective within her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a small moment, but it anchored her in a way she hadn't expected.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing Rio and Nicky together, their smiles mirroring each other, felt like something
            fitting quietly into place, like a missing piece she hadn't even realized was gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart skipped, and she took a breath, steadying herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was her life now-messy, unexpected, so far from the pristine, controlled image
            she'd cultivated for herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, somehow, standing here with Nicky and Rio, it felt more... real. James's
            voice snapped her out of her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright, well... we should get going," he said, gesturing for Amanda to
            follow. "Right," Agatha replied, her tone light but her eyes lingering on Rio and Nicky. James
            looked at her, his gaze softening just a bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You look happy, Agatha," he said quietly, almost as if he hadn't meant
            to say it out loud. Agatha glanced at him, surprised.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for once, she didn't have a biting comeback.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she gave him a small nod, an acknowledgment of a truth that she was only
            beginning to understand herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back at Rio's place, they'd barely managed to get through their food truck
            meals before</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">collapsing onto the couch, too full and content to even think about moving. Agatha
            would never openly admit how good the food was, but Rio had caught her eyes widening at the first bite, the
            reluctant approval in her expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha might've kept up the façade, but Rio knew better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now they were sprawled together on the couch, wrapped in the cozy lull of each
            other's presence. To her surprise, Rio curled into her, tucking herself under Agatha's arm with
            an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ease that felt strangely natural. And, even more surprising, Agatha found herself
            liking it. She wrapped her arms around Rio, guiding her down to lay her head against her chest, feeling the
            warmth of Rio's body settle into her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room was dim, and a documentary about whales- of all things -played softly on the
            screen, courtesy of Rio's pick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha found herself listening more to the rhythmic rise and fall of Rio's
            breathing than the narration. It was quiet, peaceful, and something about it felt deeply intimate, a
            simple</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">closeness she hadn't known she'd ever want with someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand moved through Rio's hair almost absently, her fingers grazing
            her scalp as she traced small, soothing circles.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio murmured into her chest, her voice soft, almost
            hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers paused, and she looked down, only to see that Rio wasn't
            looking up at her. Instead, her gaze was fixed forward, as if she were reluctant to make eye contact.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This... this feels really good-with you," Rio admitted quietly, her tone
            so soft it was as if she'd barely allowed herself to say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The vulnerability in Rio's voice made Agatha's chest tighten, and then warmth
            settled in there. For a moment, she simply watched Rio, feeling the weight of the admission between them as
            something tender filled the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, willing herself to action, Agatha reached down, hooking her fingers gently
            under Rio's chin, lifting her face until their eyes met. She brought her other hand up, brushing a few
            silky strands of hair back from Rio's face, her fingers lingering against her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She searched Rio's eyes, finding something there-vulnerability, maybe even a
            glimmer of hesitation-that made her heart ache. It wasn't often she allowed herself to truly look at
            someone this closely, to let the walls drop just enough to see what lay beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze held a softness that Agatha hadn't seen before, a quiet openness
            that made</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart stutter. For a moment, neither of them spoke; they simply looked
            at each other, the silence filled with all the unspoken things they'd both been too guarded to
            say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's thumb brushed lightly along Rio's cheekbone, a small, tender gesture
            she hadn't planned but couldn't resist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It feels good to me too," she murmured, her voice low.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes softened even more at Agatha's words, her lips curving into a
            small, almost shy smile that seemed so unlike her usual confident smirk. She leaned into Agatha's touch,
            letting her hand rest over Agatha's on her cheek, grounding them both in that quiet, fragile
            moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For once, words felt unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, Agatha let her thumb graze along Rio's cheek, then slip down to trace
            the line of her jaw, savoring the warmth of her skin. She was surprised by how much she enjoyed just...
            this. No pretense, no need to prove anything to each other. Just the steady beat of her own heart, the
            comfortable weight of Rio lying against her, and the soft glow of the tv filling the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't used to this-this quiet, steady intimacy that didn't demand
            anything more than just being here, in this moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Think you could get used to it?" Rio asked softly, her voice barely more
            than a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched at that, as she ran her thumb across Rio's cheekbone,
            heart aching with a quite vulnerability in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think," she replied, her voice a little rough as she forced the words
            out into the world-to Rio. "I think I already am."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened a little bit at the confession, but then-her lips curved into
            a smile at Agatha's words, and-oh, that smile was dangerous, as Agatha felt her heart clench.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could fully process it, Rio leaned down, her lips capturing Agatha's
            in a soft, lingering kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then- knock, knock -a sharp rap at the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused mid-kiss, huffing in mild annoyance against Agatha's lips before
            placing a quick peck there, her own frustration clear as she reluctantly pulled away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sorry, it's probably my neighbor," she said with an exasperated sigh
            as she stood up. "She's a sweetheart, but she has about zero concept of technology and probably
            messed up her TV again. She'll be desperate to get back to her shows. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shook her head with a wry smile before heading to the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a quiet laugh, settling back on the couch as she watched Rio head for
            the door, feeling a strange, unexpected fondness for the simple domesticity of it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her attention back to the TV, waiting for Rio to return, but a few seconds
            later, she heard Rio's voice calling out, her tone a mix of confusion and surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Um...Agatha?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat up, peering over the back of the couch to see Rio standing there, talking
            to some guy at the door. When Rio turned, her brow furrowed, and she looked at Agatha with mild
            bewilderment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He's... actually here for you," Rio said, confusion still evident in
            her expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Equally puzzled, Agatha tilted her head before getting off the couch and walking to
            the door. There stood a young man, clad in a hoodie and a backpack, unmistakably a bike messenger. He
            glanced at her with the detached look of someone just trying to finish his last delivery for the day.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You...Agatha Harkness?" he asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she replied, eyeing him cautiously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He gave a short nod, removing his backpack and pulling out a sealed manila
            folder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is for you," he said, holding it out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze dropped to the folder, her name printed in bold letters across the
            front. Years in the legal world had trained her not to touch anything without first considering the
            source.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the fact that it had been delivered to Rio's address instead of her own only
            made her more wary.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who sent this?" she asked skeptically, her eyes narrowing. "Some guy
            named Billy," he replied with a casual shrug.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relief washed over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy had access to her location, and this wasn't the first time he'd sent
            her something on a weekend or at some random location. She took the folder from him with a nod, and the
            messenger promptly turned to leave.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha weighed the folder in her hands, curiosity prickled at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What on earth could Billy have sent that couldn't wait until Monday?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio closed the door, eyeing the folder with mild interest before stepping closer, her
            voice dropping to a low murmur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Looks like you've got some work to do," she said softly, leaning in.
            "I'll be in the shower. Consider it an incentive to get done with whatever that is...
            quickly."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words brushed against Agatha's ear, and before Agatha could respond, Rio
            flashed her a wicked grin and disappeared down the hallway, leaving Agatha with the folder-and a sudden,
            very intense motivation to make quick work of whatever this was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat down on the couch, slipping a fingernail under the tape and tearing it
            open. She pulled out the contents, her brow furrowing as she lifted a paper-clipped stack of photographs. At
            the top was a handwritten note, paper-clipped to the first page, and as her eyes scanned the words, a chill
            ran down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drop the case, or face the cost.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heart pounding, she stared at the note, then hesitantly flipped to the photos beneath
            it. The first few were of Rio alone-candid shots of her at a coffee shop, picking up groceries, browsing
            through a plant store. Each image felt uncomfortably close, intimate, as though someone had been following
            her at every turn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came the photos of them together-Agatha and Rio walking side by side in Central
            Park, stepping into a town car, standing in the alley outside the Red Light. There was a shot of them
            kissing outside Rio's door, another of them together in the office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the final, brutal image: Rio and Nicky, sitting on a bench in Central Park,
            smiling at each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind raced, her thoughts a frantic blur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Billy didn't send these.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bike messenger-the delivery- it was a setup.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another second's hesitation, she jammed the photos back into the folder
            and bolted towards the door, running barefoot down the stairs, her pulse pounding in her ears as she flew
            down all five flights.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She burst out onto the street, her eyes darting around, heart hammering. And then-she
            spotted him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bike messenger walking away from her, about half way down the street.
            "Hey!" she yelled, her voice cutting through the noise of the street.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned, glancing over his shoulder, and her blood ran cold at the sight of his
            smirk. He gave her one last mocking look before slipping into car next to him. A chill swept over her as the
            car pulled away from the curb, gliding in her direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In slow motion, Agatha watched the black Cadillac roll past her, its tinted windows
            concealing whoever was inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she knew that car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same make, model, and ominous presence as the one that had sat outside Brooke
            Sinclair's apartment before her murder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart pounded as the realization crashed over her, each beat hammering
            against her ribcage like a warning siren.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were threatening her-no, they were threatening Rio to get to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They hadn't just followed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They'd delivered the threat right to Rio's door, right to the person Agatha
            had let too close, and who now, unknowingly, had been pulled into Vanguard's deadly crosshairs.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her pulse raced, her mind snapping from image to image-the photos of Rio alone,
            living her life, unaware of the eyes watching her every move; the final, brutal photo of Rio and Nicky in
            the park. And now this-the Cadillac lurking right outside Rio's fucking building.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They knew exactly where Rio lived.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gravity of it settled over her, sharp and suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath came in short, jagged gasps, her vision blurring as panic clawed
            its way up her throat. She forced herself to reach into her pocket, her fingers trembling as she unlocked
            her phone. Her heart roared in her ears, drowning out nearly everything else, but she managed to hold the
            phone to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second she heard the line connect, she spoke, her voice barely steady.
            "Emergency partner meeting. Now ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a pause, then an exasperated sigh on the other end.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Jen said, her tone laced with disbelief. "It's
            Saturday..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jen," Agatha whispered, her voice breaking as she pressed her hand against
            her chest, feeling her heart's frantic, uneven rhythm beneath her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tears stung her eyes, blurring her vision. "Jen- please. "</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could almost hear Jen processing the gravity of that single word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha never said please.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll call the others," Jen replied finally, her voice steady. "Be
            there soon."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The line went dead, but the echo of her own panic reverberated, a tight, suffocating
            grip on her chest as she stood on the street, struggling to hold herself together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved as though detached from her own body, her steps automatic as she climbed
            the five flights back to Rio's apartment. The door was still open where she'd left it, a
            silent</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reminder of the chaos she'd just fled. The ringing in her ears only grew louder,
            like the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">aftermath of a bomb blast, filling her mind and making her surroundings feel distant,
            surreal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She barely registered her movements as she crossed the threshold, each step carrying
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">closer to the sound of running water. The steam drifted out from the bathroom, and
            through the fogged glass, she could see Rio's form, hazy but unmistakably relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked back tears, her heart twisting painfully as she reached for the shower
            door. Rio turned to her immediately, a playful smile lighting up her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Done already?" she asked, running a hand through her wet hair as her smile
            morphed into that familiar, lecherous grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart clenched, the panic thrumming beneath the surface, a fierce battle
            between her need to protect and the terror clawing its way up her spine. She fought with every ounce
            of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">control she had to keep her face calm, her voice steady, masking the chaos
            inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have to go into the office," Agatha said, forcing a disappointed smile
            she hoped would mask the tremor in her voice. "Client emergency."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused, her hands still in her hair, the playful glint in her eyes fading as her
            grin slipped away. She studied Agatha, a flicker of concern crossing her face as she took in the tension
            Agatha was trying so desperately to hide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Everything okay?" Rio asked, her tone softening, the concern evident in
            her gaze. Agatha swallowed, nodding a little too quickly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just... something that can't wait. You know how it is."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't look entirely convinced, but she simply gave a slow nod, her eyes
            searching Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Anything I can help with?" Rio asked, her voice gentle but steady.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart lurched, caught off guard by the simple offer of support. She
            swallowed, trying to steady herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Um-yes, actually," she replied, the words escaping before she could fully
            process them. "Can you stay here? Don't go anywhere. I need you... on call."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened slightly, a flash of confusion crossing her face as she tried
            to understand Agatha's request.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't blame her; it didn't make a ton of sense. But until she could
            figure out how to handle this, she needed Rio to stay put until she figured out what to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Rio murmured, her expression still puzzled but trusting, nodding
            slowly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated for a moment, her heart pounding as she looked at Rio. And then,
            without thinking, she reached forward, her sleeve soaking through as she gripped Rio's arm and pulled
            her close, her mouth finding Rio's in a kiss that was anything but gentle. It was fierce, desperate, a
            kiss that seemed to hold a thousand words Agatha couldn't bring herself to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She poured everything into it-her unspoken fears, her need to protect Rio, and the
            quiet, terrifying realization of just how much Rio meant to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew, deep down, that this was the kind of kiss you give someone when
            you're not sure you'll ever get to kiss them again. When she pulled back, Rio's eyes opened
            slowly, and in that brief, vulnerable moment, Agatha saw the recognition there-Rio felt it too, the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">finality of it, even though Agatha hadn't said a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha... don't," Rio whispered, a hint of panic slipping into her
            voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a step back, her heart aching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry," she murmured, her voice breaking as she fought to keep the
            tears at bay. "Agatha-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha was already turning, heading for the door, her vision blurring. She heard
            the water shut off abruptly, and then the frantic shuffle of Rio moving to follow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, get your ass back here!" Rio's voice rang out, filled with
            desperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha didn't stop. She reached the front door, grabbed the file from the
            table, and slipped out, closing the door behind her as the first tear broke free. By the time she was on the
            stairs, her tears were falling unchecked, her heart splitting with every step she took away from Rio.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha kept walking, her mind a whirlwind of chaotic thoughts, her heart breaking
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every step. She barely registered the descent down the staircase, each step a dull
            echo in her ears. When she finally reached the street, she saw Dan already waiting by the curb, his</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression impassive as he held the door open for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slipped into the back seat, her hand immediately reaching for the
            intercom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Office," she said, her voice barely steady, and as Dan pulled away, she
            leaned back, exhaling shakily.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just as the car began to move, she caught a flash of movement out the
            window.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had burst through the building's front door, wrapped in a robe, her hair
            dripping wet, eyes wild and searching. Her gaze locked onto Agatha's through the dark tinted glass, and
            Agatha's heart twisted sharply, her throat tightening as she fought the urge to stop the car.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a brief, excruciating moment, their eyes locked through the tinted glass,
            Rio's gaze so full of desperation and hurt that it felt like a knife twisting deep inside Agatha's
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every fiber of her being screamed to stop, to go back, to let herself want this-to
            believe she could keep it, protect it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the car pulled away, something inside Agatha broke, a raw, piercing ache that
            ripped through her chest so fiercely she raised a hand to her heart, as though she could somehow hold it
            together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was pointless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't ignore it anymore, couldn't pretend her heart hadn't already
            betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She loved Rio Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Loved her with a ferocity that terrified her, loved her in a way that stripped her
            bare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was only a matter of time, wasn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness wasn't meant to fall in love-she'd known that her whole life,
            had built her life around that certainty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People like her didn't get happy endings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Love was never in the cards for someone like her, and maybe that was the way it had
            to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the distance between them stretched further, the truth settled in, heavy and
            irrevocable-a raw ache pressing deep into her chest, as real as the person she'd just left
            behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd brought Rio into this mess-into the danger of the case, into her own
            chaotic life. If she wanted to keep Rio safe, to protect her from the storm gathering around the Vanguard
            case, then she had to sever the only thing tying Rio to Vanguard:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Herself.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Called into work. Had a Hobbit movie marathon, and wrote. This chapter was pretty
            much already written. So many notes in my phone in my computer. I have been eagerly awaiting this chapter
            and it was so fun to create and refine. This is probably my favorite chapter so far. I hope you guys enjoy
            it!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also just for shits and giggles I went back and renamed some chapters to be more
            inline with AAA.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha despised Jen's office. The soft hues of pastel pinks and greens, the
            strategically placed crystals glowing faintly in the dim lights, the faint scent of sage hanging in the
            air-it all screamed peaceful energy. And that energy always seemed to be at war with who Agatha was,
            especially today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she needed to be here, needed to force herself to be in this office because
            simply, she needed Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd never admit it out loud- ever -but Jennifer Kale was a damn good lawyer.
            All this</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crystals-and-harmony nonsense might give the impression of softness, of someone who
            could be pushed around.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha knew better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Underneath the serene, faux-spiritual exterior, Jen was as sharp as a scalpel and
            just as deadly. She didn't just argue cases; she dissected them, layer by layer, until her opponents
            didn't even realize they'd been gutted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she did it with a smile. It was infuriating.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, begrudgingly, Agatha respected it-even if the sight of an amethyst cluster
            perched smugly on Jen's desk made her want to roll her eyes into next week.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paced the office, the heel of her boots sounding against the polished floor.
            She had arrived five minutes ago, and there was still no sign of the other partners.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes flicked down to the intricate rug in the middle of the room-no doubt some
            sacred handwoven artifact from a Tibetan monastery or whatever the hell it was. Agatha took a</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">small, guilty pleasure in working a deliberate line along the edge of it with every
            sharp twist of the heel of her boot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she twisted a little harder than necessary, well, it wasn't like she could
            destroy anything</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">else in the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she really needed to destroy something.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pacing quickened, the deliberate grind of her heel against the rug
            becoming sharper, more forceful. She clenched her fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms as a
            storm of emotions churned inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heartbroken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And fucking terrified.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a cocktail of feelings she didn't know how to handle, feelings that
            pressed against the very being of herself, with such a force that it borderline breaking her down
            entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hated how exposed she felt, how vulnerable. Vulnerability wasn't her
            thing-control was. Power.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Authority.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet here she was, spiraling over things she couldn't fix, couldn't
            change, couldn't</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath hitched as she stopped dead in the middle of Jen's office, staring
            blankly at one of the soft pastel paintings hanging on the wall. The peaceful, meditative vibe mocked her,
            a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cruel reminder of everything she was not. Everything she couldn't pretend to
            be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart felt like it was caught in a vice, raw and aching in a way she couldn't
            push aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All those pictures of Rio-the danger she was in was weaving through her chest like a
            needle pulling sharp, stinging thread. And Nicky... God, she couldn't even think about Nicky</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">without feeling that protective fear flare hot and fast, adding fuel to the fire
            already burning inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swiped a hand across her face, letting out a bitter laugh that sounded more
            like a broken exhale.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell was she going to do?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, voices reached her ears, pulling Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. She
            turned, and the wave of relief that coursed through her at the sight of the three women walking toward her
            was startling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Agatha respected her partners- as colleagues but they were also the closest
            things she had to friends.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha had always prided herself on not needing anyone. She could fight her
            battles, just as she always had, alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was who she was. Who she'd always been.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, standing there, watching Jen, Alice, and Lilia approach in their varying
            states of dress, something stirred inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice, a season ticket holder to the Knicks, was wearing a jersey and sneakers,
            clearly having been dragged away from a game. Lilia, wore a full ball gown, as if she'd walked directly
            off a gala's red carpet. And Jen- Jen -was surprisingly casual, in leggings and a loose-fitting sweater,
            the most dressed down Agatha had ever seen her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mismatched appearances were a dead giveaway. These women had dropped whatever
            they were doing, without hesitation, and come running the moment Agatha called.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That realization hit her harder than she expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, her throat tightened, and she fought the unfamiliar feeling threatening
            to overwhelm her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They came for me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't something Agatha was used to. Relying on others? Asking for
            help?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That wasn't in her playbook.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, here they were-showing up for her when she needed them most, without question.
            And, for a woman who had spent her entire life convinced she didn't need anyone, Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harkness suddenly became- painfully -aware of just how much she needed these
            women.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen, Lilia and Alice walked into Jen's office, each of them coming to an abrupt
            stop as their eyes fell on Agatha. The varying degrees of surprise written across their faces were
            impossible to miss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's when Agatha realized- shit -she was still dressed in Rio's
            clothes. Baggy gray sweatpants, an old, faded hoodie, and a makeup-less face, no doubt blotchy and red from
            the tears that fell earlier. The sight of herself reflected back at her in their reactions sent a flash
            of</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">heat through her cheeks, though she held her ground, forcing herself not to shrink
            under their scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she saw it in their faces-the shift.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The realization.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was one thing to get called in for an emergency meeting on a weekend. They were
            partners, after all. This wasn't the first time, nor would it be the last.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha's state -disheveled and vulnerable was the glaring red flag. It
            screamed that something was really, really wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen was the first to recover, her sharp gaze softening slightly as she tilted her
            head. "What happened?" she asked, her tone steady but laced with concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a loud exhale, the sound almost sharp in the otherwise quiet room. She
            didn't even know where to start-didn't have the words-so instead, she simply stepped forward and
            handed Jen the folder, letting the pictures and the note inside speak for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, she stepped back, crossing her arms tightly over her chest as if it
            could shield her from the wave of vulnerability creeping up on her. She hated this feeling-hated the way it
            made her feel exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen opened the folder, her expression unreadable as her eyes flicked over the
            contents. Beside her, Alice and Lilia pressed in, craning their necks to see, their curiosity and concern
            palpable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha just stood there, watching, feeling like her entire world was laid bare
            before them. Because this wasn't just professional. This wasn't just another case or a work</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">emergency.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was personal- deeply personal -and they were about to see it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood stiffly, arms crossed, watching as they flipped through the images one
            by one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw clenched as their expressions shifted from confusion to shock, and then all
            three women's eyes widened simultaneously. Agatha didn't even need to look to know which photo
            they'd landed on- the photo of her and Rio kissing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's head snapped up, her expression caught somewhere between disbelief and
            exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're sleeping with a first-year associate?" she asked, her tone
            incredulous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flush of embarrassment prickled up Agatha's spine. It was wildly out of
            character for her. She knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she wasn't about to let Jen or anyone else see her squirm. She forced herself
            to glare, planting her hands on her hips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can we maybe just concentrate on the death threats for now?" she growled,
            her voice cutting through the tension. "You can report me to HR later."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice let out a low impressed whistle, Lilia glanced sharply at Jen, and Jen-
            thankfully let it go-closed her mouth, though her raised eyebrows said enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go to the last one," Agatha snapped, pointing at the folder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen gave her a pointed look but complied, flipping through the photos until the final
            image came into view-the one of Nicky and Rio sitting together on the park bench.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room went dead silent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the air shift as they all took in the photo, the meaning of it sinking
            in. The sight of Nicky there, his smile so carefree, paired with Rio-someone who shouldn't have been a
            target but now clearly was-hit differently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus," Alice muttered under her breath, breaking the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia's face was tight with something that looked an awful lot like anger, her
            jaw set as she slowly looked back up at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's head snapped up, her eyes locking onto Agatha's with a mix of concern
            and anger simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When did you get these?" she asked, her voice sharp and steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Almost an hour ago," Agatha replied, exhaling slowly, as though the words
            themselves were a burden. "A messenger, under the guise of delivering something from Billy, dropped
            them off at Rio's front door. For me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw tightened, and she clenched her hands into fists to steady herself.
            "They're watching her. Watching her place. They knew I was there."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung heavy in the room, but Agatha wasn't done. She swallowed hard, her
            throat dry, before continuing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Those pictures from the park," she said, her voice catching for the
            briefest of moments before she pushed on, steeling herself. " With Nicky ." Her chest tightened,
            and she had to take a breath to ground herself. "Those were taken today. Earlier today."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weight of her words dropped like a stone in the room, and Jen's hand curled
            tightly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">around the closed folder, her jaw clenching as her gaze flicked toward Alice and
            Lilia, who were both uncharacteristically silent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's Vanguard," Agatha said, her voice low but steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words rang through the space like a bell, sharp and reverberating, leaving an
            unmistakable tension in their wake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's grip on the folder tightened, her expression shifting to something darker,
            sharper. She moved forward and dropped the folders on the table between them, they scattered out, and Agatha
            had to force her eyes away from them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're sure?" Jen finally asked, her tone careful but urgent.
            Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line, but she nodded.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who else has the resources, the motive, and the audacity to pull something like
            this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gestured sharply toward the pictures, her frustration laced with anger bleeding
            into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This has Vanguard's fingerprints all over it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She drew in a steadying breath, her gaze hardening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's not a coincidence that the second I finally get my jury trial they
            start threatening me. They know I have them. The evidence Rio uncovered is going to fucking bury them.
            "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice dropped, the weight of her words landing like a hammer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And judging by those pictures of us in the office..." She trailed off, her
            jaw clenching as she looked back at the folder. "We've clearly been breached. They know exactly
            what we have on them. They know they can't explain what we found-so they're trying to squash it
            before we even get to court."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen exhaled sharply, her lips pressing into a thin line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've got them on the run. They're scared," she said.
            "That's the only reason they'd escalate like this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Alice muttered darkly, her fingers curling into fists. "They
            should be." But Agatha ran her hands through her hair in frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Scared doesn't make them any less dangerous. It makes them reckless.
            "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And desperate," Lilia added, her voice low and measured, each word landing
            like the strike of a hammer. "A dangerous combination."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, her sharp gaze settling on Agatha, piercing through the tension like a
            blade. It was a look that always managed to unnerve Agatha, as though Lilia could see straight through her
            defenses to the vulnerable core beneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, there was something steadying about it, too-something that made Agatha feel,
            for once, like she wasn't alone in carrying the weight of this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you want to do?" Lilia asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question lingered in the air, heavy with meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met Lilia's gaze, her mind racing as she considered the next steps, the
            risks, the consequences. This wasn't just about her anymore-it was about so much more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The payout on this case..." Agatha began, instinctively reaching for the
            familiar ground of practicality, of numbers and logistics.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Fuck the payout," Alice interrupted sharply, her voice cutting through
            the tension like a knife. It was uncharacteristically blunt, even for her. "Our books are solid. We
            don't need it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off. It wasn't like Alice to dismiss a
            financial gain so</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">easily, and for her to do so now only underscored the gravity of the situation. This
            wasn't just about money or winning a case anymore-this was personal, and they all knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the familiar slipping out of reach, Agatha instinctively curled her arms around
            herself, as if trying to hold something steady within.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What did she want to do?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had been her white whale. The thing she'd been chasing for years,
            pouring her energy, her drive, her life into defeating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was supposed to be everything. Her crowning achievement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her ultimate victory. Or so she'd thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because now, with this threat hanging over Rio and Nicky, it was like a cold light
            had been cast over everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Vanguard felt small-insignificant, even. What was winning against them
            compared to this ? Compared to the people who actually mattered?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't even a choice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard was nothing- nothing -compared to them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But at the same time-could Agatha really let them get away with this? Let them
            silence her, just as they'd silenced Brooke Sinclair? The thought clawed at her, hot and furious.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could still see Brooke's parents, their eyes hollow with grief, their pain a
            tangible weight in the room as they mourned the daughter stolen from them. Agatha had promised them justice-
            sworn it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, she was standing at the edge of a decision that could betray that
            promise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The image of Brooke lingered, but it was Nicky's face took her place. The memory
            of him so weak and frail in the hospital bed, of her nearly losing him-the suffocating fear, the pain she
            never wanted to feel again-made her chest tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke's parents had lost their child.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had come terrifyingly close to the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gritted her teeth, the tension curling through her body like a vice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Letting Vanguard walk away, letting them silence her after everything they'd
            done, wasn't just a betrayal of her work-it was a betrayal of Brooke's memory. Of her parents'
            pain. Of everything Agatha stood for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't- wouldn't -let them win. But the cost of fighting back?</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what truly terrified her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to stand taller as she turned to Jen, her
            voice steady despite the storm raging inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That security company we had to hire," she started, "for that
            environmental terrorist group threatening the firm when we represented Freeman Gas over those fracking
            violations-were they good?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room went silent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's sharp gaze snapped to Agatha, understanding flickering to life in her eyes.
            She didn't answer immediately, her lips pressing into a thin line as she considered the weight of</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's question- and what it implied . "Agatha... are you
            sure-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Were they good? " Agatha repeated sharply, her voice cutting through the
            tension like a blade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no room for hesitation, no space for doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen straightened, her shoulders squaring as she locked eyes with Agatha. Her
            expression was calm, but the weight of the moment hung heavy between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They were good," she answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded once, absorbing the answer, her mind already racing ahead to the next
            steps. The die was cast.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no turning back now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is my mess. I can foot the bill," Agatha said, her tone firm but
            weary, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia clicked her tongue in disapproval, her expression hardening as she stepped into
            Agatha's personal space-looking her dead in the eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Lilia said firmly, her voice carrying a finality that left no room
            for argument. "They come after one of us, they come after all of us."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the unwavering solidarity in Lilia's tone.
            She opened her mouth to protest, but the look in Lilia's eyes made her stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just determination.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was loyalty-unshakeable and fierce.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen and Alice followed suit, stepping forward to join Lilia, forming an unspoken wall
            around Agatha. None of them said a word, but their expressions mirrored Lilia's resolve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The message was clear: if they wanted Agatha, they had to get through them
            first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time in a long time, Agatha felt something unfamiliar but not
            unwelcome-a strange, quiet relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, forcing down the swell of emotion that curled inside her. It
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">comforting in a way that made her uneasy, something she wasn't used to letting
            herself feel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence stretched, heavy but not uncomfortable, and Agatha shifted, her usual
            sharp edge creeping back in to steady herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I swear to god, if one of you tries to hug me, I will hit you," she
            deadpanned, breaking the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen snorted, Alice let out a bark of laughter, and even Lilia's lips twitched
            into the faintest hint of a smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't flatter yourself, Harkness," Alice teased.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, but the tension in the room eased, replaced by a quiet,
            determined unity. Whatever came next, she wasn't facing it alone-and for once, she let herself accept
            that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are we doing about Vidal?" Jen asked, breaking the moment, her eyes
            narrowing as she shot Agatha a look that made it clear she wasn't letting go of the topic anytime
            soon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met her gaze, a flicker of frustration crossing her features before she
            sighed, running a hand through her hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She needs her own security detail. So does Nicky." Agatha's voice
            softened, a rare vulnerability slipping through her usually sharp exterior. "But I don't want
            either of them to know."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen raised a brow at that, giving Agatha a look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I understand not wanting Nicky to know," she said cautiously. "But
            Vidal-she should know."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Agatha growled, her tone brooking no argument. "This is my mess.
            She doesn't need to know . I'll take her off the case. She can report to you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Me ?" Jen asked, startled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, exasperation etched into her features.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't act like you don't want her on your team," she hissed.
            "She's the best associate we've seen walk through these doors in years."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice raised her hand, looking between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Umm - why does Jen get her?" she asked, clearly offended. Agatha pinched
            the bridge of her nose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't care-you can share her for all I care. But she cannot work for me
            anymore," Agatha said, her tone clipped, frustration rolling off her in waves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh yeah?" Jen shot back mockingly. "Did you come to that brilliant
            conclusion before or after you slept with her?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed dangerously, and her middle finger shot up in a gesture
            that felt almost reflexive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh... real cute," Jen muttered, matching Agatha's glare with a pointed
            look of her own, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to fire back, because, honestly, she needed this-the back and
            forth, the sharp exchange. It was grounding, familiar, almost comforting in its absurdity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Um... Agatha," Lilia interjected, her tone hesitant but firm.
            "What?" Agatha snapped, turning to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia tilted her head to the side, subtly nodding toward the glass door. Agatha
            followed her gaze, and her heart nearly stopped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood outside the door, arms crossed over her chest, her sharp eyes narrowed at
            Agatha. The weight of her gaze was enough to make Agatha feel like she was back in the principal's
            office, caught red-handed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Ohhh... someone's in trouble ," Jen sang, her delight barely
            concealed, leaning slightly toward Agatha with a smug grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jen," Agatha hissed, whirling on her with all the fury she could muster.
            "I swear to god, I will break every single crystal in this fucking office."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's eyes widened briefly before she composed herself, fixing Agatha with a
            serious look. "That's like... really bad karma, Agatha. So, just know-that's on
            you."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out an exasperated growl, bringing her hands up in a mock-strangling
            motion, teeth bared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nope!" Lilia interjected, stepping in like the seasoned peacekeeper she
            was. Her tone was calm but firm, cutting through the escalating tension. "We're not doing this.
            We're going to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">call the security detail. They have a rapid response team, and I'm sure
            they'll be here shortly to discuss logistics."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, leveling Agatha with a look that was as unimpressed as it was
            pointed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You, however, clearly have..." she paused, her eyes drifting to the door
            where Rio stood waiting, "other things to work out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without missing a beat, Lilia turned on her heel and began ushering Jen and Alice out
            of the office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come on, you two," Lilia said, waving them forward with a no-nonsense
            tone. "Let's give her some space."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This is literally my office," Jen muttered, crossing her arms, but she
            begrudgingly followed Lilia and Alice out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the three exited, Agatha felt a strange, uncomfortable pull in her stomach, a mix
            of relief and apprehension. Thankfully, they only gave Rio passing glances as they moved by, though the
            tension in the air was palpable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as the door almost swung shut, Rio caught it and stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was dressed haphazardly-jeans and a seater that hung slightly askew, and
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't help but notice she was wearing two mismatched white sneakers. Her damp
            hair</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clung to her shoulders in uneven waves, and the darker patch on her sweater betrayed
            where the water had soaked in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it wasn't Rio's thrown-together appearance that made Agatha's throat
            tighten-it was the look on her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio wasn't just unhappy. She was pissed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You were supposed to stay home," Agatha said, her throat tightening as the
            words slipped out, almost strangled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw clenched, her eyes narrowing into a sharp glare that seemed to slice
            through the space between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't," Rio growled, stepping forward, her tone low and dangerous.
            "What was that? Huh?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You just took off, Agatha. No explanation, no nothing. What in the hell is
            going-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice faltered mid-sentence, her eyes snapping downward. Agatha instinctively
            followed her gaze, and her heart sank.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The photos- those fucking photos-were scattered across the table. Agatha let out a
            loud, exasperated sigh, her frustration bubbling over.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Fucking Jen ," she muttered under her breath, pinching the bridge of her
            nose. So much for keeping this under wraps.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze darted over the images, her expression shifting from confusion to
            something darker-something colder, more focused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, then stepped up to the table, and Agatha could do nothing but watch,
            frozen as her heart lurched painfully in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers ghosted across the handwritten threat first, her touch
            featherlight, before moving deliberately to the photos. One by one, she slid them aside, her movements slow
            and methodical, as if she were dissecting a case. Her jaw tightened with every new image</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">revealed, but she remained silent, her focus razor-sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, she reached the last photo-the one of her and Nicky sitting on the park
            bench.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hand recoiled like the picture had burned her, her breath catching audibly
            as her eyes shot up, locking on Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They threatened your son."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice was low, trembling at the edges, but there was no mistaking the fury behind
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her chest tightening. There were dozens of pictures
            on the table-all of Rio. Her privacy invaded, her every move documented, her very life threatened</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-and yet, Rio hadn't so much as flinched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the moment she saw Nicky's picture, her composure cracked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sharp edge of Rio's protectiveness hit her like a freight train, leaving her
            momentarily speechless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips parted, but no words came out. What could she even say?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure what rattled her more-Rio's fury or the undeniable fact
            that it wasn't directed at her, but for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened, and she swallowed hard before nodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you," she added, her voice quieter, pointing out the obvious with a
            gesture toward the photos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw tightened, her eyes flicking back to Agatha, dark and
            unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am an adult. I can handle some threats," she said, her tone firm, almost
            defiant. "But</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky?" She shook her head, her hand pressing flat against the table as if
            anchoring herself. "This is crossing a line, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know," Agatha murmured, her voice breaking slightly. "You think I
            don't know?" Rio didn't flinch, her steady gaze fixed on Agatha, unyielding.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she said again, and the sound of her name hit like a strike to
            the chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shut her eyes tightly. Only Rio could say her name like that-with reverence,
            like it was precious, but always tinged with so much exasperation, like it also annoyed the hell out of
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It fit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't get to use this as an excuse to push me away," Rio said, her
            voice soft but firm, cutting through the tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes snapped open, wide with disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"An excuse?" she echoed, her voice rising with incredulity. The words
            barely left her mouth before anger flared hot and bright.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" An excuse ?" she repeated, stepping closer to Rio, her hands flicking
            restlessly at her side. "They are threatening to kill you, Rio! Do you understand that? They've
            been following you for weeks- weeks ! They know where you live."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice cracked, but she pushed on, unable to stop the torrent now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The same black Cadillac that sat outside Brooke Sinclair's house before
            they murdered her was parked outside your building today. Did you know that? Did you? "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice sharpened, raw with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you have any idea how much danger you're in? How much danger I've
            put you in just by being near you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest heaved as the last words fell, her fury born from a place so deep she
            wasn't sure if it was directed at Rio, the situation, or herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably all three.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't step back. She didn't flinch or shrink from the fire in
            Agatha's words. Instead, she stood her ground, her jaw tightening as she absorbed every word, letting
            the anger and fear wash over her like a storm she born to weather.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you done?" Rio asked quietly, her voice calm, almost too calm, and
            that only made Agatha's frustration burn hotter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Done ?" Agatha snapped, her hands gesturing wildly. "No, I'm not
            done, Rio! I am trying to save your goddamn life, and you're standing there acting like this is
            some-some minor inconvenience!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips pressed into a thin line, and her eyes softened-just enough to make
            Agatha's breath catch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not standing here acting like this doesn't scare me," Rio said
            evenly, her voice steady but firm. "You think I'm not terrified? That I'm not thinking about
            what could happen? To you? To Nicky?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth opened to respond, but Rio didn't let her. She stepped closer,
            closing the small distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But this?" Rio gestured between them, her voice softer now, but no less
            determined. "W e're not running from it . You don't get to decide for me that it's over
            because you're scared."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not scared-" Agatha began, but Rio cut her off with a look so
            piercing it felt like a sliced right through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, you are," Rio said simply. "You're scared, and you're
            trying to protect me by pushing me away. But that's not your call to make, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart hammered in her chest, the weight of Rio's words pressing down
            on her as the anxiety curled inside her. Her mind drifted-back to the last moment she felt like this-to the
            hospital room, to the smell of antiseptic and the relentless beeping of monitors.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She remembered how sat there, powerless, watching her son struggle to breathe, her
            hands trembling because there was nothing she could do. She didn't have the power to protect him then.
            She'd been so helpless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, she had the power. She could protect Rio. She just needed to walk away.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if something happened to Rio...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought slammed into her chest like a freight train, and her breath
            hitched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If something happened to Rio, she would never forgive herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea was unbearable, the kind of loss that would shred her to pieces. She
            couldn't lose someone she-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her anxiety twisted and curled inside her. Her throat tightened, and she looked at
            Rio, standing there, refusing to back down. Refusing to let Agatha push her away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice, when she finally found it, was hoarse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio, if something happened to you..." She trailed off, the words caught in
            her throat, the weight of them too heavy to bear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stepped closer, her expression softening, her voice low but steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If something happened to me, it wouldn't be because of you, Agatha. It
            would be because of them. And I refuse to let them take this-us-away. Do you hear me? "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening as emotions swirled like a storm,
            threatening to consume her. She turned her head, looking anywhere but at Rio, trying to muster the strength
            to do what she thought she had to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To push through this, to protect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, softly, Rio's voice broke through her resolve.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio murmured, her tone gentle but firm. "Look at
            me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha squeezed her eyes shut even tighter, her fists clenching at her sides. She
            couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wouldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if she looked-if she gave Rio that moment-then every last shred of her
            defenses would come crashing down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Baby," Rio said again, her voice coaxing and low, brushing against
            Agatha's frayed nerves. "Just look at me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart clenched painfully at the word, her breath catching in her throat. And
            before she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">could stop herself, her eyes snapped open, glaring at Rio with as much defiance as
            she could muster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know I don't like it when you call me that," she snapped, her tone
            sharper than she intended, a desperate attempt to reclaim some ground.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio didn't flinch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she smirked-that infuriatingly confident, knowing smirk that somehow both
            grounded and disarmed Agatha all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, you do," Rio said, her voice quiet, teasing. "You just don't
            want to admit it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached up, her fingers brushing gently against Agatha's cheek, tucking a
            stray strand of hair back behind her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed heavily at the touch, the fight leaving her in one exhale.
            "Rio-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you," Rio interrupted, her voice cutting through the chaos with
            unshakable certainty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air, a soft yet powerful truth that made Agatha's heart
            skip and stutter. For a moment, all she could do was stare, her mind racing to catch up with the reality of
            what Rio had just said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You-" she stuttered. "You don't...mean that," she said
            softly, her voice trembling despite her best efforts to keep it steady. Her chest felt impossibly tight, her
            heart pounding in a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chaotic rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't flinch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. You know that," she said
            simply, her voice calm, her hand still brushing softly against Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shook her head, trying to step back, trying to put distance between them, but
            Rio didn't let her. She followed, stepping closer, her hand moving to cup Agatha's cheek.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you, Agatha Harkness," said Rio, doubling down. "All of you.
            The good, the bad, and the incredibly stubborn. And I'm not going anywhere."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight as her eyes searched Rio's, looking for
            any hint of doubt, of hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unsurprisingly, there was none.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was as she always was-steady, grounded, a calm force in the middle of
            Agatha's storm. And then, just like that, Agatha's defenses crumbled.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're impossible," Agatha muttered, her voice cracking ever so
            slightly, though any attempt at irritation was overshadowed by the heavy surrender seeping into her
            tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled, her thumb brushing lightly over Agatha's cheek, her touch soft and
            grounding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You love it," she teased, her voice warm and gentle, but laced with that
            playful confidence that always managed to make Agatha's heart stutter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes, letting herself lean, just for a moment, into the warmth of
            Rio's touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Letting the words linger in the air. Letting the moment- just be .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"God help me," Agatha found herself murmuring, her voice barely more than a
            whisper. She opened her eyes, meeting Rio's gaze, her chest tight with something she could finally
            name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words tumbled out, unstoppable, even if she had wanted to hold them back.
            "But I think I do."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened briefly in surprise, her lips twitching upward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah?" she asked softly, the astonishment in her tone impossible to
            miss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a look, one that clearly said, Don't push your luck. That's
            all you're getting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened, mischievous and knowing, and she leaned forward, her lips
            brushing dangerously close to Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just before they met, Agatha pulled back, her breath catching as her lips hovered
            over Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio...this is incredibly reckless," she whispered, her voice trembling
            slightly, her words more of an observation than a protest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're Agatha Harkness," Rio murmured in return, her tone low and
            brimming with a kind of want that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine. "Isn't that, like, your
            trademark?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed softly, a mix of amusement and resignation slipping from her
            lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever retort she might have had dissolved as she leaned forward, her movements
            instinctive, driven by something deeper. When her lips met Rio's, the kiss wasn't just heated</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-it was relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Knock. Knock.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her lips still brushing against Rio's, her breath catching as her
            eyes darted over Rio's shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there they were.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia, Jen, and Alice stood just outside the glass door, each wearing expressions
            ranging from barely-contained surprise to outright shock. Behing them, she could see men and women in suits
            filtering into the hamster cage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen mouth was agape like she couldn't believe what was she was seeing.
            Lilia's face was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">carefully neutral, though her eyes sparkled with amusement. Alice, predictably , was
            grinning like an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a quiet groan, pulling her lips away and resting her forehead falling
            against Rio's shoulder as she muttered, "I'm never going to hear the end of this."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled softly, the sound low and warm, as Agatha lifted her head and met her
            gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go to my office," Agatha murmured, her voice firm but carrying an
            undercurrent of something gentler.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand came up, squeezing Rio's arm in reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait for me there. I need to finalize the security arrangements, and then
            we're going to talk</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-about your personal security detail and future assignments."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression shifted, the humor melting away as the weight of the situation
            settled back in. She gave a solemn nod, understanding the gravity of Agatha's words. Without another
            word, she stepped back, her gaze lingering on Agatha for just a moment before turning and heading
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't so much as spare a glance at the other partners as she walked away.
            "Te veo," she said over her shoulder, her tone effortlessly self-assured.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but notice the way the seasoned lawyers seemed to completely
            lose control of their reactions. Their eyes widened, and like magnets, every head turned and tracked Rio as
            she walked down the corridor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a slow, measured breath, taking advantage of their distraction. She
            squared her shoulders and stepped forward to meet them, her expression calm but her eyes sharp, already
            bracing for whatever comments or looks were coming her way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unsurprisingly, Jen was the first to pounce.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"In my office-my sacred temple-you bring your depravity?" she hissed, her
            voice dripping with outrage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes at the theatrics, folding her arms across her chest.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It was just a kiss, Jen," she retorted, leveling her with a pointed look.
            "It's not like I bent her over your desk and fucked her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's eyes widened, her mouth opening and closing as if she couldn't decide
            whether to be horrified or begrudgingly impressed. Finally, she huffed, muttering something under her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">breath about needing to burn more sage and cleanse the energy in her office as she
            stomped away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia, let out a poorly stifled laugh before stepping closer to Agatha. She touched
            Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">arm lightly and leaned in as though she were about to share a secret, though her
            voice was far too loud for any pretense of discretion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have a good feeling about you two," she said, gesturing between Agatha
            and Rio's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">retreating figure with a pleased smile. "I'm usually right about these
            things," she added, tapping her temple for emphasis.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She started to walk away but paused mid-step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh-and don't forget, you need to submit a workplace relationship disclosure
            to HR immediately," she said, her tone slipping seamlessly into partner authority as she shot Agatha a
            pointed look. Then, with a satisfied nod, she followed Jen toward the conference room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That left Agatha standing with Alice in a silence so thick it felt like a living
            thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha waited, crossing her arms and glaring, but Alice just stood there, hands in
            her pockets, clearly enjoying herself. When the silence became too much, Agatha snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you? What do you have to say?" she demanded, throwing her hands up in
            exasperation. "Go on-let's hear it!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice raised her hands in mock surrender, her face carefully neutral, though her eyes
            sparkled with barely contained amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've got nothing," she said casually, but as the words hung in the
            air, a sly smirk crept onto her face. "I mean-I get it. She's hot. Good for you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes went wide, caught completely off guard by Alice's casual
            remark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh-," she stammered, the rare sensation of a blush creeping up her neck
            and heating her cheeks. "Umm...thanks?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice nodded, and walked forward, with a little skip in her step, but then paused
            halfway down the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Does she have an older brother- or a sister ? I'm not picky. Emphasis on
            the older though. I don't want to go to jail," Alice quipped, her grin widening with that signature
            devilish delight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned, throwing a sharp glare her way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I hate all of you," she muttered, her voice low and drenched in
            exasperation, though the faintest hint of a smirk betrayed her true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice chuckled, clearly pleased with herself, before striding toward the conference
            room without another word, leaving Agatha standing alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed heavily, running a hand through her hair. A thousand thoughts swirled
            in her mind, too many for her to grasp all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was the trial-a battle years in the making. A white whale to spear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A family she had vowed to bring peace to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And most importantly, Agatha had people to protect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, tangled somewhere in the chaos of it all, she had a relationship-a
            messy, maddening, exhilarating relationship-that she somehow needed to figure out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For all of Agatha's sharp edges and complications, for all the barriers she
            instinctively raised, there was no denying that what she had found with Rio was real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something worth fighting for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened, her resolve hardening into something unbreakable, her thoughts
            razor- sharp as they honed in on a single, undeniable truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had made a big fucking mistake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Threatening her? That was one thing. A calculated risk they likely thought they could
            control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But coming for the people she loved?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, that unleashed something entirely different within her-a new monster, fiercer and
            more ruthless than they could have ever imagined.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was the Witch of Wall Street, and Vanguard thought they had her tied to the pyre,
            flames licking at her heels, ready to burn her down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they had underestimated her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They always underestimated her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, the kind of smirk that sent chills down spines and made people
            reconsider their life choices.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Vanguard didn't realize one thing: Agatha Harkness didn't
            burn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took every attack hurled her way, let it fuel her, transformed it into her power,
            and unleashed it back at them a thousand times stronger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had no idea what was coming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they would.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, they would.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wasn't that fun? Still hate me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, I loved the coven dynamic here. I watched the Marvel Studios Assembled: The
            Making of Agatha All Along, and Kathryn Hahn ends it with a quote, "for a a show</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">about covenless witch, I sure need my coven." and I wanted to bring that same
            dynamic into this chapter. Agatha Harkness, even in the AU, needs her coven.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, the Jen/Agatha dynamic in this chapter had me literally kicking my feet while
            typing. So much fun to write!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, so I really hope you like this chapter. I really took my time with it , and I
            feel like it shows. It feels almost--tangible when reading it and it It is certainly gets...heated.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha jammed her key into the lock, the click echoing in the quiet hallway. She
            pushed the door open but stepped aside immediately, allowing the team of security agents to move past her
            like a tactical wave. They entered her home with precision, spreading out to sweep every corner for bugs and
            to install new surveillance cameras.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't enter, instead she just leaned against the wall in the dim hallway,
            arms crossed as her head tilted back to rest against the hard surface. Her eyes fluttered shut, and for a
            brief moment, she allowed herself to sag, her body barely upright from sheer exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The muted sounds of the team working inside her home echoed out into the hallway, but
            she barely registered it, her thoughts scattered and weighed down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The security firm was, as promised , thorough and relentless. They'd swept the
            office earlier that evening, uncovering two bugs and a hidden micro-camera nestled in a potted plant just
            outside the war room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fucking Vanguard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anger flared momentarily before exhaustion snuffed it out. Because once the
            office was secure, the security firm turned the protection plan-one for Nicky, one for her, and one for
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meeting had been draining.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The team's first suggestion was a safe house for all three of them. Agatha had
            shot that down immediately. She wasn't about to uproot Nicky's life or her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is when the conversation turned to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her building had been clearly been compromised.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A hotel was suggested, but Rio's silence had spoken volumes on what she thought
            of that. Agatha had seen the tension in her jaw, the stiffness in her posture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Agatha had spoken before thinking it through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would it just be easier if we were all in the same place?" she had asked,
            her tone weary but resigned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head had snapped toward her, surprise clear in her wide eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," one of the team members had replied. "Which is why we suggested
            the safe house."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then Rio can stay at my place," Agatha had said, the words tumbling out as
            if decided by some part of her she couldn't control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd ignored Rio's startled look and, more importantly, refused to meet any
            of the other partners knowing smirk from across the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have three spare bedrooms," she added matter-of-factly, as if that
            completely dismissed any thought of impropriety.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen had scoffed, her eyebrows shooting up in disbelief, but blessedly, she'd kept
            her mouth shut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had been teetering on the edge of her patience by the end of that meeting, and
            it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn't completely outside the realm of possibility that she'd lose her shit
            and launch herself across the table at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, as she stood in her hallway, listening to the faint buzz of the security
            team's work, she replayed that particularly reckless moment in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio staying at her place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus. What in the hell was she thinking?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of boots approaching the doorway brought her back to the present. One of
            the security agents stepped out, giving her a nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's clear. We'll need about an hour to finish installing the
            cameras." Agatha returned the nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Everywhere but the bathrooms and bedrooms, as discussed." "Yes,
            ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw tightened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't call me ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The security agent blinked, then recovered quickly, nodding again. "Yes, Ms.
            Harkness."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned and walked back into her home, leaving Agatha in the hallway once more. She
            let out a heavy sigh, her head lolling to the side to the quite presence next to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was standing there, leaning casually against the wall a few feet away. In her
            hand, she held an army green duffle bag, the strap loose and hanging from her fingers. Her dark eyes met
            Agatha's, unreadable, and the sight sent a strange twist of emotion curling through</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was such a terrible idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You ready?" Agatha asked, her voice attempting confidence but landing
            somewhere closer to the sound of ice cracking across the northern icefields under the relentless weight of
            global warming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, of course, immediately picked up on it. Her eyes softened, her stance relaxing
            as she shifted the duffle to her other hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't have to do this," she said quietly, her voice carrying the
            weight of both of their unspoken concerns.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened, forcing her shoulders back as if sheer posture could silence the
            war inside her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" I do , actually," she replied, her tone sharper than she intended.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose before meeting Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's not safe for you at your place. It's not safe for you anywhere,
            really, except here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air, heavier than Agatha intended, as the anxiety that had been
            simmering all evening curled tighter in her chest. It wasn't a gentle, passing storm anymore. It was the
            kind that rattled windows and snapped tree branches, building momentum just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not a full-blown tornado- yet -but the kind that left you constantly bracing for it
            and eyeing the basement door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to push the storm back into its cage, even
            though it seemed like it was determined to claw its way out. She took a steadying breath, running her hand
            through her hair as she straightened her spine and pushed herself off the wall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at Rio over her shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The hallway or the spare bedroom, your choice," Agatha said, her voice
            carefully measured, but teetering on the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved into her home, forcing herself to follow the usual routine that had
            always kept her grounded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shoes off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coat hung neatly in the closet. Purse on the front table.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cell phone in hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each step was deliberate, mechanical-a lifeline to cling to in the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind her, she heard Rio following the same steps. After all, this wasn't her
            first time in Agatha's home-not her first rodeo.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as Agatha stepped into the living room, her sanctuary, the place that usually
            greeted her such calm, everything shifted. Her breath quickened, coming out in short, uneven bursts as her
            fingers twitched at her sides.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were so many people here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Too many.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moving around her house like they belonged there, speaking in low voices, the sharp
            whirl of power tools slicing through the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt invasive, unsettling, wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm inside her chest swelled, clouds thickening, swirling faster and faster.
            She could almost hear the warning sirens wailing in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was her home, her refuge -and now-now it was just another battlefield.
            "Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name, spoken softly but firmly, cut through the rising tide of chaos inside her.
            Like a small ray of light breaking through blackened clouds, it grounded her, pulling her back from the
            brink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood there, watching her with that look-intense, unyielding, and somehow
            infinitely understanding. The kind of look that told Agatha that Rio knew-knew exactly what was going on
            inside her, even if Agatha didn't have the words to explain it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What room?" Rio asked, her voice calm but purposeful, anchoring
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, her eyes flicking toward the hallway like it held some
            elusive solution to somehow get her life back under her control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Second door on the right," she murmured, her voice quieter than she
            intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, turning to go, but then she hesitated. She stopped mid-step and glanced
            back, her expression softening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come with me," she said, her tone firm but not harsh, more of a directive
            than a request.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, she seemed to remember they weren't alone, and caught herself. She
            adjusted the bag on her shoulder, and she softened further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I need your help."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated, her mind caught in a swirl of thoughts, but before she could
            consciously decide, her feet were already moving. Her body acted on instinct, as if it had bypassed her mind
            entirely-like it knew what she needed before she even did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha followed Rio down the hallway, her teeth gritting every time she heard the
            sound of drills boring into her walls. Strangers brushed past her, their presence far too close in
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">already narrow space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It made her skin crawl.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her life was being invaded. Her walls were breached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio opened the door at on the right stepped inside, pausing to wait for Agatha to
            follow before quietly shutting the door behind them. The relative silence was jarring, but the sounds from
            outside the door still crept in, like a shadow she couldn't quite escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes swept over the room. She hadn't been in here in ages. Why would
            she? It wasn't a space she used. But it was exactly as she remembered-simple yet elegant, understated in
            a way that still felt inviting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the third nicest bedroom in the house, but the last one with its own en suite,
            a choice Agatha had made deliberately. She knew Rio would appreciate having her own bathroom- her own
            space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the sharp bang of a hammer echoed from elsewhere in the house, so loud it made
            her jump. Her teeth clenched hard enough to ache, her hands curling into fists at her sides.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The restless, anxious energy inside her clawed higher-louder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moved past her, tossing her bag onto the bed without ceremony, before heading
            toward the open bathroom door. She stopped in the threshold, turned on the light, and then shifted to face
            Agatha, her gaze steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she simply watched Agatha, something unreadable flickering in her eyes.
            Then, with a small tilt of her head, she gestured toward the bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stayed rooted where she was, her heels practically digging into the floor. She
            didn't want to move. She didn't want to be bossed around.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not now .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not with everything spiraling so wildly out of control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw clenched as she fought against the wave of restlessness surging inside her.
            It was like holding back a dam ready to burst. Everything felt so precarious, like if even the smallest
            sliver of control was taken from her, she would shatter into a thousand pieces.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio saw it -the tension in Agatha's stance, the way her hands fisted at her
            sides, her breath coming just a little too fast. And as she did the sharp edges in her gaze softened,
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression shifting to something gentler, something... patient .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio said softly, her voice steady but pleading. "Please,
            come here." Agatha's shoulders slumped almost imperceptibly at the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't a demand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a request, and it reached her in a way nothing else could.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened, but she forced herself to move, her steps slow and deliberate,
            until she crossed the threshold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bathroom was the smallest in the house-just enough space for a single sink, a
            toilet, and a decently sized tiled shower. The moment she stepped inside, the walls seemed to close in,
            pressing against her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weight of everythin g-her office, her home, her family- being invaded, the
            constant noise, the fear and uncertainty-it built like a pressure cooker inside her chest. She felt like she
            was seconds away from snapping, seconds away from tearing into Rio, of letting the storm take control and
            consuming everything in its path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, Rio reached past her and turned on the fan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, startled by the sudden-loud, mechanical hum filling the small room.
            The</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anger that had been teetering on the edge of exploding shifted to confusion, as her
            mind tried to catch up with Rio's actions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then suddenly, the sound of the fan drowned out everything . No voices in her
            house.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No drills or hammers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No footsteps echoing through the halls. Just the steady, rhythmic whir of the
            fan.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled slowly, not even realizing she'd been holding her breath until
            that moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm inside her didn't vanish entirely, but it stilled- just enough -as the
            relentless chaos from outside was replaced by the steady, grounding hum .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze found Rio, torn between irritation and gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated being read so easily, hated that Rio seemed to know exactly what she
            needed when she couldn't even name it herself. And yet, she couldn't deny the shift-that the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">suffocating grip on her chest had loosened, if only slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stepped back, the bathroom not allowing her much space, but she moved until she
            was pressed against the opposite wall-giving Agatha as much a space as possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stayed like that for a few moments, the hum of the fan filling the small space.
            The noise helped- a little -but that restless energy inside her refused to settle. It curled tighter and
            tighter, like a cloud threatening to touch down the earth, and destroy everything in its path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's voice broke through the haze, soft but unwavering, cutting through
            Agatha's spiraling thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her gaze darting to Rio, who was watching her with that maddening mix
            of patience and understanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tell me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew what she meant. Rio was asking about her. About what was wrong-what was
            clawing at her from the inside out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, then shut it just as quickly. How did she even begin to
            explain?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How did she put into words the relentless-the suffocating weight pressing down on her
            chest?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How her life felt like it was fracturing all around her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers flexed at her sides, and she looked away, staring at the bathroom tiles
            as if they might offer her an answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So finally, she settled on the only words that seemed to fit, her voice raw and
            strained as hot tears frustration clouded her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I feel completely out of control."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha continued to stare at the tile, her vision blurring slightly as her fingers
            curled and twisted, the tremble in them betraying the storm building inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence greeted her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, softly-barely audible over the hum of the fan-Rio spoke.
            "Okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word was simple, but the way she said it carried weight, a quiet understanding
            that wrapped around Agatha like a lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Okay ," Rio repeated, even softer this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence settled between them, heavy but not oppressive, as if the stillness itself
            were giving Agatha permission to just exist in the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then out of nowhere, Rio's voice cut through the quiet, low and steady.
            "Take it back."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her eyes snapping open to meet Rio's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Take what back?" she bit out, confusion transforming into anger.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't even blink an eye. She just tilted her head, letting it rest against
            the wall, her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression soft yet charged with a simmering intensity that burned behind those dark
            eyes. "All of it," she said simply. "Your control. Your power. Everything you think
            you've lost."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words lingered, heavy with meaning, pressing into Agatha with a force she
            couldn't ignore, like a flame licking at the edges of turned over oil tanker.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's right here, Agatha," Rio continued, her voice roughening, taking
            on a raw edge. "The one thing you can control."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, the air in the room turning heavier, warmer, pressing
            against her like a tangible force.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A flush rose beneath her collar, creeping up her neck and spreading across her chest
            like</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wildfire. Without thinking, her hand shot up, tugging at the collar of the hoodie,
            desperate to relieve some of the pressure building within her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze flicked to the movement, her dark eyes catching on Agatha's
            restless hand. The look she gave wasn't smug or triumphant-it was something far more intimate, something
            knowing. A quiet, unspoken challenge lingered there, but not one meant to provoke. No, this was something
            gentler, coaxing, as if she were carefully reaching for the storm Agatha was trying so desperately to hold
            at bay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's okay," murmured Rio, eyes flashing, as she gave a nod-like she
            was giving permission. " Take it ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, Agatha held herself back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The urge to act, to seize the control Rio was so willingly offering, clawed at her,
            relentless and sharp. She fought it with everything she had because she knew herself-knew the force of what
            simmered beneath her carefully maintained surface. Releasing it wasn't something you unleashed on a
            person.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It needed containment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Solitude, with a bottle of bourbon and dark thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't know what she was saying. Didn't know what she was giving
            permission for Agatha to do. She couldn't possibly understand the storm she was inviting in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers twisted restlessly at her sides, betraying the battle raging
            inside her. Her breathing quickened, her chest tightening as the heat and tension grew unbearable, each
            second stretching impossibly thin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," Rio murmured, her voice a low rasp that seemed to fill every
            corner of the small bathroom. Her gaze flicked down, honing in on Agatha's restless, twisting fingers
            before lifting back to her face. There was no softness left in her expression now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"All you have to do," she continued, her words deliberate and laced with a
            challenge-daring Agatha to rise, "is take those restless, beautiful fingers of yours... and bury
            them-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved before the sentence could fully land. She surged forward, her hands
            shooting up to cradle Rio's face, gripping firmly as their mouths collided in a kiss so fierce it
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost bruising.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head hit the wall with a loud thud, the sound reverberating through the
            small space. She gasped, her lips parting in shock, and Agatha seized the opening, her tongue slipping
            inside, devouring her like she was something Agatha had been starving for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand tangled in Rio's hair, her fingers gripping firmly at the
            roots, tugging just</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough to control Rio's movements. She held her exactly where she wanted her-no
            escape, no pushing back, just Rio completely at her mercy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their mouths clashed, Agatha's lips moving with an intensity that bordered on
            desperate. She consumed Rio, her other hand braced against the wall beside Rio's head, creating a
            barrier, a trap that kept her pinned in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gasp was swallowed by Agatha's dominance, her own hands twitching with
            the need to move, to respond, but Agatha's hold made it clear-this wasn't a moment for equals.
            This</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">was Agatha seizing control, reclaiming the power she'd been grasping for all
            night, and Rio let her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rough pull of her hair had Rio groaning greedily against Agatha's
            mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the vibration of it and tugged harder, deepening the kiss, her tongue
            sweeping inside to claim more of Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her grip tightened in Rio's hair, her fingers curling at the nape of her neck as
            she gave a sharp tug. Rio gasped, her lips breaking away from Agatha's, her head tilting back
            instinctively, exposing the long, graceful line of her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't waste a second. She descended on Rio's neck with a ferocity
            that left no room for doubt. Her lips trailed along the delicate skin, alternating between soft, teasing
            brushes</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and sharp, biting kisses that left a path of heat in their wake. Each movement was
            deliberate, a claim etched into Rio's flesh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's breath hitched, her hands coming up to grip Agatha's hips under her
            sweater, nails digging in as she tried to ground herself against the onslaught of sensation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," she groaned, her voice shaky and barely audible over the white
            noise of the fan, but Agatha didn't stop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sharp pull of Rio's hair kept her right where Agatha wanted her, utterly
            exposed, unable to move, and completely at her mercy. The power of it coursed through Agatha like</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">electricity, igniting something deep and primal within her. She bit down hard, enough
            to elicit a strangled moan from Rio, and soothed the spot with her tongue immediately after.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was high on it- too high.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every piece of control she claimed from Rio felt like she was reclaiming a part of
            herself, slotting it back into place like a puzzle finally coming together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio... Rio didn't say stop. She didn't pull away or shy from the
            intensity of it. If anything, she leaned into it- into Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breathy groans spilled out into the space between them, her hands tightening on
            Agatha's hips as if she was anchoring herself in Agatha's storm, holding on for dear life.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Rio breathed out, her voice husky and trembling, her chest rising
            and falling against Agatha's with each shaky inhale. "Yes... don't stop . Keep
            going."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were a spark to dry kindling, igniting something feral in Agatha, a need
            that burned hotter and brighter than anything she'd felt in years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled back from Rio's throat, breathless, her chest heaving as she took
            in the sight before her. Rio, pinned against the wall, panting heavily, her eyes half-lidded, pupils blown
            wide with desire. She looked thoroughly wrecked-like she'd already been completely undone by Agatha-and
            yet, Agatha hadn't even begun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's earlier words echoed in her mind, low and teasing, but now they felt like a
            challenge:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Take those restless fingers of yours... and bury them..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved into a slow, predatory smirk, her hand tightening in
            Rio's hair as she leaned in close, her breath ghosting over Rio's parted lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Turn around," Agatha rasped, her voice thick and commanding, a tone she
            had never used on Rio before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened just slightly, letting out a soft exhale, and then without
            hesitation, she obeyed, spinning on her heel to face the wall, her hands bracing against it for
            balance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart pounded as she stepped closer, her hand sliding up Rio's back,
            slow and deliberate, feeling the shiver that rippled through her in response. The storm inside Agatha
            hadn't just calmed-it had transformed into something that leveled cities.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers moved with purpose, slipping over the curve of her hip before coming
            forward to the waistband of her jeans. With precise movements, Agatha unbuttoned them, pulling down the
            zipper slowly. The sound barely registered over the hum of the fan, but to Agatha, it seemed to echo, loud
            and deliberate, like a final boundary being crossed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's breathing grew heavier, her shoulders rising and falling with every
            breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pressed her front to Rio's back, her arm wrapping tightly around Rio's
            middle to pull her closer. She felt the tremor running through Rio, the way her body seemed to shake under
            the weight of her own need, but not moving, just waiting- waiting for Agatha to act.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand slid up Rio's chest, fingers greedy as they palmed Rio's
            breast roughly through the fabric of her sweater. She relished the sound of Rio's groan, low and
            guttural, before moving her hand further up, higher, until her fingers wrapped firmly around Rio's
            throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the vibration of Rio's gasp under her palm, felt the way her breath
            hitched, and her control threatened to snap completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a precision that belayed how out of control she felt, Agatha's other
            hand slipped lower, sliding beneath the waistband of Rio's underwear. And there it was-heat, wetness ,
            and Rio arching into her touch like she'd been waiting for this moment forever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Jesus Christ ," Agatha murmured under her breath, her voice rough with
            awe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't religious, had never been, but touching Rio in that moment-feeling the
            how much Rio wanted her and the moan that vibrated under her hand around Rio's throat- this</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-this felt like heaven.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip tightened, and Rio instinctively tilted her head back to rest
            against Agatha's shoulder, baring her throat fully. The act was so deliberate, so achingly vulnerable,
            that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she froze, her lips hovering near Rio's ear, taking in the sight of
            Rio's exposed neck, her hand wrapped around it, the unspoken trust and sheer surrender of it. It was a
            sight that nearly undid her, and a low, shaky exhale escaped her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're mine, Rio," Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with equal
            parts possession and veneration. The words cutting through the space like a vow. Each syllable carrying a
            weight that was almost palpable, as though the truth of it had been etched into both of their souls long
            before they'd even met.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio whimpered softly at that-a sound so delicate, so unlike the deep, guttural noises
            that usually spilled from her lips when then Agatha touched her. And that sound- struck Agatha with more
            force than a scream ever could. It was a sound that spoke of surrender, of trust, of something so deeply
            intimate it almost stole Agatha's breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, her hand instinctively tightening its hold on Rio,
            pulling her even closer, as though the mere idea of letting her go was unbearable. Agatha's lips
            brushed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against Rio's temple, a kiss so featherlight it was almost reverent. She could
            feel the rapid flutter of Rio's pulse beneath her thumb, could feel the way her body trembled in her
            arms, not from fear, but from something deeper-from being claimed, from being utterly, undeniably
            hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment stretched between them, as if the entire world had narrowed to just this-j
            ust them .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling slowly, feeling that truth settle deep in her bones.
            For all her flaws, for all the chaos that surrounded her, this moment- Rio -was hers. And nothing, no one-
            no one -would ever take that away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that thought spurred, Agatha forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always prided herself on being a quick learner, and even now, from this new
            angle, she proved it. Her fingers moved with deliberate precision, seeking out exactly where Rio needed her
            most.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The groan that rumbled against her palm as she pressed against the sensitive bud
            beneath her fingers sent a thrill coursing through Agatha. She could feel Rio's every reaction-every
            shudder, every moan, every desperate gasp-burning into her palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knowledge that she was the one unraveling Rio like this, piece by trembling
            piece, had Agatha's heart tightening. She moved with purpose, applying just the right amount of
            pressure, her movements firm yet teasing, savoring every sound that spilled from Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Fuck , Agatha," Rio groaned, her voice ragged and breathless, as she
            sagged back further into Agatha's embrace. Her hips moved instinctively, canting with every deliberate
            circle of Agatha's fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of her name on Rio's lips sent a bolt of heat straight through
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good girl," Agatha murmured against Rio's ear, letting the words roll
            off her tongue with ease. The same words Rio had once teased her with, now seared between them, and god , it
            felt so good-better than she imagined, owning those words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's reaction was immediate-another delicate whimper, and full-body shudder that
            left her trembling in Agatha's arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked against the shell of Rio's ear, her fingers pressing tighter, more
            insistent. She could feel the tension winding through Rio, her control unraveling with every movement of
            Agatha's fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The shudder didn't stop-it coursed through Rio like her body wasn't even hers
            anymore, like she'd given it over completely to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's it," Agatha whispered, her voice low and possessive, brushing
            her lips against Rio's jaw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's breath hitched, her hand scrambling back to curl into Agatha's hair,
            anchoring herself as her head lolled against Agatha's shoulder. Every moan, every tremor in her body,
            fed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's growing fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha adjusted her grip, tightening her hand around Rio's throat just enough, a
            silent command and promise all at once. Her fingers worked with precision, each movement relentless,
            circling and pressing in exactly the way Rio liked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, Agatha felt it-the moment Rio was close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It started with a guttural moan that reverberated under Agatha's palm, raw and
            unrestrained. Then Rio's fingers dug into Agatha's hair, gripping tightly as though it were the only
            thing tethering her to the earth. And lastly, her body started trembling violently, a full-body quake that
            Agatha felt vibrate against her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Cum for me, my love ," Agatha murmured, her voice a low command against
            Rio's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words sent a visible shudder through Rio, her body responding instantly as she
            cried out. Her hips locked, thighs clenching tightly, trapping Agatha's hand between them as her entire
            body shook uncontrollably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Though her hand was pinned, Agatha didn't relent, her fingers continuing to draw
            every last tremor, every aftershock from Rio's body until she felt Rio finally sag against her, utterly
            spent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only then did Agatha stop, her hand slipping away from Rio's throat and out of
            her pants, at the same time, to wrap around her middle. It was as though she were physically holding Rio
            together, the only thing keeping her upright.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's breaths came in uneven gasps, her body trembling against Agatha's
            steady frame.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, even as Agatha held her close, feeling Rio's surrender and the aftermath
            of her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">release, that restless energy still coursed through her. It was a need that
            hadn't been sated, a hunger that demanded more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes traveled over Rio's form, hyper-aware of the way her body responded, how
            Rio could keep going- and going .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave her a few more moments, letting her breathe, letting her come back to
            herself. Then her hands moved, glided down deliberately down Rio's sides until they hooked into the
            waistband of her jeans and underwear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"More," she murmured, letting Rio know she wasn't done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a surprised gasp, her head lifting slightly, but there was no protest. As
            soon as Agatha tugged the clothing down her hips, Rio stepped out of them without hesitation, kicking them
            off to the side. Her movements were quick but fluid, as though she already knew where this was going and was
            more than willing to follow Agatha's lead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, feeling that dark thrill rise within her again. Her hands moved back
            to Rio's hips, steadying her, grounding them both. Humming with approval, she leaned in, her lips
            brushing against the sensitive shell of Rio's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Off," Agatha said slowly, her voice low and deliberate, as her hands
            reached around Rio, grabbing the hem of her sweater and pulling it upward. Rio raised her arms obediently,
            the fabric slipping over her head and landing somewhere off to the side. Underneath, she was wearing only a
            simple bra, and Agatha wasted no time unclasping it, letting it fall away before tossing it carelessly
            aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood still, her back to Agatha, little gasps escaping her lips each time
            Agatha's fingers or breath grazed newly exposed skin. She didn't speak, didn't move, but the
            tension in her body told Agatha everything she needed to know.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a moment to take her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The faint red lines of still-healing scratches marked Rio's back- her marks
            -etched into Rio's skin from earlier today. She leaned forward, pressing soft, deliberate kisses to each
            line, her lips soft as her hands moved to grasp one of Rio's wrists.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She brought Rio's hand forward, guiding it up rest against the cool tile of the
            wall next Rio's head. Agatha pressed her palm into it, a silent command conveyed in the way she lingered
            before repeating the same action with the other hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha lips brushed against Rio's shoulder for one final kiss before leaning
            close to her ear. "Bend over," Agatha rasped, her voice thick with desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From her vantage point, she could see the shiver ripple down Rio's spine, the
            visible tremor an undeniable response to her command.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The movement that followed was effortless, instinctive, as Rio obeyed without a
            moment's hesitation. Her body folded gracefully, hands pressing firmly against the cool wall for
            support.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze trailed along Rio's form, every curve and line etched in shadow
            and light, leaving her momentarily breathless. The sight of Rio like this-so utterly surrendered yet
            radiating power in her submission-lit a fire low in Agatha's core.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped closer, her hand gliding over the curve of Rio's ass with a
            deliberate slowness that made Rio shift slightly, her breath hitching audibly. Agatha let her fingers dip
            between Rio's folds, gathering her wetness, teasing her with featherlight touches before sliding one
            finger inside. Then another. Then a third, her fingers stretching Rio, filling her, as a guttural moan
            ripped through Rio's body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's snapped to Rio's hands as they curled against the wall tiles, her
            fingers digging as though trying to anchor herself against the feeling Agatha was unleashing inside
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's other hand gripped Rio's hip firmly, grounding her, holding her
            steady, as her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers moved with precision-curling, pressing, finding that spot inside that made
            Rio's entire body quake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Rio groaned, her voice raw and trembling, as she instinctively
            rocked back into Agatha's hand. The sheer intensity of her movement sent a thrill racing through Agatha,
            leaving her momentarily breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a fleeting second, Agatha paused, the urge to command Rio to stop-to reassert
            control</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-flashed through her mind. But the sight of Rio like this, so utterly consumed and
            shamelessly taking what she needed, was so breathtakingly sexy that it rendered Agatha speechless.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha, please ," Rio cried out, her voice trembling as she rolled
            herself against Agatha's fingers again, the desperation in her tone snapping Agatha out of her
            daze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha surged closer, her body pressing into Rio's, her fingers moving faster
            now, matching the rhythm Rio's body demanded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio cried out again, the sound breaking into a breathless " yes " as she
            rolled back, meeting Agatha's pace with an intensity that stole Agatha's breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt it-the way Rio's walls clenched around her fingers, the fluttering that
            signaled how close she was, the trembling in her legs as she struggled to stay upright.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved her free hand around Rio's body, her fingers finding their mark,
            brushing against Rio's clit in perfect rhythm with the curling of her fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound that tore from Rio's throat was unlike anything Agatha had ever heard-a
            raw, visceral mix of a scream and a moan that reverberated off the tiled walls.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sent up a silent prayer that the security agents were still drilling into her
            walls, because the solitude and fan were not going to hide that sound, as she moved her fingers deeper,
            curling them just right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Agatha felt it-the sudden, tight clench around her fingers, followed by the
            unexpected rush of wetness coating her hand. It took her by surprise for a moment, and then the realization
            of what just happened hit her. And with it, a thrill coursed through her, as a new sense of power bloomed in
            her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck!" Rio cried out, her voice cracking as her legs buckled beneath her
            as if her orgasm just robbed her of any strength to stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reacted instinctively, pulling her hands free and wrapping her arms around
            Rio's waist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Easy," Agatha murmured, her voice low and steady, as she eased them both
            down to the cool tiled floor. She cradled Rio against her, one arm wrapped securely around her waist while
            the other brushed through her hair. She pressed a gentle kiss to Rio's forehead, feeling the lingering
            tremors rippling through her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took a few quiet moments of just that-holding her, grounding her, letting
            Rio's breath</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">even out-before Agatha felt her finally relax, her body melting into her arms. Rio
            snuggled deeper against Agatha's chest, as though it was the only safe place in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, startled by the sight of Rio like this-not immediately bouncing back.
            She looked... soft, undone in a way Agatha had never witnessed before. Her eyes widened in mock disbelief,
            her lips twitching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did I finally find your off button?" she teased, her voice light, but
            unable to stop the hint of pride seep into her tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio huffed, a sound that was half laugh, half exasperation. Her breath warmed
            Agatha's collarbone before her voice came, muffled but unmistakable in its awe-and its
            possessiveness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who in the fuck taught you how to do that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help the snort that escaped her, her lips twitching into a wry
            smile as she tightened her hold around Rio, pressing another kiss to the top of her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You did," she said with a huff, her tone teasing but warm. "You had
            the strap-on then,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remember? I nearly passed out after? I figured, sans equipment, the mechanics were
            still the same-and looks like I was right."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned into her chest, and even thought she couldn't see it, it was
            impossible to miss the smile tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to hate how cocky you get when you're right," Rio muttered, her
            voice muffled</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against Agatha's chest. She paused for a second before letting out a huff of air.
            "But it's also annoyingly hot."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, running her fingers lazily through Rio's damp hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, buckle up, darling," Agatha drawled, her tone dripping with playful
            arrogance. "Because I'm rarely wrong. So, this is going to be quite the ride for you."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled at that, her breath warm against Agatha's neck as she shook her
            head, a soft laugh escaping her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"As long as I'm the only one who gets to ride," Rio murmured, her voice
            low and teasing, "then I think I can handle it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk deepened, her fingers threading lazily through Rio's hair.
            "Possessive, are we?" she quipped, raising an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head up, her face dead serious. "When it comes to you? Absolutely
            ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her chest tighten, but it wasn't anxiety this time. She recognized it
            instantly, the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clarity of Rio's statement settling into her like a quiet revelation. Leaning
            down, she captured Rio's lips in a kiss, firm and tender, grounding them both before pulling
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," she murmured against her lips, her voice low and steady.
            "Because I don't share well either."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They held each other in the stillness that followed, the silence not empty but
            somehow full. "How are you feeling?" Rio asked softly, breaking the quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, letting the question settle as she searched within herself. The storm
            was still there, but it was distant now, its edges softened. And in its wake, there was Rio-j ust
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That presence alone, that anchor, settled her even more. "Better," she
            answered simply, truthfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled faintly, murmuring, "Good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat like that for a while, wrapped in each other, letting the weight of the
            world fall away for a moment. Agatha felt a warmth spread through her, a strange but welcome sense of
            peace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you," Agatha said suddenly, her voice quiet but filled with
            sincerity. "I didn't know I needed that. How did you know I needed that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shifted slightly, her head resting more comfortably against Agatha's
            shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Calculated guess," she said with a small shrug, her tone light but her
            words heavy with meaning. "I feel the same way when my world starts spinning. We're alike, you and
            I."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, letting the words sink in before continuing, her voice taking on a
            thoughtful edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Power, surrender, control, submission-they're powerful forces. They have
            this... way of shifting dynamics, of shifting you. They can unmake you, but they can also rebuild
            you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused, her head pulling back slightly, her gaze searching Agatha's face as
            if looking for something unspoken, something she needed to see reflected back. Finally, she exhaled, her
            breath soft, her voice dipping into a vulnerable, almost hesitant tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And I think..." Rio hesitated, her eyes lowering for a moment as if
            gathering her thoughts before meeting Agatha's again, steady but unguarded. "I think I needed that
            as much as you did. I didn't realize it until it was already happening, but I felt... unsteady too.
            With</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything going on, all the chaos, I felt like I was losing my footing."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips quirked into a faint, self-aware smile before her expression softened
            again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But being with you like that-letting you take control-it wasn't just
            grounding; it was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">freeing. Like I could let go, trust you to hold the reins, and everything would still
            be okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't lost on Agatha that Rio's statement carried more weight than it
            seemed at first glance. Her words weren't just about trusting Agatha to take control in the intimate
            moments they shared-they were layered, edged with deeper meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio said she loved Agatha...she was trusting Agatha emotionally, letting her guard
            down in ways that Agatha knew didn't come easily to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it even went beyond that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was also placing her faith in Agatha physically , trusting her to protect her
            when the threat from Vanguard loomed over them like a shadow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just about surrendering her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was about surrendering her heart, her safety, her very life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The realization hit Agatha like a wave-heavy, powerful, and impossible to
            ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened as she felt the enormity of it, the responsibility, the
            vulnerability Rio was offering her without hesitation. And for someone who spent her entire life avoiding
            vulnerability like the plague, it was both humbling and terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled slowly, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Rio's temple, letting
            the gesture say everything her words couldn't quite reach. As she did, her arms instinctively
            tightened</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">around Rio, pulling her closer, like she was building a fortress of protection around
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio melted into the embrace, her breath evening out as she rested her head against
            Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for a moment, the weight of the world seemed to fade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pressed her chin lightly against the top of Rio's head, closing her eyes
            as she took in a deep breath. The storm inside her had calmed, the restless energy was replaced by something
            far more grounding. The promise that no matter what came next, she would be Rio's shield- against
            Vanguard, against the world, against anything that dared to threaten what she had</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">found with Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sudden vibration of her phone startled Agatha, pulling her back to the moment.
            Adjusting her hold on Rio, she fished it out of her pocket and glanced at the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Camera's are installed," she read aloud. "They just
            left."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio exhaled deeply, a sound of relief, but then she froze mid-breath, her body
            stiffening. Pulling back slightly, she looked at Agatha with a mix of confusion and dawning horror.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They texted you instead of telling you in person?" she asked, her voice
            wary. Then her eyes widened as her gaze darted to the door. "Do you think they... heard
            us?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't stop the snort that escaped her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Us? No." she repeated, her tone laced with teasing disbelief. "You?
            Absolutely . I think the tenants two floors down probably heard you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were both a tease and a point of pride, her smirk widening as Rio's
            cheeks</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flushed. There was something immensely satisfying about knowing she could make Rio
            lose control like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched the flush deepen as it rolled up Rio's neck, a faint color
            blooming across her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She liked that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She liked it a lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. "I hope none of
            them are on my security detail tomorrow."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, never one to resist an opportunity to poke fun, slowly rose from the tiled
            floor, her joints protesting slightly-reminding her that, yes, she was too damn old to be sitting on hard
            tiles for that long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, if they aren't, I am certainly going to arrange for it," she
            said casually, brushing off her knees as she stood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio dropped her hands from her face and shot Agatha a glare, her eyes narrowing
            dangerously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked wickedly, extending a hand to help Rio up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she said, her tone dripping with mock innocence.
            "Embarrassed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pursed her lips, clearly biting back a retort, and Agatha's grin widened. She
            was just</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">about to needle her further when her mind suddenly snapped to the reason for
            Rio's volume .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her smirk softened into something sly as she flexed her hand at her side, the
            evidence of their earlier activities still slick against her palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speaking of that ," she said, emphasizing the word with a wicked
            smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio froze for half a second before immediately picking up on what Agatha was getting
            at, and huffing loudly, her cheeks flushing anew.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm going to bed," she declared, spinning on her heel and striding
            into the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha chuckled softly, grabbing a nearby towel to clean her hand before flipping off
            the bathroom light and fan, casting the space into quiet darkness. She followed Rio into the bedroom, her
            footsteps soft against the floor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she stepped inside, her eyes immediately locked on Rio, who was already under
            the comforter, her dark gaze fixed on Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The playful banter that had filled the bathroom evaporated in an instant, leaving a
            charged silence hanging between them. Agatha froze in the doorway, her smirk fading as uncertainty crept
            in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what? Was she supposed to just turn around, walk down the hall, and go back to
            her room?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That thought sparked an uncomfortable, restless movement in her chest, and before her
            mind could catch up, Agatha was already moving. She grabbed the arm of her sweater, tugging it off in one
            swift motion. Her bra followed, then her sweatpants, leaving her in just her underwear as she stepped toward
            the bed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes tracked her every movement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Move over," Agatha said, aiming for confidence but falling just short, her
            voice betraying a faint waver. "That's my side."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised an eyebrow, a soft smile tugging at her lips. That smile made Agatha's
            heart hammer harder than she'd ever admit. Without a word, Rio rolled over, making space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha slid into bed, the sheets cool against her skin. She immediately reached out,
            wrapping an arm around Rio and pulling her close, her front pressed firmly to Rio's back. Rio let out a
            contented sigh, melting into the embrace, and for a moment, the weight of the day seemed to settle around
            them, soft and bearable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their breaths slowed in tandem, their bodies sinking into the quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's body may have relaxed, but her mind hadn't caught up. It was still
            locked on that specific moment in the bathroom, replaying it over and over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So," she started, unable to resist, "is that ... something that can
            happen often? Or is it like Christmas? You know, if it happens every day, it loses its holiday
            spirit?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stiffened briefly, then let out a snort, her body shaking with quiet laughter.
            Even though Agatha couldn't see her face, she knew Rio was smiling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" You did not just compare me squirting to Santa Claus."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Agatha teased, smirking against Rio's shoulder. "It felt
            like a gift to me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a choked laugh at that, the sound caught somewhere between exasperation
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fondness. She fell quiet for a moment, and Agatha thought she might have drifted off.
            A pang of disappointment followed, but Agatha knew herself. She'd get her answer eventually-Rio had to
            know she wouldn't let this go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't know," Rio murmured suddenly, her voice low and slightly shy.
            "I've never done...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that ... before."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw dropped, practically unhinging in shock. The silence hung thick for
            a moment before Rio glanced over her shoulder, catching Agatha's expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her groan filled the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh my god-you're going to be insufferable now, aren't you?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question snapped Agatha out of her stupor, and a smirk curved her lips.
            "I'm always insufferable," she quipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio huffed, a sound that carried the full weight of, I couldn't agree more. Then,
            she let out a loud tired exhale, snuggling deeper into the pillow, clearly signaling that she was
            done</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">entertaining this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But silence wasn't enough to deter her. Agatha smirked, her chin resting against
            Rio's shoulder as she spoke again, her tone teasing, playful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, you're saying it can happen again..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," Rio groaned, her voice muffled by the pillow, "go to
            bed."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't hold back the chuckle that bubbled out of her. She kissed the
            back of Rio's neck softly, letting her lips linger there for a moment before whispering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You didn't say no."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned louder this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah well, you will never hear me say yes again unless I get some fucking
            sleep," grumbled Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked faintly at Rio's grumbled response, knowing she was teetering on
            the edge of pushing her luck. But even Agatha Harkness knew when to quit-well, sometimes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went quiet, letting the teasing ebb away as she rested her head against the
            pillow, her arm still wrapped securely around Rio's waist. The silence between them wasn't
            awkward-it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">was comforting, soothing, a balm for the chaos that had surrounded them all
            day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled slowly, her chest rising and falling in sync with Rio's as she let
            herself relax, allowing her mind to finally settle. No more spiraling thoughts about security details or
            threats. No more nagging doubts about what was happening between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, there was just this-just holding Rio close, feeling her warmth, and knowing
            she was safe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a soft, contented hum, her body melting further into Agatha's hold.
            The sound brought a faint, almost involuntary smile to Agatha's lips. She pressed a kiss to the back of
            Rio's head, her grip tightening ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in what felt like forever, the storm inside Agatha was at
            rest.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bathroom scene was purposeful. I was really trying to build the same feeling from
            episode 1 where Rio helps Agatha out of the spell, and I feel like I got close. The dialogue from the show
            didn't fit it, but I feel like I captured it with just the tension</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or maybe I am just delusional? lol</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also hope the storm analogy of Agatha's control slipping wasn't too
            repetitive. Once I found it I just stuck with it, and felt like I had to build upon it throughout the
            chapter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lastly, I loved the last scene. Kicking my feet and giggling at baby lesbian Agatha
            discovering something new and exciting, and feeling like a kid on Christmas morning lol</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, so this chapter was just fun to write. I hope you guys enjoy this snapshot into
            domestic Agatha and Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat at the dining room table, her eyes fixed on the steaming plate of
            breakfast in front of her. Perfectly scrambled eggs, bacon, and a slice of buttered toast. She inhaled,
            catching the comforting aroma, and her stomach rumbled despite herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn't pick up her fork right away. Instead, she just stared at
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't eat a real breakfast often. Her mornings typically consisted of an
            organic granola bar and an oversized mug of coffee-functional, quick, efficient. Nicky had cereal and
            toast.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't because she didn't like breakfast. In truth, she loved it.
            Pancakes, omelets, French toast-breakfast was a feast of comfort. It was her favorite meal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only crutch?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness didn't cook. She was terrible at it. Always had been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what did Agatha Harkness do when was bad at something? She avoided it. Like the
            fucking plague.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank god for Sonya.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sonya, who was a god damn godsend wrapped in one miracle of a person. Nanny.
            Cleaner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, thank everything holy, a phenomenal cook. Without her, Nicky and Agatha would
            have been surviving on a steady diet of takeout, pizza rolls, and whatever sad excuse for a meal</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">could be microwaved in under three minutes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something about a home-cooked meal that made a house feel like a home.
            Agatha found comfort in knowing she could provide that for Nicky-not directly, of course, but by hiring
            someone who could. She was self-aware enough to recognize her limitations, and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cooking was one of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only problem? Sonya had weekends off and didn't arrive until 8:00 a.m. on
            weekdays, which left Agatha in charge of breakfast. This meant surviving on granola bars and cereal</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">during the week and resorting to takeout on the weekends. A far cry from the warm,
            satisfying meals Sonya churned out effortlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At one point, she had briefly considered hiring a private chef to handle every meal,
            breakfast included. It had been tempting-a fantasy, even-but in the end, it had felt like too much.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Too indulgent, even for her. Plus, there was something humbling about cereal and
            pizza rolls, a dose of reality she didn't want Nicky to grow up completely removed from.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if Agatha were willing to admit it, she didn't want to give up pizza roll
            nights. Those nights, sitting on the couch with Nicky, laughing over the TV while munching on tiny, lava-
            hot bites, were sacred in their own way. Nicky loved them, and honestly, so did she.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze lingered on the plate in front of her, as a faint shadow of a memory flitted
            across her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora had been a terrible cook too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could still recall the dry, tasteless slabs of meat Evanora would slap onto a
            plate,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">accompanied by canned vegetables. But even those meals were rare. Most of her
            childhood had been spent living off bologna sandwiches-cheap, cold, but dependable. There was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">always a pack of bologna in the fridge, next to the expired milk and whatever else
            Evanora had forgotten to throw out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip on her fork loosened as her gaze shifted to the steaming cup of
            coffee that had just been placed beside her plate. She glanced up, catching the subtle movement of Rio
            sliding the cup toward her without so much as a glance, already sinking into the chair next to her.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't say anything as she settled in, her own plate in front of her. The one
            she'd cooked-for herself and Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Agatha's kitchen. After waking up in Agatha's bed, in Agatha's arms.
            After showering in Agatha's bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now here she was, sitting at Agatha's kitchen table, holding Agatha's fork,
            drinking Agatha's coffee, from one of Agatha's favorite mugs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was so... domestic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reached for the cup and took a sip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hated this quiet invasion of her life, this disruption of her carefully
            constructed routine. She hated how easily Rio had slipped into her world, rearranging pieces of it without
            even trying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But most of all, she hated how it also felt strangely-comforting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good, even.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her grip on the coffee cup tightened slightly as the thought sank in, uninvited and
            unwelcome. Agatha wasn't supposed to like this. She wasn't supposed to want someone else so deeply
            entrenched in her life, her space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet...</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The soft clink of Rio's fork against her plate pulled Agatha from her
            thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced over, watching as Rio took a bite of her food, completely at ease, like
            they'd been doing this for years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anxiousness coiled tighter in Agatha's chest as she followed suit, and took
            the first bite of her eggs-and fuck -they were perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she fought against the urge to groan. As if she needed another reason to love
            this woman?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That thought slammed into her, hard and unrelenting, and the ferocity of it made her
            drop her fork with a loud clang on the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio glanced up at the sound, one brow arching in question. "I know it didn't
            taste that bad," she teased.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a look, sharp but tinged with exasperation, before sighing heavily
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">running a hand through her hair. She fought to get a grip on the emotions swirling
            inside her. "Doesn't this feel weird to you?" she finally asked, gesturing vaguely around
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't answer immediately, instead leaning back in her chair with a
            casualness that only irritated Agatha more. She sipped her coffee, her expression unreadable until she
            finally smirked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When life gives you lemons..." Rio trailed off, her tone light,
            teasing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's glare was immediate, sharp enough to cut glass, and thankfully straight
            through Rio stupid statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sighed wearily at that, her smirk fading as she slouched slightly in her chair.
            The playful mask slipped, replaced by something quieter, more honest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Rio said simply, meeting Agatha's eyes. "It's
            weird." Agatha flicked her hand up in a sharp exclamation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you," she muttered, needing the affirmation like air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sighed heavily, her gaze dropping back to her plate before picking up a piece of
            bacon and biting into it. She chewed it with deliberate force, as though trying to grind the entire
            absurdity of their situation into dust under her teeth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know," Rio began, her voice dripping with teasing intent, the kind
            that sent an instant ripple of irritation-and anticipation-through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze mid-chew, her eyes narrowing, already bracing herself for whatever
            nonsense was about to come out of the woman's mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, enjoying the moment far too much, and continued.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This whole situation," she said, pausing to take a languid sip of her
            coffee, her free hand gesturing lazily between them, "is like the epitome of stereotypical lesbian
            behavior."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't know what she was expecting to come out of Rio's mouth, but it
            wasn't that. She tilted her head in confusion at that, continuing chewing before finally
            swallowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you talking about?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, taking her time to spear a piece of egg with her fork. She popped
            it into her mouth, humming softly before finally meeting Agatha's gaze with a teasing glint in her
            eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"U-hauling," she said simply.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her brow furrowing. What the fuck was Rio talking about?
            "Like... the moving truck?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw dropped dramatically, as she gave Agatha an incredulous look, shaking
            her head in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've really never heard the joke?" Rio asked, her tone brimming with
            amazement, her disbelief as playful as it was genuine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brow furrowed as she racked her brain, searching for any context to
            latch onto, but came up with nothing. The frustration of not knowing-of being on the outside of an inside
            joke-pricked at her pride. She glared at Rio, her jaw tightening, and her tone sharpened as she
            spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry," Agatha deadpanned, the words somehow both a hiss and a
            mock. "I'm not well- versed in the ' vagina monologue ,' Rio. Please, enlighten
            me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's grin widened, a devilish light sparking in her eyes. She leaned back in her
            chair, clearly enjoying every moment of Agatha's irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I forget sometimes that you're a baby lesbian," Rio said, her voice
            dripping with exaggerated sympathy, her grin widening as she clearly savored every second of this.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's left eye twitched, a telltale sign that her patience was already wearing
            dangerously thin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright, listen," Rio began in a tone so placating it could've been
            meant for a toddler. She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">even held up her hands, before bringing them together like she was telling a story
            with them. "When two mommies fall in love..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha growled, her fingers tightening around her fork as she leaned forward, her
            voice low and full of menace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know I have enough connections in the upper echelons of New York society to
            kill you with my bare fucking hands and still get away with it, right?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't even flinch. If anything, her smirk deepened, her mouth twitching with
            barely</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">contained laughter as she took a slow sip of her coffee, letting the moment stretch
            just enough to test Agatha's patience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, just as quickly, the teasing faded. The smirk softened into something
            quieter, more reflective, as she set her cup down and looked at Agatha with a serious, almost
            resigned</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she murmured with a heavy sigh, pausing to collect her thoughts
            before continuing. "There's this running joke about lesbians-how we move fast. Women bond faster.
            We just... get each other, you know? No hurdles, no walls, none of that emotional baggage that men seem to
            drag out for years."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, as if considering what to say next.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Even for the truly emotionally stunted women-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's glare sharpened. She could feel the barb coming. Agatha's mouth
            opened to retort, but Rio cut her off with a look that was more knowing than teasing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"- like us ," Rio finished simply, the weight of the words settling between
            them, as she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">claimed she had just as many problems as Agatha, before moving on. "Even then,
            it's like running the 100-meter hurdles-with no hurdles. Straight to the finish line in record time
            while everyone else is jumping and stumbling behind us."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, processing Rio's words, her mind working overtime to unravel the
            logic-or lack thereof-behind them. She sat back slightly, her fork clinking against the table as she</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">waved her hand in mild disbelief, as if to wave away the nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That cannot be true," Agatha stated, her tone flat and edged with
            skepticism, as though sheer disbelief might somehow undo the absurdity Rio had just said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled, leaning back in her chair with the kind of ease that set Agatha's
            teeth on edge. Her eyes sparkled, full of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, but it is," Rio replied, her voice light but unyielding. It was the
            kind of tone someone uses to drop bigger news. "One of my friends from Texas used to say lesbians date
            like dogs age-one year for a straight couple equals seven for us."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, as her mind stumbled over the analogy. Before she could form a
            retort, Rio raised a finger to chin, her expression turning mock-serious.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let's do the math," Rio said, pausing as though deep in thought.
            "We've been at this for a little over a month now, give or take." She feigned looking up at
            the ceiling, mumbling theatrically, "Carry the one, divide by seven..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze snapped back to Agatha, and the smirk that spread across her face was
            absolutely menacing, practically dripping with satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Congratulations, my love" Rio declared, her tone teasing but triumphant.
            "We just celebrated our one-year anniversary."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw dropped, and for a moment, all she could do was gape at Rio, torn
            between indignation and outright disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That-" she began, only to falter, eyes narrowing. "You're just
            fucking with me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio met her gaze with a deadpan look, chewing her bacon like she was unbothered by
            the accusation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unfortunately, no," she said, using her strip of bacon like a professor
            gesturing with a pointer during a lecture. "It's absolutely a thing. I mean, I've done my best
            to avoid the stereotype my entire life, but I've seen it happen with my friends. Stereotypes exist for a
            reason-they're rooted in some kind of truth."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, giving Agatha a pointed look that was both teasing and resigned.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And now, look at me," Rio added, gesturing vaguely around them as if to
            highlight the absurdity of their situation. "You've ruined me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, straightening in her seat and gesturing between them. "We are
            not like that."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced, as her smirk widened. "Oh, we're
            not?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Agatha snapped, gripping her fork tightly and brandishing it like a
            weapon. "We're not. For one, you're not moving in. You're here for safety reasons. Safety ,
            Rio."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, frowning slightly as she tried to make her voice steadier, more
            commanding. "And two, I barely even like you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second the words left her mouth, Agatha winced inwardly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Damn it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not as confident as she'd intended. The hesitation in her tone was a dead
            giveaway, and of course, Rio noticed it immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head tilted, a slow grin spreading across her face like she'd just been
            handed the best gift imaginable. Then she laughed-a loud, full-bodied sound that filled the room. She threw
            her head back, her dark hair catching the soft morning light in a way that made Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chest tighten despite herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio looked back at her, her eyes were warm, playful, and entirely too
            knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Barely like me, huh?" she said, her smirk widening. "You're so
            full of shit. You love me, Agatha Harkness. You can't say it without choking, but you do."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glared at her, though her heart betrayed her by doing an annoying little flip
            at the sound of Rio's confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did those exact words ever leave my mouth, counselor ?" she retorted,
            lifting her chin stubbornly, her grip on the fork tightening just slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a strong argument, legally speaking. She hadn't said those exact words-not
            directly, anyway. Sure, she would conceded that had told Rio she loved her, but not in a way that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">carried the full weight of saying it plainly. That admission still caused a twist of
            discomfort in her stomach, a vulnerability she wasn't ready to lay bare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised an eyebrow, giving Agatha a long, assessing look, the kind that said she
            was deciding just how much she wanted to push. Her smirk didn't waver, though. If anything, it deepened,
            her amusement written all over her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't having it. She lifted her chin a fraction higher and shot Rio a
            pointed look of her own, her fork still in hand like a weapon of pure stubbornness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If it can't hold up in court," Agatha said, her tone clipped, her
            emphasis sharp as a blade, "it won't hold up in my house."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She added extra weight to the last two words, the " my " landing like a
            gavel striking a judge's bench.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, clearly taken aback for a split second before recovering, her lips
            twitching into a full grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Noted," she murmured, leaning back in her chair, the picture of mock
            compliance. But her eyes betrayed her-dark and full of that damnable confidence that made Agatha want to
            simultaneously strangle and kiss her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Agatha said, stabbing her fork into her eggs with a precise jab, as
            if to solidify her point. Her tone was firm, her authority seemingly reasserted-or at least, she
            hoped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One year anniversary. How ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rhythmic clacking of keys filled the living room by mid-day, blending seamlessly
            with the soothing narration of a documentary about mushrooms playing in the background. Agatha absently
            noted the pattern of Rio's taste in TV-it was always nature-focused, calming,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost meditative.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't mind it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least it wasn't some ridiculous reality show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting on opposite ends of the couch, Agatha glanced up from her laptop to the other
            side</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">where Rio was seated, legs tucked underneath her, her fingers flying across the
            keyboard. Her posture was relaxed, but her focus was razor-sharp, her eyes scanning the screen like she was
            devouring every line of text. Whatever she was working on had her utterly engrossed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back slightly, narrowing her eyes as curiosity began to take hold. To
            the best of her knowledge, she hadn't assigned Rio anything pressing-at least not anything that demanded
            the level of focus she was currently witnessing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she hadn't been fully transitioned to Jen or Alice yet. That shift
            wouldn't happen until tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the question lingered, gnawing at her: What was Rio Vidal working on with such
            intensity?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been eating at Agatha for hours, and finally, the question escaped her lips
            before she even realized she was speaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you working on?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, startled, as if she'd forgotten Agatha was in the room. Her eyes met
            Agatha's, a flicker of surprise quickly masked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nothing," Rio said, a little too quickly, her tone nonchalant but
            unconvincing. Agatha's brows lifted, her expression unimpressed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's a bold lie," she retorted, snapping her laptop shut and setting
            it aside. She crossed her legs, folding her hands in her lap as she gave Rio her full attention.
            "You've been glued to that thing for hours. So, what is it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio hesitated, her fingers hovering over the keyboard as if weighing her options.
            Finally, she let out a sigh and turned the laptop toward Agatha, the screen now angled for her to
            see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha frowned, leaning forward as her eyes scanned the display. It took her a moment
            to piece together what she was looking at: graphs, trend analyses, and an Excel spreadsheet filled with
            neatly marked money lines. Her gaze snapped up to Rio, her brows shooting upward in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You play the stock market?" she asked, incredulous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, leaning back into the couch and crossing her arms, clearly enjoying
            Agatha's reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How else do you think I afford my place?" she replied, one brow arching in
            a teasing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">challenge. "Because let's be honest-you pay your first-year associates
            barely enough to share rent with seven other people to rent a two-bedroom close enough to the
            office."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, the accusation hitting harder than she cared to
            admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Excuse me," she retorted, her tone sharp and defensive. "We pay very
            competitive starting salaries."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio snorted, shaking her head with a mix of amusement and exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Competitive compared to what? Barista wages?" She arched a brow, letting
            the words hang for a beat before continuing. "I mean, let's be real. You probably don't see it,
            because," she paused to gesture around her, "and most of my peers come from money. Don't think
            I haven't noticed the last names of my fellow associates."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off balance. She wasn't used to hearing her
            firm-and by extension, herself-called out so directly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What's that supposed to mean?" she asked, her voice clipped, though a
            hint of curiosity crept in despite herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees, and gestured casually with her
            hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It means that for most of your associates, this job is a stepping stone or a
            resume builder, not a lifeline. They have trust funds, inheritances, or mommy and daddy footing the bill for
            their midtown apartments. But for people like me, though? This job is the lifeline. And trust me, it's
            not enough on its own."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, then closed it, unable to form a rebuttal. She
            didn't know what hit harder-Rio's bluntness or the possible truth behind her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tucked that little nugget of information away, a mental note to dig into
            later. She knew inflation was up-rent was sky-high-but she hadn't felt it the same way others might.
            Wealth shielded her from such realities. If her firm wasn't paying their people a living wage, that was
            a serious problem. One that needed to be addressed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze dropped back to Rio's laptop, her eye immediately picking out
            the patterns. She'd represented enough investments firms and had a diverse enough investment
            portfolio</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">to be comfortable reading market data. And based on what she saw on Rio's
            screen-this wasn't the work of an amateur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A series of scheduled trades were lined up for the next morning, each neatly
            organized and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clearly optimized, given that the market was closed today. The precision of it all
            struck her- lines of numbers, detailed charts, and calculated orders that hinted at someone who wasn't
            just playing the market but mastering it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're not just dabbling in this," Agatha remarked, her voice laced
            with a mixture of surprise and genuine admiration. "You're good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers paused over the keyboard, and she looked up at Agatha with a sly
            smirk tugging at the corners of her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, come now, Agatha," she said, her tone dripping with playful
            confidence. "You should know me well enough by now-I don't just survive. I thrive."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The audacity of the statement hung in the air, and yet Agatha couldn't deny the
            truth of it. It was quintessentially Rio-unapologetically bold and utterly capable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard. She tilted her head, studying Rio with
            a newfound curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How do you even know how to do all this?" she asked, gesturing toward the
            laptop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio turned the screen back toward herself, leaning into the couch with an almost
            casual grace. She gave Agatha a look over the top of the laptop, a faint smirk pulling at her lips.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I double-majored in economics and statistics," she said with a shrug, like
            it was no big deal. "Started dabbling in the stock market when I turned eighteen. Took my measly
            paychecks</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">from a farmers' market job and threw them into investments. I got good at
            it-fast. So, I decided to major in it during college. Almost went for my master's in finance,
            but..." she trailed off, giving Agatha a pointed look. "Law school won out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, the puzzle pieces of Rio slowly falling into place in a way that both
            impressed and mildly annoyed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can actually see that," she said, shifting her position to lean her
            elbow against the couch, her head propped on her hand as she stared at Rio with a teasing smirk. "You
            certainly have the cockiness for Wall Street."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio worked her tongue against her cheek, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth
            as she met Agatha's gaze with a smirk of her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll take that as a compliment," Rio quipped, her tone light and
            amused. Agatha huffed, rolling her eyes but unable to suppress her own grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course you would," she muttered, her voice dripping with mock
            exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes lingered on Rio for a moment, quietly taking her in. She was beginning to
            pick up these little pieces of Rio-these fragments of a life so deliberately lived, filled with ambition,
            resilience, and unapologetic confidence. It was...disarming. Fascinating, even. And somehow, it left Agatha
            feeling like she was just beginning to scratch the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned in slightly, unable to resist her curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What made you choose law school?" she asked, her tone softer than
            before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk faded, shifting into something more bittersweet, her expression
            tinged with nostalgia.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It was something my dad used to say to me growing up," she began, her
            voice carrying a warmth that hadn't been there before. "As you can imagine, raising a kid who
            remembers everything is...a real treat."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A wry smile ghosted across her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Even as a kid, I'd call them out on the little fibs or stories parents tell
            to keep their kids in line. And every time I did, my dad would let out this loud, dramatic sigh and say,
            ' You should be a lawyer someday, mija. Nothing gets past you .'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, the memory seeming to hang between them, both tender and amusing. It
            softened Rio in a way that made Agatha's chest tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I guess," Rio continued, her voice heavier now, tinged with a depth that
            hadn't been there before. "I applied to law school for him, and then...I fell in love with it. It
            just felt right after that-like he was guiding me still."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words settled into the air between them, soft yet weighted, carrying an emotional
            gravity that Agatha couldn't ignore. For a moment, silence hung between them, and Agatha let it, sensing
            that anything she said might cheapen the sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another puzzle piece fell into place in Agatha's growing picture of who Rio Vidal
            was. And this one fit squarely into the bittersweet corner of her life. It was a small but significant piece
            of the whole-a glimpse into the things that shaped her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What about you?" Rio asked, her voice lighter, cutting through the air
            pulling Agatha from her thoughts. "Why did you go to law school?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, the question catching her off guard. But she welcomed the simplicity
            of her own story. It wasn't heavy. It wasn't tangled in emotion. It just... was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, that's easy," she said, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. "I
            did it for the money." Rio snorted, her incredulous expression practically dripping with
            disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Seriously?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shrugged, leaning back into the couch like she didn't feel the weight of
            Rio's judgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I grew up in a trailer park," she began, the admission catching her off
            guard for a second, before recovering. "We were always scraping by, barely making it. When you grow up
            trying to rub two pennies together just to survive, you think about security-and money meant
            security."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her tone shifted slightly, darker, as she continued.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My mom was a self-proclaimed medicine woman. Half home remedies, half religious
            healing, full delusion."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rolled her eyes, though the bitterness in her voice betrayed her effort to play
            it off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She destroyed any inclination for me to want to go into medicine. Law seemed...
            safer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucrative ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met Rio's gaze evenly, daring her to challenge the practicality of her
            choice. But Rio didn't. Instead, a flicker of understanding softened her smirk, the humor in her eyes
            tempered by something gentler.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wow," Rio finally said, her tone caught between teasing and genuine
            admiration. She paused, lips twitching like she was debating whether to say something witty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Inspiring," she added dryly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't help but smirk in return, the urge to lighten the mood
            outweighing any need to dwell on the past. After all, she had earned every ounce of humor that had come out
            of her messed-up childhood-might as well use it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Think I could host a TED Talk on it?" Agatha deadpanned, raising an
            eyebrow. " Don't follow your dreams, kids-follow the money. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, amusement dancing in her dark eyes as she leaned back into
            the couch, utterly at ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'd watch it," she said lightly. "Might even take notes."
            Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't have to take notes. You remember everything." Rio's
            smirk at that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't lost on Agatha that they'd just shared pieces of themselves that
            most people kept locked away. It wasn't until the quiet settled back in that she fully realized what had
            happened-that she'd told Rio about her childhood, about growing up with nothing, about a mother who
            barely deserved the title. She hadn't even told James any of that until they were engaged, and only
            because he'd asked if her family would be coming to the wedding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe Rio had a point about the lack of hurdles between two women. How else could
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">explain sharing one of the deepest, most guarded parts of herself without even
            realizing she'd done it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't like her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness didn't open doors that had been bolted shut for decades-not for
            anyone. And yet, here she was...letting Rio in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened, curling in on itself, the vulnerability clawing at her edges.
            She needed to break the moment before it swallowed her whole. With a sharp breath, she pushed herself
            upright, grabbing her laptop and flipping it open, her fingers finding the keys almost immediately.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The familiar screen lit up, and she dove back into work, letting the rhythm of typing
            steady her spiraling thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel Rio's gaze on her, lingering like a soft weight. But Rio-being
            Rio-didn't call her out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha heard the faint shuffle of movement from the other end of the couch, and
            moments later, the steady clicking of keys resumed, signaling that Rio had moved on too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked down at her computer, trying to read this report, but eyes began to
            ache, a dull strain creeping in as she squinted at the small text on her laptop screen. The brightness of
            the display didn't help, and she let out an annoyed grumble, rubbing at her temples.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ugh," she muttered under her breath, the faint acknowledgment of her own
            mortality tugging at her pride. She hated this-hated the reminder that age was creeping up on her, slow but
            unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grumbling again, she leaned over to her bag, fishing through its contents with a
            slight scowl until her fingers brushed against the familiar frame of her glasses. She didn't need them
            often, but when she did, the relief was undeniable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pulling them out, she inspected them briefly. At least the wide black flames were
            fashionable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Small victories.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slipped the glasses on, the world sharpening into crisp clarity almost instantly.
            Agatha sighed softly, the tension in her eyes easing as she focused back on the report in front of
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She managed to get through the first couple of paragraphs when a shift in the
            atmosphere caught her attention. The documentary had stopped running, the quiet that replaced it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">amplifying every other sound-or lack thereof. The absence of noise from Rio's
            direction was what truly pricked at Agatha's senses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not a single keystroke. Not a rustle of movement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes flicked up over the rim of her laptop, and instantly, she was met with
            blazing dark eyes. Eyes she knew all too well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the kind of look that usually ended with her pressed against some surface,
            legs trembling, chest heaving, and body utterly wrecked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her mind scrambling to keep up with whatever was happening.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're wearing glasses," Rio said, her voice low and gravelly, the
            sound sending a shiver down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took her a beat too long to connect the dots. Seriously? The glasses did it? Of
            all things.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Really?" Agatha asked, her tone flat as she pointedly removed the glasses
            from her face, dangling them between two fingers. "This is what does it for you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, her smirk slow and deliberate, her eyes raking over Agatha like
            she was something to be devoured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't think you could get any hotter," Rio murmured, her voice low
            and raspy. "And yet, here we are."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt a flush creep up her neck, unbidden and entirely unwelcome.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're ridiculous," she muttered, slipping the glasses back on and
            glaring at Rio over the frames.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed sharply through her nose and tried to focus, her eyes dropping back to
            the screen. She read the same sentence twice, then a third time, the words blurring together as her mind
            failed to process a single one of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, unmoving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name, spoken low and deliberate, rolled off Rio's tongue like a challenge.
            Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Rio said her name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just her voice-it was the way she dragged it out, low and rough, like
            it wasn't just a name but a promise. Agatha felt it in her chest, curling low in her stomach and
            spreading outward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Agatha finally bit out, not looking up. "Look at
            me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated, her pulse drumming in her ears. She didn't want to look. Knew
            exactly what she'd find if she did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she warned, her voice low and edged with exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had work to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio repeated, softer this time, but with the same damn tone-the
            one that felt like a hand reaching inside her chest and wrapping around her heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, her resolve cracking as she finally lifted her gaze over her laptop
            screen. Big mistake.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk was wicked, her eyes dark and simmering, and the way she was looking
            at her- like Agatha was the most beautiful thing in the world-made her feel both utterly exposed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and completely turned on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let the moment stretch, the weight of her gaze pressing down on Agatha until the
            air felt charged between them. Then, with a slow, deliberate tilt of her head, Rio's lips curved into a
            smirk, her dark eyes gleaming with intent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go to the bedroom and wait for me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The command was calm, but it struck with the force of a thunderclap. Agatha sucked in
            a breath, her chest tightening, her pulse quickening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The audacity-the absolute nerve of this woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she just stared at Rio, her pride warring with the heat pooling low in
            her stomach. She hated how easily Rio could do this, how effortlessly she could unravel her composure with
            just a few words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the look in Rio's eyes-that searing confidence, that magnetic pull-it
            stripped Agatha of any desire to push back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a slow breath, feeling the energy crackling in the air between them,
            building inside her. The tension was palpable, pressing down on her, driving her every move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, Agatha closed her laptop with decisive click, setting it aside on the
            table. Her fingers brushed the edges of her glasses, ready to slip them off, when Rio's voice cut
            through the heavy silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her eyes snapping to Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Keep those on," Rio said, her tone low and firm that it sent a shiver
            coursing down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heat bloomed in Agatha's chest, spreading outward, a warmth she didn't even
            try to tamp down. She couldn't fight the small smile that tugged at her lips as she moved to her
            feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, she turned, her steps deliberate and unhurried as she made her
            way toward the bedroom. There was a sway in her stride, one she didn't bother to hide, her smirk growing
            with every step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused at the doorway, just long enough to glance over her shoulder, catching
            Rio's gaze still locked on her, dark and hungry. Agatha felt the heat rise further, but instead of
            feeling overwhelmed, it felt like power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who knew getting old could be this fun?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, wasn't that cute? Not a lot of plot here, just fluff. So I added some
            chapters at the countdown because I have things that need to happen between now and the end, and this
            chapter didn't move the plot like I needed. But I also felt like it was needed, a little fluff between
            these two idiots.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whole u-hauling discussion had be rolling. Agatha being a baby lesbian is like my
            favorite thing ever. Her tipping a drag queen $100 bills, the fact that she didn't know what Rio
            carrying a backpack meant, the whole "it felt like a gift to me" thing last</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chapter, and now this U-Haul analogy...it's been so much fun to write.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "Congratulations, my love," from AAA also made me smile. Love tying
            anything in from the show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also this my be favorite line in the whole story now: ""You're so full
            of shit. You love me, Agatha Harkness. You can't say it without choking, but you do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, I saw a meme of Agatha that said, "Do you know how much trauma you have to
            go through to get this funny? and I had to work it into this story because it is so real. So the whole scene
            was purposeful: Agatha couldn't help but smirk in return, the urge to lighten the mood outweighing any
            need to dwell on the past. After all, she had earned</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every ounce of humor that had come out of her messed-up childhood-might as well use
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, notice the Aubrey Plaza tongue in cheek scene? I noticed she does that a lot
            and had to work it in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lastly, Kathryn Hahn in her glasses...is like *chefs kiss* so...lol</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay--well there are few parts in this chapter that just...hit me right in the heart.
            I really loved this chapter. I hope you guys enjoy this chapter as much I enjoyed writing it :)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heels clicked sharply against the floors, the sound echoing as she
            crossed the invisible boundary separating the civilians from the gladiators. Her stride was steady,
            deliberate, every step a declaration of war as she moved toward her designated chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Settling into her seat, she reached into her bag, pulling out a stack of files and a
            pen. She placed them on the table in front of her, her fingers instinctively twirling the pen in a
            practiced, fluid motions-a quiet outlet for the restless energy humming just beneath her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't nervous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness didn't do nervous-not when it came to court. This wasn't
            fear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something sharper, more visceral.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The electric buzz that always thrummed through her veins before stepping onto the
            legal battlefield was alive and crackling. But now, it was something more. It wasn't just about winning,
            about outmaneuvering the enemy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No-this time, she wanted blood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to rip their fucking throats out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head snapped to the left at the sound of movement, her eyes locking onto Fox and
            Ratcliff as they sauntered over to the opposing counsel's table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Fox couldn't resist. She turned toward Agatha with that insufferable,
            self-satisfied smirk, her eyes flicking over Agatha's shoulder before landing back on her with a look
            of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">completely fake concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where's your co-counsel, Agatha?" Fox purred, her tone dripping with
            mock sympathy. The facade lasted all of a second before her smirk turned devilish, her voice lowering just
            enough to twist the knife. "I hope she's okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit like a thunderclap, the ringing in Agatha's ears almost drowning
            out the rest of the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox knew .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fucking knew about the threat against Rio, and now she was openly mocking her for
            it, throwing it in her face with calculated cruelty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something inside Agatha snapped. She shoved back her chair, already halfway to her
            feet, the fury in her chest roaring to life, but before she could take a step, a firm hand pressed down on
            her shoulder, pushing her back into her chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked up, ready to lash out, only to see Lilia standing behind her, calm and
            steady. Her sharp, knowing eyes met Agatha's, not in warning, but rather in understanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, without a word, Lilia turned her head toward Fox.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox, to her credit, didn't deflate entirely under Lilia's piercing gaze, but
            the shift was there, subtle yet telling. The self-satisfied smirk wavered for just a moment, her mask
            slipping ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia's presence had rattled her, a hairline fracture in her carefully
            constructed confidence. And even the smallest crack could eventually cause a leak-and Lilia and Agatha knew
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Lilia," Fox said, surprise flickering in her tone before she quickly
            masked it under her usual cocky bravado. "I didn't know they let you out of the office anymore. I
            thought you were more of a figurehead these days."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The faintest smile curved Lilia's lips, but it was far from friendly. It was the
            kind of smile that promised pain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia's faint smile didn't waver as she stepped forward, her movements
            precise, deliberate. She stopped just short of Fox's table, her gaze steady and sharp, cutting through
            the tension like a blade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Madeline," Lilia said, her voice smooth and calm, but carrying the
            unmistakable weight of the authority that Lilia's 30 plus years in law has earned her. "It's
            always a pleasure to see you. Your theatrics never fail to entertain."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her head slightly, her smile remaining, but her eyes cold and
            unyielding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Though I must say, threats of violence against a colleague feels a bit...
            desperate. Even for you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's smirk tightened, her posture stiffening as she tried to maintain her
            composure under Lilia's scrutiny.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't know what you're talking about," she replied with a casual
            shrug, though the edge in her voice betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia leaned forward slightly, resting her fingertips on the edge of their
            table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I think you do," she said, her tone dropping, quiet but lethal.
            "Mocking the personal safety of opposing co-counsel-particularly in light of certain recent
            threats-isn't just tasteless. It's dangerous, and unbecoming of someone who's supposed to uphold
            the integrity of the court."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart thudded as she watched Lilia systematically dismantle Fox's
            smug facade. She'd seen Lilia work before, but there was something about the way she wielded her words
            now, that made even Agatha sit a little straighter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's smile finally cracked, her jaw tightening as she struggled to maintain her
            composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was simply making conversation," she said, her tone strained.
            "Surely you're not implying</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not implying anything," Lilia cut her off, her voice sharp.
            "I'm stating facts. And if you continue down this path, rest assured I will make sure those facts
            are formally addressed ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, the courtroom seemed to hold its breath, the tension between them
            crackling in the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Lilia straightened, her gaze sweeping over Fox with an air of effortless
            dismissal, like she was beneath her. Her voice, when she spoke, was smooth and cold as steel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I suggest you focus on your own side of the aisle, Madeline," Lilia said,
            her tone as sharp as a blade, each word measured for maximum impact. She let the silence linger just long
            enough to let it sting before delivering the final blow. "Because from where I'm standing...
            desperation does not look good on you. You're getting wrinkles, darling."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze lingered for a heartbeat longer, a calculated flicker of dismissal, before
            she turned on her heel and walked back to their table with the kind of calm, unhurried confidence that made
            every step feel like a statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia settled into the seat beside Agatha, the weight of her presence as tangible as
            the heavy silence now emanating from the other side of the aisle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled a breath she hadn't realized she was holding, turning to Lilia
            with a questioning glance, her voice low to avoid being overheard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Not that I didn't enjoy every second of that," Agatha murmured,
            "but what are you doing here?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia turned her head, a slow, satisfied smirk curling at the corners of her
            lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, Agatha," she said, her tone almost playful. "You didn't
            really think we were going to let you face this alone, did you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could respond, Lilia reached forward, tapping her hand lightly in an
            almost</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">conspiratorial gesture. Then she leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper,
            smooth and sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let's take these fuckers down, shall we? Like old times."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smile tugged at the corners of Agatha's mouth, despite herself. The
            chaotic energy that had been buzzing under her skin began to settle, calmed by Lilia's steady presence.
            She hadn't realized how much she needed her until this very moment, and though Agatha would never admit
            it aloud, she felt... surprisingly grateful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, she wasn't about to show it. Old habits died hard, and honestly, Lilia
            always liked Agatha exactly as she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Lilia-language," Agatha said, feigning mock outrage as she theatrically
            placed a hand over her heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia smirked, her posture casual as she leaned back in her chair with effortless
            confidence. "Please, Agatha. I've heard worse from you before dawn."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha parted her lips to retort, but just then, the door to the judge's chambers
            swung open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"All rise," called the clerk, instantly snapping Agatha's focus forward
            as she rose from her seat. "The Honorable Judge Harrison Mack presiding."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Mack entered and took his place at the bench, prompting everyone else to follow
            suit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Mack settled into his chair, adjusted his glasses, and surveyed the courtroom
            with a weary expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We're here to voir dire and get ourselves a jury. Are you counselors ready
            to proceed?" Madeline rose smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Your Honor." Agatha followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Your Honor," she said but not without casting a pointed look at Fox,
            her expression sharp enough to cut.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Mack's gaze shifted between them, the corners of his mouth twitching
            downward into a resigned frown. He exhaled heavily, the sound carrying a mix of exasperation and preemptive
            fatigue, as if he could already see the storm brewing between them and feel the inevitable migraine taking
            root.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alright," he muttered, drumming his fingers briefly on the bench.
            "Bring in the prospective jurors."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Six hours later, they had a jury. Surprisingly, the process had gone faster than
            expected- thanks to Lilia. She had an uncanny knack for reading people, a masterful intuition that made her
            jury selections feel almost surgical. It was a skill so precise it needed to be studied by
            scientists.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they descended the courthouse steps, Agatha half-listened to Lilia ramble about
            the latest fiscal report. Around them, people moved in a constant stream, the steps to the courthouse
            bustling like a human highway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, out of the corner of her eye, Agatha saw something-or rather, someone-that made
            her freeze mid-step. A man stood at the far end of the courthouse steps, casually leaning</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against a pillar. At first, the distance made it hard to be sure, the crowd moving
            between them like a living blur that forced her eyes to refocus again and again. But then the man
            smirked,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and Agatha felt her blood turn to ice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James Hughes. Head of Security at Vanguard. The man who had killed Brooke
            Sinclair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart slammed against her ribs, pounding so hard she thought it might echo in her
            ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, another large group of people passed between them, a chaotic wave of
            bodies</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chattering and bustling down the courthouse steps. Agatha's line of sight was
            momentarily blocked, her breath caught in her throat as her eyes darted, trying to track him through the
            shifting sea of strangers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when the crowd thinned and her view finally cleared, he was gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened, the thundering pulse in her ears drowning out the world around
            her. She scanned the steps, her gaze flicking from pillar to pillar, but James Hughes had vanished as if he
            had never been there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?" Lilia's voice cut through the haze, sharp with concern.
            "Are you okay?" Agatha forced herself to swallow, nodding stiffly as she fought to steady her
            breath. "Yeah," she said, her voice a little too quick, too brittle. "I'm
            fine."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she wasn't fine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a deep breath, as she worked to calm the erratic beat of her heart. The
            lingering image of James Hughes standing there still clung to her mind like smoke, but she shoved it aside,
            forcing herself to focus on the present. She turned to Lilia, her voice steady, if a bit subdued.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want a ride back to the office?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia glanced at her, really looked, her sharp eyes scanning Agatha's face as if
            she could sense something was off. For a moment, it seemed like she might ask, but instead, she let it go,
            offering a casual shrug.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, I've got a meeting uptown."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, taking a step to leave, but then hesitated. Surprising herself-and
            probably Lilia just as much-she turned back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you for today."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia blinked, caught off guard, but then her expression softened into a smile. Not
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">condescending, placating one Agatha used to loathe, but something genuine, something
            real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," Lilia said, her tone warm. She started to turn away but
            suddenly stopped, her eyes widening like she'd remembered something important.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh!" She reached into her bag and pulled out a blue folder, handing it to
            Agatha with a small flourish. "I took the liberty of getting that for you. I really must be going,
            though. Have a good rest of your day, Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could respond, Lilia was already walking off, heels clicking against
            the pavement as she disappeared into the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced down at the folder, curiosity mingling with suspicion. She opened it,
            her eyes narrowing immediately as bold black letters practically leapt off the top of the single document
            inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">RELATIONSHIP DISCLOSURE FORM</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips thinned into a tight line as her eyes darted across the
            words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a sharp exhale, she snapped the folder shut and strode toward her car, muttering
            under her breath, a new frustration simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've got to be fucking kidding me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pushed open the office doors and strode inside, her heels clicking against the
            polished floors. She rarely ventured to this side of the building, the far end where the
            associates'</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">offices were tucked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Associates came to her, not the other way around. But today was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the very end of the corridor, near the bathroom, sat the smallest office in the
            building-a space the firm reserved for the most promising first-year associate. Agatha had seen plenty of
            associates occupy it over the years, most of whom she'd ignored entirely. But this morning, Jen had sent
            out an email announcing the new occupant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio Vidal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had read the email over her coffee, her face impassive as her gaze flicked to
            Rio across her kitchen. She was making breakfast-again. French toast this time, as if they</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weren't already walking a line that made Agatha's stomach twist in ways she
            wasn't ready to confront.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't said anything to Rio. She didn't want to ruin the surprise.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio deserved the office. After everything she'd done for the Vanguard case,
            she'd shattered every expectation of a first-year associate's workload. And of course-there was
            another,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">more practical reason. The bullpen, where most associates worked, was too chaotic.
            Too hard to monitor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had managed to plant bugs and even a camera in the firm before. The idea
            that they could get to Rio out in the open was possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The black vehicles trailing Agatha's town car at a respectable distance, paired
            with the severe female agent stationed just outside Rio's door, were unmistakable indicators of the
            gravity of the threat-the danger Rio was in. The weight of it all sat heavily on Agatha's shoulders, her
            mind flashing back to James Hughes outside the courthouse today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd need to report his presence to the security team immediately. Just in
            case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was likely nothing more than a calculated act of intimidation, Vanguard's way
            of reminding her they were always watching. But Agatha wasn't about to take any chances.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not with Rio's life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That thought hit her harder than she expected, a pang sharp enough to make her pause.
            She clenched her jaw, forcing the feeling down into the recesses of her mind where it wouldn't distract
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha drew a steadying breath, her hand brushing the cool metal of the door handle
            before she pushed it open and stepped inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't knock.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may have been Rio's office now, but technically, every office in this building
            was hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment she entered, Rio looked up from her desk, her sharp gaze locking onto
            Agatha. The tan tailored suit paired with a crisp white shirt had already caught Agatha off guard this
            morning when Rio had stepped out of the guest bedroom putting on her leather banded</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watch, moving toward her with an effortless confidence that left her momentarily
            speechless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, even seeing it a second time, knowing what to expect, it still hit her like a
            punch to the chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Too good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's thoughts faltered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure.
            She stepped forward and sank into the chair across from Rio's desk, immediately regretting it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chair was stiff and uncomfortable. Her mind drifted to logistics, already
            plotting how to have it replaced with something more suitable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You get your jury?" Rio asked, setting her paperwork aside and leaning
            back in her chair with an ease that seemed almost practiced.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back as well, mirroring Rio's posture. "I did," she
            replied simply.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed felt weighted, pressing down on the space between them.
            They hadn't really discussed it-not in any meaningful way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Removing Rio from the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had taken the decision in stride, not even flinching when the news came. But
            Agatha knew her better than that. They were alike in many ways, and if the roles had been reversed, Agatha
            would've been furious. But they were also strategic, calculated. Both of them knew how to play the game,
            and Rio understood that once the partners made a decision, there was no undoing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, understanding didn't make it hurt any less.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, Agatha wouldn't even have a jury-wouldn't have a winnable case
            against Vanguard-if it weren't for Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she said softly, the words catching even herself off guard even as
            they left her lips. "I am sorry."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, her sharp features softening as she regarded Agatha for a
            moment. Then, with a sigh, she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know," she said simply. "I'm just disappointed I won't get
            to watch them go down.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or..."-she paused, her lips curving into a teasing smirk- "see you in your
            element. The showmanship of a trial and all that, you know?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha snorted, arching a brow as she leaned back in her chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought I put on one hell of a show last night for you," she shot back,
            her voice laced with dry humor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes sparked at that, and she bit her lip briefly, as if to suppress a
            grin, before letting a slow, deliberate smirk spread across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, you did," she said, her voice dropping into a low, almost purring
            tone that sent a flicker of heat course through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the heat rise beneath her collar as her mind betrayed her, flashing back
            to last night-Rio utterly dismantling her and putting her back together for hours, all while wearing those
            damn glasses. Who knew a simple pair of frames could make someone so feral?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She forced herself out of that deep, dangerous gutter, lifting her gaze to Rio, who
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">watching her with a self-satisfied smirk. The kind of smirk that told Agatha, clear
            as day, that Rio knew exactly where her mind had wandered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a pointed look but quickly remembered why she'd come in.
            Straightening in her chair, she forced herself to focus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look," she began, the hesitation in her tone making her cringe inwardly.
            She hated how uncomfortable she sounded, but this was an uncomfortable conversation, one she'd
            been</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">avoiding but could no longer dodge. "I'm going to work from home for the
            rest of the day." Rio straightened slightly at that, her playful expression replaced by a flicker of
            concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Everything okay?" she asked, her voice soft but probing. Agatha waved off
            the worry with a casual gesture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she replied, though her throat felt tight as she forced the next
            words out. "I'm picking Nicky up from school. He's coming back to me this week, and since he
            doesn't handle</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">change all that well-and there's now a stranger living in his house"-her
            sharp gaze flicked pointedly at Rio-" temporarily , I figured it was best to break the news to him in
            person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Prepare him."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned back in her chair, her expression softening as understanding settled
            across her features.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Rio knew about Nicky. She'd walked past his Toy Story -themed room
            more times than Agatha could count. His photos were everywhere-in the living room, the hallway, even on
            Agatha's desk. And then there was the day at the park when Rio met him. They'd sat on the bench
            together, talking for a while, Rio's easy demeanor putting Nicky at ease almost instantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had to know this conversation was coming and judging by the calm, unshocked
            expression on her face, she had been expecting it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Rio murmured softly, her eyes steady on Agatha. "What do you
            need from me to make this as easy as possible for him-and for you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that did something to Agatha's heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a small thing, maybe, but it struck a chord deep inside her-one she hadn't
            expected. Rio's sincerity, her lack of hesitation, and the simple, direct way she asked how to help
            Nicky settled over Agatha like a quiet warmth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For so long, she'd been used to the people she saw romantically to sidestep the
            subject of her son, treating him like an obstacle in her life rather than the center of it. But here was
            Rio, meeting the moment head-on, no discomfort, no excuses-just understanding and a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">willingness to do whatever was needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her chest tighten, the sensation unfamiliar and uncomfortably tender. She
            cleared her throat, willing herself to push past the strange flutter it sent through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Honestly," she sighed, the word carrying the weight of her uncertainty,
            "I'm not really sure. He already took to you at the park-faster than I've ever seen-but he
            might be different in his own space. I guess..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitated, her eyes meeting Rio's, searching for some reassurance. "Play
            it by ear? He can be unpredictable sometimes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, her expression shifting into a weary smile. "Wonder where he got
            that from?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a look, equal parts amused and exasperated, before letting out a
            resigned sigh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He is like a miniature version of myself," she admitted. "Sometimes I
            wonder if I made him from scratch, with no help from James at all."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, leaning back in her chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, if anyone could pull off immaculate conception through sheer willpower
            and stubbornness, it would be you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, but despite herself, a faint smile tugged at the corners of
            her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment lingered in the air, delicate and charged, before Agatha felt that
            familiar itch beneath her collar-the one that made her shoulders tense and her composure falter. Every nerve
            in her body felt like it was vibrating as she reached into her coat pocket, her fingers curling around cool
            metal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without allowing herself to second-guess, she pulled the object out and slapped it
            onto Rio's desk, her hand remaining firmly over it as she slid it toward her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want this back as soon as this is over," she said, her voice steady, but
            her heart pounding so hard she was certain Rio could hear it. Her gaze was sharp and pointed, determined to
            hide the storm of emotions swirling beneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio glanced at her hand, brows knitting in confusion before flicking her gaze back up
            to Agatha, her expression silently asking, And what exactly is this thing I'm not supposed to
            keep?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry, before she lifted her hand, revealing the
            object beneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spare key.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silver gleamed starkly against the dark wood of Rio's desk, catching the
            light like some sort of fucking beacon, screaming significance louder than Agatha would ever admit out
            loud.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I realized," she started, but her voice wavered, forcing her to pause and
            clear her throat. She straightened her shoulders, steeling herself against the sudden wave of
            vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That you're going to need it. There will no doubt be times when we
            won't be on the same schedule, and you'll need access to the house when I'm not there." She
            hesitated, her voice softening. "Or even when I am. There's no reason for you to
            knock."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weight of her words settled between them, heavier than the key itself, and
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">resisted the urge to fidget, her composure hanging by a thread. She waited for
            Rio's response, her heart pounding in her chest like a war drum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned forward, her movements uncharacteristically slow, and took the key from
            the desk. Agatha, still seated, watched as Rio turned the small piece of metal over in her fingers, her
            expression thoughtful, her discomfort flickering in the way her gaze avoided holding</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's for too long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It struck Agatha then-Rio was just as uncomfortable in this moment as she was.
            Somehow, that knowledge made her feel better, steadier. They were both on uneven ground here, both figuring
            out what this meant as they went along.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio seemed to take a breath, before reaching into her desk drawer to retrieve her
            keyring. Agatha watched, her chest tightening, as Rio slipped the silver key onto the ring alongside the
            others-a small, simple action that felt anything but.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something about the way it fit so seamlessly there, like it belonged, that
            stirred something deep in Agatha. Her heart thudded in her chest as she stared at the keyring, the key to
            her home now nestled among Rio's other keys, as if it had always been there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just a practical gesture-it was a statement. A quiet, unspoken
            acknowledgment of trust. And though Agatha wasn't one to get sentimental about such things, she
            couldn't shake the way it made her feel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she said, rising to her feet, desperate to escape the conversation
            and the feelings boiling up inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sent Rio a glance and added, "I'll see you later," already
            regretting how stiff and awkward the words sounded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, this felt weird.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thankfully, Rio didn't push. She just nodded, giving Agatha the reprieve she
            needed. Agatha turned to leave but froze at the sound of Rio's soft voice calling her name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's voice was quiet yet firm, the two syllables threading through the air with
            precision, stopping Agatha mid-step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With her hand still on the door handle, Agatha turned slowly, her gaze locking onto
            Rio, who was watching her with an unreadable expression. For a moment, the room felt too still, the soft hum
            of the buildings heating system the only sound between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood, her movements unhurried, and rounded her desk with ease. She didn't
            stop until she was just inches away-close enough that Agatha could feel the faint warmth of her presence and
            smell the faintest hint of a forest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you know I was getting the first-year associate office?" Rio asked,
            her voice steady, though her eyes searched Agatha's face for something unspoken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown by the question. She straightened her shoulders
            instinctively, as though bracing herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," she replied evenly. "I got the email this morning during
            breakfast."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile that made Agatha's chest
            tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And do all new offices in your firm come with a Hoya Carnosa Madara ?" Rio
            asked, the name rolling off her tongue with just enough emphasis to make it sound both casual and
            pointed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked at her in confusion, her brow furrowing. "A what?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, glancing over her shoulder with a gesture of her thumb toward
            the desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The several-thousand-dollar plant sitting on my desk," she clarified, her
            lips tugging into a teasing smile that sent a ripple of warmth and unease through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind scrambled for a response, her expression carefully blank. She
            hadn't left a card for a reason, and she wasn't about to own up to it now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I wouldn't know," she said with a shrug that she hoped looked
            convincingly indifferent. "Jen handles the floral orders. You'd have to ask her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips twitched, her amusement barely concealed as the corners of her mouth
            pinched, her expression practically glowing with disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," she murmured, her tone light but undeniably skeptical.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stepped back then, her gaze softening into something gentler, giving Agatha the
            space to leave without pressing further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha inhaled deeply, steadying herself as her fingers tightened around the door
            handle. She turned, opened the door, and stepped forward, eager to escape the tension simmering in
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just as she was about to leave, Rio's voice floated after her, quiet and
            warm. "Thank you for the plant, my love ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words pierced through Agatha's back like an arrow, sharp and unrelenting,
            wrapping around her heart and squeezing tight. She froze, caught in the doorway, her hand still gripping the
            handle as if it could anchor her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't the first time Rio had said those words. Hell, even Agatha said the
            exact words in the bathroom, while three fingers deep inside Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time, it wasn't said mockingly or in the throes of passion-no, this time
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">different. This time, it hit her like a lightning strike, sudden and
            all-encompassing, pulling her completely off balance-because she liked it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She liked it a lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Far more than she was willing to admit, even to herself. The way Rio said it-soft,
            unhurried, and full of quiet certainty-made something deep inside her ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just the words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the weight behind them, the meaning woven into every syllable. Rio had told
            Agatha she loved her, and now this- my love -was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just a pet name tossed out to fill the air. It wasn't casual or
            fleeting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was deliberate, heartfelt, and so achingly real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her grip tightening on the door handle, her knuckles white as she
            fought against the urge to turn around or run out the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice, when it finally came, was barely a whisper, trembling with the emotions
            she was trying so hard to suppress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're welcome," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then she stepped out, letting the door close behind her with a soft, final click.
            But as she walked away, the echo of my love lingered, sinking deeper into her chest. It felt as though the
            words were taking root, settling into a place they belonged, as if Rio were carving out a home within
            her-with every intention of staying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had braced herself for all sorts of reactions from Nicky-nervousness, a flurry
            of questions, maybe even a bit of resistance. She'd rehearsed explanations in her head during the drive,
            anticipating every possible "why" or "how long."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when she picked him up from school and gently explained that Rio would be staying
            at their house for a while because of a work thing, Nicky just smiled at her and said,
            "Okay."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just okay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned by his simplicity, her carefully rehearsed
            responses dissolving into irrelevance. She'd prepared for every possible question-except for none at
            all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, the reprieve didn't last.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment they walked into the house, as Agatha leaned down to slip off her heels,
            Nicky's voice broke through the quiet with a question that nearly sent her sprawling into the
            wall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is Rio your girlfriend?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely caught herself, her hand shooting out to steady against the wall before
            she could faceplant into it. She stayed there for a moment, braced against the cool surface, her pulse
            thundering in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky," Agatha began, her voice sharper than intended as she turned to
            face him, still steadying herself against the wall. "Where did that come from?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky sat on the floor, tugging at his sneakers. He looked up at her with wide,
            innocent eyes, the kind that only children could manage-pure curiosity written all over his face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She makes you smile," he said matter-of-factly, like it was the most
            obvious thing in the world. "Remember? I saw it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard yet again, her breath hitching as his words settled
            over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had saw it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a moment, her mind spinning as she tried to figure out how to navigate
            this</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">conversation. She could deflect, redirect, or outright lie-but none of that seemed
            right. The truth was simpler, and besides, she and Rio hadn't even talked about labels.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And girlfriend ?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word alone made her shiver, a full-body cringe rippling through her. It sounded
            so...juvenile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We are not girlfriends," Agatha said firmly, slipping off her other heel
            and straightening to look down at Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We are..." She paused, searching for the right phrasing. "We're
            friends who enjoy spending time together outside of work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky finished taking off his last shoe, placing it neatly beside hers. He stood,
            tilting his head as he looked up at her with that same unrelenting curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But she makes you smile," he said again, his tone so simple, so certain.
            He scrunched his nose, adding, "You see Aunt Jen outside of work, and she doesn't make you
            smile."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed, crossing her arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's because your Aunt Jen is annoying," she shot back, narrowing
            her eyes. "And she's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">not your aunt," she added pointedly. "She just told you that to annoy me
            ." Nicky shrugged as if the correction didn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I like calling her Aunt Jen," he said casually, then paused, as though
            gathering his thoughts. "So, Rio doesn't annoy you, and she makes you smile."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously, where was James's boneheaded genetics in this kid?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could tell James the same thing five times in a row, and he'd still forget
            it. Nicky, though? Nicky was all her-sharp, observant, and relentless-and she was paying the price for it
            now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, Rio annoys me," she muttered, giving him a playful glare at him for
            good measure. Nicky blinked up at her, his lips twitching like he was trying not to grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But she still makes you smile," Nicky said, his voice brimming with that
            maddening confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, placing her hands on her hips as she stared down at him. She was
            losing an argument to a five-year-old, and it was infuriating. She pursed her lips, trying to
            maintain</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">some semblance of authority, but then Nicky, in all his tiny defiance, mirrored her
            stance- hands on his hips, chin tilted slightly upward in perfect mimicry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And damn it if that didn't do something to Agatha's heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine, yes!" she huffed, throwing her hands up in defeat. "You win.
            She makes me smile."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's grin grew into a full-blown, heart-melting smile-the kind that left
            Agatha powerless to resist. Before she could even process what was happening, he stepped forward and</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wrapped his arms tightly around her, burying his face against her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The suddenness of his hug made her stumble back a step, but Agatha quickly steadied
            herself, instinctively wrapping her arms around him. Her hand slipped into his messy dark hair, gently
            smoothing it as if it were second nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky tilted his head up, his chin resting against her stomach, his big blue eyes-
            her eyes-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">meeting hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I like it when you smile," he said softly, his voice so full of sincerity
            it left her breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her chest tighten, and before she knew it, she was smiling-how could she
            not? It was impossible to resist him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cupped his small face in her hands, her thumb gently brushing his cheek.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I do too," she whispered, her voice low and tender, as though sharing a
            secret just for him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in a way, she was. It felt like a secret-an unspoken truth she didn't often
            let herself admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Nicky, though, she'd let it show.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if anyone deserved to see her like this, it was him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hours later, Agatha and Nicky were seated at the dinner table, about to dig into the
            lasagna Sonya had made. Agatha was mid-scoop, about to place a steaming piece on Nicky's plate, when the
            unmistakable sound of the front door opening echoed down the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She froze, the serving spoon suspended in midair, her muscles going rigid.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It all seemed to happen in slow motion. Nicky's head snapped toward the sound,
            his wide</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">eyes lighting up. That smile-the one Agatha knew all too well, the one that meant
            trouble- spread across his face like wildfire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't you-" Agatha began, but before she could finish the sentence,
            Nicky shot out of his chair like a rocket, all untamed energy and purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky!" she growled, twisting in her seat as the lasagna scoop wobbled
            precariously in her hand. She could only watch as he darted down the hallway, his small footsteps
            echoing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the walls.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice followed him, sharp and warning, but utterly ineffective. He was already
            gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With an exasperated sigh, Agatha slammed the spoon onto his plate, the lasagna
            splattering messily across the table. She shot to her feet, heart beating wildly in her chest as she chased
            after him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, Rio!" Nicky's voice rang out from the hallway, cutting through her
            and freezing her mid- step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nearly tripped over her own feet, her heart skipping a beat as she came to a
            stop just shy of the hallway. She strained to listen, and after a brief pause, she heard it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, buddy."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's voice was soft, warmer than Agatha had ever heard it before. It held a tone
            that was... different, almost tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama said you're going to be staying with us for a little bit," Nicky
            said, his words innocent but with that childlike straightforwardness that always caught Agatha off
            guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a long pause after that. Then Agatha heard the faint rustle of movement-Rio
            hanging up her coat, the closet door opening and closing that sounded so loud in the silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is that okay with you?" Rio asked, her voice still carrying that gentle
            warmth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart ached at the question, the vulnerability in Rio's tone
            striking her unexpectedly. She could picture it-Rio looking down at Nicky's, waiting for his response
            with the kind of care and patience that felt almost out of place in her Rio's normally cocky
            demeanor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Leaning against the wall, Agatha closed her eyes for a brief second, swallowing the
            knot</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forming in her throat. This was already more than she'd expected-and it was only
            the first night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a deep breath, steadying herself before stepping into the hallway. As she
            rounded the corner, she found Nicky standing just a foot away from Rio, his head tilted back to look up at
            her. Rio had already hung up her coat and was crouched slightly as she met Nicky's gaze with a faint
            smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's okay with me," Nicky said after a moment, nodding solemnly like
            he was granting some kind of official approval. "But you should know Mama burns toast
            sometimes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned softly. "Nicky-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio glanced up at her then, her expression shifting into something teasing, her eyes
            sparkling with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good to know," she said, her tone light. "I'll make sure to keep
            an eye on her when she's near the toaster."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky giggled at that, clearly delighted, and Agatha could feel her irritation
            melting under the warmth of the moment. She rolled her eyes, crossing her arms as she leaned against the
            wall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He doesn't need encouragement, you know," she muttered, her voice
            half-hearted as a small smile tugged at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio straightened, her gaze flicking to Agatha with a look that was softer than she
            expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He's just telling me the important stuff," she replied. "It's
            good to know what I'm walking into."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky reached out then, grabbing Rio's hand like it was the most natural thing in
            the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come on," he said, tugging her gently toward the dining room. "Sonya
            made lasagna, and it's really good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let him lead her, casting a quick glance over her shoulder at Agatha, who
            lingered in the hallway, watching them go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Agatha just stood there, her arms uncrossing as she rubbed the back of
            her neck. The sight of Nicky holding Rio's hand, so trusting and comfortable, tugged at something deep
            inside her. It was a strange mix of relief and vulnerability-like a door she'd kept locked was quietly
            creaking open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shaking off the thought, she followed them into the dining room, her voice calm but
            firm. "Nicky, sit down properly this time. And Rio, don't let him con you into extra
            dessert."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised a brow, a playful smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I don't know. He seems like a pretty good negotiator."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed as she reclaimed her seat at the table, already regretting the
            inevitable chaos Rio seemed poised to encourage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have no idea," she muttered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, already seated, grinned at Rio and gestured to the chair directly across from
            him. Rio moved forward, taking the offered seat without hesitation. Agatha, settling back into her spot next
            to Nicky, glanced at Rio across the table. She fought the urge to fidget-or worse, to smile-because
            Rio's presence at the table with her and Nicky was unsettling in a way that wasn't entirely
            unpleasant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With forced composure, Agatha leaned forward and scooped a generous helping of
            lasagna onto Rio's plate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thanks," Rio said, her voice calm, but that infuriating smirk was back,
            lighting up her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, her glare doing nothing to erase the amusement
            playing on Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence at the table was broken by Nicky, who, mid-bite, looked up and
            declared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Today my friend Sam told me that birds have hollow bones. That's why they
            can fly so easily. They don't weigh a lot."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Agatha and Rio turned to him, their attention now on the small, sauce-smeared
            face smiling brightly as he continued to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's cool," Rio said, nodding as she took her first bite of
            lasagna.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before either of them could say more, the oven timer went off, its beep cutting
            through the moment. Agatha pushed her chair back and started to stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's the bread," she said, moving toward the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll get it," Rio said quickly, already rising and shooting her a look
            as if daring her to argue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They're already cooked!" Agatha called after her, exasperation
            creeping into her voice. "I can't ruin them!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Best not take any chances," Rio quipped over her shoulder, disappearing
            into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky giggled, his small shoulders shaking as he shoveled another forkful of lasagna
            into his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to him, her expression one of exaggerated betrayal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Et tu, Brutus?" she asked, placing a hand dramatically over her heart.
            Nicky paused mid-chew, his brow furrowing in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who's Brutus?" Agatha snorted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Never mind, kid. Finish your dinner."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced toward the kitchen, where Rio was pulling the bread from the oven and
            setting it carefully on the stove. Her movements were casual, fluid, as though she'd always belonged in
            this space. Agatha's eyes shifted, catching sight of the blue folder sitting on the countertop island
            that separated the kitchen from the living room-the one she'd left there to discuss with Rio later
            tonight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened. She hated the idea of using Nicky's presence as a buffer,
            but she wasn't above it. She'd already endured too many hard conversations today, and the thought of
            diving into another one-this one particularly fraught-made her stomach twist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There's a document from work I need you to look at on the countertop,"
            Agatha said,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forcing her voice into something she hoped sounded casual, even as her heart hammered
            in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio turned, one brow lifting slightly in curiosity, but she didn't say a word.
            She crossed the kitchen to the island, picked up the blue folder, and flipped it open with a practiced ease
            that sent a ripple of tension through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stayed in her seat, gripping her fork tightly, the edges of the metal biting
            into her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers. The room felt unnervingly quiet, the hum of the oven and the faint clink of
            cutlery the only sounds filling the space. Even Nicky, engrossed in his lasagna, seemed oblivious to the
            weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as Rio scanned the document, her eyes moving steadily over the page.
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">could practically feel the seconds stretching, each one tightening the knot in her
            chest. Then it happened-the exact moment Rio's gaze landed on Agatha's signature at the bottom of
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relationship Disclosure Form .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression shifted, subtle but unmistakable. She looked up then, meeting
            Agatha's eyes across the space that suddenly felt far too small.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stared at each other, the silence stretching taut between them, unspoken words
            and questions hanging heavy in the air.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a brief moment, Agatha forgot how to breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held Agatha's gaze for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then,
            without a word, she reached over, picked up the pen resting beside the folder, and signed the document with
            a quick, fluid motion. She closed the folder, placing it neatly back on the countertop before turning to
            retrieve the bread.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched as Rio rounded the kitchen island, her movements calm, almost too
            casual, as if she didn't just sign her name on a legal document declaring they were in a
            relationship.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you know owls can turn their heads all the way around, but they can't
            move their eyes?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio said, her tone light and conversational, as though she were merely continuing a
            casual chat from Nicky's earlier comment about birds.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky looked up at her with wide, amazed eyes. "No way, that's so
            cool!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled at him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, still clutching her fork, stared at Rio, blinking as she tried to reconcile
            the effortless ease in her tone with the gravity of what had just happened. Rio didn't even glance her
            way, her focus entirely on slicing the bread with calm, precise movements.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What else do you know about birds?" Nicky asked, his voice eager. Rio
            shrugged, her expression casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Quite a bit," she replied. "I watched a documentary on them last year
            that was really good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes went wide with excitement, and he turned to Agatha, practically
            bouncing in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama, can we watch the bird show after dinner?" he asked, his words
            tumbling out in a rush. "Then I can tell Sam all about it tomorrow!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked at him, still half-rooted in the emotional whirlwind of moments
            earlier, but Nicky's enthusiasm tugged ger back to the present. She sighed, finally setting her fork
            down, and gave him a small smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sure," she said, her voice softening. "We can watch it after
            dinner."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky beamed, his joy infectious, while Rio set the bread on the table with a faint
            smile of her own. She slid into her chair, casually grabbing a slice of bread and buttering it as if this
            dinner were any other mundane evening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's excitement bubbled over as he launched into another story, his words
            tumbling over each other in an energetic rush.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As his voice filled the room, both Agatha and Rio looked up at the same time, their
            gazes locking across the table. For a moment, everything else seemed to fade-the chaos of the day, the
            weight of earlier conversations-leaving only the quiet between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into a smirk, one that was both knowing and playful, and it
            sent a ripple through Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And God- it felt so right . Her, Nicky... and Rio.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia showing up at court...loved it. Also her "taking the liberty" to

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And James Hughes from Vanguard...showing up. Bum bum bum. (also I just realized that
            Agatha's ex-husband's name is James. So I am sorry for the confusion. Just caught that)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That whole scene in Rio's office had me melting into a puddle into the floor.
            Especially the "my love" and Agatha's little "Your welcome."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Made from scratch" was just *chefs kiss*</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sorry for the delay. I've just been dealing with a lot lately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was grumpy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slept like shit, tossing and turning in her king-sized bed. All night she'd
            wake up sprawled on one side, only to find herself on the other an hour later, tangled in the sheets. By the
            time the first few hours of this restless cycle had passed, she knew exactly what the issue was-and that
            realization made her mind just as restless as her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her body was searching for Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every time she shifted in her sleep, her subconscious seemed to reach out, and every
            time it came up empty-handed, it jolted her awake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But no matter how much she wanted to- God , how much she wanted to-Agatha
            couldn't bring herself to go to Rio's room. Every fiber of her being pulled her in that direction,
            but she stayed put, forcing herself to resist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were reasons, of course. Practical ones.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, while a great sleeper, had a habit of sneaking into her room on occasion, and
            she couldn't bear the thought of him waking up in the middle of the night and not finding her
            there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there was the other reason, the one that made her chest tighten every time
            she thought about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To actually do it-to slip into Rio's bed and wrap herself around her-that would
            be opening herself up too much. It wasn't just about sharing a bed. It was about admitting something
            deeper-something far more terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To need someone-to need Rio, like that? It felt like a vulnerability too great to
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was this what love was?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did people willingly subject themselves to this feeling?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And more importantly, why the fuck did they romanticize it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was nothing poetic or beautiful about this gnawing, restless ache. It felt like
            a betrayal of everything Agatha had built herself into-everything she prided herself on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now here she was...not being able to sleep without Rio? What was next?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was she going to lose her ability to fucking breathe without Rio?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The town car came to an abrupt stop, jolting Agatha out of her thoughts as she
            instinctively braced herself against the partition, narrowly avoiding a headfirst collision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"For fuck's sake," she muttered under her breath, her glare snapping to
            the barrier separating her from the driver.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Apologies, Ms. Harkness," Dan's voice crackled through the intercom,
            his tone calm but</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">edged with caution, as if he could feel the waves of irritation rolling off her.
            "Bike messenger cut us off."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed sharply, settling back into the plush leather seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," she muttered to herself, closing her eyes for a brief moment
            to gather her composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just before she closed her yes, out of the corner of them, she caught Rio sitting
            next to her, frowning slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd been giving Agatha that same look all morning-watchful, concerned, and just
            perceptive enough to be irritating. Rio had a way of sensing Agatha's mood the way most people sensed
            the weather, and nothing-not even the fucking delicious apple cinnamon pancakes Rio had made for
            breakfast-had managed to shift it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, on the other hand, had been a different story. He'd buzzed around the
            table like a tiny whirlwind, devouring his pancakes with questionable table manners and peppering Rio with
            nonstop chatter. Every moment between bites, he'd paused to confirm his "bird facts" from the
            documentary they'd watched last night, his little face lighting up every time Rio nodded in agreement or
            added another tidbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You going to tell me what's wrong?" Rio asked, her voice steady but
            probing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes, letting out a quiet sigh. She'd been expecting this
            moment, honestly. Waiting for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't a matter of if Rio would call her out but when.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, she was surprised Rio had lasted this long. She'd dealt with Agatha's
            sharp edges and cold shoulder for hours without pressing, without pushing, giving her space to stew in
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">own frustration. But Rio's patience had limits, and it seemed they'd finally
            run out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I slept like shit," Agatha sighed out, the honestly surprising her or
            maybe it was the exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Either way, the words couldn't be taken back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence from Rio was deafening, stretching long enough that Agatha almost
            regretted speaking at all. But then she heard the faint sound of shuffling, and a moment later, she felt the
            faintest slide of familiar fingers across her shoulder, trailing upward to her neck before burying
            themselves in the back of her hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's touch was firm yet soothing, her fingers kneading gently at the base of
            Agatha's skull, massaging the tension Agatha hadn't even realized she was holding there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled slowly, the tension in her shoulders easing as Rio's touch worked
            its way through her defenses. She hadn't even realized how much she needed this-needed her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd been grumpy all morning, avoiding Rio's touch like it was the plague,
            channeling all her frustration and shitty sleep into silent blame. It was petty, of course. She knew it. But
            she was not above pettiness, and most of the time, leaning into that pettiness felt a hell a lot easier than
            admitting what was really bothering her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, with Rio's fingers gently massaging the back of her head, it was hard to
            hold onto her stubbornness. Hard to hold onto anything, really, except the undeniable fact that somehow Rio
            always knew exactly what she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't sleep well either," murmured Rio, in that lower timber that
            had a new shiver moving down Agatha's spine. "I missed you last night."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jesus.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes snapped open, her gaze locking onto Rio. She was met with that
            soft</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression-just a little slice of vulnerability-that always managed to leave her
            breathless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even under Agatha's sharp gaze, Rio fingers didn't stop. They continued their
            gentle path along Agatha's scalp, as she met Agatha's eyes head-on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You did?" Agatha whispered, her voice smaller than she intended.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into a gentle smile, her eyes holding that steady, honest look
            that left no room for doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Rio said, her voice calm and confident, as if the admission cost her
            nothing. "I like being held by you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the raw simplicity of Rio's words. Her chest
            tightened, her throat suddenly dry as she struggled to form a response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers continued their slow, soothing path along Agatha's scalp,
            grounding her in a moment that felt far too intimate-too real. The tension Agatha had been holding onto all
            morning seemed to crack and splinter under the weight of Rio's words and touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I..." Agatha started, but the words faltered, catching in her
            throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was she supposed to say to that? To someone so unflinchingly honest, so open,
            when she felt like a storm barely contained behind walls she'd spent a lifetime building?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't push. She just kept her touch gentle and steady, waiting, her eyes
            never wavering from Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her voice finally finding its way back to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not exactly the best at... this." She gestured vaguely between
            them, her tone brittle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile softened even further, her fingers pausing for a brief moment before
            sliding to rest at the nape of Agatha's neck. Her thumb brushed gently against her skin, the touch
            impossibly tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio said, her voice steady and warm. It was a tone that seemed to
            have the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">exacting ability to unravel something deep inside Agatha. "There's no right
            way to do this. I think we're just figuring it out as we go."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes held Agatha's for a moment longer before her smile transformed into that
            infuriating smirk-the one that always signaled trouble.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach sank preemptively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And," Rio added, her tone teasing but sharp enough to land its mark,
            "if you want to save yourself some trouble in the future, you could just tell me what's wrong
            instead of being a crab ass all morning."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's glare was immediate and sharp, her lips pressing into a tight
            line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Crab ass?" Agatha repeated, her tone teetering on the edge between genuine
            offense and mock indignation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only widened, her confidence palpable as the hand resting on the back
            of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's neck tightened slightly, just enough to ground her, to make her feel
            held in more ways than one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, I stand by it," Rio said, her voice low but undeniably smug.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a deep exhale, the kind that seemed to come from somewhere deep in her
            chest, releasing a fraction of the tension she'd been carrying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Someone's feeling brave today," she muttered, giving Rio a pointed
            look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk only widened, her confidence radiating in that way that
            simultaneously irritated and fascinated Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," Rio said, her voice laced with teasing, "I figured why not
            push a little more since, you know... we're in a relationship now ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line at that, her expression hardening
            slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd been wondering when Rio would bring that up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They hadn't really talked about it last night. What signing that document
            meant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After dinner, true to her word, they'd watched the bird documentary-a
            mind-numbingly dull experience for Agatha, but Nicky had loved every second of it. Apparently, even the
            second viewing was enough to hold Rio's attention, though Agatha suspected she was just humoring
            Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing remotely entertaining about the whole ordeal had been Nicky peppering
            Rio with question after question, each one more specific than the last. And somehow, Rio had</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">answered every single one without missing a beat, as if she had an endless reservoir
            of bird facts tucked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that came Nicky's bedtime routine, which was always more challenging on his
            first night back. It took longer than usual, his energy winding down in uneven bursts, and by the time he
            was finally tucked in and asleep, Agatha was exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she returned to the living room, Rio was gone, having already retreated to her
            room. Agatha didn't know how to feel about that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was she disappointed?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or was she relieved?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe a little of both.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now here they were, the unspoken from last night finally being spoken, as
            Rio's words hung in the air like a dare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That was for protection-for the firm," Agatha said, the words leaving her
            lips sharper than she intended, though she knew how weak the argument sounded even as she said it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Rio saw right through it. She always did.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand slipped from the back of Agatha's neck as she leaned back slightly,
            fixing her with a look. It wasn't angry or mocking-it was worse. It was piercing and patient, the kind
            of</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">look that made Agatha want to squirm in her seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pursed her lips, irritation prickling under her skin as she felt the
            unraveling begin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you want me to say?" she huffed, throwing her hands up in
            exasperation. She knew she was being petulant, but she couldn't help it. Her palms felt clammy, and she
            rubbed them against her pants.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio arched a single brow, her silence speaking volumes, pressing against Agatha like
            a weight she couldn't shrug off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay!" Agatha snapped, throwing her hands up in frustration. "We
            are..." She started, but the words caught in her throat, refusing to cooperate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips parted, but nothing came out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio snorted softly, the sound warm and unguarded, a teasing smile tugging at the
            corners of her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are absolutely ridiculous," she said, her tone light but laced with
            affection and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">exasperation. Then, meeting Agatha's gaze head-on, she added with quiet
            certainty, " Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">... we are in a relationship."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simplicity of the statement made Agatha's breath hitch, her chest tightening
            as the weight of it settled over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There it was-laid out in black and white, No room for evasion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at Rio, her jaw tightening as her mind raced to push back against the
            simplicity of it. But the steadiness in Rio's gaze, the way her teasing smile softened into something
            more genuine pierced through Agatha, straight through her defenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," Agatha finally said, her voice quiet, almost reluctant, but there.
            Rio tilted her head, her teasing smile softening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay?" she echoed, her voice laced with a faint hint of amusement, like
            she couldn't help but savor this rare moment of vulnerability from Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes snapped back to hers, her expression sharp but lacking its usual
            edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, okay," she repeated, her voice louder this time. "We're in a
            relationship. There. Happy now?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile grew, slow and steady, and Agatha's heart lurched in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were in an actual relationship.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought hit her like a truck, the weight of it slamming into her all at once. She
            was in a relationship-with a woman. She was in love with a woman 16 years her junior. It should</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">make her skin crawl, shouldn't it? It should set off every alarm bell she had,
            make her recoil, reject this whole thing outright.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything about this should feel wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet... it didn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that, perhaps, was what terrified her most of all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank fucking God the car chose that moment to stop, jerking slightly as it came to a
            halt in front of the office. The timing felt like divine intervention, yanking Agatha back from the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">edge of the spiraling thoughts she wasn't ready to fully process.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand shot toward the door handle, desperate for escape, for fresh air, for
            anything to shake off the weight pressing down on her chest. But before she could pull it open, a hand
            landed gently on her arm, stopping her in her tracks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her pulse skipping as she turned her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's dark eyes locked onto hers, steady and intense, and before Agatha could
            even process the moment, Rio moved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reaching up, Rio grabbed the back of Agatha's neck, her fingers firm as she
            pulled her forward. And then Rio kissed her-searing, deliberate, and with enough heat to leave Agatha's
            thoughts scattered like leaves in a high wind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't tentative, wasn't soft, wasn't polite. It was everything Rio
            was-bold, sure, and unapologetically direct.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, her mind blanking under the sheer force of it. She
            gripped the door handle as if were the only thing anchoring her to reality.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio finally pulled back, her lips lingered for just a moment longer than
            necessary, she smiled-soft, knowing, infuriating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have a good day, my love, " Rio murmured against Agatha's lips, the
            words soft and intimate, yet so confident they left no room for misinterpretation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed in response, the sound more out of exasperation than anything else,
            though it did nothing to mask the way her heart fluttered in her chest, betraying her completely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she muttered, pulling back just enough to meet her gaze, her own
            lips tingling from the kiss. Her tone was sharp, but the faint pink dusting her cheeks gave her away.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk returned, playful yet laced with something deeper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go on," she teased, her hand lingering at the back of Agatha's neck
            for a moment longer before releasing her. "You've got an empire to run."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes, giving Rio her best glare as she adjusted her jacket and
            reached for the door handle again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're lucky I like you," she grumbled under her breath, though the
            words carried no real heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You love me," Rio shot back, her voice light and teasing as she leaned
            forward, starting to crawl after her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha was quicker. She stepped out of the car with practiced grace, shutting the
            door firmly behind her-right in Rio's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The faintest of smiles tugged at Agatha's lips as she adjusted her bag, the
            lingering heat of the kiss still buzzing faintly beneath her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, her mood had significantly improved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mood carried her through most of the day. She finalized key elements of
            her trial strategy for the Vanguard case, set to begin on Wednesday. And then she held two client
            conferences, and a minor client emergency cropped up-a contract mishap that could've spiraled into
            something worse if she didn't handle it personally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as she ran out of things to do, that nagging that she was putting something off
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">curling at her neck. She could avoid it, like she had been all day-but then she would
            have to deal with Lilia's knowing glances that somehow found her multiple times today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which is why Agatha, against her better judgment, bit the bullet and now found
            herself standing outside one particular office she avoided like the plague. The godforsaken blue folder was
            clutched in her hands, her grip so tight the edges were beginning to crumple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Closing her eyes, she let out a long, exasperated sigh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, she cursed herself for allowing this situation to spiral into what it had
            become. Then, she cursed Lilia for being the catalyst that had forced her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And lastly, and most of all, she cursed Rio-because, obviously, this was all
            Rio's fault.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha steeled herself, grabbing the door handle and pushing it open with more force
            than necessary. She stepped inside the HR office, which consisted of just one person-one person who, despite
            her size and age, somehow managed to strike fear into every partner, associate, and intern alike.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, what a surprise," came the high-pitched unmistakable voice from
            behind the desk, warm and welcoming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pasted on a fake smile, one that didn't even come close to reaching her
            eyes, and looked up at the woman. Nearly in her 70s now, she was the only person in the world who made
            Agatha feel like she was back in the principal's office, awaiting a lecture.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her blonde, shoulder-length hair was always tastefully styled, her posture was
            perfect, and her kind smile seemed almost too genuine to be real. The woman practically radiated a goodness
            that immediately set Agatha on edge, like she was walking into some kind of moral interrogation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, Mrs. Hart," Agatha said, her voice higher pitched and completely fake
            to mask her discomfort.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart gave her a knowing look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, we've worked together for nearly 20 years. How many times have I
            asked you to call me Sharon?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out an awkward laugh, the sound more forced than genuine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, thank you.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Old habits die hard," she deflected, brushing off the request with a wave
            of her hand as she stepped forward and placed the blue folder on the desk, throwing caution to the wind.
            "I need to file this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, she turned on her heel, fully prepared to make her escape.
            "Wait," Mrs. Hart called out, her tone calm but commanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze mid-step, her shoulders tensing as she closed her eyes for a
            moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course it wouldn't be that easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sighing internally, Agatha turned on her heel, schooling her expression into a mask
            of neutrality as she faced Mrs. Hart again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart glanced down at the folder on her desk, her finger tapping against it with
            a hesitant rhythm, as if wary of what might be inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are we being sued by one of the first years again?" she asked, giving
            Agatha a pointed look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha bristled, crossing her arms tightly over her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she said curtly. "And even if they tried, they wouldn't have
            a leg to stand on. Their contract is ironclad."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart raised a brow, unimpressed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you cause bodily harm to any of our employees?" Agatha scoffed,
            rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That was one time, and my coffee slipped, " she hissed defensively. Mrs.
            Hart didn't miss a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you hold another company-wide meeting to present a PowerPoint ranking all
            the associates from 'safe' to 'most likely to get fired'?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glared, her lips thinning as she leaned forward slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she said with exaggerated calm, tapping her chin in mock
            contemplation. "But now that you mention it, I do think we're due for another one of
            those."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart opened her mouth to throw out another one of Agatha's
            "questionable decisions" but Agatha stepped forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, no, and no," said Agatha losing her patience. "Just open
            it," she gestured to the folder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart gave her a knowing look, then grabbed the folder and leaned back in her
            chair, opening it with the deliberate care of someone who had seen it all but still expected a
            surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her breath, watching as Mrs. Hart scanned the document.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh!" Mrs. Hart said, a note of surprise in her voice. She flicked her gaze
            up to Agatha, her smile widening. "You must be so proud! I always knew that son of yours was a smart
            one."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, her brow furrowing in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was this woman going senile?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What-" Agatha started, but Mrs. Hart cut her off by lifting the paper and
            holding it up for her to see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look at all those gold stars!" Mrs. Hart exclaimed, delighted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes dropped to the paper, her confusion turning to horror as she took
            in the childish chore chart. Written at the top in big, blocky letters were the words "I Listened
            Today,"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">followed by an obscene number of gold stars haphazardly stuck across the page.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It only took a second for Agatha to piece it together, and when she did, a deep flush
            crept up her neck and spread across her face, hot and searing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands curled into fists at her sides as she bit down the stream of
            curses bubbling to the surface. She could already picture Rio's smug expression, that infuriating smirk
            as she'd slipped the paper into the folder, knowing full well it what it meant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's teeth clenched, her jaw tight with fury. She was going to kill
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved with a speed that was anything but slow, practically ripping the paper
            from Mrs. Hart's hands in a motion so abrupt it bordered on embarrassing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart startled at the ferocity of it, her expression a mix of surprise and mild
            amusement. "Yes," Agatha hissed, catching herself mid-snap and forcing her tone into something
            more</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">controlled. "I am very proud."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She clutched the paper covered in gold stars in one hand, crumpling it slightly,
            while her eyes darted to the open folder now sitting on the desk. There it was-the Relationship Disclosure
            Form, practically flashing up at her. Mrs. Hart's gaze followed hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The older woman's eyes went wide as she took in the contents of the
            folder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, watching in horror as Mrs. Hart's eyes scanned the paperwork, her
            expression shifting from shock to something far more measured. Then, slowly, Mrs. Hart's gaze moved back
            up to Agatha, a curious arch of her brow adding to the growing tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're disclosing a relationship with..." Mrs. Hart paused, glancing
            down at the form again for confirmation, her voice tinged with incredulity. "Rio Vidal. A first-year
            associate?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her mind racing for a response, but in the end, she decided- fuck
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's what it says," she replied coolly, flicking her hand toward the
            document as if it were nothing more than a minor inconvenience, and not something capable of giving Agatha a
            panic attack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart's gaze didn't waver.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Isn't Rio Vidal's file the one your assistant returned to me last month
            with permanent marker scribbled all over it? Her company picture had a mustache and a beard"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought hard against the smirk tugging at the corners of her lips, determined
            to keep her expression impassive. She remembered the moment vividly-letting Nicky draw the file purely out
            of spite toward Rio at the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Mrs. Hart didn't need to know that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll speak to Billy about his negligence with personnel files later,"
            Agatha said smoothly, deflecting with practiced ease. "Now, are we done here?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart gave her a long, skeptical look, the kind that could see through just about
            anything. With a resigned sigh, she closed the folder, tapping it lightly against the desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Have you removed her from your direct report?" she asked, her tone all
            business now. "Yes," Agatha answered, her voice sharp and to the point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart nodded, closing the folder with a soft thump and setting it neatly on her
            desk. "Good," she said briskly. "Then we're done-for now."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took that as her cue to leave, turning on her heel with practiced precision
            and heading for the door. Her pulse was still pounding, and all she wanted was to escape this office.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Mrs. Hart called out just as her hand reached the door handle.
            Agatha paused, stiffening slightly before turning back to face her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Hart's expression had softened, and for a moment, Agatha saw something
            almost maternal in her warm smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Congratulations," Mrs. Hart said gently. "I hope it works out for
            you, dear."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit Agatha like a quiet wave, disarming her in a way she hadn't
            expected. She opened her mouth to respond, but nothing came out, so she settled for a small, tight
            nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without another word, she turned back to the door, stepping out into the hallway.
            Her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">footsteps were quick, her chest tight, but Mrs. Hart's parting words lingered,
            trailing after her like a faint echo she couldn't quite shake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't until Agatha was halfway to her office that she realized she was still
            clutching the piece of paper covered in gold stars.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She came to an abrupt stop in the middle of the hallway, glancing down at it. The
            sheer number of gold stars on it, and knowing Rio everyone was purposeful, marking the exact moment Agatha
            did listen, made her jaw tighten. Whatever lingering warmth she'd felt from Mrs. Hart's unexpected
            blessing evaporated in an instant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her name simmered in Agatha's mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a second thought, she spun on her heel and marched toward Rio's office
            with purpose. Judging by the way the associates practically leapt out of her path-side-stepping into
            cubicles and flattening themselves against the walls-her expression was likely a perfect reflection of the
            storm brewing inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stormed into Rio's office, ready to unleash the anger building in her
            chest, only to find it empty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes darted around the small space as if Rio might somehow be hiding in one of
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">corners. When that proved fruitless, she turned sharply on her heel, her movements
            taut with irritation, before reaching into her pocket and fishing out her phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thumb tapped the screen with precision, dialing Rio's number as she paced the
            office. She shut the door firmly behind her, the sound reverberating through the small space as she raised
            the phone to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It rang once. Twice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio picked up on the third ring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hello, my love," Rio said, her voice low and raspy, that soft endearment
            curling around the words like it belonged there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze for a moment, her mind blanking at the sound of those two simple words.
            She hated it-hated how it hit her, unbalancing her just enough to make her forget why she was even mad in
            the first place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip on the phone tightened as she forced herself to snap out of the
            haze Rio's voice always seemed to put her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where are you?" she demanded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a pause on the other end, followed by the faint shuffling of movement and
            the low hum of traffic in the background.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm with Mrs. Kale," Rio said, her voice calm as ever. "She's
            taking me to a deposition across town."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze at that, her heart giving a sudden, unwelcome lurch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you have security?" she asked, her irritation dissolving into something
            else entirely-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">concern .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Rio replied, her tone steady and reassuring. "Two very large
            bodyguards trailing us like shadows."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Agatha muttered, relief flooding through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, there was silence as she paused, catching her breath. Then she
            remembered</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">exactly why she'd called.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I found your little sticker chart," she growled, her voice low and
            cutting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a beat of silence on the other end, just long enough to let Agatha know Rio
            was composing herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you now?" Rio remarked, her voice deceptively calm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha could hear it-the faint edge of amusement she was trying-and failing, to
            suppress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Agatha hissed, her grip tightening on the crumpled paper. The heat
            of her anger turned into something else entirely, a slow burn coursing through her, far more
            dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When you get home," Agatha growled, her voice dropping into a husky,
            dangerous tone, "your ass is mine."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't miss a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That sounds like fun," she responded, her professional voice slipping with
            a playful heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, ready to deliver a biting retort, but the
            unmistakable sound of Jen's voice cut through the line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who are you talking to?" Jen asked, her tone dripping with suspicion.
            There was a brief pause before she added, sharper this time, " Gross. Is that Agatha? Tell her no
            personal calls on company time!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's anger, already simmering, flared back to full force, snapping like a
            whip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell Jen she can fuck off," she snapped, her voice cutting through the
            phone with precision. The line went silent for a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I will not be saying that to my boss," Rio replied, her tone dry but
            amused, though Agatha could hear the faint shuffling of movement in the background. "Look, we just got
            to the building. I have to go."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could respond, Rio's voice softened, a warmth threading through her
            words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Te veo, " Rio murmured, her voice carrying a gentleness that caught
            Agatha completely off guard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The line clicked off suddenly, leaving Agatha staring at her phone, her breath caught
            somewhere between a huff of frustration and something deeper she refused to name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't until a moment later, as she stood there alone in Rio's office, the
            ridiculous gold- star-covered paper still crumpled in her hand, that the realization struck her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had said, "when you get home."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not her home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not Agatha's home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As in Rio's home, too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn't even thought about it-it had slipped out so naturally, so
            unconsciously, that it hit her like a lightning bolt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't know how long she stood there, replaying those words in her head,
            her thoughts circling relentlessly. The realization had planted itself firmly in her chest, and she
            couldn't shake it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her hand, jolting her back to the present. She
            glanced down at the screen, letting out a huff as she rolled her eyes. Without hesitation, she
            answered,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">already heading for the door to leave Rio's office. "Jen, I am not in the
            mood-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Jen said her name stopped Agatha dead in her tracks. There was something in
            her tone-something urgent, something wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she demanded, her voice sharp, but it carried the faintest
            tremor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence followed, stretching far too long, and then Agatha heard it-the unmistakable
            sound of sirens wailing in the background.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-Agatha," Jen's voice was tight, panicked, unlike anything Agatha
            had ever heard from her. "You need to get to Mount Sinai. Now. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sirens grew louder, piercing through the static of Agatha's mind.
            "It's Rio."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha-she forgot how to breathe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chooo...chooo...all aboard the angst train. Hopefully this one will be a round trip
            back?? I have been sitting on Mrs. Hart being HR since like chapter 5 and I have been</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">WAITING for this moment. Freaking loved writing her into the story. I could like
            picture her voice and smile during her exchange with Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, as a writer this just was so good to me. For Agatha to literally to question
            love,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and think "Was she going to lose her ability to fucking breathe without
            Rio?" like it was impossible to even think of, that Rio did have that power over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only for the last line to be: And Agatha-she forgot how to breathe. Because she might
            actually be without Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is shit like that makes me fall in love with writing.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay, buckle up. Here we go....</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha burst through the emergency room doors as manic as she felt, her heels
            pounding</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against the floor as she moved with a singular focus. Her chest was tight, as her
            breath came out in short, ragged bursts, her eyes darting around the crowded room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ignoring the line of people waiting at the front desk, she pushed past them with zero
            fucks given, slamming her palms onto the desk with enough force to make the nearby pens rattle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where is Rio Vidal?" she demanded, her voice sharp, carrying the full
            weight of her panic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The emergency nurse behind the desk-clearly a veteran at dealing with chaotic and
            frenzied people-didn't so much as blink. She just looked up at Agatha with a raised brow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ma'am, you'll need to get to the back of the line," she said
            exasperated. Agatha's rage boiled over instantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you don't tell me where she is right now, " she hissed, her voice
            dropping dangerously low, "I will sue this fucking hospital until I own it-and when I do, you'll be
            the first person I fire!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nurse's brow twitched, the only sign she'd been affected, but her calm
            demeanor held. "Ma'am," she said, her tone firm, "I need you to take a breath
            and-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't tell me to breathe, " Agatha snapped as she leaned closer, her
            entire body practically vibrating. "Rio Vidal. Where . Is . She ?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before the nurse could respond, another voice cut through the air.
            "Agatha!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha whipped around, her heart seizing in her chest as she locked eyes with
            Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was standing about ten feet away, her usual polished appearance still intact but
            the tan coat she was wearing told a completely different story.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even from this distance, Agatha could see it, the dark, unmistakable splatters of
            blood staining the fabric.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, a sharp gasp sticking in her throat-and for a moment, her
            entire world tilted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jen," Agatha choked out, her voice barely audible. She moved to step
            forward, but her knees buckled, her legs giving out beneath her as the weight of everything crashed down all
            at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ground rushed toward her, fast and unforgiving-but before she could hit it, arms
            caught her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Whoa, Agatha," Jen's voice was sharp but steady, her grip firm as she
            pulled Agatha upright. "I've got you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clung to her as the world spun and her chest heaved. Her eyes locked on the
            bloodstains on Jen's coat, so vivid and stark against the light fabric, and her stomach twisted
            violently. Her hands tightened on Jen's arms, her knuckles turning white as she fought to pull herself
            together but the panic clawing at her chest wouldn't let go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Blood," Agatha managed to gasp out, her gaze still locked on the stains as
            her voice trembled. "Is that... is that Rio's?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen hesitated, the pause just long enough for Agatha to catch it-and fuck it felt
            like someone punched her in the chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Jen finally admitted softly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a ragged breath, her chest heaving as tears blurred her vision. One
            hand flew to her chest, clutching at her heart feeling like it was breaking- shattering into pieces inside
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jen..." she cried out, the sound raw and pleading. Her knees buckled
            again, like her body was folding at the sheer weight of everything dragging her down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shit," Jen cursed under her breath, moving quickly to catch her. She
            gripped Agatha firmly around the middle, before steering her backward until she eased her into a
            chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as Agatha sat down, her head dipped forward, trembling hands covering her
            face as though she could block out the image burned into her mind. The sight of Rio's blood was still
            vivid, sharp, and utterly unbearable . Her body trembled as adrenaline and fear coursed through her
            veins.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Jen said softly but insistent. She crouched in front of her,
            reaching out to gently peel back Agatha's hands from her face, before firmly grabbing Agatha's face
            and tilting it upward so their eyes met.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look at me," Jen urged, her grip anchoring Agatha for a moment. "Rio
            is alive. Do you hear me? She's alive. The doctors are patching her up right now."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's tear-filled eyes locked onto Jen's. Her breathing was still ragged,
            but the words</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">began to cut through the fog.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one word reverberated in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's alive," Agatha repeated in a shaky whisper, as though saying it
            aloud would make it real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, honey," Jen said, her voice impossibly gentle as she held
            Agatha's face, making sure their eyes stayed locked. "She's alive."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's words broke something loose inside Agatha and a sob tore free from her
            chest, as her shoulders shook violently. The tension she'd been holding onto for dear life unleashed all
            at once, leaving her in an uncontrollable free fall as her emotions tore out of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen moved in closer wrapping her arms around Agatha and holding her tightly as the
            sobs tore through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Breathe, Agatha," she murmured softly, her voice calm and steady.
            "It's okay. Let it out." Agatha's sobs came in harsh, choking gasps as she struggled to
            pull herself together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen held her steady throughout every cry, murmuring quiet reassurances.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, with a shuddering breath, Agatha pulled back, her hands quickly moving to
            wipe at her tear-streaked face. Her face felt raw, and hot. The embarrassment of breaking down in front of
            Jen clawed at her, making her skin prickle uncomfortably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as the weight of her fear began to lift, it left something else in its
            place-anger. A burning, unrelenting fury.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest heaved as she fixed Jen with a sharp glance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What the fuck happened?" she demanded, her words dripping with rage, her
            hands still trembling in her lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen hesitated for a fraction of a second, her jaw tightening before she quickly
            composed herself, straightening to a stand as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Someone tried to mug me," she said, disbelief lacing her words. "One
            second, we were</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">walking into VitaCore headquarters, and the next, this random guy comes out of
            nowhere and tries to grab my Prada bag. Rio stepped in, there was a scuffle, and then..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice faltered as her eyes flicking away for a moment as if she didn't want
            to say the words, and then back to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then there was a gunshot."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the air leave her lungs as the world tilting on its axis.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait," she whispered, her voice trembling as she gripped the arm of the
            chair with white- knuckled intensity. Her vision swam for a moment, and she forced herself to focus on
            Jen's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She was shot?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words came out in a breathless-fragile whisper, as if saying them aloud would
            make them more real.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen nodded, jaw clenching as her own hands trembled slightly before she crossed her
            arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She was shot the shoulder," she added quickly, her voice urgent as she
            rushed to explain. "But it just grazed her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely heard her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words she was shot echoing in her mind, growing louder with each repetition. Her
            chest heaved as she tried to breathe, the weight of the revelation pressing down on her chest like a fucking
            boulder, leaving her feeling somehow both hollow and filled with rage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-" Agatha started, her voice catching as the words tangled in her throat.
            Nothing coherent came out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took a moment, but when she finally found her voice, fury surged forward, filling
            the void.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where in the hell was security?!" she raged, her voice cutting through the
            air like a whip. "How in the hell did this even happen?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen flinched slightly at the outburst, her composure faltering for a fraction of a
            second before she steadied herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They were there, Agatha," Jen said, her voice calm but heavy with
            exhaustion. "It happened so fast. One second, it was just some guy grabbing my bag, and the next...
            everything spiraled."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitated, her eyes clouding like she was replaying the memory in her
            mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They're the only reason Rio and I are still alive," she continued, her
            voice softening. "They tackled the mugger just as he was aiming at Rio. They stopped him-but not before
            the gun went off..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, the words hitting her like a physical blow. Her breath caught as her
            body going rigid as the implications sank in. And with it, the rage flared hotter-searing through her
            veins.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And the shooter?" Agatha asked, her voice low and cold.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's expression tightened and a grimace flickering across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He got away," she admitted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He got away ?" Agatha spat, the words slicing through the air.
            "You're telling me the man who shot Rio is out there right now?!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen winced but tried to explain. "Agatha, it happened so fast-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't care how fast it happened!" Agatha snapped, her voice rising.
            "How the hell does someone walk away from this?!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen held her ground as she shot Agatha a look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Security prioritized getting us to saftey, Agatha. It was chaos. By the time
            they secured Rio and me, he was gone."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers twisted in her lap. The thought of the shooter still at
            large-walking free-it was like a knife twisting in her gut. Her breath came out in heavy puffs as she tried
            to focus on anything other than the blinding rage threatening to take over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I need to see her!" Agatha demanded, her voice trembling under the weight
            of her barely contained emotions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as her words hung in the air, her anger suddenly ebbed, giving way to something
            far more deeper. Desperation crept into her tone, cracking it at the edges, and her eyes filled with fresh
            tears as she looked at Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" I need to see her ," she repeated, the plea in her voice so quiet- so
            vulnerable , it startled even herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's eyes widened at that before softening as she looked at Agatha, then really
            looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay-okay," Jen murmured after a moment, her voice impossibly gentle. She
            reached out briefly and her hand squeezed Agatha's arm. "I'll see if I can find a doctor.
            I'll be right back."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned toward the front desk, her stride carrying her through the bustling chaos
            of the emergency room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched her go, the panic still clawing at her chest as she waited-every
            second feeling like an eternity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees and burying her face into her
            hands. She took a deep, shaky breath, as the sharp scent of antiseptic flooded her senses. Her stomach
            twisted in revulsion, a visceral response she couldn't suppress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She fucking hated hospitals.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind reeled back to the year she had spent in one-by Nicky's side, watching
            him</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">endure round after round of chemo, the machines beeping relentlessly around him, the
            sterile walls a constant reminder of how close she'd come to losing him. There had been a surgery too,
            the hours stretching endlessly as she sat praying to a God she didn't even believed in for him to pull
            through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He'd come so close to dying... so fucking close . And now, here she was
            again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another person she loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath hitched at the thought as her fingers digging into her temples as if she
            could block out the overwhelming weight moving from her brain to her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why does the world keep trying to take away the people she loves?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question hit her like a hammer-heavy-over and over again. And then, as if
            summoned by her pain, another voice crept in-one that had haunted her since she was a child.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did it ever occur to you that perhaps God is punishing you?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Evanora's cruel words echoed in her mind, sharp and venomous, worming their way
            between her thoughts. Agatha shook her head violently, as if she could physically shake them loose, but they
            clung to her insides like a fucking leech.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled at the roots of her hair, her teeth gritted as though the pressure
            might somehow force her out of the nightmare inside her head. Her breaths were shallow, and her chest
            tightened as her mind spiraled further into a place she didn't want to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, there was movement beside her-two people sitting down, one on either side.
            Then, warm hands rested gently on her back, steady and grounding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head shot up, startled, her wide eyes darting to her right. Lilia.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze shifted to her left. Alice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't say a word, her throat too tight, her mind too frayed. Instead, she
            brought her gaze forward, staring blankly ahead. The tension in her body began to ease-just a fraction, as
            she let their hands rest on her back, their presence surprising but so goddamn needed .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She inhaled deeply, the steady weight of their touch anchoring her, keeping her from
            spiraling further as the minutes ticked by. The chaos of the hospital around her dulled, and for the
            first</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">time since she'd walked through those doors, Agatha felt like she could
            breathe-even if just barely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, movement in the distance caught her attention. Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And walking beside her was a female doctor in a white coat, her expressions serious.
            They were heading directly for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's body reacted before her mind fully registered what was happening. She
            shot out of her seat, her knees trembling as she stood as her heart pounded wildly in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is she-" Agatha started, her voice catching before she could
            finish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen raised a hand, a small gesture that managed to calm her just enough to stay
            rooted in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor stopped in front of her, looking between Agatha and the others.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness?" the doctor asked, her tone calm but direct, meeting
            Agatha's sharp, unblinking gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she said quickly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor exhaled softly, nodding once before speaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Vidal is a little banged up," she began, their words steady but kind,
            "but she's fine." Agatha's breath hitched, her knees nearly giving out as a wave of relief
            crashed over her. The doctor offered a small, reassuring smile before continuing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's asking to see you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those words- she's asking to see you -sent a different kind of tremor through
            Agatha. She nodded quickly, her voice catching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Take me to her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor nodded and gestured for Agatha to follow, stepping aside to clear the
            way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha moved forward instinctively, but then paused, her eyes darting back to Jen,
            Alice, and Lilia. She hesitated as her insides curled, making her feel like she needed to say something-
            anything-to acknowledge their support.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go," Lilia said gently, nodding toward her with a small encouraging smile.
            "We'll be here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a shaky breath, the gratitude she felt too heavy for words, and nodded
            back to them. Without another word, she turned and followed the doctor, her steps unsteady as they</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">entered the labyrinthine of halls of the ER.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sharp scent of antiseptic was stronger here, mingling with the faint tang of
            something metallic that turned Agatha's stomach. The corridors were bustling with people-nurses</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rushing between stations, patients groaning in pain, and the nightmare wouldn't
            be complete of course without the sharp, distant cry of a child echoing through the halls.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's skin prickled at the sound, her shoulders tensing. The noise pulling at
            painful memories she didn't want to resurface. She forced herself to focus on the doctor's back, the
            white coat guiding her through the chaos like a lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This way," the doctor said over her shoulder, leading her around another
            corner. The hum of activity dimmed slightly and the hall grew quieter, more secluded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's pulse quickened and the anticipation built with every step.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, the doctor stopped in front of a closed door and turned to her, offering a
            small, reassuring nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's inside," she said softly, stepping aside to give her a path to
            enter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand hovered over the door handle for a moment, her breath hitching as
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">emotions swirled-relief, fear, and the overwhelming need to see Rio for herself. With
            a steadying breath, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment she stepped inside, she was met with the sharp, clipped sound of Rio's
            voice, practically vibrating with frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I told you, I'm not letting another person touch me until I see Agatha
            Harkness!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's pacing was relentless, her steps agitated as she moved back and forth
            across the small recovery room. She didn't even glance at the door, her words clearly aimed at the empty
            air</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-or the medical staff she'd presumably entered her room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught as her eyes took in the sight before her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was still in her black dress pants, but now paired with a plain white T-shirt.
            Her hair, was pulled back into a messy ponytail. The collar of the shirt was stained with dried
            blood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio turned to pace the other way, Agatha's gaze locked onto the torn
            shoulder of her white shirt, the fabric roughly cut away to accommodate the thick white bandage
            wrapped</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">around her upper arm. The sight sent a sharp pang through Agatha's chest, but it
            was nothing compared to the jolt of emotion that hit when her eyes traveled up to Rio's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A jagged cut through Rio's brow had been stitched shut with and the angry
            bruising around it was already darkening into deep purples and blues. The contrast against her pale skin
            made the injury look even worse, and Agatha's stomach twisted painfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn't matter that Rio was upright, pacing, or even shouting-because seeing
            Rio like this</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-bruised, cut, stitched back together, made Agatha's breath hitch, the full
            weight of</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything crashing down on her all over again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sharp hitch of Agatha's breath must have been louder than she realized,
            because Rio froze mid-step, her head snapping toward the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze landed on Agatha, wide at first, her body tensing as if bracing for
            something. But then, in a single heartbeat, the tension melted from her frame, her shoulders sagging
            slightly as relief flooded her features.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio said softly, the frustration and anger that had laced her
            earlier tone now replaced with something achingly tender. She didn't move right away, as if the sight of
            Agatha in the doorway had momentarily rooted her in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't speak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes were locked on Rio, scanning every bruise, every bandage, every speck of
            blood dried on her skin and shirt-and her chest tightened so painfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither of them spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They just stared at each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, as if pulled by an invisible thread, they both moved at the same time. Agatha
            stepped forward, reaching up as her fingers threaded into Rio's messy hair as she gripped the back of
            her head and pulled her forward. Her arms wrapped tightly around Rio's frame, holding her as if letting
            go wasn't an option.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio followed instinctively, her own arms circling Agatha's waist, her fingers
            curling into the fabric of Agatha's coat with a desperate sort of grip. She buried her face into the
            curve of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's neck, and Agatha felt the warm rush of Rio's breath against her skin
            as she inhaled deeply, like she needed Agatha as much as Agatha needed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that mattered was that Rio was here, alive- breathing , and most importantly,
            back in her arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes, her own breath hitching as she leaned into her even further.
            Her fingers moved gently, raking through Rio's hair, her touch slow as if trying to calm them
            both.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She buried her face in Rio's hair, the faint scent of forest mingling with the
            sterile, metallic tang of the hospital, and inhaled deeply. As if the act of breathing her in could stitch
            back together the parts of herself that had shattered at the thought of losing her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers curled tighter into Agatha's coat, a silent plea for her to
            stay close. Agatha's hand shifted slightly, her fingertips tracing the base of Rio's neck, her touch
            light but constant as she offered reassurance without words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her for a few more moments, her fingers still raking gently through
            Rio's hair, before she murmured softly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me see your face."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio exhaled a shaky breath against Agatha's neck, the warmth of it lingering on
            her skin, but she pulled back, her movements slow and deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hands moved instinctively, rising to cup Rio's face. Her palms
            rested against her cheeks as her thumbs brushing lightly over the curve of Rio's cheekbones. She tilted
            Rio's head slightly with a mix of tenderness and pain etched into her expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze lingered on the stitched cut above Rio's brow, the dark
            bruising spreading out like a painful bloom around it. Her jaw tightened, muscles flexing as she fought
            against the wave of emotions threatening to consume her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached up slowly, her fingers trembling slightly as they traced the edge of the
            bruise. Her touch was light, barely there, as she followed the jagged line of the stitches running through
            Rio's brow and extending up her forehead at least an inch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight of it sent a fresh ache through Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"God damn it, Rio," she murmured, her voice trembling, the words carrying
            equal parts frustration and aching concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a soft breath, warm against Agatha's skin, and a faint smirk tugged
            at the corner of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know," she murmured, her voice low and teasing. "I'm turning
            into one giant lesbian cliché."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her head slightly, the smirk widening as a playful glint lit her tired
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My eyebrow hair probably won't grow back normal and people are definitely
            going to think I gave myself an eyebrow slit on purpose."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, her grip on Rio's face firming but still being
            careful. "Don't make jokes right now," she said, her voice tense, the words edged.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk faltered, fading entirely as she stared at Agatha. The teasing light
            in her eyes dimmed, replaced by something softer-more serious. She held Agatha's gaze for a long moment,
            no doubt, taking in every deepened line etched into Agatha's face since the moment she heard Rio was
            hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, she nodded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she murmured, her voice steady but subdued, the weight of the
            moment settling between them again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio reached up slowly, her hands gentle as they cupped Agatha's face. She leaned
            in, closing the small distance between them until their foreheads touched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, their exhales mingling in the small space between
            them. "Agatha," Rio murmured, her voice trembling in a way Agatha had never heard before.
            Agatha's heart clenched at the sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio closed her eyes, her fingers curling around the back of Agatha's neck,
            stroking the skin there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want to go home," she said, her voice breaking ever so slightly.
            "Please take me home."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, the lump in her throat threatening to choke her, and she
            nodded against Rio's forehead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay, my love," she whispered, her voice filled with a love that she
            couldn't contain-not anymore. "Let's go home."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha twisted the door handle and stepped into the familiar embrace of her home. The
            soft quiet of the house washed over her-such a stark contrast to the chaos of the hospital. She turned,
            holding the door open for Rio, who walked slowly behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had taken hours to get discharged, the entire ordeal a marathon of paperwork and
            negotiation. The combined influence of all four partners had been the only thing that made it happen.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia had pulled strings with the hospital's leadership.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice, wielding her former experience as a prosecuting attorney, had managed to delay
            the police interview until tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen, ever the coordinator, had handled the rest with precision. And Agatha?</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had done something rare for her-she let them take over. She'd sat silently,
            letting them handle the logistics, trusting them to take care of everything she couldn't, but most
            importantly, trusting them to take care of Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, finally, they were home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The late hour draped the house in a heavy darkness and stillness. Nicky was already
            asleep, no doubt, disappointed that Agatha hadn't been home in time to tuck him in. Agatha had</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">resolved herself she'd find a way to explain everything to him tomorrow, to tell
            him about Rio's injuries without scaring him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't like lying to him-it wasn't how she parented-but the instinct to
            protect him far outweighed the weight of a little lie.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped aside, her eyes fixed on Rio as she shuffled into the house, her
            movements careful and slow. Once Rio was inside, Agatha quietly shut the door behind her as the soft click
            of the lock echoed in the stillness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They walked down the hallway together in silence, the weight of the day settling into
            the quiet between them. Agatha toed off her shoes with practiced ease, setting them neatly to the side. Rio
            hesitated for a moment before bending over to do the same, but Agatha's hand landed firmly on her
            shoulder, stopping her mid-motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave Rio a pointed look before crouching down to handle it herself.
            "Agatha," Rio sighed. "I can take off my own shoes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's narrowed eyes shot up at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have a concussion," she said, her voice low but firm-the tone leaving
            no room for argument.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio opened her mouth to respond, but the look Agatha gave her cut her off before a
            single word escaped. Instead, she sighed again, this time softer, and let her shoulders relax slightly, as
            Agatha took off one shoe, and then the other. Setting them aside right next to her heels before
            standing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reached forward, her hand slipping into Rio's, and gently guided her
            through the house. She felt the faint hesitation in Rio's steps as they passed the guest room door
            but</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't stop-she gave a light, insistent pull, leading her past it and
            toward her own room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?" Rio murmured, her tone questioning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't respond right away. She kept walking, pulling Rio into her bedroom
            and stopping by the edge of the bed. Without a word, she pressed a hand to Rio's shoulder, coaxing her
            to sit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sank down with a faint frown, watching Agatha as she turned and moved back to the
            door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha quietly shut it, the soft click sounding louder in the stillness. She rested
            her hand on the handle for a moment, her back to Rio before finally speaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're sleeping in here tonight," she said, her voice firm but low,
            still not turning around. Silence hung heavy behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What about Nicky?" Rio asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, finally turning to face her. Her eyes met Rio's before flickering
            up to the stitches on Rio's head, and her breath caught at the flood of emotions rising in her chest.
            Her voice wavered, but she didn't look away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she said softly, her words almost a plea, "I need you to stay
            in here tonight-with me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, they just looked at each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression softened with understanding before slowly, she nodded, her lips
            curving into a faint but reassuring smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she whispered, her voice gentle. Her eyes flickered toward the
            bathroom, and she hesitated before adding, "I'm going to go clean up first."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, unable to trust her voice to respond.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood up and took a small step forward, pausing to glance back at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you mind grabbing me something to wear from the spare bedroom? I put all my
            comfy clothes in the dresser."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded again, her throat working against the lump that had formed
            there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips twitched into a shaky smile. Without another word, she turned and made
            her way to the bathroom, closing the door softly behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood still for a moment, the quiet of the room pressing down around her like
            a heavy blanket. Her hands fidgeted at her sides, restless and unsure, until she exhaled slowly, the tension
            in her chest loosening just enough for her to move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned toward the door, her steps soft and deliberate as she made her way to the
            spare bedroom. The room was dim, lit only by the faint glow from the hallway. Agatha moved to the
            dresser.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn't take long to find what she needed: a clean set of underwear, a pair of
            soft, worn shorts, and a faded gray Texas college soccer T-shirt. The name Vidal was printed across the back
            in bold letters, the number 9 below it in bright red.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers lingered on the letters, the faded print rough beneath her
            touch. Her heart pounded, each beat echoing the thoughts swirling in her mind. This shirt-this simple,
            ordinary thing-was a piece of Rio's life, a reminder of everything that made her who she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A life Agatha had almost lost today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought was like a punch to the chest, stealing the breath from her lungs. She
            closed her eyes briefly, steadying herself against the surge of emotion. She didn't want to think about
            how close it had been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a deep breath, she pulled her hand away and carefully folded the shirt, as
            though treating it gently could somehow keep Rio safe. She gathered the rest of the clothes, cradling them
            to her chest, and turned back toward the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The walk back to her room felt longer than it should have, the quiet of the house
            amplifying the sound of her own footsteps. When she reached her room, she pushed the door open and stepped
            inside, and then closed it behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The faint sound of running water from the bathroom filled the room, a soft, steady
            hum that broke the silence but did little to ease the heaviness pressing down on Agatha. She set the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clothes on the edge of the bed and sat down next to them, her elbows resting on her
            knees as she stared at her hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes drifted to the hospital bag on the floor. Rio's clothes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without thinking, she reached for it, her fingers curling around the handles as she
            picked it up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her intentions were simple-take out the clothes, toss them in the laundry, and try to
            create some semblance of normalcy. But as she reached inside and pulled out the first item, she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's white collared shirt-the one she had worn this morning-hung limply from
            Agatha's hands, its fabric now a horrifying patchwork of red. The collar was soaked in blood, a dark,
            dried stain that spread across the chest. The sleeve had a jagged tear, surrounded by more blood that had
            dried into a sickening rust color.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, and her stomach twisted violently at the sight. The
            sheer amount of blood sent a wave of nausea crashing through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't move, her hands trembling as they clutched the shirt. Her eyes
            stayed locked on the bloodstains, her mind replaying the same haunting images she hadn't even seen
            but</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't stop imagining. The chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gunshot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio crying out in pain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened, and before she could even register it, tears began to blur her
            vision. Still, she didn't move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tears spilled over, warm and unchecked, trailing silently down her cheeks.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even then, she didn't lift a hand to wipe them away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she could do was watch helplessly as her tears fell, landing softly on the
            bloodstained</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fabric. Tiny droplets seeped into the dark crimson already there, merging into the
            dried blood. The sight of her tears mixing with Rio's blood felt like an invisible hand tightening
            around her heart-squeezing until it was felt like it was going to burst.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of the bathroom door opening broke through the fog in her mind, pulling
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention back. She blinked rapidly, the tears still falling, and looked up to see
            Rio standing in the doorway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood there wrapped in a towel, her eyes locking on Agatha instantly. They
            widened as they took in the tears streaming down Agatha's face, the anguish etched into every line of
            her posture. Then Rio's gaze shifted, landing on the bloodstained shirt clenched tightly in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's trembling hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw tightened, her expression hardening for a brief moment before
            softening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio murmured, her voice gentle, but Agatha couldn't look at
            her. Her gaze fell back to the shirt, her knuckles white around the fabric and her breath unsteady.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soft footsteps sounded, and then Rio was crouched in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely registered it until Rio's warm hands covered hers, gently prying at
            her fingers, until Agatha let go of the shirt, letting it fall the ground as Rio intertwined their hands
            together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hey," Rio said, her tone soothing as she squeezed Agatha's hand,
            "look at me." Agatha reluctantly lifted her eyes to meet Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The emotion in Rio's dark brown eyes struck her like a blow-concern, tenderness,
            and something so deeply reassuring that it made Agatha's tears fall harder. Agatha's chest tightened
            painfully, and she opened her mouth to speak, but the words caught on a sob.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, forcing herself to push through the knot in her throat.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I almost lost you," Agatha whispered, her voice breaking on the words, so
            quiet they barely made it past her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression softened further, and her grip on Agatha's hands tightened
            just slightly</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But you didn't," Rio said gently, her voice firm and steady, a
            lifeline in the storm Agatha was drowning in. "I'm here, Agatha. I'm right here."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio untangled their hands, reaching up to cup Agatha's face, her thumbs brushing
            away the tears with a tenderness that nearly broke her all over again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hey," Rio murmured, her tone unbelievably soft, wrapping around Agatha
            like a balm. "Let's get dressed and go to bed, huh? You can hold me all night. How's that
            sound?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">More tears spilled down Agatha's cheeks at those words, and she let out a shaky
            breath, her heart clenching painfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's all she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," she whispered, her voice so small she almost didn't recognize
            it, and she hated it- hated how raw and vulnerable she sounded. She followed it with a shaky nod, trying to
            regain some semblance of control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave her a soft, reassuring smile, her hands lingering for a moment to swipe away
            the last few tears before she rose to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wiped at the tears Rio hadn't caught, letting out a slow breath as she
            forced herself to stand. Her movements felt mechanical as her legs carried her almost numbly to the
            bathroom. She moved through her nighttime routine, skipping the non-essentials, her mind too clouded to
            focus on anything more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally stepped back into the bedroom, her breath caught for a moment. The
            hospital bag and the bloodstained shirt were gone, and for a fleeting moment she wondered what Rio did with
            them but it vanished just as quickly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was already in bed, nestled under the covers, waiting for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha crossed the room in silence, her steps soft but purposeful. She slipped into
            the bed beside Rio without a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment her head hit the pillow Agatha reached for Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shifted closer without hesitation, nestling against her as if it was the most
            natural thing in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's arms wrapped around her tightly, pulling her in as though holding her
            any looser might risk losing her altogether.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"See?" Rio murmured softly. "You've got me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip tightened instinctively, her chest constricting as fresh tears
            welled in her eyes. She buried her face against the back of Rio's neck, her breath hitching as she
            inhaled deeply.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah," Agatha whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "I
            do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They lay in silence, and Agatha could feel the gentle rise and fall of Rio's
            chest against her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was everything she needed and yet it made the ache in her chest deepen. The words
            hovered in Agatha's mind, unspoken but insistent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I love you.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tightened her hold around Rio, the thought growing louder with every heartbeat.
            "Rio," she whispered, her voice barely audible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah?" Rio murmured back her voice soft but drowsy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-" Agatha began, her breath hitching, but the words caught in her
            throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Say I love you.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You almost lost her today. Say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-" she tried again, her voice faltering as the words refused to
            come.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could spiral any further, Rio's hand reached down, brushing against
            Agatha's. Rio grabbed the hand wrapped around her middle and intertwined their fingers, holding on
            tightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know you do," Rio whispered. Silence stretched between them
            again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go to sleep, baby," Rio murmured, her words gentle and reassuring.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with that, Agatha exhaled a shaky breath, her eyes fluttering shut as she held
            Rio closer. The weight of the day didn't ease, but she let herself drift off with Rio safe in her
            arms.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thanks for being patient with me. The holiday was crazy, and I had no time to write.
            So here is a nearly 10,000 word chapter to make up for the wait. Also...peep the additional chapter I had to
            add. So we are up to 31. I know you guys want me to go beyond 31 but I am starting to lose gas. This chapter
            was already so hard to write, and I am feeling like I need to take a break from writing soon lol I will of
            course, finish this story but I am sticking with the gameplan and outline I already have. So 31...maybe 32
            if I can't get the plot moving between now and then end.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As always, I appreciate your guys.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's internal alarm honed by years of early mornings stirred her awake. She
            blinked against the soft morning light filtering through the gap in the curtains, her mind still hazy with
            the edges of sleep. She shifted slightly moving to sit up but suddenly realized she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes shot open, and she looked down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two heads of dark hair were curled into her-one on each side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio lay on her left, her long hair slightly mussed from sleep with her ear pressed
            against Agatha's heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On her right, Nicky was tucked in close, his smaller body curled into her side with
            his short hair sticking up in all directions like it always did when he slept.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her chest tightening. It took her a long moment to process what she was
            seeing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-what she was feeling-as her heart began to swell with something achingly warm. Her
            gaze flickering between them, and it hit her all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had never noticed it before-how similar the shades were. The deep, dark tones
            that mirrored one another so perfectly made her breath hitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her hand resting wrapping around Rio's back, her other
            hand brushing through Nicky's hair. She could feel the steady rhythm of their breathing, the soft rise
            and fall of their chests against her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes stinging with unshed tears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what whole feels like.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought had Agatha's fingers trailing lightly over Rio's back and Rio
            stirred slightly, nuzzling closer to her chest. On her other side, triggered by Rio stirring-Nicky let out a
            soft sigh in his sleep, his tiny hand curling into the fabric of Agatha's night shirt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes briefly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fear, the exhaustion, the chaos of the day before-all of it faded away in the
            face of this simple, quiet moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in a long time, Agatha didn't feel the need to move or
            rush out of the bed and conquer the day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't want to break the spell.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she just stayed there holding them both, letting herself savor the feeling of
            holding the little boy she loved most in this world, and the woman she was starting to love with just as
            much ferocity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let nearly ten minutes pass, savoring every second before the reality began to
            creep back in. It was a school day and while Rio wasn't going to work and Agatha had arranged with the
            other partners to work from home-Nicky still needed to stick to his routine. Any</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">deviation from that routine was a surefire recipe for a meltdown, something Agatha
            was well aware of and hoping to avoid at any cost.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as much as she hated to admit it, she needed to pee.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Badly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Carefully, she began the delicate process of detangling herself from them both. Nicky
            grumbled first, a soft, sleepy noise that made Agatha's lips twitch into a smile. Rio followed a second
            later, her own sleepy mumble warm and unintelligible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took a few minutes, but Agatha finally managed to extract herself without fully
            waking either of them. She moved to the end of the bed, before standing. Looking back her breath caught in
            her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio and Nicky were still asleep with an Agatha-shaped gap between them. The sight
            from this perspective had her stomach flipping and her heart fluttering wildly at the image. It was so
            simple, so perfect, and yet it left her feeling raw and exposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a soft sigh, Agatha slipped into the bathroom and relieved herself. As she
            washed her hands, she caught her reflection in the mirror and paused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How was she going to navigate this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Waking Nicky without disturbing Rio wasn't impossible, but that wasn't what
            had her stomach twisting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the collision of her worlds-Rio, her-what? Girlfriend?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lover?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Nicky, her son.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two people who held such enormous parts of her heart, who until now had existed in
            their own spaces.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this morning, they'd both been there- together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The image of them sleeping on either side of her resurfaced in her mind, her
            chest</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">constricting with something so tender it almost hurt. Yet, the complications of it
            all loomed. Rio was so new to her Nicky's life, and while he had already taken to her in ways that
            surprised Agatha, this was still uncharted territory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would Rio be okay with Nicky climbing into bed like that? Would she feel
            overwhelmed?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or worse, suffocated by the instant intimacy of family life? Agatha shook her head,
            trying to push the thoughts away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had made her intentions clear-she wanted this, wanted her and she knew that Nicky
            was part of that package. But that didn't make it any less terrifying to let these two worlds blend so
            seamlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking a steadying breath, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom and back into the
            bedroom but she stopped short in the doorway, her breath catching in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At some point while she'd been gone, Nicky had moved across the bed and curled
            into Rio's side. His small body was tucked against her with his head nestled beneath her chin like it
            was the most natural place in the world for him to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio, still deeply asleep, had instinctively draped an arm over him, her hand
            resting lightly against his back, holding him close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared, her chest tightening as warmth flooded through her. The sight was so
            unexpectedly tender that it rendered her momentarily speechless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step closer, moving slowly as if afraid to disrupt the scene in front of
            her. Her eyes roamed over them and her heart twisted at how peaceful they both looked. Nicky's little
            face was relaxed in a way that only happened when he felt completely safe, and Rio's features, softened
            by sleep, looked just as content.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sheer rightness of it all nearly undid her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze lingered on them, and for a fleeting moment she let herself imagine a life
            where this wasn't an exception but ordinary-a life where mornings like this were the norm-where this was
            just a part of their everyday life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought terrified and thrilled her in equal measure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky shifted, grumbling softly in his sleep as he nestled closer into Rio's
            side. His small head bumped against her chin, the light jolt rousing her from sleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, watching as Rio stirred, taking a deep breath as her eyes fluttered
            open. She blinked a few times, her gaze unfocused, as if trying to make sense of where she was. Then her
            eyes flicked around the room until they landed on the small figure curled into her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her body tensed briefly in surprise, her eyes going wide as she realized it was
            Nicky. Agatha held her breath, waiting to see what Rio would do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, the tension in Rio's shoulders eased. The surprise melted away,
            replaced by an expression so soft it made Agatha's chest ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze lingered on Nicky with a tenderness that seemed to fill the entire
            room. Her hand moved slowly, brushing a lock of his messy hair back from his forehead, her touch
            gentle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky let out a small sigh at her touch, his body relaxing further into her.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't move, her feet rooted to the spot. She hadn't expected this,
            hadn't anticipated how seeing them together would feel. Her world-two pieces she'd kept so carefully
            separate</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-had collided in the most beautiful way. And somehow, it didn't feel
            chaotic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt complete.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost as if sensing Agatha's gaze, Rio looked up and when her eyes locked onto
            Agatha's they widened slightly, like she'd been caught.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them was heavy, stretching for what felt like forever. Neither of
            them moved, their eyes locked as if the world around them stopped to give them this moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Agatha stepped forward. She walked around the bed, slipping in on the other
            side,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">careful not to disturb Nicky. She positioned herself against his back, her head
            propped on her arm as she settled in, her eyes still fixed on Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't look away, her expression open but tentative, as if she were afraid
            she was overstepping.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky remained nestled into Rio's side, blissfully unaware of the emotions
            filling the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio finally broke the staring match, her eyes flicking down to Nicky, curled against
            her, before returning to Agatha's. She swallowed, her throat working as she finally whispered.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You okay with this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stayed quiet for a moment, her eyes still lingering on the two of them-the way
            Rio held her son, the way it looked so natural-like they belonged together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Agatha spoke, her voice soft but steady. "I was about to ask you the
            same thing."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, her lips parting slightly in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she didn't respond, her gaze dropped back down to Nicky, still
            curled against her, his small body tucked securely under her arm. Her hand rested gently on his back,
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers barely moving. When she looked back at Agatha, her eyes were softer, more
            thoughtful, as if she were carefully weighing her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm okay with it," Rio said after a moment, her voice a little
            unsteady but sure. "Are you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't answer right away. Instead, she reached out, her fingers threading
            gently through Nicky's messy hair, smoothing it back with slow, deliberate strokes. His quiet, rhythmic
            breathing filled the space, steady and soothing in a way that anchored her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand lingered there, resting lightly, as she turned the question over in her
            mind. Was she okay with this? It seemed like such a simple thing-Nicky curled up against Rio like it was the
            most natural thing in the world-but the reality was anything but simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think so," she said finally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head and really looked at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You think so?" she echoed gently, her tone carrying no judgment.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, letting her hand slip from Nicky's hair to rest on the bed.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she said, gesturing faintly toward the two of them, "this
            wasn't something I expected. Seeing the two of you together...like this...it's-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitated, the words catching in her throat as she tried to put her feelings into
            something coherent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's a lot," Rio finished for her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, a small, wry smile tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's a lot," she agreed. "But not in a bad way. It's just...
            unexpected." Rio looked down at Nicky at Agatha's words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I get that," she said, her voice quiet and thoughtful. "I never
            thought this was something I</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">even wanted." Her eyes were locked on Nicky, her expression softening further.
            "But it feels right. Doesn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened as she watched Rio look at Nicky with so much care, the
            same tenderness she'd seen in those dark eyes when they were focused on her. The weight of the moment
            pressed against her, but instead of overwhelming her, it steadied her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed, as she reached out tucked a strand of Rio's unruly bed head
            behind her ear, fingers lingering on her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It does," she murmured, thumb stroking Rio's cheek. "It really
            does."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's shoulders softened at Agatha's words, the tension she'd been
            carrying visibly melting away. She leaned into Agatha's touch, her hesitant smile shifting into
            something more genuine, more at ease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They laid there in silence, their eyes meeting across the small space, with Nicky
            nestled soundly between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt as if the room was steeped in a rare and precious stillness, the kind
            that made</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything else fade away. And for a moment, it felt like the world had paused just
            for them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But eventually, reality intruded, as it always did because the world hadn't
            stopped turning, no matter how much it felt like it had.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a heavy sigh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have to get him up for school," she said, reluctant to disturb the
            peace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded at that, but Agatha caught the slight downturn of her smile as if she
            didn't want the moment to end either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned forward, carefully slipping her arms under Nicky's small body and
            lifting him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Slowly, she detangled him from Rio without waking him fully, cradling him close to
            her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky stirred, mumbling something incoherent, but he snuggled closer into her, his
            cheek pressed against her shoulder. Agatha shimmied to the other side of the bed and stood,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">adjusting his weight in her arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was getting bigger- too big to carry like this for much longer. But as she looked
            down at him, his face relaxed in sleep, she felt a pang in her chest. She thought of how small he used to
            be, how easily she'd carried him everywhere. That ache she knew too well threatened to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rise, but she pushed it down. She would carry him for as long as she could, until the
            day she physically couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a fleeting moment, the thought crossed her mind-of having another. Maybe a little
            girl with dark hair and deep brown eyes. The idea sent an unexpected warmth through her chest, her heart
            flipping with a longing she hadn't anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the sound of movement behind her broke through that dangerous line of
            thinking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced back, catching Rio shifting, her body language making it clear she was
            about to attempt to get out of bed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where do you think you're going?" Agatha asked her voice still low
            enough not to startle Nicky but sharp enough to stop Rio in her tracks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio froze, then looked up at her, attempting to raise an eyebrow, only to wince
            slightly as the stitches on her brow pulled. She touched them briefly, then gave Agatha a knowing
            look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was going to make him breakfast," she said casually, as though her idea
            wasn't completely absurd.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha huffed, shaking her head as she shot Rio a glare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Absolutely not," she said firmly. "You are not getting out of this
            bed today. You will stay horizontal-all day. Do you hear me ?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips twitched with a faint smile as she leaned back into the pillows, hands
            raised in mock surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, ma'am," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held Rio's gaze for a moment longer, her stern look softening before she
            turned her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">attention back to Nicky. Gently, she adjusted him in her arms and carried him out to
            the living room, settling him onto the couch. His small body laid against the cushions, and she reached out
            to smooth his hair back, her voice quiet and soothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Honey, it's time to wake up for school," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky stirred slightly, grumbling under his breath as he shifted. Agatha smiled
            faintly, rubbing his back in slow circles until his eyes began to flutter open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched him closely as his blue eyes adjusted to the light, scanning the room
            before landing on her. The sight of him, eyes still hazy with sleep made her heart ache in the best
            way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama," he croaked softly, his voice still heavy from sleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good morning, baby," she whispered, brushing his messy hair back from his
            forehead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He blinked up at her, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with his small hands before his
            gaze settled on her, curious and a little worried.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where's Rio? Why didn't you come home last night?" he asked, his
            voice tinged with worry and with a hint of blame.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question sent a warmth through her chest, but it was shadowed by unease. She
            hated lying to him-always had-but the full truth was far too harsh for his little world. Her hand</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">smoothed over his back again as she carefully chose her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry I wasn't home last night," she said softly, meeting his
            gaze. "Rio tripped and fell at work and had to go to the hospital."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes went wide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But she's home," he said quickly, his words tumbling out as he sat up.
            "She was in bed with you. I saw her. She held me-I felt it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, her chest tightening at his words. Of course, he had
            noticed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, he had felt Rio's arms around him. He always picked up on
            everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, honey" she said gently, keeping her voice steady despite the lump in
            her throat. "She's home now, but she hit her head and needs to stay in bed today to
            rest."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky frowned, his small brow creasing as his gaze flickered toward the open bedroom
            door down the hallway, then back to Agatha. His voice was quieter when he spoke again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I go see her and tell her I hope she feels better?" he asked, his
            earnestness shining through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt her heart warm by the sheer kindness in his words. No matter how many
            times he surprised her with his thoughtful nature, it never failed to leave her in awe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let's get ready first," she said, deciding to give him a little
            incentive to power through the morning routine. "Eat, get dressed, brush your teeth-and then you can
            see Rio. Deal?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky scrunched his nose at her words, his lips pursing as his eyes darted back
            toward the hallway. She could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he weighed his options,
            his</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression so serious for such a small boy. Finally, he looked back at her and gave a
            decisive nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Deal," he said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes slightly, watching him closely. That was too easy.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her instincts prickled, but she chose not to call him out just yet, opting instead to
            pat his back gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," she said with a small smile. "Let's get
            moving."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even as she spoke, though, she made a mental note to stay one step ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was her son after all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky managed to get dressed in record time, his uniform neat enough to pass
            inspection without much fuss. Agatha, meanwhile, busied herself in the kitchen, though her focus was</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">split between the coffee pot sputtering to life and a piece of toast she was
            determined not to burn- again .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first attempt had been a disaster, the smell of burnt bread still faintly
            lingering in the air despite her efforts to air it out. She grumbled under her breath as she plated the
            second round, this time only slightly burnt alongside a simple bowl of cornflakes. With a satisfied nod, she
            poured herself a mug of coffee, setting it on the counter just as Nicky padded into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He climbed onto the stool at the kitchen island before looking down at the plate in
            front of him. He sniffed once, his little nose wrinkling slightly, and then shot Agatha a pointed look- a
            look that plainly said, I know you burnt the first toast. I can smell it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha caught his expression and arched a brow, her own look saying just as clearly,
            Don't push it. Just eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a routine they had perfected over time, one that needed no words. Nicky held
            her gaze for a moment longer before shrugging and picking up the slice of toast. He took a bite, his</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face carefully neutral as if judging whether it was worth commenting on. Agatha,
            meanwhile, sipped her coffee, a small smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe- just maybe -she could make it through the morning unscathed. She pushed the
            toaster down again, to make Rio some toast as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, is Rio your girlfriend now since she's sleeping in your
            bed?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha choked on her coffee. The hot liquid burned down the wrong pipe, and she
            sputtered, hitting her chest as she coughed, her eyes watering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally managed to catch her breath, Agatha set her mug down with a loud
            thud, wiping at her mouth with the back of her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky!" she rasped, her voice half incredulous, half wheezing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky watched her calmly, chewing his toast as though he hadn't just almost
            killed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened her mouth, then shut it, her brain scrambling for a way to handle this
            line of questioning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's sleeping in my bed because she's hurt, Nicky," Agatha
            finally said, her voice measured. "And because it's the most comfortable place for her to
            rest."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky frowned, clearly weighing her explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But you slept with her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked. She knew he meant actually sleeping but the words were loaded and
            it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">caused her mind to stutter for a second. She stood there trying to think of a
            suitable response, but all she managed was a weak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She needs someone to keep an eye on her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky wasn't buying it. He gave her a look-an unblinking, skeptical look that
            seemed far too knowing for a child his age. They stared at each other in silence, the air between them
            thickening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Agatha sighed, setting her coffee mug down with a thud. She pushed herself
            away from the counter and stepped closer to Nicky, placing her hands firmly on the countertop in front of
            him. She leaned forward slightly, meeting his gaze directly, her heart hammering</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anxiously in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn't how she had envisioned the conversation going, but there was no way
            around it now. It was happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Taking a steadying breath, she squared her shoulders and spoke, her voice clear and
            deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she said, nodding slowly. "Rio is my girlfriend."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air for a moment, and Agatha braced herself for his
            reaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's expression didn't change immediately, his big blue eyes locked on
            hers, processing what she'd just said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with all the innocence of a child and the precision of a fucking bullet, he
            asked. "Do you love her?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, her stomach flipping. Could this kid ever just give
            her a fucking inch?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened as she stared at her son, his earnest gaze boring into
            hers. It felt like the room had shrunk, the weight of his question pressing down on her. Her first instinct
            was to deflect, to steer the conversation away, but something in Nicky's face stopped her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He deserved honesty-he always had, and since she already lied to him once this
            morning, she couldn't do it again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a shaky breath, her hands gripping the edge of the countertop as she
            steadied herself. Her voice, when it came, was barely above a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she said, her eyes softening as she looked at him. "I
            do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words had barely left her mouth before Agatha's nerves got the better of her.
            She began pacing in front of the counter, her thoughts spilling out faster than she could organize
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know it's a lot, buddy," she said, her tone rushed, as if she needed
            to get ahead of whatever reaction he might have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mom," Nicky said, his voice calm but clearly trying to get her
            attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know it's really fast," she continued, her words tumbling over his,
            interrupting him. "And I understand if it's confusing or... or overwhelming."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mom," Nicky tried again, his voice a little louder this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And I also know it's different ," Agatha added, pausing as she
            struggled to find the right words. "With your mom... being with another woman."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She winced, the awkwardness of her phrasing making her cringe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mom," Nicky said again, more insistent, but Agatha barely noticed.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know it's a lot of changes," she pressed on, turning to face him,
            her hands gesturing as if to emphasize her sincerity. "But if you need to talk about anything- anything
            at all -I'm here to listen, okay? I want to make sure-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mom!" Nicky's voice finally cut through, louder and firmer, stopping
            her mid-sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her hands falling to her sides, and she stared at him, her chest
            heaving slightly from her nervous ramble.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" she asked, blinking as though only now realizing how much she'd
            been rambling. Nicky didn't say anything at first, just gave her a look, then casually pointed behind
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The toast is burning," he said simply.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her confusion holding her still for a beat-until the smell hit
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She whipped around and darted to the toaster, slamming the lever up. A plume of smoke
            rose as two charred slices of bread popped up, blackened and unrecognizable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Damn it," she muttered under her breath, grabbing a dish towel to fan away
            the smoke as she glared at the ruined toast like it had personally betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind her, Nicky snickered, and when she turned to him, he was smirking around a
            bite of his slightly less-burnt toast.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When is Rio feeling better?" he asked, his eyes sparkling with amusement.
            Agatha shot him a faux-glare, wagging the burnt toast in his direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Watch it, kid, or this is your lunch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky giggled, his grin wide and mischievous. "I don't even take a
            lunch."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tossed the charred toast into the trash and leaned back against the counter,
            crossing her arms as she looked at him, her expression softening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You sure you're okay with all this?" she asked gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky popped the last bite of toast into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully as he slid
            off the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chair. He carried his plate and bowl to the sink, setting them down with a clink,
            then turned back to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm okay with it," he said, his tone light but certain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, without hesitation, he walked over and wrapped his small arms around her waist,
            looking up at her with a smile that made her heart squeeze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's nice."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught as she looked down at him, her own arms wrapping around
            him instinctively. She rested her chin lightly on the top of his head for a moment before pulling back
            enough to meet his gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're sure?" she asked again, searching his face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky rolled his eyes in an exaggerated manner, shaking his head with mock
            exasperation. "Yes," he said with a huff, his tone implying she was the one being
            ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes at his little display of attitude, but the corners of her
            mouth betrayed her, twitching upward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky grinned sheepishly, clearly knowing he'd won this round. He continued
            grinning up at her, unbothered, before tilting his head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I go see Rio now?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, shaking her head as she ruffled his hair. "Go on, but be
            gentle."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky didn't need to be told twice. He was already halfway down the hall, his
            small feet padding quickly toward the bedroom. Agatha watched him go, feeling a surprising lightness settle
            in her chest-a small but undeniable relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to the counter, eyeing the toaster like it was like her personal
            nemesis.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a quick motion, she grabbed two fresh slices of bread and slid them into the
            slots. Her finger hovered over the lever for a second before she pressed it down with a click.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes narrowed at the toaster, lips pursed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm watching you, motherfucker," she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few minutes later, Agatha made her way down the hallway, balancing a plate with
            perfect</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- not burnt -toast in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other. As she approached
            the bedroom, the sound of Nicky's excited voice floated down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you know that flamingos are pink because of what they eat?" Nicky
            asked, his enthusiasm practically vibrating through the walls.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh yeah?" Rio replied, her voice warm. "What do they
            eat?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shrimp!" Nicky declared, followed by a pause. "But not, like, the
            kind we eat with pasta. I think it's tiny shrimp. Or maybe different shrimp? I'll have to look it
            up."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The tiny shrimp are called Brine Shrimp," answered Rio said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, shaking her head as she continued down the hall. When
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached the bedroom doorway, she stopped short, hovering just outside the doorway,
            the plate and mug balanced in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved to enter but then Nicky's voice had changed-softer, tinged with a
            sadness that tugged at her heart that her feet cementing in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," he said, quieter now, almost hesitant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her ears straining as the silence stretched. She could sense the shift
            in the room, feel it in the heavy pause that followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah, buddy?" Rio finally replied, her voice gentle but cautious.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a faint rustling sound-someone shifting on the bed. Agatha imagined Nicky
            sitting up straighter, his small frame moving closer to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you're gonna be part of this family," Nicky began, his tone serious
            in a way that only a child's honesty could be, "you have to be more careful. Mom... she doesn't
            like it when the people she loves are hurt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her chest tightening as Nicky's small voice carried
            through the doorway, raw and full of innocence. She didn't need to see them to feel the weight of his
            words pressing down on the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dad says it makes her scared," Nicky continued, his voice even quieter
            now, barely above a whisper. "Because I got really sick when I was three-and I almost
            died."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gripped the plate and mug in her hands tightly, her knuckles whitening as a
            flood of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">emotions washed over her: love, fear, and a fierce, protective ache for her son. It
            was a part of her life she didn't talk about often, even with herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But hearing Nicky say it out loud, hearing him explain her fears so simply, moved
            through her in ways she hadn't expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed felt like an eternity before Rio's voice broke it, soft
            and steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't know that," Rio said gently, her voice tinged with something
            Agatha could only describe as shock. "That must've been so scary-for both of you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky didn't respond right away, but Agatha could imagine him nodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't remember a lot," he said finally. "But I remember Mom was
            always with me. She wouldn't leave me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a pause, then he added.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She loves me like that. And I think she loves you like that too."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood frozen just outside the doorway, her breath catching as Nicky's
            words reached her ears, soft but full of the earnestness only a child could muster.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, you have to make sure your shoes are tied," he said, his small voice
            carrying an unexpected weight. "And you need to watch where you're going, so you don't fall and
            get hurt again."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a pause, the kind that seemed to stretch time. Agatha could almost feel the
            wheels turning in his little head before he spoke again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We take care of Mom by taking care of ourselves," Nicky said, his voice
            steady but so heartbreakingly wise for his age.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit Agatha like a punch to the chest, her grip tightening on the plate and
            mug she held. Her knees threatened to buckle as she let out a shaky exhale, the lump in her throat nearly
            suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could a five-year-old carry so much understanding? So much awareness?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Inside the room, Rio's voice broke the silence, soft but steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're a smart kid, you know that?" she said, her tone filled with
            affection. "And you're absolutely right."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky hummed in acknowledgment, and Agatha could hear the rustling again. "Will
            you promise?" he asked, and his voice was quieter now, almost shy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't hesitate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I promise to always take care of your mom," she said, and her voice held a
            quiet sincerity that caused Agatha's chest to tighten further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't take anymore and finally stepped into the room, her steps feeling
            heavier as she forced herself to move past the emotional weight threatening to anchor her to the
            spot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned lightly against the doorframe, clearing her throat just enough to announce
            her presence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Nicky and Rio turned to look at her. Rio was still in bed, and Nicky was sitting
            next to her in the middle. Nicky's face broke into a wide smile, while Rio's expression
            softened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Breakfast delivery," Agatha said, lifting the plate and mug as she walked
            in. Her voice was steady, but her emotions churned just beneath the surface. "What's going on in
            here?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just making sure Rio knows the rules," Nicky answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, setting the plate and mug down on the nightstand next to
            Rio as she glanced between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, and what rules are those?" she feigned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That she has to tie her shoes and not fall anymore," Nicky said, his tone
            so serious that Agatha couldn't help the smile tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha casted a look at Rio who was looking at Agatha with a bemused smile, before
            coming back to Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, those sound like very good rules to me," Agatha said softly,
            brushing her fingers through Nicky's hair as she crouched beside the bed, her voice straddling warmth
            and teasing. "Maybe we should get her some velcro shoes to make things easier for her. What do you
            think?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smirked as her gaze flicked to Rio, whose eyes immediately narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Velcro shoes?" Rio repeated, her tone incredulous, though her lips
            twitched as though fighting a smile. "Do I look like I'm five?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her smirk growing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Considering a five-year-old just gave you a lecture about responsibility,"
            she said giving Rio a pointed look that said play along, even though she could barely contain the smile on
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Maybe it's not a bad idea," Agatha finished.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's giggle filled the room, his face lighting up as he looked between
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Velcro shoes are cool, Rio," he chimed in enthusiastically. "They are
            so easy! I have some! A couple of them even light up."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned to Agatha, his eyes wide with excitement. "Can we order some light-up
            velcro shoes for Rio?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing outright. She shot a
            sidelong glance at Rio, who was watching the exchange with amusement that was now giving wake to
            horror.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That sounds like a really good idea, sweetheart," Agatha said, her voice
            perfectly serious as she carefully avoided Rio's narrowed gaze. "We can check Amazon when you get
            back from school. Maybe even find matching pairs for you two."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's grin stretched impossibly wider as he practically bounced in place.
            "Cool!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, cool," Agatha echoed, giving him a small nudge toward the door.
            "Now go grab your shoes and backpack. School's waiting."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky stood up on the bed and jumped off with an excited yell before dashing out of
            the room as the sound of his little feet echoing down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let her smirk unfurl, tilting her head as she turned back to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes came to rest on narrowed dark eyes and a tight jaw, clearly unimpressed by
            the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I promise," Agatha said mockingly, her tone dripping with faux sincerity,
            "I'll find you a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">really stylish pair."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes narrowed even further as she stared daggers at Agatha. " Agatha
            ," she said, her voice low and warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The single word was laced with enough quiet menace to send a delicious shiver down
            Agatha's spine. Her smirk only deepened as she stepped forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shifted on the bed, moving to sit up straighter, her movements careful but
            determined.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ah, ah, ah," Agatha tutted, her eyes narrowing in return as she placed her
            hand on Rio's shoulder and putting gentle pressure to push her back down into the mattress</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Horizontal," Agatha reminded firmly, leaning down to press a quick kiss to
            Rio's lips. Rio huffed against her mouth but returned the kiss, her annoyance melting just
            slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Agatha pulled back, Rio gave her a look that was equal parts frustration and
            affection as she sank back into the pillows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're insufferable," she muttered, though the faintest smirk tugged
            at the corner of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened, her own smirk softening as she stepped toward the doorway.
            "Rest up. I mean it. I'll be back in an hour."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sighed but leaned back fully, surrendering to the inevitable. As Agatha moved to
            leave, Rio's voice called out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're lucky I love you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze for the briefest of moments, her heart doing a little flip before she
            turned back and sent Rio a playful wink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know," she said with a smirk, walking out the door with her heart
            feeling inexplicably lighter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat at her desk, her home office bathed in the golden glow of afternoon light
            filtering through the windows. Papers that Billy dropped off this morning were spread haphazardly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">across the surface, her desktop computer's three monitors were glowing brightly,
            each</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">competing for attention. Her phone buzzed incessantly next to her coffee cup, now
            cold after hours of neglect. And with no assistant to bring her a fresh cup, Agatha just powered
            through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day, which she had intended to spend quietly, had spiraled into chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it would be the day clients decided their entire legal futures hinged on
            her immediate intervention. Despite the other partners stepping up and fielding most of the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crises, there were still calls and emails that demanded her personal touch. Every
            time she thought she was done, her inbox or phone would ring with another urgent message.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then there was the security firm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had spent an hour on the phone with the head of their operations, letting
            loose a tirade that would probably go down in their record books. Her voice had been cold, measured, and
            deadly-every word a calculated reminder of their monumental failure. How a mugger had gotten close enough to
            Rio to even pull a gun was beyond unacceptable. Their excuse of " trying not to impede on her life
            " and " maintaining a safe but distant watch " had been laughable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's changing now," Agatha had snapped, her voice razor-sharp.
            "From now on, I want someone glued to her side. A shadow. Someone who doesn't even breathe without
            knowing where Rio is. And if I so much as suspect you've let your guard down again, I'll make it my
            personal mission to see your entire firm buried in lawsuits."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The head of security had tried to assure her that changes were already being
            implemented, but Agatha wasn't convinced. The thought that this " mugging " might not have
            been random</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-that it could have been Vanguard making another calculated move, just like they had
            with Brooke Sinclair's suicide-sent a chill down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The possibility was too real, too plausible to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled sharply, leaning back in her chair as she pressed her fingers to her
            temples, willing the tension away. The clock on her desk caught her attention, and her eyes widened slightly
            as she realized just how much time had passed. Hours had slipped away since she'd last checked on
            Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To her credit, Rio had actually listened to her. She'd stayed horizontal,
            following Agatha's orders without much protest. The last time Agatha peeked in on her, Rio had moved
            from the bed to the couch, bundled under a blanket, her attention fixed on a documentary about black
            holes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was just about to stand and check on Rio when her phone rang, the sharp tone
            slicing through her thoughts. She glanced down at the caller ID and let out a resigned sigh before picking
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Russell," she greeted, her tone already carrying the sharp edge she
            reserved for her most demanding clients.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Russell Grossman was one of her oldest clients, a cantankerous millionaire who owned
            a chain of high-end real estate and hospitality businesses. His penchant for litigation over</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">zoning laws, tenant disputes, and contract squabbles kept Agatha perpetually busy. He
            also had a maddening insistence on dealing only with her. If he weren't such a consistent source of
            billable hours-and one of the firm's most lucrative clients-Agatha would have happily dropped him years
            ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Russell barked on the other end, his tone grating with
            impatience. "I need you to deal with these zoning commission idiots. They're dragging their feet,
            and I don't have time for their nonsense."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but the door to her office creaked open. Her
            words died on her lips as she watched Rio stroll in, not even sparing her a glance. Instead, Rio made her
            way to the couch on the far end of the room and sprawled across it with the kind of ease that said she
            wasn't going anywhere soon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha!" Russell snapped in her ear, pulling her focus back to the
            phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She jumped slightly, casting a pointed glare at Rio, who looked thoroughly
            unbothered. "Yes, Russell," she said tightly, forcing her tone to remain professional.
            "I'm here."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Russell launched into one of his signature tirades, his voice droning in her ear.
            Agatha barely registered his words as she muted the phone and turned her attention fully to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What are you doing?" she asked, her voice low and sharp, her annoyance
            bubbling just below the surface.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head lazily in Agatha's direction, a smirk tugging at her
            lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm bored," she said simply, her voice languid. She gestured to her
            reclined body with an exaggerated flourish. "And look-I'm horizontal, just like you
            ordered."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's glare deepened, her lips thinning into a line. She stared at her for a
            moment, then sighed, shaking her head as she unmuted her phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Russell," she cut in, her tone clipped as her patience rapidly wore thin.
            "I've already sent the documentation to their legal team, and I have a follow-up call scheduled
            this afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're ahead of schedule on this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio raised a brow at her from across the room, clearly entertained by the
            exchange.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her another look, but Rio just smirked, settling further into the couch
            as if daring her to react.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She exhaled sharply through her nose, her focus snapping back to Russell's tirade
            on the other end of the call.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm pulling up the document now," she said tightly, clicking through
            her email and opening the zoning report his assistant had sent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words on the screen blurred slightly as her headache throbbed at the edges of her
            mind, a clear warning sign of her caffeine deficiency. She grumbled under her breath, reaching for her
            glasses and sliding them on. Leaning forward, she scanned the opening paragraphs, her mind automatically
            shifting into work mode.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, out of the corner of her eye, she caught movement from the couch.
            Agatha's gaze flicked sideways, and there Rio was, shifting slightly, her body languidly stretching as
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">adjusted her position. And then those eyes-dark, rich, and utterly captivating-locked
            onto her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her throat tightening as heat surged through her. She recognized that
            look instantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The smoldering heat in Rio's gaze pinned her in place, and for a moment, the room
            seemed to shrink around them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's lips curved into a slow, deliberate smirk, her eyes dropping to
            Agatha's face, lingering in a way that made Agatha's pulse spike.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You see what those bastards are claiming?" Russell's voice roared in
            her ear, jolting her out of the trance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked rapidly, tearing her gaze from Rio and glaring at the zoning document
            in front of her as though it had personally offended her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she replied crisply, though her voice came out slightly
            uneven.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I see exactly what they're claiming, Russell. Let me..." She trailed
            off, adjusting her glasses and trying to focus, but the lingering heat from Rio's gaze made her heart
            thud in an infuriatingly erratic rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the room, Rio's smirk deepened, clearly enjoying every second of
            Agatha's flustered state.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line, her jaw tightening as she forced her
            attention back to the call.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Russell, oblivious to Agatha's increasingly frazzled state, continued his tirade
            on the other end of the call.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I want a comprehensive rebuttal, Agatha. Don't hold back. These clowns
            think they can push me around, but they're about to find out who they're dealing with!"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Russell," Agatha said through gritted teeth, her focus fracturing as
            she caught movement from Rio again out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flicked toward the couch, her attention split between the zoning report and
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">casual sprawl of Rio's body. But this time, Rio wasn't looking at her. Her
            eyes were closed, her head tilted slightly back against the armrest. She looked almost
            peaceful-except</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught as she noticed Rio's hand. Under the waistband of her
            shorts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And moving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip on her phone tightened as her heart skipped violently. She nearly
            dropped the phone entirely, her knuckles going white around it. Heat flared across her skin, rushing up her
            neck and flooding her face as she froze in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the actual-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you listening to me, Agatha?" Russell's booming voice shattered
            her thoughts like glass, and she blinked rapidly, yanking her eyes back to her computer screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Y-yes, Russell," she stammered, her voice catching in a way that made her
            wince. "I'm listening. I'll handle it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the room, Rio remained completely unbothered, her movements slow and
            unhurried, as if she had all the time in the world as she touched herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach flipped, her mind racing between indignation, shock, and-
            goddammit - desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good!" Russell barked, thankfully oblivious. "I want those updates by
            three. Don't let me down!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course," Agatha replied, her voice higher than usual. "You know
            who I am, Russel."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ended the call with a hurried tap, tossing her phone onto the desk and glaring
            daggers at Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What the hell are you doing?" she hissed, her voice breaking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes opened lazily, and that smirk- damn that smirk -curved her lips as her
            hand continued moving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm staying horizontal," she drawled, voice low and smug. "Just
            like you told me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's nostrils flared, her entire body tensing as she stood rooted to the
            spot. She was caught between fury and a deep, primal hunger that she didn't know whether to fight
            or</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">surrender to. Her jaw clenched as her gaze flickered to Rio's hand, still moving
            beneath the waistband of her shorts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then she heard it-a low, husky moan that escaped Rio's lips, soft but
            devastating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're supposed to be resting ," Agatha snapped, her voice rough,
            betraying her with the unmistakable growl beneath it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, her tongue working against the side of her cheek. The
            deliberate motion sent a bolt of heat straight through Agatha, who tightened her grip on the edge of her
            desk as though it could keep her from launching across the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have been resting," Rio purred, her voice dripping with defiance and
            seduction. "All. Day."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words hung in the air, charged with a teasing edge that made Agatha's pulse
            roar in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've been a good girl, haven't I, Agatha?" Rio's breath
            hitched slightly as her hips arched upward, just enough to make Agatha's gaze zero in. "Don't
            you think I deserve a reward?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry, her control slipping further with every
            passing second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're really doing this?" she hissed, but her voice lacked its usual
            sharpness, trembling under the weight of her own desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's dark eyes locked onto hers, glittering with challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You could come over here and stop me," she teased, her voice a breathy
            taunt. "Or take over for me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers dug into the desk so hard she thought she might crack the wood,
            her body vibrating with tension.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," she growled, her tone low with warning. But Rio's smirk
            didn't falter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, it grew.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, my love?" she murmured, her words deliberately innocent, but her
            actions anything but.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's control snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha practically launched herself out of her chair, her body moving on instinct, as
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crossed the room. She reached the couch in seconds, her hands poised to grab Rio-but
            then she stopped, her breath catching as the image of blood-soaked fabric flashed in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stitches on Rio's brow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bruise blooming across her forehead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bandage on her arm peeking out from her t-shirt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory of how fucking close she came to losing her. Her eyes snapped to Rio, and
            she saw it immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She froze, her eyes fixed on Rio. Her chest rose and fell with uneven breaths as her
            thoughts warred inside her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, sensing the shift, stopped her hand. Her movements stilled as her head tilted,
            concern replacing the heat in her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha?" she murmured, her voice softening with a hint of worry.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat felt tight, her words sticking for a moment before she managed to
            speak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you sure?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. It sounded
            smaller than she intended. "I don't want to hurt you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's face softened immediately, the teasing smirk vanishing as tenderness
            replaced it. She propped herself up slightly, her good arm braced behind her, her eyes steady as they
            met</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Baby ," she said softly, the word carrying so much warmth that it sliced
            right through Agatha's defenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm okay," Rio said gently, her voice steady and sure, but with an
            edge of need. "I promise." She reached out with her free hand, brushing her fingertips lightly
            against Agatha's wrist, grounding her. "And I need you. Please ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words struck deep, the rawness in her voice wrapping around Agatha's heart
            and squeezing. For a moment, Agatha just stood there, staring at her, the weight of everything they had been
            through crashing into her all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, slowly, she moved forward, sitting down beside Rio, before reaching forward
            and cupping her face in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned down and kissed Rio softly, once-twice, and then deepened it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio kissed her back, her lips demanding, her hands pulling Agatha closer. It was as
            though Rio was trying to anchor herself to Agatha, her fingers digging into her waist with an urgency that
            set Agatha's heart racing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha allowed herself to be guided down until she was fully on top of Rio, their
            bodies pressed together. The heat between them igniting as the kiss turned frantic. Then, suddenly, Rio
            grabbed Agatha's hand and pressed it down, guiding it into her pants.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus, Rio," Agatha mumbled against her lips, the combination of Rio's
            raw desperation and the slickness she felt beneath her fingers stealing the air from her lungs. Her voice
            came out almost reverent, like a prayer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I missed you," Rio gasped, her voice breaking with need.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The admission made something inside Agatha snap. A deep, aching need unfurled in her
            chest as she kissed Rio harder, her fingers moving with purpose, drawing soft, shuddering sounds from
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it wasn't enough-it could never be enough. Agatha needed more.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back, her lips just barely brushing Rio's as she whispered. "I
            need to taste you."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes went wide, and she barely managed a breathy. "Fuck yes,"
            before Agatha pressed her hand to Rio's chest, stopping her from moving as she slid down her
            body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her movements were deliberate as she gripped the waistband of Rio's pants,
            tugging them down in one swift motion and tossing them aside. She paused, her gaze meeting Rio's, her
            lips curving into a wicked smirk at the way Rio's eyes burned with both anticipation and
            surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't move," Agatha murmured, her voice low and commanding as she
            spread Rio's legs, leaning down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha never thought she would love this-the taste of a woman on her lips, on her
            tongue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio was different. There was something intoxicating about her, something utterly
            addicting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first time she had been hesitant, unsure, but now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, she craved it. She devoured Rio like she was starving, her tongue moving through
            her with deliberate intensity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-Agatha," Rio growled, her voice raw and broken as her hips arched off
            the couch, pressing herself further into Agatha's mouth. Her hands tangled in Agatha's hair, her
            grip tightening as her breathing grew uneven.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of Rio's voice, the way she said her name, sent a bolt of heat straight
            through Agatha. It was electric, sparking something primal and possessive within her. She moved with
            purpose, her tongue and lips working in perfect rhythm, reveling in every gasp, every shudder, every curse
            that spilled from Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hips moved instinctively, chasing Agatha's mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pressed her hands to Rio's pubic bone pressing her into the couch, keeping
            her in place as her name falling from Rio's lips like a prayer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha-oh god-don't stop," Rio gasped, her voice breaking as her
            fingers tightened in Agatha's hair, holding her there, like she was afraid she might disappear.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha curled the tip of her tongue over Rio's clit, applying just the right
            amount of pressure, her movements deliberate and knowing. She'd learned what Rio loved, the patterns
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rhythms that sent her spiraling. A couple of swipes later, she felt it-the way
            Rio's body tensed, her breath hitching sharply before a guttural moan ripped free from her
            throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked against her, doubling down, her tongue working Rio through it as her
            thighs began to tremble around Agatha's head. Rio's hands tightened in her hair, tugging almost
            desperately as her hips bucked, completely lost to the waves of pleasure crashing over her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio cried, her voice hoarse and broken, her body shuddering
            uncontrollably as Agatha continued, drawing out every last bit of her release.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only when Rio's moans turned into soft whimpers, her body sagging against the
            couch, did Agatha finally ease her movements, pressing a few soft, lingering kisses to Rio's inner thigh
            before pulling back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat back on her heels, her lips still glistening, her dark, hungry eyes taking
            in the sight of Rio-sprawled out, chest heaving, cheeks flushed, and utterly wrecked. Her
            satisfaction</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">was clear in the smug grin that tugged at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio opened her eyes and caught the expression, rolling her own in
            exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're too damn good at that," she muttered, though there was no
            mistaking the warmth in her tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha licked her lips slowly, savoring the lingering taste of Rio. "You taught
            me well," she replied, her voice low and teasing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a soft laugh, her head tilting back against the couch cushions.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Too well," she said, before turning her gaze back to Agatha. Her eyes
            gleamed as a playful smirk curved her lips. "Now come here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, her confidence faltering for a moment. It was one thing for her to
            take the lead, to pour all her focus into Rio's pleasure-but the thought of Rio returning the
            favor,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">especially now, had her hesitating. She glanced at Rio's injured arm, the tension
            creeping into her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio, I'm good," Agatha said carefully, the edge of her voice betraying
            her uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes narrowed slightly, seeing straight through her. She stared at Agatha
            for a long moment, her gaze sharp and knowing, before the corner of her mouth tugged into an amused
            smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You know," Rio said, her voice dipping into a low, sultry drawl,
            "there are ways for me to get you off-while staying horizontal and without needing to move anything but
            my mouth." Her tongue flicked out, trailing over her lips deliberately, her dark, smoldering eyes
            drifting down to Agatha's thighs before snapping back up to hold her gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched, her eyes widening, and- fuck -there was no denying the
            heat that shot through her at Rio's words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come here, my love," Rio murmured, her voice soft yet commanding, laced
            with a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">confidence that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine and made her heart pound in her
            chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's resolve crumbled, shattering like glass under the weight of Rio's
            words and the hunger in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She moved without thinking, standing and slipping out of her pants and underwear in
            one</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fluid motion, before stepping forward, her body attuned to Rio's as if by
            instinct. Rio's hands slid to her waist, firm yet gentle, guiding her closer, pulling her forward and
            up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Agatha straddled Rio's face, her breath caught in her throat. And when
            Rio's lips and tongue met her, hot and insistent, the world fell away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing else mattered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, god- she fucking loved this woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don't Steal Her Struggle</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Okay so this chapter was supposed to contain sooooo much more. But then I got to
            9,000 words and was only like 60% done and I was forced to switch up my game plan and break it into two
            parts. Sorry for the delay, December is brutal on my time. Good news is that the next chapter is pretty much
            written, I just need to wrap up the end. So</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">you won't have to wait too long between now and the next chapter. Also because it
            is a 2 parter--peep the extra chapter. We are officially up to 32 and nearing the end!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha jolted upright in bed, her breath ragged and her heart pounding against her
            ribs. Her mind raced as the realization hit her like a freight train-the cameras.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cameras in her office.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones that had definitely caught her and Rio fucking on her couch. Beside her, Rio
            stirred, her hand instinctively reaching for Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What is it?" she murmured, her voice low and rough with sleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers pressed against her rapidly beating heart, her voice a shaky
            whisper. "The cameras... in my office..."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a heavy sigh, pulling herself closer to Agatha. Without opening her eyes,
            she slid an arm around Agatha's waist and tugged her back down against the pillows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Relax," she muttered into Agatha's neck, her breath warm against her
            skin. "I texted Sam. She wiped the footage."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart was still racing, but her mind struggled to catch up with the calm
            certainty in Rio's tone. The panic, sharp and clawing, refused to let go. Her thoughts spiraled,
            picturing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every humiliating frame of what might have been captured-most notably, the moment
            when she'd ridden Rio's face like a championship bull rider, clinging on for dear life and
            determined to last more than eight seconds.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let Rio's words settle over her, soothing her nerves just enough for her
            breathing to steady. But her mind latched onto something she couldn't let go of. Her brows furrowed as
            she finally voiced the question clawing at the edge of her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Who the fuck is Sam?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned into her neck, a low, sleep-heavy murmur of frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course you had to wait until 3 AM to have this conversation," she
            grumbled, tightening her hold on Agatha as she adjusted her head against the pillow, clearly trying to drift
            back to sleep. "Sam's the security agent on my detail. The one always standing outside my office
            and following me around like a shadow."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was all Rio said, like it was the most ordinary thing in the world. But for
            Agatha, sleep was now a distant dream. Her mind-razor-sharp even in the dead of night, a trait that made her
            an exceptional lawyer-kicked into overdrive. She conjured the image of the woman, piecing together every
            detail like solving a puzzle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't like categorizing people-she found it reductive, lazy. But as the
            vivid memory of Sam sharpened in her mind, there was one label her brain had slapped on the woman
            immediately: gay .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Short-cropped hair with that was perfectly tousled with a the messy look. A tattoo of
            a flower creeping up her neck, just barely hidden by the high collar of her suit. Numerous piercings
            sparkling in her ears. And beneath the professional attire, the unmistakable build of someone
            strong-probably ex-military.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam radiated an aura of danger, like someone who could kill you and then look good
            doing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the time, Agatha had focused on the dangerous part, appreciating that Rio had
            someone so clearly capable of protecting her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she could think about was the gay part.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the fact that Rio had her number and they texted. Agatha's stomach
            churned.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you text often..." she began cautiously, trying to keep her voice
            nonchalant. Rio huffed, as if sensing the direction Agatha's thoughts were heading.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Relax," she mumbled, her lips brushing lazily against Agatha's neck.
            "She keeps me safe. That's it. She's not my type."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart pounded, a restless drumbeat she couldn't ignore as she
            pressed her lips into a tight line, trying-and failing-to maintain a semblance of composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Safe?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was debatable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam had obviously failed in that department. The jagged line of 12 stitches running
            across Rio's brow, and the bullet graze on her shoulder was evidence enough of that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But fine. She let that part go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she couldn't let go was something else entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And what is your type, exactly?" Agatha asked, her tone sharp but
            betraying a flicker of vulnerability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gods .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could feel Rio smile against the skin of her neck, the curve of her lips warm and
            teasing as her arms tightened around her waist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's voice was low, rough with sleep, and impossibly smug as she
            grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Uptight lawyers who wake me up at three in the morning to interrogate me about
            women who delete security footage... of her riding my face."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned, burying her face in her hands as her cheeks flushed, a mix of
            exasperation and embarrassment making her want to throttle-and kiss-Rio all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I hate you," she muttered, her voice muffled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No you don't," Rio countered, the grin evident in her voice as she
            pulled Agatha closer. "Now, go to sleep, cowgirl. You have a trial to win tomorrow."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled, the panic about the cameras and Rio texting other women beginning to
            quiet in her mind. But in the silence left behind, another storm stirred-the ever-present buzz of her work
            brain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Vanguard trial.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It started tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched as the weight of it settled over her like a familiar
            blanket-but this one suffocated, heavy with far more than legal briefs and courtroom strategy. This
            wasn't just another case. It wasn't even just the biggest case of her career.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was personal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had come for her. For Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The security firm couldn't confirm the mugging was connected to Vanguard, but
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">knew . It was the kind of deep, marrow-deep certainty she couldn't explain, but
            couldn't</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">deny. They tried to kill Rio. This trial wasn't just a trial. It was war.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Life and death, balanced on the edge of every argument she'd make tomorrow. Her
            mind flashed to Brooke Sinclair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dead.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Murdered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another casualty in Vanguard's long, bloodstained history. Brooke didn't get
            justice in life, and now the burden of delivering it in death rested squarely on Agatha's
            shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was the only one left who could hold them accountable. The only one standing
            between Vanguard and the countless others they'd destroy if they weren't stopped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind her, Rio's arm tightened around her waist, her breath steady and warm
            against Agatha's neck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was alive-thank the gods, alive-despite Vanguard's attempt to change
            that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha closed her eyes, her hand covering Rio's where it rested against her
            stomach. The trial wasn't just about justice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was about making sure Rio stayed alive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Making sure no one else had to pay the price Brooke had. Tomorrow wasn't just
            about winning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was about survival.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The morning passed in a blur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had allowed Rio to be vertical for the day-begrudgingly. Which meant Agatha
            and Nicky were treated to omelets. Nicky, thrilled to see Rio up and moving, had been in high spirits,
            happily chatting away between bites. It was a good morning for him, which meant he actually listened to
            Agatha, leaving on time with his security detail for school.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That left Agatha alone in the kitchen, sipping her coffee with a blessed ten minutes
            of quiet. She used the time to review her opening statement, the words etched into her brain as she silently
            recited them, ensuring every phrase landed with the precision she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of approaching footsteps pulled her from her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced up-and her heart lurched in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was walking down the hallway, strapping a black leather watch onto her wrist. She
            was wearing black loafers paired with a tailored light gray suit, cinched at the waist with a sleek black
            belt. A high-necked black turtleneck hugged her torso, accentuating her lean frame, while her hair cascaded
            down in soft, effortless waves. Even with makeup just barely</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">concealing the bruises-dark, angry shadows blooming across her temple-Rio looked
            devastatingly good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Too fucking good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took Agatha a moment to process the sight, her mind struggling to reconcile the
            bruised</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and battered woman she'd insisted rest with this polished version striding down
            the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then it hit her like a kick to the chest-Rio looked like she was going to work.
            Which was insane.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha set her coffee down narrowing her eyes. She kept her voice measured and calm,
            though an edge of warning laced her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why are you dressed like you're going to the office?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio finished fastening her watch, the strap clicking neatly into place before she
            looked up. Her expression was cool, casual-completely unbothered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because I am," she said simply, as though it were the most obvious thing
            in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, stunned by the sheer audacity. The disbelief quickly gave way to
            anger, sharp and immediate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Like hell you are," she snapped, her voice slicing through the calm of the
            morning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stopped mid-step, her expression shifting from casual to serious in an instant.
            Her posture straightened, and her gaze locked onto Agatha's with a weight that made the air between them
            feel heavier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," she said, her tone low, edged with a warning that dared her to
            push further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," Agatha shot back without hesitation, her voice equally firm,
            matching her tone beat for beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rounded the kitchen island, her movements careful but sharp, until she stood just
            a few feet away, arms crossed tightly over her chest. Her eyes narrowed, fixed on Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tension crackled between them, unspoken but palpable. It felt like one of those
            old Western standoffs-two gunslingers in the middle of a dusty street, hands poised at their waists, waiting
            to see who would draw first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither moved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither blinked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air between them felt like a taut wire, ready to snap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw clenched, her mind racing through every argument she could make to
            stop Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then her voice came out sharp, unwavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are not going to work," she said, enunciating each word with measured
            force. "You</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">were just shot at, for Christ's sake! You have twelve stitches in your head and
            another fifteen in your arm. You are not leaving this house."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw ticked at that and her eyes locked on Agatha with a steady, unyielding
            intensity. "Agatha," she said slowly, her tone measured but firm, like she was trying to talk down
            a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">storm. "I have already been cleared by the doctor for light duty. I am going to
            work. I can't</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">just sit here alone and do nothing. My mind is too restless to sit idle for another
            day. I need to work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's nostrils flared, her arms crossing tighter over her chest as her
            frustration boiled over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What you need is to stop being a fucking idiot," she snapped, her words
            cutting through the room like a whip.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That one landed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes narrowed, a flicker of hurt glinting beneath the sharp glare she
            leveled at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Careful," Rio warned, her voice low, edged with a sharpness that
            immediately sent a chill through the air between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, her expression hardened, her jaw tightening as her dark eyes locked
            onto Agatha's, daring her to push further. But as the tension lingered, something in Rio's gaze
            shifted. The sharpness gave way to something softer, something almost pleading.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio took a step forward, closing the distance between them. Her movements were slow,
            measured, as though she were trying not to startle a skittish animal. Her eyes stayed locked on
            Agatha's, no longer daring, but searching-trying to find a way through the storm raging behind
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached out, her fingers brushing against Agatha's hand before wrapping
            around it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">firmly. Her grip was strong, but not forceful, a steadying anchor against the chaos
            swirling in Agatha's chest. Rio's thumb moved in a slow, deliberate arc over the back of
            Agatha's hand, an attempt to infuse calm, to draw them back from the edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sam has already increased my security team," Rio said, her tone softer
            now, measured. She was trying to placate Agatha, trying to pull her back from the edge. "They're
            waiting for me downstairs. I'll be fine. I'm going straight to the office and then back. That's
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The name hit Agatha like a gong, reverberating through her mind with a jarring,
            relentless echo. It consumed her thoughts in an instant, louder than anything else Rio had just said.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before she could stop herself, Agatha took a step back, her movements sharp and
            defensive. She ripped her hand away from Rio's like she had been burned, the loss of contact leaving an
            ache in her chest even as her anger surged forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's fingers curled into fists at her sides as she tried- really tried -to
            clamp down on the surge of anger and unease rising in her chest. She knew she was spiraling, could feel it
            like a train wreck in slow motion, but stopping felt impossible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam, the very obviously lesbian security agent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam, who had deleted the office footage with zero hesitation-because Rio had asked.
            Sam, who Rio texted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam, who was waiting for Rio downstairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thoughts churned, louder and louder, her insecurities screaming over the rational
            voice in her head telling her to calm down. Everything between her and Rio was so new, so raw, so
            overwhelming .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was powerful enough to feel all-consuming, and that terrified her. She'd never
            had this before- this intensity -this type of love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea of losing Rio-to another woman or to another attempt on her life that might
            succeed this time-suddenly felt all too real. It crept into her chest like a vice, squeezing tighter with
            every breath. The thought of Rio walking out that door, whether to someone else or into a danger she
            couldn't control, sent a ripple of panic through her that she couldn't ignore, no matter how much
            she tried.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened as she fought to clamp down on the words brewing inside
            her but the words spilled out anyway, fueled by fear she couldn't quite contain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Right," she said, her voice cold and biting, dripping with false control.
            "You're not going to work. And, effective immediately, I'm removing Sam from your personal
            detail."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sucked in a breath, her brows drawing together in confusion that quickly
            sharpened. "What?" she asked, her tone dropping into a low growl.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach twisted at the sound, her heart skipping a beat as she
            registered that tone- the one Rio only used when she was dead serious. It was the same low, commanding voice
            she used in the bedroom when issuing orders, the one that sent a shiver down Agatha's spine and made her
            body respond before her mind could catch up. It was a tone that carried weight, one that promised
            consequences if pushed too far.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was no different, except the stakes were higher. This wasn't a game,
            wasn't foreplay.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was real and dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha couldn't stop herself-not now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You heard me," Agatha said, her arms crossing tightly over her chest like
            armor, her voice sharp and unyielding. "Sam is out. I'll assign someone else-someone who
            doesn't make me question why the hell my girlfriend seems to trust her more than me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression darkened even further, her jaw tightening as she stepped closer,
            her movements slow like a predator closing in on its prey. When she spoke, her voice was calm but carried an
            undercurrent of warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha, this isn't about her-this is about you trying to control something
            you can't." Agatha's chest tightened, her stomach twisting painfully.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Rio saw right through her. She always did.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that didn't make it any easier to hear. Her fear and frustration, bubbling
            dangerously close to the surface, spilled over before she could stop herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Control?" she spat, letting out a mocking laugh as she stepped forward,
            closing the distance between them. Her heels gave her just enough height to look down at Rio, and she used
            it to her advantage, her eyes blazing. "You think this is about control? This is about
            protecting</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">you! "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice cracked slightly on the last words, the intensity of her emotions bleeding
            through despite her attempt to hold them back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't flinch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just looked up and met Agatha's storm head on with one of her own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Rio said evenly, her voice calm but laced with steel. "This is
            about you being scared and not knowing how to deal with it. So, you're looking for something- someone
            -to blame."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words struck Agatha like a slap, sharp and stinging. She faltered, her breath
            catching as the weight of Rio's accusation settled over her. It was too close to the truth, and that
            made it all the more unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened her posture, arms crossing tightly over her chest as if she could
            shield herself from the fallout of her next words. Her voice came out sharper, laced with a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">commanding edge she wasn't sure she even believed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're not going to work," she said again, louder this time. "Not
            today. Not after everything that's happened. I won't allow it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's good eyebrow arched slightly, but the rest of her expression remained
            unreadable, her body stiffening like an immovable wall in the face of Agatha's demand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You won't allow it?" Rio repeated, her tone cool, quiet, and cutting,
            the dangerous edge in her voice unmistakable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach churned, her pulse quickening as the tension between them
            thickened. But she pushed forward, her chin tilting up in defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You heard me," she snapped, her voice trembling faintly at the edges.
            "You're staying here, whether you like it or not."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio dark eyes bore into Agatha's with an intensity that made her throat tighten.
            The air between them felt charged-crackling-like it was waiting for the moment that one of them said
            something to catch fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not a child, Agatha," Rio said, her voice dropping into that
            dangerously calm tone that carried the promise of consequence. "I don't need your permission to
            leave the house."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed, frustration boiling over as her hands flew into the air, her gestures
            sharp and exaggerated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then stop acting like one!" she shot back, her voice rising, each word
            dripping with fear she couldn't admit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw tightened, the muscles in her neck flexing as she took another measured
            step</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forward. Her presence loomed closer now, and her voice, though quieter, was
            unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What part of 'I need to work' don't you understand?" she said,
            each syllable deliberate and firm. "I can't sit here doing nothing. My mind doesn't do well
            with -"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then it happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha storm broke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the words that tumbled out of her mouth were fueled by all her fears and her
            insecurities.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you walk out that door," she said, her voice trembling, raw and uneven,
            "then don't--don't even bother coming back."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed was deafening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart sank the moment the words left her mouth, regret crashing over her like a
            tidal</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wave. Her eyes widened, and her hands trembled at her sides as if fighting the urge
            to reach out and physically pull the words back into herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio froze as the words landed, her body going rigid. The shift in her expression was
            immediate. Her eyes widened ever so slightly, and for the first time, Agatha saw something she'd never
            seen before on Rio's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not anger, not frustration, but raw, unguarded hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart gave a painful lurch at the sight, the unfamiliarity of it cutting
            deeper than she thought possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had done that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had caused that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it didn't go away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't shove it down, didn't hide it behind her usual mask of
            composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let it linger, let Agatha see it, and that made the weight in Agatha's chest
            unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Really?" Rio said finally, her voice soft but impossibly heavy, thick with
            disbelief and hurt that made every syllable feel like a blow. "You're doing this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to speak, to explain, to take it back, but the words
            wouldn't come.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were stuck in her throat, trapped by her own pride and fear, like shards of
            glass she couldn't swallow or spit out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Rio exhaled sharply, her jaw tightening as she did something Agatha hadn't
            anticipated</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-she stepped back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart cracked in her chest, the sound of it almost audible to her own
            ears. The distance Rio put between them felt like so much more than just a couple of feet-it had weight,
            tangible and crushing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had always pushed, always stepped forward, always closed the space between them,
            no matter how heated things got.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, Rio was stepping back, and it felt like a chasm opening between them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't get to do that, Agatha," Rio finally said, her voice low but
            sharp, each word slicing through Agatha like a knife. "You don't get to use our relationship as
            blackmail to get me to do what you want. You don't get to twist what we have into another weapon in
            your</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">arsenal."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, her dark eyes locking onto Agatha's, her expression a devastating mix
            of anger and heartbreak.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What you are to me, and what I am to you-that isn't leverage. It's not
            a bargaining chip. And if you think that's what this is, then maybe you don't love me like I thought
            you did."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words landed like a physical blow, and Agatha staggered back a half-step, her
            chest tightening as though the air had been sucked out of the room. Her hands trembled at her sides, and she
            reached behind her to clutch at the counter behind her, desperate for something solid to hold onto,
            something to ground her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio..." she started, her voice cracking, but the words faltered and died
            in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe you don't love me like I thought you did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sentence echoed in Agatha's mind, reverberating with a cruel, relentless
            clarity. Her heart gave a sharp, painful twist, and she felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course I love you.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is what she wanted to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to scream it, to grab Rio by the shoulders and make her understand.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words wouldn't come, and the silence that stretched between them felt
            damning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't say that," Agatha finally managed, her voice barely above a
            whisper, shaky and broken. "You know that's not true."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze didn't soften. Her jaw remained tight, her posture rigid, as if
            she were holding herself together by sheer willpower. Her eyes locked onto Agatha's, filled with a
            mixture of hurt and defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then say it," Rio said quietly, her voice trembling just enough to betray
            the depth of her emotions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught in her throat. Her mouth opened, but the words refused to
            come out. They sat there, heavy and jagged, caught on the edge of her pride, her fear, her own maddening
            inability to be vulnerable in the way Rio needed her to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-" she started, but the sound faltered, thin and brittle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's shoulders sagged just slightly, a flicker of defeat crossing her face.
            Still she waited, giving her the space to speak-to say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest heaved as her heart raced, her pulse thundering in her ears. She
            wanted to say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the fear, the walls she had spent a lifetime building, wouldn't let her.
            "Rio..." Agatha's voice cracked, her hands trembling at her sides.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out a slow, steady exhale, her expression closing off as though she had
            finally</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">accepted the answer Agatha couldn't give. She took another step back, and
            Agatha's heart snapped inside her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Right," Rio said softly, her voice breaking just slightly before she
            masked. "I'm going to work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her back to Agatha and walked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She made it about five steps, before pausing at the edge of the hallway, her
            shoulders stiff as if she were holding the weight of the moment in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught in her throat, her chest tight with the desperate hope
            that Rio might turn around, might look at her, might give her just one more chance to fix this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio didn't look back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know you will be worried so I will text you when I get there," Rio said,
            her voice flat, hollow, a shell of its usual warmth. "Good luck at your trial."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then she walked into the hallway, leaving Agatha's line of sight. Agatha
            couldn't move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stood frozen in place, her body rigid, her mind screaming at her to do something,
            to call out, to stop Rio from leaving. But she stayed rooted where she was, unable to tear herself free from
            the weight pressing down on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She listened instead, every sound amplified to an unbearable degree. The muffled
            shuffle of Rio's footsteps on the hardwood floor. The sharp creak of the closet door opening. The</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rustling of fabric as Rio pulled on her coat. Each sound hit like a drumbeat, so
            fucking loud, as if the world itself was conspiring to force Agatha into action.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn't move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The metallic clink of keys being lifted from the bowl on the table cut through the
            silence,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">followed by the faint jingle as Rio carried them to the door. Then came the soft
            click of the lock turning, the faint creak of the door hinges as it swung open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's voice, low and unsteady but so goddamn loud it seemed to fill
            every corner of Agatha's home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you, Agatha," she murmured, the words carrying a weight that made
            Agatha's chest ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words Agatha couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they now hung in the air, lingering and heavy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then the door closed with a soft but final click, sealing Agatha inside with her
            regret and Rio's love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The house was quiet again, so quiet it felt oppressive. Agatha's legs trembled,
            but she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">couldn't make herself move. She stood there, staring at the empty space where Rio
            had just been, her mind racing and her heart pounding as her emotions clawed at her from the inside
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just wanted to protect Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, as she stood there alone, and felt the first fall of tears, she couldn't
            help but realize the only thing she had succeeded in protecting was the walls she had built to keep her fear
            inside-and Rio out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fight with Rio replayed in Agatha's mind on an endless, punishing loop. Every
            word she'd said, every defensive step she'd taken, every sharp retort and unspoken plea from
            Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-she could see it all as clearly as if it were still happening. Her chest ached, a
            gnawing emptiness settling deep inside her, and she cursed herself for how fucking stupid she had
            been.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why couldn't she just say it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why couldn't she tell Rio how much she loved her? She knew the answer, of
            course.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't about Rio, not really. It was about her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tangled mess of her own trauma, the years spent convincing herself that
            vulnerability was a weakness, that love was a risk she couldn't afford to take. It was the need to
            protect herself, the overwhelming certainty that she didn't deserve what Rio gave her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the fear-that sick, twisted fear-that the moment she said it out loud, everything
            would fall apart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to see her therapist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed to figure out what the hell was wrong with her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And more than anything, she needed to fix what she had broken. She needed Rio.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness, are you ready?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words barely registered, faint and distant in the fog of her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then came a sharp jab to her ribs, startling her out of her spiral. Agatha snapped
            her head to the right to see Lilia, staring at her with wide eyes and a look that screamed what the fuck are
            you doing?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness, are you ready?" repeated Judge Marks, his tone clipped and
            impatient, the frustration of having to repeat himself evident in every syllable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's gaze shifted forward, and her body stilled as the gravity of the moment
            hit her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was in court.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her surroundings came into focus-the heavy oak bench, the jury watching her with
            silent curiosity, the courtroom buzzing faintly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, forcing herself to take a breath. She needed to get out of her
            head and be present. She couldn't afford to let her personal life bleed into this, not here, not
            now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha inhaled deeply, straightened her shoulders, and forced her voice into
            steadiness. "Yes, Your Honor," she said, her tone calm, collected, even as her chest still ached
            with everything she hadn't said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, she stood, smoothing her hands over her suit, and stepped forward. Whatever
            personal turmoil she was drowning in would have to wait. Right now, she needed to be the person everyone
            else thought she was: unflappable, precise, and always in control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if she felt like she was falling apart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha straightened her jacket as she stepped to the center of the courtroom, her
            heels</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clicking softly against the floor. She inhaled deeply, pushing down the storm of
            emotions swirling inside her. She could feel Brooke Sinclair's parents in the front row, their grief a
            tangible presence that made her chest tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't fail them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cleared her throat, her voice steady as she began, the words she had practiced
            for a week burning into her mind like a script she had memorized down to the punctuation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury," Agatha started, her tone calm and
            commanding. "The</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">case I will present against Vanguard is simple. They are responsible for the death of
            a young woman who had the courage to stand up for what was right. Brooke Sinclair."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She gestured toward the front row, where Brooke's parents sat. Her voice softened
            slightly as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brooke was raised in a small community in Ohio by two incredible people who
            taught her to always stand up for what was right, even in a world that so often turns a blind
            eye."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze lingered on Brooke's parents, their tearful eyes locked on her.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She did that. She stood up. And it cost her everything. It cost her-her
            life."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's voice tightened, and she paused for a beat, the weight of her words
            hanging in the air. She could feel the eyes of the courtroom on her, the quiet tension as everyone waited
            for her to continue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Vanguard must be held accountable," she said, her voice firm but beginning
            to waver as her thoughts flickered, unbidden, to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about you, Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you accountable for?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question stabbed at her, sharp and unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't Brooke's case that filled her chest with guilt and regret in that
            moment-it was Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she had said to her. What she hadn't said to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her practiced words faltered, the speech she had designed to be powerful slipping
            away like sand through her fingers. Instead, something else rose to the surface. Something unfiltered, and
            painfully honest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step closer to the jury box, her hands gripping the lectern, her eyes
            scanning the room, though her mind felt a million miles away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brooke Sinclair was brave," Agatha said, her voice quieter now but no less
            steady. "She knew the risks. She knew that standing up for what she believed in might cost her
            everything. And yet, she did it anyway. Because she believed in truth. She believed in justice. And she
            believed that doing what was right mattered more than fear."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice trembled slightly, but she pushed through, the words tumbling out as though
            they had been waiting to escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fear...fear can be paralyzing. It can make you lash out, make you say things
            you don't mean, make you hesitate when you should act."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, exhaling slowly as her gaze dropped for a moment before lifting
            again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But fear doesn't excuse us. It doesn't absolve us of responsibility. We
            are all accountable for the choices we make-even when we're afraid. Especially when we're afraid.
            "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened as she thought of Rio, of the look on her face when Agatha said
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">words she couldn't take back. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to focus, to
            tie it back to the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Vanguard's fear of exposure, their fear of losing power- of money -that
            drove them to make decisions that cost Brooke Sinclair her life," Agatha said, her voice gaining
            strength</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">again. "And now, they must face the consequences of those decisions. Because
            accountability isn't optional. Not for them. Not for any of us."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped back slightly, her eyes scanning the jury, her chest heaving with the
            effort of keeping her composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Justice is not about perfection. It's about doing what's right, even
            when it's hard. Even when it hurts. That is what this case is about. That is what Brooke stood
            for."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked back toward Brooke's parents, her voice softening as she addressed the
            jury one final time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And that is why we must hold Vanguard accountable. Not just for Brooke. But for
            everyone who deserves to live in a world where doing what's right doesn't cost you your
            life."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped back, her chest heaving as she finished, her heart pounding in a way that
            had nothing to do with the trial and everything to do with Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words she had spoken weren't just for the jury. They were also for
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A promise to herself to fix what she had broken, to take responsibility, to be
            better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as she returned to her seat, she knew that when this trial ended, her real
            fight-the one for Rio-was only just beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That fight was so brutal for me to write. Poor Agatha. Poor Rio. Here is to hoping
            Agatha pulls her head of her ass by the next chapter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I Can't Reach You</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Prefacing this chapter to say once again, I am not a lawyer. The only thing I know
            about the law is what I see on the TV while watching The Good Wife and Suits lol</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Second, this is a long ass chapter. 11,000 words. God damn. It was pretty much
            written, just needed the ending to wrap up. So that is why the turn around time was quicker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which was honestly nice, because I felt bad leaving you guys hanging after the last
            chapter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Third, I had to add...another chapter because I didn't get to some stuff I needed
            to in his chapter. So now we are up to 33.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lastly, enjoy!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trial had started just as Agatha anticipated-Fox and Ratcliff were a well-oiled
            machine, and they'd started strong. The defense paraded their high-profile witnesses, corporate
            heavyweights who spoke about Vanguard's contributions to national security and humanitarian causes. On
            paper, Vanguard looked like a beacon of corporate responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had known she wouldn't win against those witnesses. They were polished,
            untouchable. She couldn't poke holes in their testimony because, frankly, it wasn't the time. She
            needed to bide her time, to wait for the moment when she could peel back surface and and expose the rot
            beneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that moment had come with Brandon Vanguard, the company's Vice President and
            namesake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom had been buzzing when she called him to the stand, expecting another
            corporate heavy weight that would only lend to Vanguards great reputation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, Agatha knew better.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon was an Achilles' heel disguised as an asset, and she was about to slice
            right through Vanguards tendon and send the companies case staggering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd started slowly, building the foundation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Vanguard," she had begun, her tone calm, "how would you describe
            your role in the company?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His answers were predictable, rehearsed. He talked about overseeing operations,
            maintaining relationships with key partners, and ironically -ensuring the company's integrity.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had let him talk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let him feel comfortable. Then she turned up the heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've been arrested twice for DUIs and have one documented possession
            charge for</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cocaine," Agatha said, her tone purposely sharper. "Would you say those
            incidents reflect the integrity you've mentioned?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unsprisingly, Fox sprang to her feet. "Objection, Your Honor.
            Relevance."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes, her control slipping just for a fraction
            of a second before she caught the steady gaze of Judge Marks over his glasses. His expression was neutral,
            but she knew better than to test his patience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness," Judge Marks said, his tone dripping with warning,
            "you'd better have a good reason for this."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha masked her features with a practiced calm, turning to face the bench.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, it's relevant to establish a pattern of recklessness that
            extends beyond personal behavior," she explained. "It speaks to his judgment as a leader within
            Vanguard."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her argument was clear and undeniably valid, but she knew it wouldn't stop Fox
            from pushing back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As expected, Fox immediately asked to approach the bench. The sidebar was
            tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox argued passionately defending Brandon and, by extension, Vanguard's
            reputation. After all, his last name was the company's name-a cornerstone of its brand. Allowing Agatha
            to tie him to any impropriety was dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha, in contrast, countered with practiced precision, dismantling each of
            Fox's points with her usual cutting but methodical approach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks finally raised a hand, silencing them both. He glanced between the two
            attorneys, his lips pressing into a thin line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then his gaze settled on Agatha. That was all it took.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One look, and she knew she had won.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So did Fox, whose loud puff of frustration that was impossible to miss as she stalked
            back to her table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Answer the question, Mr. Vanguard," Judge Marks said.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't suppress her smirk as she turned on her heel, heading back toward
            the center of the courtroom. Just for show-and because she couldn't resist tweaking Fox and Ratcliff-
            she shot them a quick, mocking wink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't need to see Fox's reaction to know it landed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning her attention back to Brandon Vanguard, she tilted her head slightly, her
            smile faint but predatory, like a cat toying with a bird with a broken wing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you need me to repeat the question, Mr. Vanguard?" she asked, her voice
            deceptively sweet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips ticked upward just a fraction, amusement flickering in her eyes as she
            watched him shift uncomfortably.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The jury was watching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The gallery was watching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone in the courtroom was waiting for Brandon's response and Agatha was going
            to make sure they remembered every second of this moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've made some mistakes in my past," Brandon began, his voice humble,
            his eyes scanning the jurors as though addressing each one personally. "But those mistakes don't
            define me,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and they don't define the work we do at Vanguard. I've grown, I've
            learned, and I'm proud of the strides I've made, both personally and professionally."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't bother hiding the pointed glance she sent Fox's way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox was perched in her seat smiling like a proud parent, clearly pleased to see her
            rehearsed damage control coming to life on the stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a slow breath and stepped forward towards Brandon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you agree," she began, her tone measured-careful, "that these
            incidents reflect poor judgment?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon's smile faltered, the confidence in his voice wavering slightly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've already acknowledged that those were mistakes," he replied, his
            tone still polished but not as sure as before. "Mistakes I deeply regret."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, tilting her head as if she were about to let it slide. Then, she
            pivoted, her voice sharpening just enough to turn the room's attention back to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And would you agree," she said, her words deliberate, "that these
            incidents also suggest a pattern of recklessness?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The creak of Fox's chair as she stood was almost as loud as her sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection, Your Honor! Counsel is badgering the witness," Fox responded,
            her voice</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clipped, "and attempting to smear his character without establishing relevance
            to the case." Agatha didn't even flinch at her objection-she expected it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," she argued back fighting to keep her tone calm, "the
            witness's pattern of behavior is directly relevant to this case. It speaks to his judgment and
            leadership, both of which are central to the actions of Vanguard and the events that led to Brooke
            Sinclair's death."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks leaned back slightly, his lips pressing into a thin line as he considered
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">argument. His gaze flickered to Brandon, who was clearly growing more uncomfortable
            by the second, before settling back on Fox and then Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll allow it," Judge Marks said finally. "But tread carefully,
            Ms. Harkness." Agatha inclined her head in acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course, Your Honor."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to Brandon, her gaze locking onto his.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Vanguard," she said, her voice steady, "let's clarify. Would
            you agree that a leader's decisions and personal behavior set the tone for the organization they
            lead?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. "Yes," he said
            slowly, carefully.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And would you agree," Agatha continued, her tone hardening just slightly,
            "that a pattern of recklessness-whether personal or professional-can have consequences for the people
            who depend on that leader?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon hesitated, his hands gripping the sides of the witness stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I... I suppose so," he admitted, his earlier confidence now visibly
            waning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the silence hang for a moment, the tension in the room palpable. Then she
            stepped closer, her voice soft but cutting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Vanguard, let's move on to your role at the company. As Vice President,
            you've signed off on numerous financial reports, correct?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Brandon said, his tone careful now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha returned to her desk, picking up the folder of documents Rio had
            prepared.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Specifically, this series of expense reports," she said, holding them up
            for the court to see before sliding one to Brandon for him to look at it. "These reports total millions
            of dollars over three years. Each one bears your signature, and yet the payments cannot be tied to any known
            accounts at your company or its affiliates. Can you explain that?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon shifted in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-uh, I don't typically handle accounting," he said. "That's
            usually managed by department heads. I must have signed off without-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Without knowing where millions of dollars were going?" Agatha interrupted,
            her tone incredulous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you typically sign off on payments, Mr. Vanguard?" "No," he
            admitted, looking distinctly uncomfortable now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her expression a mixture of feigned confusion and
            disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then please explain," she said, stepping closer to the jury as she held up
            the stack of documents for them to see, "why your signature is on this same invoice account, every two
            weeks, for three years. Are you seriously telling this court you don't know where this money is
            going?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon's face reddened, his gaze darting toward Fox. Agatha noticed immediately
            and pounced.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Eyes on me, Mr. Vanguard," she said sharply, her voice cutting through the
            tension as Brandon's eyes shot to her-as did every other person's eye in the courtroom. "Why
            are you looking at your counsel? Do you think they have the answers? Are you not the Vice President of this
            company? Why don't you have the answers?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-I don't know," Brandon stammered, his composure starting to unravel
            under the weight of Agatha's relentless questioning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, seeing the cracks starting to form. She leaned forward
            slightly, her voice sharp and precise, each word landing like a hammer to those cracks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you like to add perjury to your already extensive criminal history, Mr.
            Vanguard?" "Objection!" Fox's voice cut through the courtroom as she snapped top her
            feet, her face</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flushed with barely contained anger. "Counsel is badgering the witness and
            making</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">inflammatory statements. Move to strike!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks raised his hand to silence her, and his expression turned stern as he
            looked at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness, watch yourself. This is a court of law, not a theater. The
            objection is sustained, and the jury will disregard that last statement."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped back slightly, raising her hands in a gesture of mock surrender.
            "Of course, Your Honor. My apologies."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The judge's eyes narrowed further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Be careful, Ms. Harkness. You're already treading on thin ice."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded at that but thin ice is where she thrived and this exactly where she
            wanted to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to the jury, and could feel the tension in the room, the way the
            jurors leaned forward, their attention fully captured. She knew that Brandon's hesitation, his inability
            to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">answer, was already far more damning than anything she could say outright.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She walked deliberately to the witness stand, placing the folder in front of him with
            a quiet thud, its contents splayed open to reveal stacks of documents bearing his signature.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Vanguard," she began, her tone calm but deliberate, gesturing toward
            the folder. "These payments-totaling," she paused for effect, tapping her chin as if calculating,
            though the number was burned into her mind, "three hundred sixty-one million dollars over three
            years</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-bear your signature every two weeks. Are you seriously telling this court you have
            no idea where this money went or what it was for?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon swallowed hard, the movement visible in the tightness of his throat. His jaw
            clenched as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-I don't recall," he said finally, his voice uneven, barely audible
            over the hush of the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched an eyebrow, her skepticism practically dripping off her expression. She
            tilted her head slightly as if studying him, the pause amplifying the weight of his answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You don't recall signing off on millions of dollars? Or you don't
            recall where the money went? Or what it was used for?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice rose slightly as she leaned closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What exactly don't you recall, Mr. Vanguard?" "All of it,"
            Brandon muttered, his voice cracking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"All of it?" she repeated, her tone incredulous, turning the phrase into a
            weapon. She stepped closer, lowering her voice just enough to force the jury to lean in. "Or are you
            just saying that</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">because you know the truth would be even worse?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection!" Fox barked, practically leaping to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Withdrawn," Agatha said quickly, raising her hands in a gesture of
            surrender before Judge Marks could admonish her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cast a glance at Judge Marks, whose glare told her she was nearing his limit, and
            nodded with a brief, apologetic smile. But the faint curve of satisfaction at the corner of her mouth
            betrayed her real feelings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning slightly, she let her gaze sweep over the jury. She didn't need to say
            another word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their faces told her everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The seed of doubt was already blooming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon's polished facade was cracking, and the jury was beginning to see him for
            what he was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's voice softened as she grabbed the documents from in front of them and
            held them in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Final question, Mr. Vanguard. And I want to take you back to my earlier
            question. Now that we've established you authorized the transfer of three hundred sixty-one million
            dollars to an unknown entity, would you agree that this behavior aligns with what we could call a pattern of
            recklessness?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon opened his mouth, but the words that came out were garbled, a disjointed
            mess. "I-I mean, no-you see-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let him flounder for a moment before offering him a placating smile that
            barely masked her disdain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Question withdrawn," she said smoothly, giving him an out while
            simultaneously underscoring his incompetence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The damage was already done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she turned back to her table, she allowed herself a brief glance at Fox, whose
            tight-lipped expression spoke volumes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox knew it too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha knew she was finally on the board.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No further questions, Your Honor," Agatha said, her tone final as she
            walked back to her seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox- of course , wasted no time, standing immediately for redirect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She clawed back what she could, framing Brandon as a high-level executive inundated
            with documents, signing hundreds of reports daily for a company worth ten billion dollars. She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">argued that three hundred sixty-one million, while significant, wasn't unusual in
            the scale of their operations. She added that Vanguard's nature as a government contractor meant
            security clearances could restrict even the VP from knowing certain details. The money might not</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">appear in standard accounts because it was tied to classified work. Agatha frowned as
            she listened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox was good-very good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew how to spin the narrative and patch the holes. But as Agatha watched the
            jury, she could see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doubt till lingered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was subtle, but it was there, and that was all she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Doubt was her opening, and she would widen it even further tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Fox returned to her table, shooting Agatha a look that was equal parts
            frustration and warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks nodded curtly. "The witness is excused."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brandon stepped down stiffly, his once-confident swagger replaced with rigid
            movements. The charm he'd exuded earlier was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched him retreat, a faint smile playing on her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks adjusted his glasses, his expression unreadable as he surveyed the
            courtroom. With a quick glance at the time, he rapped his gavel once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We'll reconvene tomorrow at 9 a.m.," he announced, his tone final.
            "Court is adjourned."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom buzzed to life almost immediately. Lawyers shuffled papers, the jury
            began filing out, and the spectators broke into quiet conversations. Agatha exhaled a controlled breath,
            straightening her posture as she gathered her notes into a neat stack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside her, Lilia was already packing up the case files.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," Lilia muttered under her breath, glancing at Agatha, "that
            was... something."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked faintly but didn't reply. She slid her folder into her briefcase,
            snapping it shut before nodding toward the door. Together, they rose from their seats, stepping into the
            steady stream of people filtering out of the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before heading into the hallway, Agatha made her way over to Brooke Sinclair's
            parents, who had been sitting quietly in the first row throughout the trial. Brooke's mother stood as
            Agatha approached, her eyes glassy with unshed tears.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair," Agatha said, her tone soft but steady.
            "I'm happy with how today went. We made progress, and tomorrow we'll push even
            harder."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mrs. Sinclair nodded, her lips trembling as she reached out to squeeze Agatha's
            arm. "Thank you," she whispered. "For fighting for Brooke. For giving her a
            voice."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat tightened, but she managed a faint smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We're not done yet. Rest tonight-we'll keep fighting tomorrow."
            The Sinclairs exchanged a grateful glance before Mrs. Sinclair said,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We're heading back to the hotel for the night. But we'll be here first
            thing in the morning." Agatha nodded.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Take care of yourselves. I'll see you tomorrow."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a final squeeze of her arm, they left, their steps slow and heavy as they
            disappeared into the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The corridor was crowded, a mass of lawyers, reporters, and onlookers bustling
            about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha and Lilia maneuvered their way through the throng. The hum of conversations
            surrounded them, snippets of whispered speculation about the trial and Brandon's testimony.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Lilia said, her voice low and laced with amusement as they
            maneuvered through the bustling corridor, "I had forgotten how absolutely entertaining it is to watch
            you in court."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, the compliment pulling her momentarily from her thoughts.
            "Entertaining, huh?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia chuckled, shaking her head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, don't be modest. You know exactly what you're doing in there.
            Watching you dismantle Brandon Vanguard piece by piece? That was art."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk widened slightly as the memory surfaced, but it wasn't just
            the thrill of today's performance that lingered. It was the history between them, the way their paths
            had first crossed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over a decade ago, they had been on opposite sides of the courtroom-a true David
            versus Goliath matchup. Lilia had been Goliath, leading a powerhouse firm with resources Agatha couldn't
            dream of at the time. But David-Agatha-had come out on top, not only winning the case but also earning
            Lilia's respect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That victory had led to the most surprising turn of her career. Lilia offering her a
            spot on the partnership track at her firm. Agatha had taken the opportunity without hesitation, and
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rest, as they say, was history.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as Lilia continued to praise her courtroom theatrics, Agatha's mind drifted
            to a different battle, one she wasn't sure how to win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though she still felt the high of finally making headway in the Vanguard case,
            the nagging ache in her chest reminded her that she was behind- way behind-when it came to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Work was easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She understood how to read a courtroom, anticipate a move, counter a play. It was all
            second nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But bridging the gap she had caused in her relationship with Rio? That was foreign
            terrain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And unlike court, there were no precedents in her arsenal to lean on because
            simply-she never had a relationship like she had with Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never loved someone as much as she loved Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of groveling-a necessity, she knew-made her stomach churn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And emotional conversations? That was a minefield she had spent her entire life
            avoiding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought of laying herself bare, of voicing the words she had always kept locked
            away, sent a ripple of anxiety coursing through her. Vulnerability was not her strength, and the prospect of
            confronting her own fears felt like voluntarily stepping into a pit of her worst nightmares.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she had, for all intents and purposes, royally fucked up this morning. And now,
            she needed to do whatever it took to make it right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To unfuck what she had so spectacularly fucked up. Lilia's voice brought her
            back.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're quiet. That's not like you after a win."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced at her, forcing a small smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just thinking about tomorrow," she lied smoothly. Lilia's eyes
            narrowed slightly, but she let it go.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, if tomorrow is anything like today, Melanie better be on her
            toes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but before a single word could leave her lips, a
            body crashed into her, shoulder slamming into hers with enough force to send her stumbling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The impact knocked the air from her lungs, and she fought for balance. Of course,
            today had to be the day she chose to wear her highest heels-a statement piece for court that also doubled as
            torture device. They were difficult enough to walk in on a good day, let alone</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">when she was literally thrown off her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She staggered, arms flailing slightly, but before she could hit the ground, a hand
            gripped her arm, yanking her upright with surprising strength.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus, Agatha, are you okay?" Lilia's voice was sharp, cutting through
            the commotion with genuine concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely registered her words as another voice, low and venomous, was speaking
            directly into her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sorry about your girlfriend's face," the voice murmured, quiet but
            dripping with malice. The words slithered around her like a snake, tightening with each syllable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hand on her arm squeezed painfully, making her wince.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She had such a pretty face. Next time, I'll tell my guys to aim lower, so
            you can give her an open-casket funeral."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, every muscle in her body locked as the words sank in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air around her seemed to thin, and the bustling hallway faded into a muffled hum.
            Her mind reeled, instincts screaming at her to react, but for a moment, she was paralyzed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The chill running down her spine was soon consumed by a surge of molten rage,
            white-hot and blinding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned slowly, her heart pounding in her chest, and there he was-James Hughes,
            Vanguard's Head of Security.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He stood there so fucking cocky, a smirk tugging at his lips. His eyes gleamed with
            smug satisfaction, his posture relaxed as though this was just another day for him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind raced.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This man is unhinged.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not just bold-fucking insane.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had confessed to Agahta . Right here in public, in the middle of a courthouse
            hallway. Threatening her, admitting to orchestrating the attack on Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't a mugging. It had been a hit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, he was promising to come after Rio again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened, terror and fury battling for dominance. The image of Rio's
            bruised face, her wounded arm, the blood-it all flooded back, consuming her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James released her arm and began to turn away, his smirk widening as if he'd
            already claimed victory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then it snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rage boiled over, feral and uncontrollable. A guttural sound tore from
            Agatha's throat, primal and raw, before she even realized it was hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James paused mid-step, his smirk faltering as he turned back at the sound,
            amusement</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flickering in his eyes. But he didn't have time to say anything because
            Agatha's fist collided with his face with brutal force.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crunch of bone echoed in her ears, followed by a sharp, stabbing pain in her
            hand. She didn't know if she'd broken his nose, or her hand, or both-but she didn't care.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha!" Lilia's voice was sharp and panicked, cutting through the
            chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Agatha didn't hear her, didn't register the commotion erupting around
            her. Her vision tunneled on James, who staggered back, clutching his bleeding nose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You bitch! You broke my nose!" he snarled, stepping forward, his face
            twisted with fury. Blood seeped between his fingers, staining his cuff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could respond-or throw another punch-the security team assigned to her
            stepped in. Two burly men moved swiftly, positioning themselves between her and James, hands raised in
            warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chaos erupted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The corridor buzzed with shouts-accusations, expletives, gasps of shock. Agatha
            wasn't silent.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice joined the fray, rising above the rest as she hurled her own
            expletives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You fucking coward!" she roared, her body trembling as she strained
            against Lilia's grip and her security team's restraint. "You tried to kill her! You fucking
            tried to kill her!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Fox and Ratcliff rushing toward the scene,
            their faces etched with disbelief and something close to horror.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ratcliff moved to James's aid while Fox looked at Agatha with wide eyes.
            "Agatha, have you completely lost your mind?" she shouted at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James started to lunge forward, but the security team shoved him back firmly.
            "Stay back, Mr. Hughes," one of them repeated-warning edging his tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that this man was still trying to come after her, only added fuel to
            Agatha's already burning rage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are a coward! You want to come after me then come after me, you piece of
            shit! You stay the fuck away from her! You hear me!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then a voice cut through the chaos. "Enough!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The single word echoed in the hallway, silencing everyone instantly. Heads whipped
            around toward the source.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks stood at the door to his office, likely hearing the panic and stepping
            out. His</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face was a storm of fury and disbelief as he took in the chaos outside his chambers.
            His eyes flickered to the security team restraining James, the blood dripping from his nose, and
            Agatha</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-her hand smeared with blood, her chest heaving, wild-eyed as she locked eyes with
            the judge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The judge's gaze narrowed on her immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Counsel," he said sharply, his voice laced with icy authority. "In my
            chambers. Now ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The judge's chambers were thick with tension as Agatha stood there, her shoulders
            stiff and her chest still heaving with residual fury. She could feel her teeth grinding together, her body
            practically vibrating with adrenaline and rage. She was trying to focus on the moment, but the burning
            sensation in her hand pulled her attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," she hissed, looking down at her bloody knuckles, which were rapidly
            swelling and starting to throb in time with her heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia, already beside her, grabbed Agatha's wrist gently, her brow furrowing as
            she inspected the damage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think you broke your hand," Lilia said, her voice filled with worry.
            Agatha gritted her teeth, pulling her hand back from Lilia's prodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm fine," she snapped, her tone clipped, though the pain begged to
            differ.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Lilia could argue, the sound of the door slamming shut made everyone in the
            room jump. Judge Marks stood by the now-closed door, his face set in a thunderous scowl.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Does anyone want to explain what the hell is happening?" he barked, his
            voice echoing in the small space.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, the sharpness of his tone cutting through her lingering rage.
            She'd pissed off Judge Marks before-plenty of times, if she was honest-but she had never seen him this
            mad. Suddenly, she felt like she was back in high school, standing in the principal's office after
            she'd kneed the star quarterback in the balls for grabbing her ass. She'd gotten a week-long
            suspension for that one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this wasn't high school, and Judge Marks wasn't a principal. He was the
            presiding authority over the most important case of her career, and she had just jeopardized it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'd like to know that myself," Fox interjected, her voice tight with
            barely restrained anger. "Your Honor, my client's head of security was assaulted in the hallway by
            opposing counsel. This is unacceptable-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your client's head of security threatened me, " Agatha shot back,
            laced with the fury still raging in her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enough!" Judge Marks bellowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His glare snapped between Agatha and Fox, leaving no room for argument. "Both of
            you. Sit."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reluctantly dropped into the leather chair. Lilia remained standing behind
            her, a grounding presence with one hand firmly on Agatha's shoulder. Across the way, Fox sank into her
            chair beside her with a flourish of irritation, while Ratcliff chose to stand, mirroring Lilia's stance
            behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks began pacing behind his desk, his hands clasped tightly behind his back
            as though restraining himself from slamming them onto the table. He was clearly searching for the right
            words, his jaw clenched as his frustration radiated off him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me get this straight," he said finally, his voice low but thick with
            disbelief. "Opposing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">counsel physically assaulted someone in the middle of my courthouse? Do you have any
            idea what this could do to my courtroom's reputation, let alone this trial?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's jaw tightened, the urge to defend herself bubbling up, but before she
            could speak, Lilia's hand tightened on her shoulder-a silent warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Judge Marks," Lilia said, her voice calm and controlled, the very picture
            of composure-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything Agatha wasn't in this moment. "Last week, Ms. Harkness received
            photos from an unknown entity threatening her son and her partner. The photos were taken both in public and
            in private settings, clearly showing her family was being monitored. Accompanying the</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">photos was a note warning Ms. Harkness to drop the case against Vanguard-or her
            family would be harmed."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marks froze mid-step, his sharp eyes locking onto Agatha, the anger in his expression
            softening slightly as concern edged in. He straightened, his tone less biting as he addressed Lilia.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why wasn't this reported?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia's lips pressed into a thin line before she answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We could not substantiate whether the threat definitively came from Vanguard,
            so we took precautions on our side. We hired security to protect Ms. Harkness's family. However,"
            her voice dropped, her gaze steady, "two days ago, Ms. Harkness's partner, Ms. Vidal, was shot at
            in what was framed as an attempted mugging."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox scoffed loudly, leaning forward with a dismissive wave of her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This isn't a spy thriller, Lilia. My client had nothing to do with this
            alleged 'mugging.' Let's not turn this courtroom into a conspiracy theory
            playground."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The growl that tore from Agatha's throat was low and feral, her self-control
            hanging by a thread.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell that to James Hughes," Agatha snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut.
            "The man just shoulder-checked me in the hallway, admitted to orchestrating the shooting, and
            threatened to do it again!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's eyes widened, the briefest flash of unease flickering across her face
            before she smoothed it back into her practiced facade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did anyone else hear this alleged 'confession,' Agatha?" Fox
            retorted, her voice dripping with condescension. "Because I call hearsay. You're just grasping at
            straws to win this case by spinning wild accusations."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot to her feet, ignoring Lilia's attempt to keep her seated. Her injured
            hand slammed onto the table, sending a sharp jolt of pain through her arm, but she didn't care.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That son of a bitch threatened my family!" Agatha roared, her voice
            cracking under the weight of her fury.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Enough!" Judge Marks thundered, his voice cutting through the room like a
            whip. His patience was visibly fraying, his knuckles white as he gripped the edge of his desk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He leaned forward, his piercing gaze boring into Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness, sit down. I am already fining you $10,000 for your
            actions-warranted or not, I will not tolerate violence in my courthouse."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a sharp scoff, the rage still boiling under her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Only $10,000?" she retorted, her voice dripping with venom as she gestured
            to the door. "Bring that asshole back in here so I can hit him at least ten more fucking
            times."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Lilia hissed in warning, her fingers gripping Agatha's
            shoulder like a vice as she forcibly pushed her back into her chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's lips pressed into a thin line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's another $10,000, Ms. Harkness," he said, his voice icier than
            before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, but before she could fire off another retort, Lilia reached
            over and flicked her ear hard enough to sting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A fine she will pay," Lilia interrupted smoothly, her tone calm and
            authoritative.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to glare at her, but Lilia didn't so much as glance in her
            direction. Her focus was entirely on Judge Marks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The judge's eyes narrowed as he regarded Lilia, the tension in the room
            thickening. There was a history between them-anyone could see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mutual respect, yes, but also something deeper, something unspoken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Agatha didn't know better, she'd suspect there had been a flicker of
            romance between them long ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks exhaled heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose as though willing
            himself to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">regain control. Finally, he shifted his attention to Fox, his expression darkening to
            something far more severe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you, Ms. Fox," he said, his voice cold and deliberate, "if I find
            out your client's people are involved in even half of what's being alleged here, I will personally
            see to it that this trial doesn't just sink your case-it will destroy your career."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox bristled, her jaw tightening, her fingers twitching against the arm of her chair,
            but she wisely kept her mouth shut-for the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks straightened behind his desk, looking as though the weight of the trial,
            and now this debacle, had aged him ten years in the span of five minutes. His eyes moved between the
            attorneys, heavy with exasperation before he finally sat down in his chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thankfully," he said, his tone sharp, "the jury was deliberating at
            the time, so they did not witness any of this mess. From where I stand, the trial can continue as
            planned."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's head snapped up at that, her carefully maintained composure slipping for a
            fraction of a second.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," she began, her voice smooth but tinged with barely concealed
            frustration, "this situation has irreparably compromised the proceedings. The actions of opposing
            counsel-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">physically assaulting my client's employee in the courthouse, no less-are grounds
            for dismissal. How can we expect a fair trial under these circumstances?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha scoffed audibly, her fury bubbling to the surface as she opened her mouth to
            retort. "Oh, please-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Lilia cut in smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, opposing counsel's claim is absurd," Lilia said, her gaze
            fixed on Judge Marks, ignoring Agatha and Fox entirely. "Ms. Harkness responded to a clear and imminent
            threat made against her family. While her response may not have been ideal, dismissing the case</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">would reward the very intimidation tactics being used against her. That would set a
            dangerous precedent."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence descended over the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowing as he studied Lilia, then
            Agatha, and finally Fox.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I agree with Ms. Caldru," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.
            Fox stiffened, her jaw tightening further, but she didn't dare interrupt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Here's what's going to happen," Judge Marks continued, his voice
            authoritative. He turned to Agatha, his expression sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your firm will provide me with all evidence regarding these threats by tomorrow
            morning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're alleging someone admitted to a crime, I expect a formal report filed
            with courthouse security before you leave this building. Am I clear?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line, but she nodded. "Yes, Your
            Honor."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marks's gaze shifted to Fox, his tone turning colder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you, Ms. Fox-you will get your client's people under control. If I hear
            even a whisper of harassment or intimidation from Vanguard or anyone associated with this case, I will not
            hesitate to issue sanctions that will cripple your defense."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed was deafening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks straightened in his chair, his final words cutting through the tension
            like a blade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're all dismissed. And let me be perfectly clear-if I hear about another
            incident like this, neither of you will like the consequences. Get out ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia was the first to rise, placing a firm hand on Agatha's arm to guide her up.
            Agatha followed, her body still humming with adrenaline and fury, but she bit back any further
            comments.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the heavy door to Judge Marks's chambers slammed shut behind them,
            Agatha's mind raced, her thoughts a chaotic swirl of anger, pain, and lingering fear. Her hand throbbed
            mercilessly and her jaw ached from grinding her teeth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia was on the phone speaking beside her, her voice low, undoubtedly dispensing
            orders to someone on the other end of the line, but the words barely registered. Agatha's focus
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">consumed by the storm of emotions roiling inside her. The memory of James
            Hughes's smirk, the venom in his voice, and the weight of his threat all played on a loop, fueling the
            fire in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Lilia! Agatha!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sharp voice jolted Agatha from her spiraling thoughts. She recognized it
            immediately and turned to see Alice hurrying toward them from the elevator, her wide eyes locked on
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia ended her call abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, Jen-I will keep you informed," she said curtly before lowering her
            phone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, irritation sparking. Of course, Lilia had told Jen. She'd
            never hear the end of this from Jen-ever. She opened her mouth to call Lilia out for being a tattletale, but
            before she could get a word in, Alice reached them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you done with your motion hearing?" Lilia asked briskly, her tone all
            business.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice nodded but didn't take her eyes off Agatha, her expression a mix of concern
            and disbelief as she no doubt took in her disheveled state.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Lilia said, her tone clipped as she gestured toward Alice.
            "Take Agatha to Mount Sinai. She's broken her hand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice's eyes widened in alarm as she turned to Agatha. "You what
            ?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha ignored her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm not going to the hospital," she growled. Lilia stopped abruptly,
            spinning to face her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You will get your ass to the hospital right now," Lilia hissed, her voice
            low but filled with warning, "or I will drag you there by the ear."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped closer, she was a good 6 inches shorter then Agatha right now due to the
            heels, but still somehow made Agatha feel small on her glare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You want to test me, Agatha Harkness? Try me. Let's see how your unshakable
            reputation handles getting dragged out of the courthouse like a misbehaving child. Because I will do
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth fell open, and for a moment, she was too stunned to respond. But
            when Lilia reached toward her face, as if she were genuinely about to grab her by the ear, Agatha batted it
            away with her good hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay, mom!" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she stepped back.
            "Jesus! Fine!" Lilia didn't respond, merely crossing her arms and arching an eyebrow in silent
            triumph.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice snorted, her initial concern giving way to a faint smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before the moment could stretch, Lilia turned her sharp gaze on her, and any
            trace of humor melted from Alice's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you still have that contact at the FBI?" Lilia asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice straightened, her lips pressing into a thin line. As a former district
            attorney, Alice had an extensive network of criminal justice contacts, a resource the firm often relied on
            to stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I do," Alice said, her voice cautious as her gaze flickered between Agatha
            and Lilia.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good," Lilia replied. "Have them meet you at the hospital. We're
            turning over everything we have on Vanguard- now ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha bristled at that, her body stiffening as a surge of unease coursed through
            her. She shot Lilia a sharp look, her voice cutting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No-" Agatha began.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It is not up for debate," Lilia interrupted, her voice rising just enough
            to convey finality. Her piercing gaze locked on Agatha. "Jen agrees. A line was crossed today, and now
            that we know the attempt on Rio's life was tied to Vanguard, we're done taking risks. We're
            turning over everything to the FBI-effective immediately."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clenched her good fist, biting back her instinct to argue further. She hated
            this, hated the idea of handing over all hard-won evidence Rio found to an agency that might not handle it
            with the same care. Vanguard had deep pockets, influence, and undoubtedly eyes</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everywhere. If the FBI had it, there was a very real chance it could find its way
            back to Vanguard's hands, compromising their entire case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was of course always the plan to turn over the evidence after the case, but never
            before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as much as she hated it, Agatha knew Lilia was right. Vanguard had escalated the
            stakes, and this wasn't a game anymore-it was war.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw tightened, and after a beat, she gave a single, reluctant nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine," she said through gritted teeth, her voice clipped with
            frustration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice exchanged a glance with Lilia, her expression grim as she pulled out her phone.
            "I'll make the call on the way to the hospital. They'll likely meet us there."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia nodded curtly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good. I'll stay behind to fill out the report for courthouse security and
            ensure Judge Marks gets all the documented threats he's requested. We can't afford to push him any
            further when he's already on edge."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes, crossing her arms as her hand throbbed painfully at the
            movement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speaking from personal experience, Lilia?" she quipped, her tone
            biting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia arched an eyebrow, her lips twitching with the faintest hint of
            amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wouldn't you like to know," she replied smoothly, moving her eyebrows
            suggestively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's face twisted in mock disgust. The mental image that flashed in her head
            was like imagining her parents having sex-something she wanted to erase immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Actually, no. Keep it to yourself," she muttered, fake gagging for effect.
            Alice leaned closer, her grin wicked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"For the record-I definitely want to know."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, letting out a dramatic huff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course you do, you little freak," she mocked, shaking her head. She
            flexed her swollen hand slightly and winced as a fresh wave of pain shot through it. "God, I can't
            believe I'm saying this, but get me to the damn hospital. My hand feels like it's about to
            explode."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The humor vanished from Lilia's face, replaced with worry. She stepped back,
            nodding at them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go," she said firmly. "I'll handle everything here."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice and Agatha nodded back, and without another word, they turned and headed toward
            the elevator. As they waited, Alice glanced down at Agatha's hand, her brows furrowing at the sight of
            the swelling and smeared blood.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus-what did you do?" Alice asked, her voice filled with both shock and
            curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elevator dinged, the doors sliding open, and they stepped inside. Alice hit the
            button for the ground floor, her gaze flicking back to Agatha, waiting for an answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned against the elevator wall, her tone dry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I punched Vanguard's head of security in the face," she said, almost
            flippantly. Alice froze, her jaw dropping as her eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You what ?!" she shouted, just as the elevator doors slid shut, sealing
            them inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gritted her teeth as the orthopedic surgeon carefully examined her hand, the
            dull throb of pain intensifying with each subtle movement. The sterile scent of the hospital room and the
            bright overhead lights only added to her growing irritation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Based on your X-rays, you've definitely broken the metacarpals in your
            hand," the doctor said, frowning as he released her hand and gave her a pointed look. "I'm
            going to need to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reset the bones to restore blood flow, and then we'll get you into a cast."
            Agatha huffed, her jaw tightening further.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fuck.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This day just kept getting worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll grab the materials for the cast and get you a prescription for some
            painkillers," the doctor added. "Fair warning-the reset is going to hurt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded mutely, watching as he stepped out of the room. Her gaze flickered to
            the doorway, where Alice stood just outside, deep in conversation with two FBI agents. They were nodding
            along as Alice filled them in, gesturing occasionally to emphasize a point.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had already gone over what had happened at the courthouse in excruciating
            detail, and she trusted Alice to handle the rest. But her stomach churned as she watched the interaction.
            Suddenly, Alice turned at the sound of a voice, and another figure stepped into view-Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha instinctively held her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice and Jen exchanged a few quiet words, their expressions unreadable from where
            Agatha sat. Then, Alice tilted her head toward the room, indicating in Agatha's direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen's gaze snapped toward her, and Agatha froze under the weight of her eyes. It
            was a look balanced precariously between relief-likely at seeing Agatha was okay-and frustration,
            undoubtedly at the situation that had landed her in this hospital to begin with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha braced herself, already expecting the barrage of criticism she knew Jen would
            deliver. Jen took a step toward her, her expression saying that she was about to rip Agatha a new
            one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then she stopped abruptly, her eyes darting down the hallway to her left. Her
            posture stiffened, and for a split second, her eyes went wide before narrowing again and then she turned
            back to Agatha her lips twitching into what could only be described as a pleased smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brow furrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why does she look so smug?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen lifted her hand and gestured toward Agatha, pointing directly at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What the hell?" Agatha muttered under her breath. She had no idea what was
            happening, but then-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood in the doorway, her dark eyes immediately locking onto Agatha like a laser.
            She didn't look happy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be fair, Rio hadn't looked particularly happy when she left this morning
            either, but this was different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was intense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to say something- anything -but the words refused to come.
            She snapped her mouth shut, her mind scrambling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was she supposed to say?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should she apologize for this morning? For now?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or should she just be grateful that Rio even bothered to show up? The silence
            stretched, heavy and suffocating.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, unsurprised by Agatha's floundering, rolled her eyes and let out a loud,
            exasperated sigh before stepping into the room. She moved forward coming to stand beside the bed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stared down at Agatha, her gaze sharp and searching. For a moment, she said
            nothing, her eyes sweeping over Agatha's face, lingering there for a moment. Then, her gaze dropped to
            Agatha's hand-the swollen, clearly broken mess that rested in her lap.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips pressed into a thin line, and she exhaled through her nose, the sound
            quiet but loaded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You mangled my favorite part of your body," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart lurched painfully in her chest. Memories surged forward, of the
            first time Rio had touched her, the way she had traced her fingers over Agatha's hands, massaging them,
            worshiping them like they were sacred.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, her throat tight with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," she said, her voice unsteady, "at least I have
            two."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She raised her uninjured hand and wiggled her fingers weakly, trying for levity,
            though the gesture felt hollow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moved faster than Agatha anticipated, snagging her uninjured hand out of the air
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cradling it gently in her own. Her fingers traced Agatha's palm, mapping the
            lines and curves, her thumb brushing softly over her knuckles. It was intimate and grounding, and it
            made</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Rio finally looked up, the weight of her gaze hit Agatha like a punch to the
            chest. The depth of emotion in those dark eyes was overwhelming-worry, anger, affection, and so much god
            damn love that it felt tangible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you okay?" Rio murmured, her voice so soft it was barely
            audible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared at her, momentarily stunned by the tenderness in Rio's tone. Her
            throat</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">worked, but the words caught. She blinked rapidly, swallowing around the lump that
            had formed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've been better," Agatha admitted quietly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded slowly, her expression unreadable but her eyes softening. It was as if she
            was silently agreeing that she, too, had seen better days. They'd both been through hell-and all of it,
            Agatha knew, was thanks to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you really punch someone at the courthouse?" Rio asked after a beat,
            her tone laced with disbelief and a flicker of curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha grimaced, her lips twitching in a wry half-smile. "Jen didn't tell
            you?" she asked, surprised.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen usually jumped at any opportunity to report Agatha's antics, especially to
            Rio. It was very much a Jen move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shook her head, her dark eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," she said. "But it's all over the office. 'Agatha
            Harkness punched a guy after court.' You know something like that spreads like wildfire. Then the
            Sa-" She paused, clearing her throat as if catching herself. "Security said you were at the
            hospital, so I came right here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't lost on Agatha that Rio had deliberately avoided saying Sam's
            name-like she was trying to avoid the fight this morning-at least for now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio said slowly, her hand intertwining with Agatha's.
            "What happened?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha frowned, her gaze dropping to their joined hands. She squeezed Rio's
            fingers, as if drawing strength from her touch, and exhaled heavily.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It was James Hughes," she admitted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened at the name, recognition flashing across her face.
            "Seriously?" she asked, her voice sharp with alarm.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded grimly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He shoulder-checked me in the courthouse hallway, and then..." She
            hesitated, her throat tightening as the memory resurfaced.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He admitted it, Rio. The mugging wasn't random. He orchestrated it. He was
            trying to kill you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stiffened, her free hand clenching into a fist at her side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And then," Agatha continued, her voice faltering for a moment before she
            pushed on, "he said he'd come after you again."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words burned as they left her mouth, her chest tightening painfully as the weight
            of them settled between them. Agatha squeezed Rio's hand tighter, as if that alone could anchor
            her,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remind her that James hadn't succeeded-that Rio was still here, alive and in
            front of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression darkened, her jaw tightening as her gaze flickered briefly to
            the doorway where Jen and Alice were still deep in conversation with the FBI agents. Her eyes lingered there
            for a moment, her mind clearly working through the implications, but then her focus shifted back to
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated under Rio's sharp gaze, then grimaced, a flicker of something
            almost sheepish crossing her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I may have lost my temper," she admitted. "And... punched
            him."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's sheepishness didn't last long. Her expression shifted as a sly smile
            tugged at her lips, the memory of the moment blooming vividly in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pretty sure I broke his nose," Agatha added, a flicker of pride slipping
            into her tone despite the throbbing pain in her hand. The image of James Hughes's face, contorted with
            shock as blood poured from his nose, replayed in her mind like a highlight reel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn't help but savor it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression shifted, caught somewhere between surprise and the urge to scold
            Agatha for her recklessness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Rio let out a quiet sigh and reached forward, her fingers gently cupping
            Agatha's face. The tender gesture melted the last of Agatha's tension, her shoulders relaxing as she
            leaned instinctively into Rio's touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha-" Rio began.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before she could finish, the door swung open, and the doctor walked in, his arms
            loaded with supplies. He froze mid-step, his eyes widening slightly as he registered the moment he'd
            interrupted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His lips quirked into an awkward smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Uh... ready to get your cast on?" he asked awkwardly, shifting the
            supplies in his arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pulled her hand back quickly, stepping away from Agatha with a subtle clearing of
            her throat. The absence of her touch was immediate, and Agatha had to fight the impulse to reach out and
            grab her hand again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, Agatha let out a huff of frustration, casting a sidelong glance at Rio
            before nodding. "Let's just get it over with."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor nodded, stepping toward a nearby tray and beginning to organize the
            materials with practiced efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Can I stay?" Rio asked, her voice steady but quiet, her gaze fixed on the
            doctor. The doctor barely looked up before nodding.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, of course," he said, his tone matter-of-fact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both Agatha and Rio exhaled audibly, their relief almost comical in its
            synchronicity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha glanced at Rio again, her lips twitching with a faint smile despite herself.
            Having Rio there-despite everything-felt like a balm to the frayed edges of her nerves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor finished setting up his supplies, arranging the splints, bandages, and
            casting materials with well practiced hand. Then he turned to Agatha, moving to stand beside her as he
            gently took her injured hand in his own. His touch was firm but careful, and his fingers began to press
            along her swollen knuckles and radiating pain points.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha winced, her breath hitching at each probing movement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay," the doctor said after a few moments, his fingers pausing on a
            particularly sensitive spot. He lingered there, his touch light but deliberate. "I need to reset the
            fracture. This is going to hurt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled sharply, her shoulders stiffening as she mentally braced herself. The
            pain was already bad- how much worse could it get?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, she felt another hand slip into hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Startled, she glanced down to see Rio's fingers entwined with her own. Rio's
            dark eyes stayed locked on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, a flicker of appreciation cutting through the haze of
            pain and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">frustration. She looked back up at the doctor, her voice firm despite the knot in her
            throat. "Just do it," she said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor nodded, positioning her hand carefully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll count down," he said, his voice calm, almost soothing. He began
            to count.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Three... two-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he reached one, he pressed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pain shot through Agatha like a lightning bolt, and she let out a sharp hiss,
            gripping Rio's hand like a lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't flinch. She just squeezed Agatha's hand tighter, her thumb
            brushing gently over the back of her knuckles.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Agatha groaned through gritted teeth, glaring up at the doctor.
            "What's the point of counting down if you're not going to go on one ?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doctor didn't even blink, his attention on her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because going on two is better," he said simply, as if it were the most
            obvious thing in the world. "People brace too hard on one, makes it harder to reset
            properly."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, but before she could retort, the doctor pressed one last
            time, setting the bone fully into place. The sharp pain made her hiss again, her grip on Rio's hand
            tightening reflexively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And... done," the doctor said, stepping back and pulling off his gloves.
            "You'll need to keep this hand immobilized for a few weeks. I'll get the cast on now, and
            we'll go over aftercare instructions."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, her body slumping slightly. Her hand still throbbed,
            but at least the worst of it was over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's grip on her hand didn't loosen, and Agatha didn't pull away. She
            looked over at Rio, their eyes meeting for a brief moment that felt like an eternity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thanks," Agatha said softly, her voice barely audible as the lingering
            pain throbbed in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod, her dark eyes meeting Agatha's
            with that quiet intensity she seemed to master. Her thumb continued its soothing rhythm, brushing lightly
            against Agatha's knuckles, grounding her in the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course, my love," Rio murmured, her voice so gentle it almost broke
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, those words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's ' my love ' wrapped around Agatha heart, easing the ache in her
            body far more effectively than anything the doctor could prescribe.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hours later, Agatha and Rio stepped through the front door, the soft click of it
            closing behind them echoing in the quiet house. The nighttime nanny glanced up from the book she was</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reading on the couch, her gaze quickly shifting between Agatha's cast and then
            Rio, both of them clearly new to her. She raised an eyebrow but didn't comment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky went down okay," the nanny said, setting the book aside and rising
            to her feet. "He was, of course, sad you weren't here, and also he kept mentioning someone named
            Rio. But after a couple of chapters of Harry Potter, he was out like a light."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the mention of Nicky asking for Rio, Agatha's eyes flicked to her, and she
            didn't miss the small quirk of Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll leave you to it, Ms. Harkness," the nanny said with a polite nod
            before grabbing her things and heading out the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as the door closed, the silence in the home was deafening. It pressed in on
            Agatha, heavy and suffocating. She made a beeline for the kitchen, heading straight for the liquor.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her movements were awkward, her left hand fumbling to grab the whiskey from the high
            perch had frustration bubbling up inside her. Using her non-dominant hand for something so simple felt
            infuriatingly clumsy, and the ache in her cast didn't help.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could fumble further, she felt fingers at her back, light and steady.
            "Let me do it," Rio said softly, her voice calm and steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, the tension in her shoulders easing as she sagged into Rio's touch
            for a brief moment. She nodded wordlessly and stepped aside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio reached up and pulled down the bottle of bourbon. She grabbed two glasses from
            the other cabinet, her ease in the space so sure and effortless it made Agatha's throat tighten.
            Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">poured a generous amount into each glass, clearly understanding that both of them
            needed this tonight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't hesitate, grabbing her glass, before putting some distance between
            them and taking a long drink. The bourbon burned as it slid down her throat, the sensation grounding her,
            pulling her focus away from the chaos of the day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She caught sight of Rio taking a sip from her own glass, her movements slower,
            more</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">controlled. Rio nursed her drink, her dark eyes thoughtful as they lifted to meet
            Agatha's. Their gazes locked, and neither of them looked away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then finally, Agatha sighed because she had things she needed to say-things she
            needed to own up to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," Agatha said softly, her voice steady but strained as she made sure
            to look Rio in the eye. "I'm sorry about this morning."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw tightened, the muscle flexing just slightly-a small but telling sign
            that the fight from this morning still lingered, tender and unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't respond.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't say it was okay-because it wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Agatha had said wasn't okay, and they both knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, Rio stood silently, her dark eyes fixed on Agatha, giving her the space to
            say more. Because an apology, Rio's silence made clear, wasn't going to cut it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, respecting the unspoken demand and hating it all the
            same.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman-this maddening, beautiful, unrelenting woman-was never going to give her
            an inch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Letting out a slow breath, Agatha set her glass down on the counter and leaned back
            against it, crossing her arms over her chest as she tried to figure out where to even start. How did she
            explain herself-explain why she was so damn emotionally stunted?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I've mentioned it before," she started haltingly, her voice quieter
            now. "My childhood. And I'm not trying to make excuses-I'm not. But my mother... she really
            fucked me up."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words came out raw, almost brittle, but Agatha forced herself to keep
            going.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"By the time I was Nicky's age, I knew every form of neglect there was.
            Starved, beaten, degraded..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice faltered, and she let out a shaky breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't have a home, Rio. I had a rotting trailer where survival was a
            daily battle. And love?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a bitter, broken laugh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Love wasn't something I ever received and if you asked my mother-it
            wasn't something I deserved."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze dropped to the counter, the fingers of her good hand tracing the edge
            absently as the vulnerability crept up her chest like an itch she couldn't scratch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Growing up like that- fuck -it changes you," she admitted, her tone heavy.
            "It carves something sharp and hard inside you. And as much as I hate to admit it..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips twisted into a wry, self-deprecating smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Evanora Harkness may have completely fucked me up emotionally-but her cruelty
            is part of what made me the lawyer I am today. It made me ruthless enough to climb higher than</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">anyone thought I could. I didn't care whose body I had to step over to get my
            power. When you grow up powerless... power is everything. And I wanted it. I needed it. And I fucking have
            it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha inhaled deeply, the air feeling thick and heavy in her lungs. The silence
            stretched between them like a chasm, and she knew- knew -that the next words she spoke would either build a
            bridge or send them tumbling into the void that Agatha created this morning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's dark eyes were steady, piercing, and unreadable. It wasn't anger, but
            it wasn't softness either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was patience.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was the one giving her space, and somehow, that made it harder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened, and she had to look away, her eyes falling to her hands-one now
            in a cast, the other trembling slightly. She swallowed hard, trying to gather herself, trying to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">figure out where to start.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And then Nicky came along," she said softly, her voice almost too quiet
            for the room. A bittersweet smile flickered across her lips. "And he cracked something open in
            me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something I didn't even know was still there."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let out a shaky laugh, glancing down the hallway where his room was, her mind
            painting an image of him safe in his bed, his tiny body curled up, lost in dreams-safe and knowing nothing
            but unconditional love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"He's my heart, my every breath. And I've sworn to him-to myself-that
            he'll never know the childhood I had. Never."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the weight of Rio's gaze on her, and it burned. She forced herself to
            meet it, her voice soft but firm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love my son," she said, the words spilling out like a prayer. "I
            love him with every beat of my heart, with every breath I take. From the moment I first felt him move inside
            me, I loved him. Completely. Instantly."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips pressed into a thin line as her thoughts shifted, the warmth in her voice
            cooling into something more vulnerable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That love-motherhood-it came so naturally to me. I didn't even have to
            think about it. He's mine. My blood. It made sense."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat tightened as she reached the place she had been dreading, the place she
            knew she had to go. Her hands shook, and her gaze faltered for a moment before she forced herself to keep
            going to look Rio in the eye as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But with you," she began, her voice breaking slightly, "it's
            different. What I feel for you-it doesn't come naturally, and it doesn't make sense to me. And it
            scares the hell out of me, Rio. It makes me question everything I thought I knew about myself."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, her chest rising and falling as she fought to steady her breathing. The
            words clogged her throat, but she pushed through, her voice trembling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You terrify me, Rio," she admitted, her voice cracking. "You make me
            feel things I've spent my whole life trying to avoid. You're not something I can control. You're
            not something I can predict. And for someone like me... that's the most terrifying thing in the
            world."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tears came then, hot and fast, spilling over before she could stop them. She let
            out a broken laugh, swiping at her face with her good hand, but the tears kept coming.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But you're also the most beautiful thing I've ever had," she
            pushed, voice cracking. "You're my home, Rio. And for someone who grew up thinking a home was
            nothing more than a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cruel joke, you've given me something I never thought I could have. And now that
            I have it, I'm so fucking scared of losing it. Of losing you. "</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She finally looked up, her eyes red and glistening, her heart in her throat.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't know how to love you the way you deserve," she admitted, her
            voice hoarse and broken. "But I want to. God, I want to. And I'm sorry-so fucking sorry-that I
            can't say those words. That I can't-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice cracked, and she exhaled shakily, her hands trembling as she swiped at the
            tears on her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm trying, Rio. I'm trying so damn hard to be what you deserve, but
            I'm so scared. Scared that if I say it-if I admit how much you mean to me-that it'll all fall
            apart."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her shoulders slumped as the weight of her words settled over her, the silence
            between them deafening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sorry," she whispered again, the words barely audible but carrying
            every ounce of her aching regret.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stood still for a moment, her expression unreadable, her gaze steady and locked
            on</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha. Then, without a word, she set her drink down on the counter with a soft clink
            and stepped forward, closing the distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't stop until she was so close that Agatha could feel the faint warmth of
            her body, her presence grounding and overwhelming all at once. Agatha froze, her breath hitching, her heart
            hammering in her chest as Rio reached up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gently, Rio cupped Agatha's face with both hands, her touch impossibly tender.
            Her thumbs moved slowly, swiping away the tears that had been steadily falling down Agatha's
            cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The softness of her touch, the care in the gesture-it broke something in Agatha,
            something fragile and hidden that she hadn't even realized she'd been holding onto.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips parted, but no sound came out. Her whole body seemed to lean into
            Rio instinctively, craving the closeness, the connection, even as the vulnerability in her chest screamed at
            her to retreat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio wasn't retreating. She wasn't walking away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't leaving after hearing how fucking broken Agatha was, how much of a
            mess she'd made of her emotions, of her past, of her own damn heart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that realization hit Agatha like a freight train.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath hitched again, her eyes fluttering closed for a moment as she leaned into
            Rio's touch, her good hand coming up to rest lightly on Rio's hip, pulling her closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Agatha finally opened her eyes, they met Rio's, and the raw emotion she
            saw there almost stole her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't pity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't judgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something so much deeper-understanding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened, and her voice came out as a whisper, trembling and so
            fucking fragile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're still here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into the faintest smile, her thumbs brushing over Agatha's
            cheekbones as she replied softly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're my home too, my love," she murmured, her dark eyes holding
            Agatha's gaze with an intensity that made Agatha's heart stutter. "And I'm not going
            anywhere."</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also that whole scene with Agatha punching James Hughes in the face. That scene has
            been written for like 3 weeks just waiting for this chapter lol</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No ILY, but something close to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hint for next chapter...it will be smutty because words can only heal so much, and
            with Agatha's dominant hand now in a cast...I wonder what "creative" solutions they might come
            up with for Agatha to be able to touch Rio.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well I was able to get this done a day earlier then originally planned. I hope you
            guys enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See the end of the chapter for more notes</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reached up and pulled Rio into a kiss, because God, she needed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All day, the thought had clawed at her-relentless, unbearable -that she had pushed
            Rio too far. That the woman she loved might not come back to her, that she might never feel Rio's lips
            against hers again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio was here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That fact sent a tremor through Agatha, one she couldn't contain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the moment her lips found Rio's, Agatha sighed with relief into her mouth.
            Her grip tightened on Rio's shirt, needing something to hold on to, needing her to hold on to.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kiss wasn't like the others.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips moved against hers with a softness that stole the air right out of
            Agatha's lungs. For a moment, Agatha didn't know how to respond-the tenderness was so unfamiliar.
            This</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wasn't the kind of kiss they typically shared, the ones that burned hot with
            passion and defiance, where they pushed and pulled, each daring the other to surrender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, this kiss was different. It was quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was careful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was filled with something deeper-something fragile, precious, and impossibly
            tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shaky breath into Rio's mouth, as the realization struck. This
            kiss didn't feel like just forgiveness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It felt like healing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every brush of Rio's lips against hers, every slow, unhurried slide of their
            tongues, felt like a careful mending of the fractures Agatha had caused between them. The fight from that
            morning, of course, still lingered like a shadow between them, but this-this kiss-felt like they were
            molding themselves back together piece by piece.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest ached, the weight of it pressing down on her ribs. It was relief
            and longing, regret and hope all wrapped into one, and it was almost too much. She clutched Rio's shirt
            tighter, grounding herself as the kiss deepened, as Rio poured steady reassurance into every movement of her
            mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hands stayed on her face, warm and steady, her thumbs still brushing
            lightly against Agatha's tear-stained cheeks as though to remind her: I'm here. I'm not
            leaving.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for a few moments, they stayed like that-pressed close kissing gently. Rio held
            her like she was something precious, something breakable. It was soft, tender, and everything Agatha
            didn't know she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as the minutes stretched on, as Rio's body pressed against her, pinning her
            gently against the countertop, something inside Agatha shifted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She loved the softness. She needed the softness. But now?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now she needed more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because as much as Agatha loved the tenderness, the careful way Rio kissed her, she
            needed the heat, the urgency, the wildfire that had always been them. She needed the spark that burned so
            hot it threatened to consume her entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss as a quiet hum escaped her throat. Her
            hand slid down to Rio's hips, fingers curling into the fabric of her shirt before tugging her
            closer-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">closer -until there wasn't an inch of space left between them. Her good hand
            gripped Rio's hip possessively, her fingers digging in just enough to leave a mark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Please ," Agatha whispered into Rio's mouth, her voice low and
            needy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The effect was immediate. Rio's body tensed for just a moment, as though the word
            had hit her like a physical touch. Then, with a low exhale, she kissed Agatha again, deeper this
            time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a quiet sound again against Rio's mouth-something between a sigh
            and a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">whimper-as the kiss deepened, slow giving way to something hotter. Rio's lips
            moved with more purpose now, coaxing and demanding all at once, and Agatha gave in, meeting her with every
            ounce of pent-up emotion she felt all day.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The heat between them ignited, spreading through Agatha's veins like wildfire.
            Her hand slid up to the back of Rio's neck, fingers tangling in her dark hair as she tugged, needing
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">closer , needing to feel her everywhere .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second she pulled, it was as though the last shred of control Rio had been
            holding onto snapped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hands gripped her tighter, her touch becoming firm, possessive- hungry. Her
            teeth</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">caught Agatha's bottom lip, a sharp bite that had Agatha gasping, before Rio
            soothed it with the slow stroke of her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shivered at the contrast, her knees suddenly weak as Rio pressed her harder
            against the edge of the countertop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bite of the marble dug into the base of Agatha's spine, but she didn't
            care. Not when Rio was kissing her like this, her body fitting against hers perfectly, like she belonged
            there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That familiar coil of want tightened low in Agatha's stomach-the kind of want
            that made her ache to shift their positions, to reverse their roles, to push Rio back against the
            counter</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and take her right here, right now. She wanted to fuck her on every surface of the
            damn house until the only thing either of them could think about was each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Agatha's casted hand shifted instinctively around Rio's back, and-
            damn it -the flare of pain shot through her wrist, a dull throb radiating up her arm. Her fingers-the
            ones</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">she frequently favored to fuck Rio with, were trapped in the cast and a frustrated
            huff slipped out of her mouth against Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio stilled immediately, her body still flush against Agatha's, her breathing
            heavy as she pulled back just enough to search her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What's wrong?" she murmured, her voice rough around the edges.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned in exasperation, letting her head thud lightly against the cabinet
            behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she snapped, holding her casted arm up. "I swear to God, I
            didn't regret breaking my hand on Hughes's face for a second, but now-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips quirked into a crooked smile, despite herself, her hands still
            steadying Agatha at her waist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Second thoughts, Mayweather?" she teased softly, though her gaze stayed
            tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes but couldn't help the corner of her mouth twitching
            upward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Only because now...I have to teach my left hand how to do what my right hand
            just learned."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled lowly, a sound that sent a fresh wave of heat through Agatha's chest
            as Rio leaned in again, her lips brushing against the shell of Agatha's ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're resourceful," Rio whispered, her voice a low hum that curled
            through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back just slightly, her thumb brushing over Agatha's bottom lip in a
            slow, deliberate sweep.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm sure you'll manage."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just a statement-it was a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha met Rio's gaze, and without missing a beat, she bit down gently on
            Rio's thumb, trapping it against her teeth. Her lips curved into the barest smirk around Rio's thumb
            as her tongue flicked out-slow and devastatingly familiar. She dragged the tip of her tongue across
            Rio's thumb with the same curling motion she'd use against Rio's clit, the intention clear- the
            promise undeniable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's breath hitched sharply, her body going taut as her dark eyes flared.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held her gaze, her tongue lingering just enough to provoke- to dare .</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound Rio made was low and feral, something caught between a growl and a moan,
            and whatever restraint had held Rio back shattered in an instant. She ripped her thumb from</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth, and her hands were gripping Agatha's hips, pulling her away
            from the countertop and spinning them around.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Agatha could even catch her breath, Rio had reversed their positions, kissing
            her with a passion that sent sparks racing down Agatha's spine. She didn't relent as she backed
            Agatha down the hallway, their lips never parting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha should have known this was coming-she'd invited it-but it still caught her
            by surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All pure power and untamed energy, like a nuclear reactor, always toeing the line
            between control and implosion, threatening to consume everything in her path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tried to keep up- God, she tried -but Rio was relentless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't until Agatha felt the edge of her bed press into the backs of her legs
            that she realized they were in her bedroom. She didn't even have time to process it before Rio pushed
            her down onto the mattress, the impact while soft, still somehow managed to steal what little air she had
            left.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then before she could even recover Rio was on her-literally on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She crawled into Agatha's lap straddling her without breaking the kiss for even a
            second. Her hands threaded into Agatha's hair, pulling and twisting, guiding her, directing her like
            she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">was something Rio had absolute control over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every pull sent a jolt of electricity through her, and Rio's hips began to move,
            rolling slowly into Agatha's lap with a precision that left her dizzy. Agatha groaned into Rio's
            mouth, her good hand sliding down to grip the curve of her ass, fingers digging in possessively.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The contact earned her a moan from Rio, muffled against her lips but vibrating
            through her chest like a hum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Rio ," Agatha breathed, her voice ragged as Rio's lips finally broke
            away to drag across her jaw.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head tilted back instinctively, her fingers flexing against Rio's body.
            "Fuck."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio pulled back just enough to look at her, her dark eyes hooded and wild, her
            breathing matching Agatha's in its ragged unevenness. A faint smirk curled at the corner of her lips,
            but there was nothing teasing about it-no playful edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something sharper-something that screamed intent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just when Agatha prepared herself to be devoured
            again.        surprisingly Rio didn't move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, Rio just looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha watched as Rio's gaze drifted slowly downward, her eyes trailing over the
            way their bodies were pressed together-her thighs framing Agatha's lap. Agatha could see the flicker of
            thought as it moved across Rio's face, quick and unreadable, but enough to set off something sparking in
            Agatha's chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then Rio looked back up, locking eyes with her, and- God help her -there was
            something devastating in that look. Something that had Agatha's pulse stuttering, a shiver rolling down
            her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could see the words sitting on the edge of Rio's lips before she literally
            bit down on her bottom lip, as if she were physically trying to hold back a thought she couldn't
            contain. And judging by the feral gleam in her eyes, Agatha knew-she just knew -that whatever Rio was
            thinking, whatever Rio was planning, it was something Agatha would never be prepared for.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A wave of anticipation hit her like a punch to the chest, but underneath it, buried
            deep, was the faintest ripple of nervousness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Agatha understood exactly what they were dancing around-what they had been
            circling since the very beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power Rio had when Agatha gave it to her. The control Rio could wield with a
            look, a touch, a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the way Agatha would let her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had only just cracked the surface of this-this thing between them. This dynamic,
            this balance of power that felt so fragile and yet so right . There was so much more to explore, to unearth,
            to lose themselves in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What?" Agatha said finally, her voice unsteady, cracking through the
            silence because she couldn't take it anymore. "Do I even want to know what you're
            thinking?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, a slow, dangerous curve that sent warning bells and heat
            sparking through Agatha all at once. Her tongue worked against the inside of her cheek as her gaze locked on
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't answer right away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, her fingers moved in Agatha's hair, nails grazing against her scalp,
            scratching lightly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-just enough to pull at the strands at the base of her neck. The tug sent a sharp
            jolt down Agatha's spine, the touch as teasing as it was powerful .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned in closer, her lips just a breath away, the heat of her body curling
            around Agatha like a vice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Probably not," Rio murmured, her voice a low, delicious hum that sent heat
            curling in Agatha's stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's throat went dry, her entire body taut beneath Rio's touch.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, she was in trouble.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me anyways," Agatha whispered, the words barely audible, her voice
            betraying the flicker of need and curiosity she couldn't suppress.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio paused, and then she looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't just a glance, or a teasing stare-it was the kind of look that stripped
            her bare. Her breath caught and her pulse pounding in her ears as she held Rio's gaze, unable to look
            away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, without a word, Rio pulled back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The loss of her hands, her warmth, her weight, felt sudden and jarring, like the air
            had been sucked out of the room. And before Agatha could blink, Rio slid off her lap, rising to her feet
            with the kind of quiet grace that made the movement feel calculated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha frowned, her brows knitting together in confusion as she watched Rio
            straighten. And then Rio walked out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't say a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just... left.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, stunned into silence, her mind stuttering to catch up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the hell?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she sat there, still perched on the edge of her bed, listening to the
            distant sound of Rio's footsteps padding down the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, she heard it-the soft creak of a door opening. Her door.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her stomach plummeted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mind started to spiral, confusion giving way to something far
            darker.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was she leaving Agatha?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was Rio seriously leaving her like this, after kissing her senseless, after working
            her up and then- what? -walking away?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio had been right earlier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha did not like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her jaw tightened, anger bubbling beneath the surface as she tried to process what
            was happening. She was seconds away from storming down the hall to demand an explanation when she heard it
            again-the soft thud of Rio's door closing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, footsteps. Steady, unhurried footsteps coming back to her .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed, her pulse quickening as she sat up straighter, glaring at
            the doorway like Rio might appear there just to further test her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there she was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned casually against the doorframe, as if she hadn't just left Agatha
            hanging, her dark eyes locked on Agatha's with a slow, simmering intensity that made her chest
            tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For one long, torturous moment, Agatha was too focused on Rio's face-the faint
            smirk playing on her lips, the infuriating calm in her expression-to notice what she was holding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then her gaze dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught, her mind stalling completely as she zeroed in on the
            object dangling loosely from Rio's fingers at her side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That fucking backpack .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head, that infuriating, devastating smirk deepening like she could see
            every single thought flashing through Agatha's mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well... Agatha didn't hate the idea. Not one bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that didn't mean she was going to let Rio off the hook without a little
            snark.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" So -just to be clear," Agatha drawled, arching a brow as she leaned back
            on the bed, propping herself up on her good arm. She forced a casualness into her tone, trying-and</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">failing-to appear nonchalant. "When you receive a death threat and get forced
            out of your home, your strap-on makes the cut as an essential item?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk widened, wicked and unrepentant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Packed it right next to my toothbrush," she replied smugly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha snorted before she could stop herself, a sound caught somewhere between
            laughter and disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well," Agatha said, her lips twitching into a smirk that didn't quite
            hide the way her pulse picked up. "At least you've got your priorities straight."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't answer right away. Instead, she stepped forward the backpack swinging
            lazily</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">from her fingers as she closed the distance between them. The room felt smaller with
            every step she took-every step building something Agatha couldn't name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or just fucking Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Rio finally reached the bed, she set the backpack down next to Agatha with
            an unhurried ease. But then, instead of saying a word, she reached forward and cupped Agatha's face in
            both hands, tilting her chin up until their eyes met.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath caught in her throat, because Rio's expression
            softened-melting from something teasing and predatory into something so full of love it made Agatha's
            chest ache. It was the kind of look that made her want to reach for Rio and never let go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"With you... always, my love," Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, each
            word carrying the weight of a promise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A shiver ran down Agatha's spine, sharp and all-consuming, as those words settled
            deep- curling into her chest like they were meant to live there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And suddenly, Agatha wasn't laughing anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her throat bobbed as she swallowed, the overwhelming tightness in her chest making
            it</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">almost painful to breathe. She had to look away, dropping her gaze to the backpack
            resting against her legs, afraid that if she met Rio's eyes any longer, her ribs might crack under the
            pressure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers fell away from her face, and Agatha busied herself with playing
            with the zipper pull until she found her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What made you think I wouldn't like this?" Agatha finally asked, her
            voice soft but teasing</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-anything to steady herself. She forced the emotions clawing at her chest back into
            place</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and looked back up at Rio, lifting a brow. "I think the last time we did this- I
            was very much in the 'yes' category for a repeat performance."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smiled-warm, genuine-but there was a flicker of something else beneath it. Was
            that hesitation?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Open it," Rio said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment felt like déjà vu, except this time Agatha wasn't
            bracing herself for what was inside as if disarming a pipe bomb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew what was inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then she sent a hesitant look to Rio- or at least, she thought she knew what was
            inside.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She reached for the backpack, struggling for a moment with her one good hand until
            she managed to work the zipper open. Her brow furrowed as she glanced inside, and then she froze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her brain registered what she was looking at, but it still took her a beat to process
            it. Slowly, she looked back up at Rio, questioning, but Rio just stood there, perfectly still, her gaze
            unwavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled through her nose, glanced back into the bag, and reached inside. The
            black leather straps were familiar, but the dildo -that was new.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gone was the intimidating black silicone Rio had once fucked her with. And in its
            place was something undeniably different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Purple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A striking color that contrasted starkly against the leather harness. It was slightly
            smaller, more approachable in size, yet no less prominent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Agatha could only stare at it, her good hand holding it up as though
            she were trying to reconcile what she was seeing with what she knew . Finally, she looked back at Rio, her
            brow arching despite the tightness that had returned to her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is this because purple's my favorite color?" Agatha asked, aiming for
            nonchalance, but the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smile widened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought you'd appreciate the color," she murmured, her voice low and
            edged with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely had time to quirk an eyebrow before Rio's expression shifted, the
            playful smirk softening into something deeper, something that made Agatha's breath catch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I got it for you," Rio said, her tone steady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simplicity of the statement was its power, and it landed with weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha froze, her breath hitching at the weight in Rio's tone. There was
            something more there-something unspoken yet impossible to miss. Agatha's eyes narrowed slightly as she
            searched Rio's face- waiting- needing her to finish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio held her gaze for a beat longer, steadying herself. Then she took a step closer,
            close enough that Agatha could feel the heat rolling off her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I got it for you..." Rio repeated, her voice low and soft, as though each
            word was carefully chosen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, just long enough for Agatha's pulse to quicken, before she continued.
            "To wear-for me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened and her brain stuttered over Rio's words as they
            sank in. She felt pinned beneath Rio's gaze, her words and gaze almost palpable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her fingers curling tighter around the leather straps as heat
            coiled low in her stomach, sharp and undeniable. The weight of Rio's words lingered in the air as her
            mind scrambled for something- anything . And when all else failed, she leaned into the one thing that had
            always been her armor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Humor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched a brow, her lips curving faintly into what she hoped was a confident
            smirk as she managed with fake offense.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why is mine smaller?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before her smirk returned-slow,
            devastating, and entirely too smug.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought size didn't matter," she teased, her voice dripping with
            mock innocence. "I'm sure you'll make up for it... somehow."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out an incredulous pfft , shooting Rio a pointed glare even as the nervous
            flutter coiled tighter in her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't expecting this . She wasn't prepared.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that, no doubt, was exactly where Rio wanted her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She dangled the harness from her fingertips, staring at it like it might grow teeth
            and bite her before setting it to the side on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't even know where to begin with using something like this... on
            you," she admitted, her voice quieter, a little unsteady.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk softened into something even more dangerous. She stepped closer,
            invading Agatha's space, until their bodies were nearly touching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I just need you to wear it, darling," Rio murmured, her voice a low hum
            that sent shivers racing down Agatha's spine. "I can do all the work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her heart slamming against her ribs as Rio's words curled
            around her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-and then through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, damn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, watching as the realization flickered across Agatha's face, the dots
            connecting one by one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What do you say, Agatha?" Rio murmured, her voice threaded with a
            dark-silky challenge</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-nearly breathless with anticipation. She leaned in close- so close that Agatha could
            feel the heat of her breath ghosting over her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Will you wear that for me... and let me fuck myself on it- on you ?" The
            world tilted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's stomach bottomed out, the weight of Rio's words hitting her with a
            force that stole the air from her lungs. She gripped the leather straps tighter in her hand as if holding
            onto them could somehow keep her grounded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she wasn't grounded-she felt like she was floating with no sense of
            control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened her mouth, tried to summon her trademark wit, the sharp retort Rio usually
            dragged out of her so effortlessly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But nothing came.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Certainly, not with Rio's words lingering in the air like a tangible thing, a
            touch, a promise- something that painted itself across her mind in vivid, intoxicating detail.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heat coiled low and sharp between her legs making her thighs press together
            instinctively.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The image formed in her head with startling clarity-Rio straddling her, moving
            against her, taking what she wanted- Agatha's hand on Rio's hips, holding her steady, guiding her to
            orgasm-holding her after.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck..." Agatha breathed, the word slipping out on a ragged exhale, her
            voice lower than she intended, almost reverent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head slightly, satisfaction flaring across her face like taking
            Agatha's breathless whisper for exactly what it was- acceptance . Her smirk softened into something more
            dangerous, as she let her eyes drift from Agatha's face to the harness still clutched in her
            hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped closer-agonizingly close-her body now brushing against Agatha's
            knees</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">where they bent at the edge of the bed. Slowly, Rio leaned down until her lips
            hovered over Agatha's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We'll get to that , baby," she whispered, the words sinking past
            Agatha's lips and down her throat, like molten heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio straightened just enough to meet Agatha's gaze again, her expression nothing
            short of devastating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But you've got to put it on first."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This fucking woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her gaze locked on Rio's, the air between them crackling
            with tension so thick it felt suffocating. Slowly, her good hand reached up and curled around the back of
            Rio's neck. Her fingers threaded through the soft strands at the base of Rio's neck- just enough to
            tease, just enough to make Rio's breath hitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes, searched Rio's face as she leaned in. She let the silence
            stretch, let Rio feel the weight of the moment that she herself created but also allowed her more time to
            gather her own courage, before licking her lips and finally murmuring softly-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go lock the door."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood in front of the bed, her arms crossed over her chest as if she could
            physically shield herself from the overwhelming awkwardness pressing down on her. This had to be one of the
            most uncomfortable moments of her life-or at least, that's what she told herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then Rio, in her endless ability to disarm, had to open her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Relax," Rio said with a sly grin, reclining casually on the edge of the
            bed. "I'll handle the bottom half. You just focus on the top."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, the dry humor taking the edge off her nerves for half a
            second-until Rio took her words literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't just take over. She owned the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sitting on the edge of the bed, she reached for Agatha, her hands firm but careful as
            she pulled her closer. Agatha stiffened, her skin prickling as the awkwardness returned with the intensity
            of a thousand suns. When Rio's fingers hooked into the waistband of her pants and, without ceremony,
            began sliding them down her hips, Agatha's entire body went rigid.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus Christ," Agatha muttered, half under her breath, her hands twitching
            as though she didn't know whether to stop Rio or help her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, of course, was completely unfazed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't stop, didn't pause, just kept going with the kind of calm,
            surgical precision that should have been illegal in moments like this. Agatha's pants hit the floor,
            quickly followed by her underwear, and suddenly, she was standing there-completely bare from the waist
            down-while Rio reached for the harness on the bed like this was the most normal thing in the world.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It so wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's skin prickled like the awkwardness was a physical force pressing down on
            her, but Rio didn't seem affected by it at all. She moved with purpose, her fingers deftly undoing
            buckles and adjusting straps, her expression focused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then it happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The brush of warm lips against Agatha's hip bone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her breath hitched, the unexpected touch knocking the air clean out of her lungs.
            The</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">awkwardness, the self-consciousness, all of it melted under the heat of that kiss.
            Agatha looked down, her chest heaving, only to find Rio looking up at her with a smirk curling at the edges
            of her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips lingered on Agatha's skin, pressing another kiss just as her fingers
            continued to work at the buckles of the harness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips lingered on Agatha's skin, warm and soft, pressing kisses along the
            curve of her hip. Agatha's breath hitched again when Rio's lips trailed lower, brushing along her
            stomach, her other hip, and then just above her pubic bone. The heat of Rio's mouth against her skin was
            electric, sending sharp sparks shooting up her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Rio, damn her, didn't even pause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers worked with a practiced ease, the cool leather of the straps brushing
            against Agatha's thighs. She murmured softly as she adjusted the buckles, her voice low and soothing, a
            counterbalance to the fire she was igniting with her kisses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This one goes here," Rio said, her words brushing against Agatha's
            skin as she kissed the edge of her stomach. Her fingers slid one strap into place, tugging gently before
            buckling it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this strap," another kiss, just above her thigh, "is going to
            make sure everything stays in place."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a shuddering breath, her hand instinctively reaching out, her fingers
            threading through Rio's hair. She wasn't sure if she was trying to ground herself or pull Rio
            closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe both.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just for the record," Agatha managed, her voice unsteady, "I'm
            not absorbing a single thing you're saying."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled softly against her skin, the sound low and wicked, vibrating against
            Agatha's hip and sending another sharp jolt of heat spiraling through her body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Noted," Rio murmured, her lips brushing the curve of Agatha's hip
            before her teeth grazed the sensitive skin. She bit down gently, enough to have Agatha hissing, her fingers
            tightening in Rio's hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio soothed the bite with her tongue, sending another shiver down Agatha's spine.
            Her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers worked the last buckle with practiced ease, and then she pulled back, her
            mouth and hands falling away. Rio's eyes dropped, taking in the strap now secured between Agatha's
            legs, her gaze dark and feral.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, this should be awkward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It should be awkward as hell, but the look in Rio's eyes-the way her lips parted
            slightly, her chest rising and falling a little faster-had Agatha swallowing hard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio dragged her eyes back up, slowly, purposefully, and smirked when her gaze landed
            on Agatha's still-buttoned white dress shirt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What happened to you handling the top half?" she teased, her voice low,
            warm, and edged with amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha mustered every ounce of composure she had left, glaring mockingly at Rio
            despite the heat coiling low in her belly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was busy trying not to run out of the room," she deadpanned, though her
            lips twitched at the corners.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio snorted at that before leaning back on her hands, propping herself up with a lazy
            grace that was anything but casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just so you know...you running around in your dress shirt, bare-assed, with a
            purple strap bouncing between your legs is now permanently burned into my brain," Rio quipped, her
            smirk widening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes, but her heart raced at the teasing lilt in Rio's tone,
            her good hand moving to her hip in a faux gesture of defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Glad I could leave a lasting impression," she retorted, though the corner
            of her mouth betrayed a smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes glinted as she sat up slightly, her voice dropping into a huskier
            tone. "Oh, Agatha-trust me. You always leave more than an impression on me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hit Agatha square in the chest, her heart stuttering in response.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio tilted her head slightly, a small, knowing smile playing at her lips before she
            stood and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reached for Agatha's hips. In one smooth motion, Rio reversed their positions,
            now standing in front of Agatha while still maintaining control of the moment. Her hands moved to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's shirt, fingers brushing over the fabric as she began unbuttoning it with
            deliberate slowness. It was maddeningly intentional, every movement drawn out as though Rio wanted to savor
            the anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time Rio reached the last button, Agatha's breathing was uneven, her pulse
            a drumbeat in her ears. Rio carefully slipped the shirt from Agatha's shoulders, mindful of the cast on
            her arm, leaving her standing there in nothing but her cream-colored lace bra.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Rio's gaze dropped immediately to her chest-fixated in a way that was
            both</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">endearing and undeniably heated. Agatha might have teased her about it if she
            weren't just as bad. But as Rio's eyes began to roam, mapping the expanse of her skin, the heat
            shifted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's expression changed, her brows knitting together as something flickered in
            her eyes- confusion, then worry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha followed her gaze, trailing down her own arm until she saw it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A bruise, dark and unmistakable, wrapping around her bicep in the clear outline of a
            hand. James Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The memory came rushing back-the way he'd grabbed her in the courthouse hallway,
            his grip hard enough to make her wince. She hadn't even realized he'd left a bruise. At the time,
            she'd been too consumed with rage, too focused on delivering that satisfying punch, and later, too
            distracted by her broken hand to notice anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's jaw tightened, her fingers brushing lightly over the mark. "He did
            this," she said, her voice low and simmering with anger. It wasn't a question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, her hand coming up to Rio's wrist, holding it gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's nothing," she said, attempting to dismiss it, but the way
            Rio's gaze darkened told her that wasn't going to fly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's not nothing," Rio said, her tone sharp pulling her hand from
            Agatha's light grip, before reaching forward and lightly dragging her fingers across Agatha's arm as
            though she could erase the bruise through sheer willpower. "He put his hands on you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio..." Agatha started, her voice softer now, attempting to soothe, to get
            ahead of whatever storm was brewing behind that glare.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's nostrils flared as she let out a sharp, audible breath through her nose,
            cutting Agatha off before she could say more. Her jaw was clenched so tight that Agatha swore she could hear
            her teeth grinding, a sound that made her wince more than the bruise on her arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Rio didn't say anything, her eyes fixed on the darkened mark on
            Agatha's skin. When she finally spoke, her voice was low, controlled, but trembling at the edges with
            suppressed rage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you have any idea how lucky he is that you got to him first?" Rio said,
            her words measured but carrying the weight of a promise-a threat that sent a shiver racing down Agatha's
            spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the sheer ferocity in Rio's tone. She opened
            her mouth to respond, but Rio didn't give her the chance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Rio continued, her eyes snapping up to meet Agatha's, the
            intensity in them making it impossible to look away. "Because if I had been there, if I had seen him
            lay a hand on you..." Her voice trailed off, her hands curling into fists at her sides as she visibly
            tried to reign herself in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio," Agatha tried again, her voice softer now, trying to pull her out of
            the dark place she was clearly teetering on. She reached out with her good hand, her fingers brushing gently
            against Rio's arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio let out another sharp breath, this one trembling as her fists slowly unclenched.
            She looked down at Agatha's hand on her arm, then back at her, her eyes softening just enough to remind
            Agatha of the woman beneath all that fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard, her voice faltering for just a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I can't stand the thought of someone doing that to you. Ever ."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a slow, measured breath, her chest tightening as the memories of just
            days ago came flooding back-the sheer terror, the helpless rage, the image of Rio bleeding, wounded, from
            the mugging-turned-hit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew exactly how Rio was feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The anger coursing through her wasn't foreign-it was all too familiar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reached up, her fingers ghosting over the stitches still healing on Rio's
            brow. Her touch was feather-light, reverent, tracing the edges of the wound.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Trust me, my love," she murmured softly, her voice barely above a whisper.
            "I know exactly how you're feeling right now."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words seemed to pull Rio's attention, her dark eyes softening as they
            searched Agatha's face. Agatha felt the weight of that gaze, the love and worry intertwined with
            something deeper-something primal, protective, and unrelenting. It was the same feeling that had driven her
            to punch James Hughes without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hand came up to cover Agatha's, holding it for a moment before pulling
            it away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment lingered, quiet and charged, until Agatha finally let out a small, genuine
            smile that edged toward a smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now," she said dryly, her voice laced with deadpan humor, "can we
            please get back to the part where you fuck yourself on this ridiculous purple cock now strapped to my
            body?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio froze for half a beat, her eyes going wide with surprise before a laugh erupted
            from her- a real, genuine laugh that echoed through the room, breaking through the tension that had</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weighed them both down. It was warm and bright, and it melted the somberness that had
            threatened to swallow them whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh, my God," Rio muttered, shaking her head as her laughter softened into
            something more private, her dark eyes glinting with amusement and heat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped closer, her smile turning wicked as she reached forward and pressed two
            fingers against Agatha's breastbone, pushing her back with just enough force to guide her. Agatha moved
            willingly, her legs hitting the bed until she was sitting on the edge, staring up at Rio with a raised brow
            that dared her to make her next move.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio met that challenge without hesitation, her gaze darkening as she took a step
            back. And then-without a word-she reached for the hem of her shirt and stripped it off with a fluid
            motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely had time to process that before Rio's hands moved to her waistband,
            shoving her pants down in a motion so quick and efficient it left Agatha momentarily stunned. In the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">span of seconds, Rio was standing in front of her completely bare, radiating
            confidence and power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's mouth went dry.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This woman was fucking beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze swept over Rio's body, lingering on every line, every curve, every inch
            of radiant, flawless skin. But it wasn't just Rio's physical beauty that left Agatha breathless-it
            was the way she carried herself. There was an unapologetic boldness in her stance, a confidence so magnetic
            that it made Agatha's pulse race. And then there were her eyes, dark and locked on Agatha with an
            intensity that felt like a physical touch, pulling her in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's voice came out low, almost pleading, as she murmured- "Come
            here."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't have to say it twice. Rio moved without hesitation, closing the
            distance between them with fluid grace. In an instant, she was in Agatha's lap, straddling her, and the
            warmth of her body pressed against Agatha's own sent a jolt of electricity through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's lips were on hers, the kiss crashing down with all the force of a
            tidal wave. It was wild, consuming, the kind of kiss that demanded everything and gave just as much
            in</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">return. Agatha's arms moved instinctively, wrapping around Rio and pulling her
            closer- needing her- needing this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha claimed Rio's lips in a rough, desperate kiss, her good hand gripping her
            hip with bruising intensity as if anchoring Rio to her. Then, she pulled back, her mouth trailing down
            Rio's jawline, her teeth grazing just enough to pull a sharp inhale from her. Agatha's lips</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">found the curve of Rio's neck, biting and sucking with a ferocity that left no
            room for doubt. Rio didn't seem to mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hips canted forward instinctively, rolling against Agatha and pressing the strap
            perfectly against Agatha's clit. The friction was enough to drag a guttural moan from both of them,
            Rio's sound low and gravelly, Agatha's sharper, edged with need.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That contact ignited something primal in Agatha. The heat in her blood roared to
            life, driving her movements as her mouth slid lower, her lips and teeth finding the swell of Rio's
            breast.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kissed, licked, and bit with precision, the way she knew Rio craved. She
            alternated between soft pulls and sharp nips, drawing out gasps and groans that had Rio trembling against
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Rio hissed, her voice low and reverent, her fingers threading into
            Agatha's hair and holding it up so she could watch. She didn't just want to feel Agatha-she wanted
            to see her, to savor the sight of her mouth working over her nipples, of her lips swollen and red as they
            dragged across Rio's skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hips kept moving, grinding into the strap, sending jolts of sensation
            through both of them. The way she murmured, her words incoherent but full of heat, only spurred Agatha on.
            She closed her teeth lightly around one nipple, tugging just enough to have Rio's head falling back with
            a sharp groan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jesus, Agatha," Rio rasped, her voice shaky and raw, her body arching into
            Agatha's mouth as if she couldn't get enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither ocould Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every sound, every movement, every moan lit her up, and she was determined to give
            Rio and her everything she needed-and more.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's fingers slid away from Agatha's hair, one hand moving with purpose as
            she lifted herself from Agatha's lap. Agatha could feel her breath catch as Rio's hand wrapped
            around the purple silicone, her grip firm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight sent a jolt through Agatha-something unexpected, something primal-that
            settled low in her stomach, coiling tight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait-shouldn't we get lube?" Agatha blurted, her voice
            uncharacteristically shaky. Rio didn't answer with words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she released her hold on the strap and reached for Agatha's left hand,
            guiding it between her legs. The second Agatha's fingers brushed against her, both of them
            groaned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was soaked-so impossibly, undeniably ready-and the realization sent a wave of
            heat crashing through Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, my love," Rio murmured, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha's
            ear, her voice low- dripping with a desire that Agatha could feel against her fingers. "We definitely
            don't need lube."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was enough to make Agatha's head spin and her hand, already poised between
            Rio's thighs, moved instinctively. Her fingers slid through the wet heat again and even with her less-
            dominant hand, she still managed to find enough control to circle Rio's clit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound that spilled from Rio's lips-a soft, breathy mewl-was both
            devastatingly hot and heartbreakingly tender. It struck a chord deep within Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"God, Rio," Agatha murmured, her voice rough, almost breaking under the
            weight of her own desire. Her fingers swirled again, finding just the right rhythm, and Rio's hips
            bucked, pressing harder into her touch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck-Agatha," Rio moaned, her voice raw and needy, before reaching between
            them and grabbing the silicone again. Her movements were unhurried yet commanding, and the sheer control she
            exuded sent a new wave of heat pooling low in Agatha's stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Keep your fingers right there," Rio said, her voice thick with want, her
            words nearly a plea but laced with an undeniable authority. "Can you do that for me, baby?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely had time to nod, her mind spinning, before she felt the pull of the
            silicone harness, the slight shift as Rio adjusted it, aligning it just right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time seemed to suspend, every second dragging out as anticipation coursed through
            her. And she knew she had a choice-a fleeting, dizzying decision.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should she look down and watch as Rio took the silicone inside her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or should she keep her eyes locked on Rio's face, drinking in every reaction to
            Rio taking her?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha chose the latter, her breath hitching as she tilted her head up slightly, her
            gaze locking onto Rio's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And fuck -it was the right choice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's features shifted, her lips parting as her eyes fluttered closed for a
            heartbeat before snapping open again, locking onto Agatha with an intensity that felt almost tangible. Her
            gaze was fire and hunger and something so deeply intimate it threatened to undo Agatha entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Rio rolled her hips-slowly, testing, teasing, taking-Agatha watched the
            cascade of reactions ripple across her face. A sharp inhale, a slight quiver of her lips, a flicker of
            something raw and vulnerable giving way to unrestrained desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was mesmerizing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha forced her fingers to remain, still moving, still working, and the sound that
            tore from Rio's throat-a low, guttural moan-shot straight through her, igniting every nerve in her
            body.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"God, you feel so good," Rio murmured, her voice trembling, and Agatha
            couldn't tear her eyes away. She wanted to memorize every second of this moment, the way Rio's head
            tilted back slightly, her throat exposed, her body arching into Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was intoxicating, overwhelming, and Agatha was utterly, completely undone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio..." Agatha groaned, her voice catching, raw and desperate, as Rio
            moved with precision. The slow, purposeful roll of her hips sent the strap pressing perfectly against
            Agatha's clit, the friction igniting every nerve ending and stealing the air from her lungs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Agatha gasped, her hips arching instinctively, chasing the
            sensation, the overwhelming pleasure blurring the edges of her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's response was instant-a deep, guttural groan that vibrated against
            Agatha's lips as their bodies found a rhythm. Her movements grew more insistent, her hands bracing
            against</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's shoulders for leverage as she ground down, every motion wringing more
            sounds of raw pleasure from them both.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha somehow still managed to keep pace with her fingers, circling-building up in
            pressure and intensity with every roll of Rio's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head tipped back for a moment, her moan spilling into the air, rich and
            unrestrained. " Agatha ," Rio cried, her voice trembling with need, her hips grinding down
            harder.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound-raw, unguarded-was the hottest thing Agatha had ever heard. But the haze of
            pleasure flickered as a thought pierced through.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were going to wake Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio seemed to realize it at the same time. Without missing a beat, she leaned down,
            crashing their mouths together. The kiss was frantic and consuming, Rio's lips muffling her cries, her
            moans, her gasps of pleasure, each sound now swallowed by Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha suddenly became acutely aware of her own orgasm looming closer, like a storm
            gathering on the horizon. She could feel it-a low rumble deep within her, building with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every grind of Rio's hips. The pressure coiled tighter, electric and unrelenting
            but she wasn't going to let go-not yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She needed Rio to fall first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look at you," Agatha rasped, her voice low and rough, thick with desire.
            Her fingers pressed and circled faster, perfectly matching the rhythm of Rio's hips as they rolled
            against her. "So fucking perfect, baby. Taking me so well."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words surprised her-Agatha wasn't usually one for dirty talk. She preferred
            letting Rio take the lead there, savoring the filthy, breathless things Rio murmured into her ear. But
            something about this moment, about the way Rio looked above her, wild and vulnerable all at once, made her
            want to try. To see if her words would have the same effect Rio's always did to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turned out... they did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio whimpered, the sound raw and needy, her head falling forward until her forehead
            pressed against Agatha's. Rio's hips stuttered for the briefest second, as if her body had
            momentarily short-circuited under the weight of Agatha's words, before finding their rhythm again, her
            movements even more desperate than before.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You like this, don't you?" Agatha continued, her voice dipping lower.
            "Feeling me inside you like this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio moaned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she whimpered, the sound high and breathless, her hands gripping
            Agatha's shoulders for stability as her movements grew more desperate, more erratic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're trembling," Agatha continued, her words a seductive purr.
            "You're right there, aren't you, my love?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Please...please...please," Rio pleaded, her voice breaking on the
            syllables, her hips bucking into Agatha almost violently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let go for me," Agatha commanded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers worked Rio's clit faster, circling and pressing in just the way she
            knew would send her over the edge. At the same time, her hips rolled up into Rio's, driving the strap
            deeper, harder, pulling a guttural moan from both of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come for me," Agatha growled, her voice raw and unrelenting. "I want
            to feel you. Let me have it, Rio."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Agatha felt it-the way Rio tensed all at once, her body locking up as her
            orgasm hit her like a tidal wave. The raw cry that tore from Rio's throat was loud- too loud -and Agatha
            reacted on instinct, her hand leaving Rio's clit to curl behind her neck, pulling her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">forward into a kiss. She swallowed the scream that ripped from Rio's mouth, the
            sound vibrating between them as Rio's trembling body collapsed onto her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fell back onto the bed together, Rio's weight settling atop her as Agatha
            worked her hips up, driving the strap deeper, feeling the resistance that wasn't there before.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned into Rio's mouth, her own need teetering dangerously close to the
            edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's hips rolled again, jerky and uncoordinated, rolling back against
            Agatha's in desperate, shuddering movements. Her sighs and moans poured into Agatha's mouth, hot and
            ragged,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">and it was too much-the sounds, the way Rio clung to her, the slick, startling
            wetness-that Agatha was suddenly aware of only heightened every sensation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fuck," Agatha gasped into the kiss, her body arching as the tension
            snapped inside her, sending her spiraling. Her hips stuttered, pressing up hard against Rio as the orgasm
            crashed through her, her cries mingling with Rio's in the heat of their mouths.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio trembled on top of her, her fingers tangled in Agatha's hair, her breaths
            ragged as they both rode the waves of pleasure together. Their bodies moved in sync, trembling and</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clinging, until the last shudders faded into stillness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a long, shaky breath, her head falling back against the mattress as
            Rio slumped against her, warm and soft and utterly spent. For a few moments, neither of them spoke, the only
            sound in the room the unsteady rhythm of their breathing as they came back to themselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's hand lifted, her fingers threading gently through Rio's damp hair,
            her lips brushing a soft kiss against Rio's temple. It was a simple gesture, but it carried a quiet
            intimacy that made Agatha's chest ache in the best way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Rio sighed softly, her body shifting as she sat up. She moved with the
            grace of someone entirely drained, sliding off Agatha's lap and collapsing beside face down on the bed
            with a groan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned her head, her gaze lazily sweeping over Rio's utterly wrecked
            form-her flushed skin, her tousled hair, the rise and fall of her back with every breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha dragged her eyes away, and drifted down her own body, catching the obscene
            amount of wetness glistening on her own stomach and the purple silicone gleaming with evidence of Rio's
            release.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smirked, the teasing lighting up her voice before the words even formed.
            "Well, would you look at that," Agatha drawled.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of Rio's eyes cracked open, narrowing in suspicion as she turned her head
            toward Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk widened, leaning into the taunt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Christmas came early again," she quipped, her grin widening at her own
            audacity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's open eye rolled dramatically before narrowing again, and she let out an
            exaggerated huff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are horrible," Rio muttered, though the corner of her mouth betrayed
            the faintest twitch of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth to deliver what was undoubtedly going to be another smug
            remark, but before she could get a single word out, a pillow smacked her square in the face.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following morning, Agatha found herself sitting on the couch. Still clad in her
            purple silk robe and her hair a mess. She hummed, as her hands cradled a warm mug of coffee</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">emblazoned with the words " Big Witch Energy ." It was a Christmas gift
            from Jen, who had thought herself particularly clever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The couch shifted beneath her as a body slid into the seat next to her. Agatha turned
            and her gaze landed on Rio. She was wearing Agatha's mink kimono robe-the one with a botanical print
            that stopped mid-thigh. And when Rio crossed her legs, Agatha's traitorous eyes</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">followed the movement, tracing the bare expanse of skin exposed. Her mind immediately
            flooded with memories of how soft that skin felt-against her hands, her lips, her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio cleared her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes shot upward, and she froze-caught.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's dark eyes were locked on hers, amusement dancing in them, and her lips
            curved into a slow, knowing smirk as she sipped from her mug-a mug that said "Dissent" in bold
            letters, featuring an illustration of Ruth Bader Ginsburg flipping a double bird.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The look in Rio's eyes told Agatha she knew exactly where Agatha's mind had
            wandered. And suddenly, the warmth blooming in Agatha's chest wasn't just from the coffee.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could say anything, a loud bang broke through the quiet. She jumped,
            startled, as a child's voice rang out in dramatic authority.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I call this family meeting to order!" Agatha sighed, long and
            heavy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, her son had inherited her flair for dramatics.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned her attention away from Rio and toward the dining chair that Nicky had
            dragged into the middle of the living room. He sat perched on it in his Bluey pajamas, holding a bright
            yellow plastic hammer that he was enthusiastically banging on her coffee table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bang. Bang. Bang.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha winced.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There not enough coffee in the world making that sound bearable at 6:00 AM.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky, you're going to dent the table," she said, her tone more
            matter-of-fact than scolding, though she arched her eyebrow in warning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky, in true Agatha fashion, completely ignored her. But he did- by the grace of
            god- set the hammer down. Nicky leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms his blue eyes moving between
            Agatha and Rio with a look so reminiscent of Agatha's own that it was uncanny.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out of the corner of her eye, Agatha saw Rio's lips twitch as a small snort of
            laughter</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">escaped. She masked it quickly, coughing into her mug, but it was too late. Both
            Agatha and Nicky turned sharp, narrowed gazes on her at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sorry-frog in my throat," Rio murmured innocently, though the amusement in
            her eyes betrayed her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a slow sip of her coffee, then gave Nicky an encouraging nod. "Please,
            Judge, continue."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky straightened in his chair, visibly puffing up with importance at Rio's
            acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't decide whether to laugh or roll her eyes at the display. "It
            has come to my attention..." Nicky began, his voice serious.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God help her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kid was six.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Who even talks like that?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...that safety procedures are not being followed," he finished, his sharp
            gaze shifting between Rio's stitched brow and Agatha's casted arm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha barely resisted the urge to groan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second Nicky saw her arm in a cast this morning, he had, of course, been worried.
            But once she'd explained- lied -and told him she fell at work, his concern quickly morphed into the
            complete opposite end of the spectrum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Enter: the family meeting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was no stranger to these meetings-after all, she'd called a few herself to
            talk through big things with him-his diagnosis, the divorce, bad days at school, his favorite tv show being
            cancelled. But she certainly hadn't expected him to pull an uno reverse card and not only schedule one
            for her but make Rio attend as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shot Agatha an amused side-eye as she took another sip of her coffee, clearly
            enjoying every second of this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, already feeling the weight of her son's
            righteous indignation bearing down on her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicky... they were accidents, honey-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her attempt at reasoning was immediately cut off by her son's dramatic
            retort.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When I cut my knee open at the playground this summer, you gave me a whole
            speech on way home about responsibility," Nicky reminded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He leaned forward, his voice shifting into an exaggerated impression of hers.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"' You only get one body, Nicholas-you need to take care of it. '
            Remember that, Mom? Because I do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked at him, a mix of disbelief and begrudging admiration flickering across
            her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">face. The little monster had not only an impeccable memory but also a talent for
            turning her own words into ammunition.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay-yes," Agatha conceded, lifting her hand in mock surrender. "Rio
            and I need to be more careful. And we will be."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nudged her elbow into Rio. "Won't we, Rio?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio to her credit, and Agatha's relief, seemed to wipe all humor off her face as
            she looked at Nicholas seriously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she said with a nod. "My shoes have been tied, and I have been
            carefully watching where I am going."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes narrowed, his small face filled with the gravity of someone twice
            his age as he gauged the sincerity of their statement. After a long, dramatic pause, he gave a single nod,
            clearly satisfied with their pledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shifted, looking ready to climb down from his makeshift judge's chair, but
            Agatha wasn't about to let her six-year-old son walk away with the upper hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had a reputation to uphold, after all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ah. Ah. Ah," she tutted, holding up a single finger and gesturing downward
            in a firm " sit back down " motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky paused, giving her a suspicious look, but plopped back into the chair with a
            huff, crossing his arms over his chest in defiance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Since we're all here," Agatha continued, her tone light but edged with
            that unmistakable</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">mom power , "and since safety procedures seem to be the hot-button topic of the
            day ..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the words hang, savoring the way Nicky's little eyebrows furrowed in
            confusion, before dropping her own version of a hammer down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I think we should discuss the packet of Oreos I found under bed this morning.
            You know, the ones I keep on the top shelf for special occasions?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes went wide, and his mouth fell open in a guilty gasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio immediately covered her mouth with her hand, muffling a laugh that threatened to
            escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Last I checked, your doctor said you were 46 inches tall, correct?"
            continued Agatha. Nicky froze, his confidence faltering for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes-I grew two inches," he answered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ah, yes," Agatha said, her eyes narrowing as she leaned back against the
            couch. "So, tell me, Nicholas-how does a child, even with those extra two inches , reach the top shelf
            that's at least ten feet off the ground?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, savoring the tension, taking a sip of her coffee before setting it back
            down on its coaster with an almost theatrical flourish. Then, she leaned forward, elbows on her knees, her
            gaze locking onto his.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unless, of course," she continued, her voice dropping into a sharp, almost
            conspiratorial tone, "someone thought it was a good idea to climb onto the countertop, then step on top
            of a soup pot-which, by the way, was conveniently left out the following morning as evidence of said
            crime-and then smuggle said cookies into their room in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hmm?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched a brow, her tone sharp as her gaze bore into Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Does standing on the countertop, balancing on a soup pot, sound like following
            safety protocols to you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes widened, panic flickering across his face as he desperately searched
            for an</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">escape route. Agatha didn't miss the way his gaze darted toward Rio, locking onto
            her with a pleading look so pitiful it could have softened stone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio shifted uncomfortably under the intensity of his puppy-dog stare, her once-smug
            smirk dissolving into thin air. The amusement that had danced in her eyes moments ago was now replaced with
            a subtle, wide-eyed plea of her own as she glanced toward Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Help me, " her expression seemed to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a quiet sigh, her lips twitching in mild exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew this game all too well-the power of those big, innocent blue eyes was
            practically weaponized by her son.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Eyes on me, Nicholas," she said firmly, saving Rio from melting under the
            pressure. "Rio can't save you here."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky let out a huff, his little chest rising in exaggerated defeat, but he brought
            his eyes back to Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Anything to say for yourself?" she asked, her brow arching higher,
            savoring the moment as she waited for him to crack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Nicky looked well and truly cornered, his tiny gears visibly turning as
            he weighed his options. Just when Agatha thought she had him backed into a victory, he shot another quick
            glance at Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as son's eyes flickered with confusion before he returned to Agatha,
            his expressions still confused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Umm... five?" he said cautiously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, momentarily stunned by the odd response. Her gaze flickered toward
            Rio, and that's when she caught it-five fingers held up towards him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took her a beat to connect the dots, and when she did, her jaw dropped. She turned
            sharply to Rio, disbelief etched into every line of her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you seriously trying to get him to plead the Fifth?" she demanded, her
            tone hovering somewhere between exasperation and incredulous amusement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked, her cockiness returning in full force.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What's the Fifth?" Nicky asked, his voice full of curiosity.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution," Rio explained
            smoothly, as if she were back in law school. "It protects people from self-incrimination, meaning they
            can refuse to answer questions or provide information that might get them into trouble."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes grew comically wide, his lips parting as he processed this
            groundbreaking revelation. He turned back to Agatha, jabbing a finger in Rio's direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I do that!" he declared triumphantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha groaned, throwing her head back against the couch as Rio erupted into
            laughter, her smirk now a full-blown grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course you do," Agatha muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose.
            " Unbelievable ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha narrowed her eyes at Rio, a warning in her gaze that was met with nothing but
            a small, unbothered smirk. Finally, she let out a resigned sigh, turning her attention back to Nicky.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay-look we're all going to make better choices, okay?" she said
            softly, her tone serious but still maintaining warmth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky looked up at her, his small face thoughtful as he absorbed her words. Then,
            with a serious nod, he repeated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because we only get one body."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened at his words, her heart aching with a pang of
            bittersweet emotions. She remembered those terrifying nights when he was so sick, the fear that gripped her,
            the helplessness. Her eyes flicked to Rio, and another wave hit her-this time, the memory of how close that
            bullet had come.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had come so close to losing them both.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," she murmured, her voice steadier now but still laced with
            tenderness. "We only get one body. So, we need to make sure we protect it. No more unnecessary risks,
            even for</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cookies, okay?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky nodded earnestly, and without another word, he crawled forward and nestled
            himself between the two women on the couch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sorry about the cookies," he said in a small voice, his head dipping
            slightly. "I knew it was naughty."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smiled, her fingers running gently through his hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Next time, just wake me up and ask, sweetheart. I would've let you have
            some."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky nodded, the three of them falling into a comfortable silence for a moment,
            before his head tilted back, his wide eyes gazing up at her curiously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Did you hurt your hand in your bedroom?" he asked suddenly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question, her hand stilling in Nicky's
            hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, honey. I hurt it at work," she said carefully.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oh," Nicky replied, but his little brow furrowed in a way that Agatha
            instantly recognized as dangerous. "I could've sworn I heard banging last night and a loud cry
            coming from your</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">room when I was walking back to my room after I got the cookies."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stiffened, heat rising up her neck. She opened her mouth to respond, but Rio
            was already on her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And on that note," Rio interjected, her voice a little too chipper,
            "I'm going to make breakfast."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She bolted to the kitchen with such speed that her coffee nearly tipped over, and
            Agatha's jaw dropped as she watched her retreat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Traitor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She flicked her gaze down to Nicky, whose curious blue eyes were locked on
            her-waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio didn't tie her shoes and fell again," Agatha blurted, pulling the
            excuse out of nowhere. "That's what you heard."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's eyes went wide.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rio-you said you were being careful!" he called out, twisting around on
            the couch to peer over its back.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the kitchen, Rio's voice rang out, incredulous and dripping with betrayal.
            " Agatha! "</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha feigned innocence, turning her head slowly to look over her shoulder. Rio
            stood there, a frying pan in hand, staring at her like she couldn't believe what she'd just
            heard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shrugged, her expression smug.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Rio... " Nicky sighed shaking his head at her as his little voice adopted
            the same exasperated tone Agatha often used herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned back to Agatha with a serious expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We really need to order her those velcro shoes, Mom."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha grinned, her lips twitching into a full smile as she shot a look at Rio that
            practically screamed take that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Excellent thinking, honey," she said, reaching for her phone and unlocking
            it with a flourish. She handed it to him, the Amazon app already open. "I've got a couple matching
            pairs in the cart. Pick which ones you like for you and her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's face lit up as he grabbed the phone, and Agatha leaned back with a
            victorious smirk, her eyes locking with Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ohh...I like these Marvel superhero ones!" exclaimed Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio narrowed her eyes at her from the kitchen, but Agatha only winked, her grin
            absolutely wicked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky was off to school, leaving the house quiet, and Agatha found herself standing
            in her closet, still wrapped in her purple silk robe. Her makeup was flawless, her hair styled to
            perfection-but the outfit, the pièce de résistance , was still undecided.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today was pivotal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final day of the Vanguard trial, barring any surprises from the FBI leaking their
            evidence to the opposing party. She needed something sharp, commanding, and unmistakably Agatha
            Harkness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze swept across the rows of her expansive walk-in closet, every inch
            meticulously organized with designer clothes hung in neat, color-coordinated lines. Not her doing, of</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">course. Without the help of a professional organizer, the space would look like a
            luxury bomb exploded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Professionally, she was controlled chaos, but personally? She was just chaos.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this closet? It wasn't just a wardrobe-it was an investment. Enough designer
            labels</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">were packed into this space to purchase a chic condo in an up-and-coming
            neighborhood. The least she could do was pay someone to treat them with the respect they deserved.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, as she stared at the array of choices, she felt the stirrings of indecision.
            Power suits, elegant dresses, tailored trousers-all weapons in her arsenal, but none of them felt quite
            right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not for today.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha crossed her arms, her manicured nails tapping lightly against her cast-another
            thing she had to figure out how to hide, scrutinizing her options. Today needed the perfect balance: sharp
            enough to remind everyone in the courtroom who they were dealing with, but not so severe as to give off
            power bitch vibe and spook the jury.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a fine line to walk, but if anyone could do it, it was her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, she felt hands slide over the silk at her waist, and her body tensed
            instinctively before softening as she recognized the touch. She let out a breath she hadn't realized she
            was holding, tension melting away as Rio's hands circled her waist.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The press of Rio's front against her back was grounding, and Agatha practically
            sagged into her, her head tilting to rest on Rio's shoulder. She closed her eyes as Rio buried her face
            in the curve of Agatha's neck, breathing her in deeply.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've been in here for ten minutes," Rio murmured against her skin,
            her voice low and warm, sending shivers down Agatha's spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, the sound soft, almost involuntary, as if Rio's presence had
            unlocked a tightly coiled spring inside her. She barely had a moment to register the relief before Rio's
            lips pressed against her neck, trailing kisses slowly upward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A quiet moan slipped from Agatha's lips before she could stop it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Someone's wound up," Rio teased, her tone dripping with smug
            satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha could practically feel the smirk against her skin, and it only made her huff
            in response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Knock it off," she muttered, though she made no move to step away. If
            anything, her body betrayed her, leaning slightly into the contact as Rio's kisses continued. "I
            don't have time for this. I need to be out the door in twenty minutes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio chuckled, her breath warm against Agatha's neck. "I could get it done in
            two."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't even hesitate-her elbow shot back, landing squarely in Rio's
            ribs. A surprised "oof" escaped Rio as her grip loosened, and Agatha took the opportunity to step
            away, smirking to herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Serves you right," Agatha said over her shoulder, running her fingers
            along the neatly organized rows of designer outfits. She tried to focus, hoping one of them would magically
            "spark joy" in true Marie Kondo fashion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Behind her, Rio chuckled, but the sound quickly faded into a thoughtful silence.
            "Big day today," Rio murmured, her tone softer now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned, her gaze landing on Rio-and her lips twitched with both amusement and
            irritation when she caught sight of the sweatshirt Rio was wearing. Faded gray, slightly oversized, with
            "Harvard" emblazoned across the front in bold lettering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her sweatshirt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nicked it from your dresser," Rio said sweetly. She tugged at the hem of
            the sweatshirt as if staking her claim. "Full disclosure-this is mine now."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched, betraying her. She hated how much she loved seeing Rio in
            her things, how easily it softened her. But, of course, she wasn't about to let Rio know that.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Full disclosure," Agatha countered, arching a brow, "if you ever
            catch me wearing that hideous orange Longhorn sweater from your alma mater, check me into the nearest
            psychiatric facility, because I've clearly lost my mind. Orange-honestly, you look like a walking
            creamsicle, Rio."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shivered for dramatic effect, adding a disdainful flourish with her hand.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a moment later, her mind finally connected the dots. Rio was makeup-free, her
            hair pulled back in a messy bun, and she was wearing sweatpants.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're not going to work today?" Agatha asked, her voice soft but
            hesitant. And of course, Rio caught it immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, the idea of Rio leaving the house today-after everything with James Hughes
            yesterday-had been gnawing at Agatha since the moment she opened her eyes. The thought of her stepping out
            into the world where a very real threat loomed over her made Agatha's stomach churn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worse, Agatha had been ready to let her go, to pretend like she wasn't worried.
            Because she didn't want to fight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not again.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not after yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't want to push Rio away, didn't want to risk saying the wrong thing,
            but gods-this entire situation felt like a lose-lose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Agatha hated losing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," Rio said quietly, her voice pulling Agatha from her spiraling
            thoughts. "I called in."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's breath hitched at that, a mixture of relief and something warmer
            blooming in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You called in?" Agatha repeated, her brow furrowing slightly as she
            tried-and failed-to mask the rush of emotion swelling in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio nodded, closing the distance between them until there was barely a breath of
            space left. Her hands came up to cup Agatha's face, her thumbs brushing softly over her cheeks in a
            gesture so gentle it made Agatha's knees threaten to buckle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jen's letting me work from here," Rio murmured, her voice low and
            soothing. The corners of her lips quirked upward into a smile that was equal parts affectionate and teasing.
            "Figured I'd stick around and make sure someone doesn't overthink herself into a frenzy before
            one of the biggest days of her career."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched, her initial instinct to glare completely undermined by
            the way she leaned into Rio's touch. She knew the look she managed was more petulant than intimidating,
            but she couldn't quite bring herself to care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I do not overthink," she countered, though her voice lacked conviction.
            Rio's brow arched, her skepticism radiating loud and clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've been standing in your closet for the last 10 minutes." "I
            was picking out a statement piece!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's smirk deepened as her hands slid from Agatha's face to encircle her
            waist, pulling her close.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've had three cups of coffee."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pressed her lips together in defiance. "I function better
            caffeinated."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's chuckle was soft, a low hum of reassurance as her hand trailed up and down
            Agatha's back, the touch as steady as the ground beneath her feet. Her dark eyes locked onto
            Agatha's, and in an instant, the teasing gave way to something more profound-a kind of understanding
            that made Agatha's chest ache.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you're trying very hard not to admit you're glad I'm staying
            home," Rio murmured, her voice warm and knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha opened her mouth, a sharp retort at the ready, but it withered on her tongue.
            She hesitated, swallowing the urge to deflect. Instead, she let out a slow breath, the tension in her
            shoulders easing as her gaze softened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am," she admitted quietly, the words slipping free like they had been
            waiting to be said. "Glad, I mean."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hands moved almost instinctively, reaching up to settle on Rio's shoulders.
            Her fingers brushed through the soft baby hairs at the back of Rio's neck before raking gently against
            her scalp. The response was immediate-Rio's eyes fluttered closed, and a quiet hum of approval escaped
            her lips, a sound so content that it made Agatha's heart tighten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you," Agatha whispered, her voice trembling just enough to betray
            the depth of her emotion. "I can't-I didn't want to think-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She broke off, struggling against the weight of what she wanted to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words felt too heavy, too fragile, too much. But Rio didn't need the
            words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned in, her lips capturing Agatha's in a kiss so sure, that it seemed to
            erase every unsaid thought and every lingering fear. The kiss wasn't rushed or frantic-it was steady and
            a reminder of every reason why Agatha fucking loved this woman.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll be safe here," Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, punctuated
            by the tender press of her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll stay put all day. I promise."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hands slid up to cradle Agatha's face as she kissed her again, this time
            firmer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You just focus on the trial," Rio continued, her voice soft but laced with
            conviction, each word a whisper against Agatha's lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"On Brooke."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another kiss, deeper this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"On bringing her family justice."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She kissed her again, this time long and lingering, as though pouring every ounce of
            her strength, her faith, her love into Agatha. When she finally pulled back, Rio's dark eyes burned
            fiercely, her fingers tightening on Agatha's face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And holding those fucking bastards accountable ," she growled, the last
            words pressed against Agatha's mouth like a command and a plea all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's thoughts spiraled as she kissed Rio, her lips moving with a fervor that
            conveyed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everything she couldn't put into words. She had never truly had this
            before-someone who didn't just tolerate the demands of her career but understood it. Someone who
            respected the weight of her work and pushed her to be better-to be relentless.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that Rio-Rio, who loved the law as much as she did, who loved work as much
            as she did-had willingly stayed home today for her, for her peace of mind, it was everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was more than Agatha ever dared to ask for, more than she even knew she
            needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought hit her like a lightning strike, and she surged forward, her kiss searing
            and passionate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kiss wasn't just a thank you. It was a demand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it told Rio everything -that this wasn't going to stop at a kiss.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned against her lips, her hand slipping around Agatha's waist as she
            backed her into the wall of neatly arranged shoes. The soft thuds of toppling heels barely registered
            as</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's robe loosened, Rio's fingers tugging it apart and slipping under the
            silk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought you didn't have time," Rio teased, her voice husky, her
            breath warm against</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips as her hand cupped a bare breast, her fingers squeezing greedily,
            exactly the way she knew Agatha loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gasped, her body arching into Rio's touch, her fingers tangling in
            Rio's messy bun and tugging her closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You said you could get it done in two. Chop. Chop ," Agatha goaded, her
            voice a mix of challenge and breathless need as she tilted her hips into Rio's, her robe sliding further
            from her shoulders, forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's dark chuckle sent a shiver racing through Agatha, her lips brushing against
            Agatha's jawline before murmuring in a low, smoky tone-</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then I better not waste a second."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, Rio dropped to her knees. She grabbed Agatha's leg, her
            fingers firm as she hooked it over her shoulder. Agatha's breath hitched, her chest heaving as she
            looked down, only to catch Rio's a wink-a move that would have been infuriating if it weren't so
            devastatingly hot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any thoughts of irritation dissolved the moment Rio's mouth found her.
            Agatha's head snapped back, her eyes slamming shut as a raw, guttural moan tore from her throat, so
            visceral it startled even herself. The sound of more heels clattering to the floor barely</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">registered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio was right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She only needed two minutes, and as Agatha sagged against the wall, legs trembling,
            Rio stood up, licking her lips with a grin so smug that it made Agatha's head spin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha shot her a glare, just as weak and wobbly like her legs, and she knew
            it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio smirked unapologetically, turning to walk out of the room to give Agatha space to
            collect herself. But then she stopped mid-step, tilting her head as her eyes scanned the closet. She looked
            to her left, then back across the room, her gaze thoughtful. Without a word, she strode across the room and
            plucked a pair of plum-colored pants from their hanger.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked in confusion, still trying to steady her breathing, as Rio moved to
            grab a crisp white button-down that had a jeweled button that secured the collar and then a navy-teal
            blazer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio turned back to her expression neutral as she crossed the room toward
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wordlessly, Rio placed the outfit into Agatha's outstretched arms. Agatha stared
            down at the ensemble, a faint laugh escaping her lips, but Rio wasn't done. Leaning forward, she
            brushed</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">against Agatha-deliberately, of course-and pulled out a pair of sleek navy heels from
            the rack and added them to the pile in Agatha's arms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wear that," Rio instructed, her smirk practically dripping with
            confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped back, her gaze lingering on Agatha for a moment longer, as though
            committing her to memory. Then, she turned and started to walk away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But just as she reached the door, Rio paused.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced over her shoulder, her dark eyes meeting Agatha's, and a
            devastatingly beautiful smile curved her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go get 'em, killer."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The midday courtroom buzz carried an undercurrent of tension as Agatha leaned back in
            her chair, allowing herself a fleeting breath before the next round. She'd put Brooke's parents on
            the stand first thing this morning, their testimony painting a portrait of a loving, hardworking daughter,
            full of life and ambition.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox had pounced on every opportunity to claw at their credibility, treading carefully
            to avoid leaving a bad taste in the jury's mouth being the "big corporate" lawyer bullying
            grieving parents. Her questions were measured, her tone gentle, and while she managed to chip away at the
            edges of their testimony-pointing out that living states away meant they couldn't know
            "everything" about their daughter's life-it wasn't enough to destroy the picture</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had drawn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew better than to underestimate Fox.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every five feet she earned, Fox clawed back four, her counterstrikes as relentless as
            they were precise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a game of cat and mouse, their movements circling the jury like a carefully
            choreographed dance, each word spoken an adjustment, a feint, a recalibration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But for now-for this fleeting moment-Agatha was ahead. She knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Fox knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this morning was just a warm-up. The real battle was about to begin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rose to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We call Harrison Smith to the stand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha and the rest of the court room turned as Harrison Smith walked down the aisle,
            dressed in a sleek blue suit that fit him like a glove. His boyish charm was undeniable, his clean-cut
            features and hesitant smile toward the jury radiating an air of harmlessness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes at the performance. Of course he was
            polished.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course he was perfectly packaged for the jury's sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Madeline Fox ever left the law, she'd make a fortune in dog training. Only Fox
            could take men this dangerous and reframe them as harmless, tail-wagging puppies.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She waited for him to adjust himself in the chair, his hands folding neatly on the
            edge of the stand as though he were posing for a magazine spread. The jury's eyes were on him, already
            softening under the weight of his hesitant smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he finally shifted, his gaze flicking nervously toward Fox, Agatha spoke.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good afternoon, Mr. Smith," she said, her tone polite. She stepped
            forward, her heels</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">clicking sharply against the courtroom floor, commanding attention with every
            movement. Rio after all, picked an amazing outfit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Good afternoon," Harrison replied, his voice smooth, rehearsed-almost too
            perfect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched a brow. Of course it was rehearsed. Everything about him screamed
            preparation, from the suit to the carefully calibrated smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're the head of logistics at Vanguard Industries, correct?" she
            began, her tone deceptively casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes, that's correct," Harrison replied, his smile widening just enough
            to flash teeth. "And you've held that position for, what, three years now?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's right."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You must be quite the standout, Mr. Smith," Agatha said, tilting her head
            slightly. "At thirty years old, already managing such a vital department at one of the country's
            largest defense</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">corporations. Quite impressive."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you," he said, his cheeks coloring faintly in what could have been
            feigned humility.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned gracefully, walking back to the counsel table with her heels clicking
            sharply against the polished floor. She picked up a thick stack of papers, holding them up for the</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">court to see, her expression one of calculated detachment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," she began, her voice calm but pointed, "here is a list of
            every employee currently working at Vanguard Industries."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She allowed the weight of the stack to land audibly on the table, the sound
            reverberating through the silent courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The jury's attention shifted from her to Harrison, who seemed to straighten
            slightly in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"My team," Agatha continued, briefly thinking of Rio and the countless days
            she'd poured into combing through the data, "did some research."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the words hang for just a moment before lifting her gaze back to
            Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Off the top of your head, could you estimate the average age of individuals
            holding leadership positions at Vanguard? Positions equivalent to yours."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison's hesitation was palpable. He blinked once, his jaw tightening just
            slightly as he shifted in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Uh... I'd say somewhere in their... late-thirties or early-forties?"
            he guessed, his voice carrying just a touch of uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a faint smile that didn't reach her
            eyes. "Late thirties," she repeated, her tone almost thoughtful. "Interesting."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She picked up another document from the stack, flipping through it slowly,
            deliberately, as if to prolong the silence just enough to make him sweat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Because," she continued, lifting her gaze again to meet his, "our
            findings indicate that the average age at promotion for your level at the company is actually forty-eight.
            Quite a bit older than your twenty-seven, wouldn't you agree?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, but he nodded slightly.
            "I suppose so," he said cautiously.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And yet here you are," Agatha said, gesturing toward him with an open
            hand, "managing logistics at one of the country's largest corporations, years ahead of the curve.
            Truly</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">remarkable."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox shifted in her seat, her sharp gaze fixed on Agatha, who didn't so much as
            glance in her direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Tell me, Mr. Smith," Agatha said, leaning forward slightly as she clasped
            her hands behind her back. "Do you think your friendship with Brandon Vanguard-your college roommate,
            no less-might have helped accelerate your rise to such an influential position at 27?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom was silent, every pair of eyes fixed on Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I... I don't think so," Harrison said after a beat, his voice tighter
            now. "I'd like to think I earned my position based on merit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let out a soft hum, neither affirming nor denying his statement. Instead, she
            turned, picking up yet another piece of evidence from the arsenal Rio had meticulously prepared for
            her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well see if your merit speak for itself," she said, handing it to the
            bailiff for distribution. The jury leaned forward as they examined the document-authored and signed by
            Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's expression didn't falter, but Agatha saw it-the subtle tension in her
            jaw, the way her fingers tightened on her pen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was about to drop a bomb, and Fox knew it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha held up a sheet of paper, unassuming in its simplicity. She approached the
            witness stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she began, holding the document up for the jury's scrutiny
            before handing it to Harrison, "is one of your logistics reports, correct? Prepared and approved by
            you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison leaned forward slightly, his fingers brushing the paper. He glanced over it,
            his lips thinning into a straight, carefully controlled line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he replied, his tone measured. "That's
            correct."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her expression sharp but feigning curiosity.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why is a senior manager writing reports, Mr. Smith? Shouldn't you just be
            approving them?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question hung in the air like a loaded weapon. Harrison shifted, his discomfort
            flickering across his features for a split second before he masked it with a polished response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I still get my hands dirty with the logistics agents," he answered
            smoothly, his voice carrying just enough humility to sound genuine. "It keeps me aware of any issues
            or</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">bottlenecks my employees might be facing. And, frankly, I think my team appreciates a
            boss who isn't afraid to get into the trenches with them."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, but she could practically feel the smirk
            radiating from Fox across the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Such a good fucking answer. She hated it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a carefully neutral expression, she stepped closer, as if acknowledging the
            response but not letting it derail her momentum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, that's admirable, Mr. Smith," Agatha said smoothly, her tone
            cool, unbothered, though her mind raced ahead to her next move. "I'm sure your employees do
            appreciate it. But tell</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">me-when exactly do you find the time to personally draft these reports? Between
            overseeing an entire department and, as you said, being in the trenches?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison blinked, the faintest flicker of uncertainty flashing across his face.
            "I, uh, prioritize," he said after a beat. "I make time where it's needed."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her expression thoughtful, almost indulgent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course. Prioritization is key in any leadership role. So, if you're
            personally drafting reports, I imagine these must be particularly important. Wouldn't you
            agree?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison hesitated again, his jaw tightening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said carefully. "Important enough to require my direct
            attention."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smiled-a slow, deliberate curve of her lips that sent a ripple of anticipation
            through the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned back to her desk, and reached for the next document. Lilia had it
            ready, sliding it into her hand without missing a beat. Agatha lifted it, holding it up for the jury, the
            dense text and numerous pages clearly visible even from a distance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she began, her voice crisp and commanding, "is one of
            Vanguard's standard logistics reports. You're familiar with these, I assume, Mr. Smith?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison straightened in his seat as she walked toward him, the document extended. He
            took it, his fingers flipping through the thick stack of pages. His brow furrowed slightly as his eyes
            skimmed the densely packed data.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said after a moment, his tone cautious. "It looks like one
            of our standard reports."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha clasped her hands behind her back, giving him a moment before tilting her head
            slightly. "How many pages would you say that is?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison hesitated, flipping to the back before glancing up.
            "Twenty-two."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nodded, stepping closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And would you agree it's fairly detailed? Inventory, dates, itemized costs,
            carrier information-all laid out in exhaustive detail, correct?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said, his voice tightening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned to the jury, her tone shifting to one of conversational
            authority.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a logistics report for a shipment valued at ten
            point three million dollars. Twenty-two pages. Every item accounted for, every dollar
            explained."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She returned her gaze to Harrison, her eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now, Mr. Smith," she continued, "you mentioned earlier that you
            personally draft reports when they're particularly important. Is that correct?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Harrison said again, visibly bracing himself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pivoted, reaching for another document. She held it up, this one noticeably
            thinner, almost flimsy in comparison to the first.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this," she said, her tone sharpening, "is the report you
            personally wrote and signed for a shipment valued at eleven point two million dollars. One page long
            ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She strode forward, placing the single-page document in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat, glancing at the single-page report in
            front of him as if it might offer some kind of escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said slowly, his voice slightly uneven. "But that's
            because-due to the nature of this particular shipment-it was entirely classified. National security
            protocols require us to keep certain details off the logs."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded as though considering his words, but the sharp gleam in her eyes told
            a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">different story. She stepped closer to the jury, gesturing to the two reports she had
            presented earlier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I see," she said, her tone calm but edged with skepticism. "National
            security. Certainly a valid concern for a company like Vanguard. But let me ask you this, Mr.
            Smith."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to face him, her heels clicking with purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"In the 23-page report we reviewed earlier-the one for a $10.3 million
            shipment-there are ten items labeled as 'logistic supplies,' totaling $789,000. The rest of the
            cargo, however, includes meticulously detailed entries: missiles, drones, top-of-the-line surveillance
            gear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each item explicitly listed, down to the model and serial numbers."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let her words hang for a moment, then took a step closer to the witness
            stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would it surprise you to learn that my team"-her lips curved into a faint
            smile as Rio</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">crossed her mind-"reviewed every single logistics report filed over the last
            three years? And that in every single case where Vanguard cited 'logistic supplies' or 'security
            hardware,' they accounted for less than 5% of the reported cargo?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison opened his mouth, but no words came. He hesitated, clearly trying to
            formulate a response, when Fox's voice cut through the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection." Fox's tone was sharp, clipped. "Is counsel
            testifying, or is she going to ask a question?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks barely glanced up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Move it along, Ms. Harkness."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't miss a beat, her smile tightening as she turned back to
            Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," she said smoothly, her voice ringing with quiet authority,
            "the average shipping report for Vanguard contains only 5% classified material. But this
            report"-she pointed toward the single-page document still sitting before him-"claims the entire
            ship's cargo is</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">confidential. Is that correct?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison fidgeted again, his shoulders stiffening as his eyes flicked down to the
            stack of reports Agatha had placed before him. His hand hovered for a moment before reluctantly taking the
            documents.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said finally, his voice barely above a murmur. "That's
            correct."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded slowly, her expression sharp and calculating as she moved back to her
            desk. Lilia was already there, sliding a stack of reports into her hand like clockwork. But instead of
            approaching Harrison immediately, Agatha leaned casually against the table, letting the tension in the room
            simmer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When you select the reports to write, Mr. Smith, do you have certain accounts
            you prefer to manage, or do you simply help wherever your team needs assistance?" she asked, her tone
            deceptively light.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I just help where the team needs help," he said carefully. "So, you
            don't choose?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection-asked and answered," Fox interjected, her voice cutting through
            the room. "Sustained," Judge Marks said firmly. "Move it along, Ms. Harkness."</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned her head slightly, giving the judge a brief nod of acknowledgment
            before pivoting back to Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you believe in luck, Mr. Smith?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A scoff sounded from Fox's side of the courtroom, and Agatha could practically
            feel her opponent bristle beside her. Good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison blinked at the question, clearly thrown.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-I guess so," he said hesitantly, his voice shaky. "I don't know
            if I believe in luck as much as I believe in just... working toward what you want."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk deepened, the predator in her sensing blood. God, he just set
            himself up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"' Working toward what you want ,'" she repeated, her voice slow,
            deliberate, as if savoring the words. She took a step forward and extended her hand toward the stack of
            reports he was now holding.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, tell me, Mr. Smith-would you call it luck that you- and only you -are the
            logistics agent who files reports on the Meridian Star ? The same ship that carries tens of millions in
            'only classified cargo' almost bi-weekly for three years? Or would you say you ' worked toward
            what you wanted ,' ensuring that no one else writes these reports but you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question lingered in the air, each second of silence stretching longer than the
            last. Harrison's throat bobbed as he swallowed hard, his face pale under the weight of the
            courtroom's collective gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His silence spoke louder than any denial could. Agatha didn't need him to
            answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She already had him cornered.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," Agatha began, her voice cutting through the charged
            atmosphere, "were you</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">aware that Brooke Sinclair flagged one of these reports when she noticed the account
            number didn't align with any known accounts, and the 'vague itemization' raised concerns for
            her?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his hands tightening on the edges of the
            witness stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was aware," he admitted, his tone guarded. "She worked in a
            different department than my team, but her supervisor did escalate it to me. I worked with her, and due to
            the confidential nature of the manifest-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha cut in smoothly, her tone cool but pointed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Confidential or not, she flagged the report, didn't she? She raised
            questions about the validity of the account number and the lack of transparency in the
            itemization."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison nodded, though reluctantly. "Yes, she did."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised her eyebrows, leaning slightly against the edge of her table as if
            settling in for a particularly interesting story.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a step closer, her heels clicking deliberately on the floor. "And
            what exactly did you do in response to her concerns?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison hesitated, his jaw tightening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I explained to her that certain logistics details are classified, as per
            company policy. I</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">assured her that the proper protocols were followed and that there was no need for
            concern."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her eyes narrowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You assured her? And did that satisfy her concerns, Mr. Smith?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he replied, a touch too quickly. "As far as I could tell, she
            understood the explanation and moved on."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded slowly, as though considering his response. Then she straightened, her
            posture tightening as her tone took on an edge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And yet, Mr. Smith," she said, stepping closer to the witness stand and
            fixing him with an unrelenting stare, "a week later, Brooke Sinclair flagged another one of your
            reports. This time, she took her concerns directly to James Hughes, didn't she?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison froze for a beat, his mouth opening slightly before he seemed to catch
            himself. "I-I wasn't aware of that."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You weren't aware that she raised her concerns about your report with
            Vanguard's Head of Security?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," he said, his voice wavering slightly. "That wasn't brought
            to my attention." Agatha's lips curved into a small, sharp smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Interesting. Because emails between Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Hughes, obtained
            during discovery, show that she explicitly questioned discrepancies in your report. Would you like me to
            read them for the court?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison's face drained of color. Fox immediately rose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection, Your Honor. This line of questioning is argumentative and
            speculative without proper context."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Overruled," Judge Marks said, his tone measured but firm. "Proceed,
            Ms. Harkness." Agatha held up a printout, her movements deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"In one email, dated five days before her death, Brooke Sinclair wrote, and I
            quote, ' This manifest doesn't align with standard protocols. The vague itemization and missing
            account details are alarming. I believe this warrants further investigation .'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the words hang, her eyes boring into Harrison's pale face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," Agatha said, her voice quiet but icy, "do you still
            believe Brooke Sinclair was 'satisfied' with your explanation?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom fell silent. Harrison sat frozen, his lips parting slightly as if to
            respond, but no words came out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weight of Agatha's question hung in the air, suffocating and inescapable.
            Agatha's gaze didn't waver.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Harrison finally attempted to speak, it was little more than a stammer, his
            carefully rehearsed composure beginning to crack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I-uh, well, I mean-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha took a deliberate step forward, cutting him off smoothly but firmly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," she began, her voice steady and razor-sharp, "in front of
            you, you have over 100 logistics reports, all authored and approved by you for the Meridian Star's
            cargo. However," she paused for effect, letting the silence stretch just long enough for everyone to
            hang on her next words, "you are not the final approver, are you?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison shifted in his seat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," he admitted, his voice barely above a murmur.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"These reports," Agatha continued, stepping closer, her tone growing
            sharper with each word, "typically require two additional signatures-one from a member of senior
            leadership and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">another from security to confirm the contents and approve the course of direction.
            Correct?" Harrison fidgeted, his fingers curling against the edges of the stack before him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her smile razor-sharp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Please read the leadership approval on your report. Pick any one-it doesn't
            matter."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hesitated before reaching for the top report, his hands trembling ever so slightly
            as he flipped to the signature page.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brandon Vanguard," Harrison finally said, his voice cracking just enough
            to betray him. The courtroom fell deathly silent, as though the very walls were holding their breath.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head ever so slightly, her eyes sharp as a blade.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And the security sign-off?" she pressed, her voice calm, almost
            conversational-a stark contrast to the storm brewing beneath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison hesitated, his eyes darting briefly toward Fox, who sat rigid, her face
            impassive yet brimming with restrained fury.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no lifeline for him here, no escape.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"James Hughes," he said finally, the name falling from his lips like a
            stone sinking into dark waters.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mention of that name made Agatha's stomach churn, revulsion crawling under
            her skin. But she didn't let it show-not even for a second. She took a deliberate step forward, her
            heels clicking against the polished floor, the sound echoing like a ticking clock.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"James Hughes," she repeated, her voice quieter now, but no less piercing.
            "The Head of Security at Vanguard Industries. The same James Hughes to whom Brooke Sinclair escalated
            her concerns. Is that correct?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, his discomfort visible
            for all to see. "Yes," he croaked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the admission hang in the air, heavy and damning. She moved to the edge of
            the jury box, her gaze sweeping across their faces, ensuring they felt the gravity of every word
            spoken.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Grab another report," she instructed, her voice steady. "Let's
            see who signed that one." Harrison swallowed hard but complied, pulling another report from the
            stack.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brandon Vanguard and James Hughes," he read aloud, his tone flat but
            strained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't miss a beat. She stepped forward, plucking a random report from the
            middle of the stack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this one?" she asked, handing it to him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Harrison's fingers trembled as he scanned the page. "Brandon Vanguard and
            James Hughes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha raised her eyebrows, her lips curving into a faint smirk. "Let's try
            from the bottom, shall we?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection!" Fox's voice rang out, sharp and tinged with exasperation.
            "This is a waste of the court's time."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned toward Judge Marks with the measured grace of someone who knew exactly
            how to wield the room's attention. Her expression was composed, deliberate, her voice steady yet
            cutting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, I agree. To save the court's time, we will stipulate that all
            123 one-page reports authored and approved by Mr. Smith-each connected to the Meridian Star cargo carrier
            and containing vague classifications such as 'logistics supplies' and 'security
            hardware'-share one undeniable commonality. Every single one bears the signatures of Brandon Vanguard
            and James Hughes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A ripple of murmurs spread through the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mrs. Fox?" Judge Marks prompted, turning his attention to the opposing
            counsel. Fox hesitated, her jaw tightening as she weighed her options.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We will stipulate that for now," she said finally, her voice clipped,
            "but reserve the right to retract pending verification of those signatures."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So stipulated," Judge Marks said with a nod, before turning back to
            Agatha. "Anything else for the witness, Ms. Harkness?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smiled, slow and predatory, the kind that made people sit up straighter,
            bracing themselves for what was coming next. She raised a single finger, her movements precise as she
            pivoted toward Harrison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Just one," she said, her tone deceptively light.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped closer to the witness stand, her eyes locking onto Harrison's.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence in the courtroom was deafening, the tension coiled tight as a
            spring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Smith," she began, her voice low but cutting enough to slice through
            charged air,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"would you say it was luck that Brooke Sinclair died before she could escalate
            her concerns even further? Or would you call it what you just described earlier-' good old-fashioned
            working toward what you want ?'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question hit the room like a semitruck into one of those electric clown cars-and
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">collective gasp from the gallery confirmed it. All eyes turned to Harrison, whose
            face drained of color, his mouth opening and closing as if searching for a response that would not damn him
            further.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection!" Fox's voice rang out, sharp and desperate, with a thin
            veneer of control barely masking her frustration. "Argumentative! Counsel is clearly attempting to
            inflame the jury with baseless accusations."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't so much as blink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she turned to Judge Marks seeing the warning look.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Withdrawn," she said smoothly, though the smirk tugging at the corner of
            her lips hinted that she knew the damage was already done. The words she'd left hanging in the air had
            planted themselves firmly in the jury's minds, like red wine spilled on cream carpet, impossible to
            erase.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No further questions, Your Honor," she added, her tone crisp and biting as
            she cast a final, scathing glance at Harrison Smith before striding back to her table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heels clicked against the courtroom floor, each step radiating a confidence that
            only deepened when she got closer to Fox and Ratcliff.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't need to look back to know she'd rattled her opponent. The
            tension was practically tangible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when she finally did glance over, she was greeted with the sight of Fox
            exchanging hushed words with Ratcliff, her frustration written in every sharp gesture, her mask of composure
            slipping just enough to reveal cracks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time, Agatha saw it. Fox was floundering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was no regaining control here-Agatha was pulling ahead, and Fox knew it.
            "Mrs. Fox, any questions?" Judge Marks prompted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox hesitated, clearly startled, and Agatha felt a surge of satisfaction ripple
            through her. She leaned back slightly in her chair, her smirk widening as Fox glanced at Ratcliff,
            their</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">conversation growing quieter but more visibly strained.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Fox rose to her feet with a forced calm that didn't quite meet her
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No questions at this time, Your Honor," she said stiffly. "We reserve
            the right to recall Mr. Smith after reviewing the reports in detail."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Granted," Judge Marks replied, dismissing Harrison Smith with a wave of
            his hand. "Ms. Harkness, call your next witness."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the victory settle over her shoulders like a familiar mantle, but it
            wasn't without weight. A nervous coil twisted low in her stomach as she straightened, her broken
            hand</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flexing instinctively against the cast as she cleared her throat to call the next-and
            final witness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We call James Hughes to the stand," she announced, her voice steady,
            though the gravity of the moment sent a ripple of tension down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The doors at the back of the courtroom opened, and all eyes turned toward
            them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James Hughes strode down the aisle, dressed in a sleek black suit that did nothing to
            mask the swelling around his nose or the deep bruises under his eyes. Agatha's gaze flicked upward,
            locking onto his face, and she felt the smallest, sharpest thrill.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd done that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A slow, deliberate smirk spread across Agatha's lips as he passed, her gaze
            locking onto his with an intensity that made the tension in the courtroom practically hum.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James Hughes glared back at her, his expression a volatile mix of resentment and
            barely concealed rage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her smirk deepened, her fingers instinctively brushing the edge of her cast-a quiet
            reminder of the satisfying crack that had reverberated through her fist just yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched as James Hughes strode to the witness chair. He settled into the seat,
            his gaze locking onto hers, sharp and defiant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, the courtroom seemed to fade, the air between them charged. And then,
            like a flame sparking in the dark, Rio's words echoed in her mind, steady and sure, filling her chest
            with fire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Go get 'em, killer."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk widened into something lethal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh...she was going to fucking destroy him.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well here it is. The final chapter before the epilogue. I hope you guys enjoy it and

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back slightly in her chair, savoring the moment like the most expensive
            bottle of whiskey she owned. The one that she only broke out for special occasions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James Hughes sat before her, visibly bristling beneath his carefully composed
            exterior, but it wasn't just his discomfort she was savoring-it was the sheer gravity of what this
            moment</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">represented.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James Hughes was so many things to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, she thought Vanguard itself was her ultimate target-her great adversary.
            But when Rio had pulled back the curtain on the company's underbelly, her focus had shifted. Her</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">white whale wasn't Vanguard. It wasn't even Brandon Vanguard or Harrison
            Smith, as much as she'd relished taking them apart piece by piece.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, the real prize, the true puppet master pulling every blood-soaked string, was
            sitting right in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">James. Fucking . Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the beginning, Brandon Vanguard, Harrison Smith, and James Hughes had always
            reminded her of that three-headed dog from Harry Potter-what was it called?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ah yes, Fluffy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Together, they guarded their arms smuggling empire they'd built, the so-called
            "stone" of their operation. But Agatha's gut, that instinct she trusted more than any piece of
            evidence, told her the truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes wasn't one of the heads. He was the brains.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Voldemort of this twisted operation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God-she really needed to stop reading Harry Potter to her son.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now that the metaphor had taken root, she wasn't about to let it go.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, like Voldemort, Hughes had made the ultimate mistake: he'd come for her
            family.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bastard had threatened Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And worse, he had actually tried to kill Rio. But this is where this analogy
            stopped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Agatha wasn't some naive, broomstick-clutching eleven-year-old who
            thought she could take down the ultimate dark wizard with luck and courage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was everything the rumors whispered about her. She was the Witch of Wall
            Street.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was powerful. She was merciless. She was relentless.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And most importantly-she always, always , finished what she started.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved as her nails rapped on the table in a restless movement
            before she stood, smoothing the lines of her plum pants. Her heels clicked against the courtroom floor with
            the precision of a metronome.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Click. Click. Click.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each step drew the jury's attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to face him fully, her gaze locking onto his. And for just a moment, she
            let the silence stretch savoring the tension- the anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, ever so slowly, her lips curved into a predatory smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, Mr. Hughes," she began, her voice just as sharp as her smile,
            "shall we begin?" Hughes just stared at her that flicker of defiance still shining in his
            eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And god , if that didn't send a pleased thrill down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She loved when they thought they could hold their ground against it her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It made tearing them apart so much sweeter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You are the Head of Security at Vanguard, correct?" she asked, her tone
            innocuous, like she was just ticking off a box.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes's jaw tightened. For a moment, she thought he might not answer, but then
            he gave a stiff nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," he said, his voice clipped. One-word answers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Smarter than his peers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she wasn't worried.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just needed to pry him open like a stuck pickle jar-and everyone knew the best
            way to unstick a pickle jar was to slam the lid on the countertop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flickered briefly to his face, taking in the bruises, the swollen nose, the
            undeniable evidence of her fist meeting his face. She resisted the urge to smirk, fighting it back
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">every ounce of willpower.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Time to give him a little tippy-tap on the metaphorical countertop.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The injury to your face looks painful," Agatha said, her voice laced with
            feigned concern, her expression a perfect mask of mock sympathy. "Did you get that at
            work?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words had barely left her lips when the courtroom erupted into motion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection!" Fox shot to her feet, her voice sharp and furious, the word
            echoing off vaulted ceilings like a god damn opera house.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness!" Judge Marks barked, his tone clearly unimpressed. But
            Agatha didn't flinch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even blink.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her focus was singular-locked on James Hughes. His reaction was all she cared
            about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And-there-it-was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched, and his lip curled into a snarl-a visceral,
            unrestrained display of the fury she'd been hoping to bring out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest filled with satisfaction, allowing the evil smirk she was holding
            back to curl slowly and fucking deliberately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted him to see it, to feel it, to know exactly who had just gotten under his
            skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks was most certainly going to rip her apart in a second, but she
            couldn't bring herself to care.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Worth it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every bit of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The jar was officially loosened.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Counsel," Judge Marks said, his tone sharp and scolding. "Bench. Now
            ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned away from Hughes calmly, though the cockiness in her stride faltered
            just slightly under the weight of Judge Marks' glare. As she approached the bench, she caught the soft
            sound of footsteps behind her-Fox, moving to walk next to her. Their shoulders nearly brushed as Fox leaned
            in just enough to murmur under her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have balls, Harkness," she muttered, a hint of reluctant admiration in
            her tone. "I'll give you that."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched, a brief flicker of amusement threatening to break through
            her composed exterior.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was no time to bask in the rare compliment from Madeline
            Fox.        Because like a coin flipped in midair, as soon as they
            reached the bench, Fox's demeanor changed entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," Fox began, her voice brimming with indignation, "Ms.
            Harkness is blatantly baiting the witness. Yesterday's events were to be explicitly kept from the jury
            to not prejudice my client with opposing counsels' baseless accusations. Her reckless disregard for this
            court's instructions is-"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks exhaled heavily, raising a hand to cut off Fox mid-rant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words died instantly, though the heat in her glare remained fixed on
            Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Ms. Harkness ," Marks said, the simmering warning in his tone clear as he
            leaned forward slightly, his gaze locked onto hers. "Let me make myself crystal clear. If you so much
            as hint at yesterday's events again-if you even think about dancing near that line with your clever
            little word games-I will not just fine you, I will hold you in contempt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His voice dropped further, the weight of his words pressing down like a gavel.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And unlike the last time I held you in contempt-you will go to jail," he
            said, his gaze locked onto hers. "And not only that, but I will personally ensure my sheriffs escort
            you to the dirtiest, most uncomfortable cell the great city of New York has to offer."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a slow exhale, he continued, his voice as sharp as ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And, as I'm sure you're aware, paperwork moves slow down there. So
            don't test me, Ms. Harkness. Am I making myself clear?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks's words hung heavy in the air, filled with enough warning and bite to
            make even her pause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was a master at walking the line-no, she fucking lived on it .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That razor-thin boundary where control and chaos teetered, where risk flirted with
            reward. She loved that line, thrived on it, and danced along its edges with a near manic grin. But</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha knew, the line was different for everyone, and for most, she relished in
            finding out what lay on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Judge Marks?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was one of the rare few where crossing the line wasn't a game. With Judge
            Marks, she had no desire to find out what waited on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she nodded, keeping her expression neutral.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I understand, Judge," she said, making sure to lace her tone with just
            enough contrition to be believable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marks studied her for a long moment, his eyes narrowing as if trying to gauge the
            sincerity of her words. The silence stretched between them before he finally leaned back in his chair and
            gave her a curt nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Continue with your questioning, Ms. Harkness. But tread carefully," Judge
            Marks warned.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha gave a nod, her gaze snapping briefly to Fox. She threw her a pointed look as
            they stepped back from the bench. Only when Fox was seated again, Agatha pivoted her focus back to James
            Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes," she began, her voice steady, "what does the Head of
            Security at Vanguard actually do?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes shifted in his seat, his movements stiff, his jaw tightening before he
            answered with a gruff voice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Due to the nature of Vanguard's work," he started, his tone laced with
            well rehearsed</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">authority, "we must ensure that the weapons we create are protected from our
            enemies both internal and overseas. I oversee all surveillance and security at our warehouses. Additionally,
            I ensure that when transporting those weapons-whether by ground or sea-they are safeguarded. That is my job,
            Ms. Harkness. I protect."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched slightly at his choice of words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Protect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What a joke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned forward slightly, her eyes sharpening as she let her next question roll
            out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"To be in such a vital position at Vanguard, one would assume you have some
            experience in law enforcement, security, or the military. Is that a correct assumption, Mr.
            Hughes?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes answered without missing a beat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I was a captain in the Marines. Served 15 years. Retired. I completed three
            tours in Iraq. Special forces."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, her jaw tightening briefly before she forced out the words, her voice
            professional but clipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you for your service, Mr. Hughes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn't acknowledge her thanks-not a nod, not a glance. He simply stared back
            at her, impassive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't mean it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the silence hang for a moment before tilting her head slightly, her tone
            turning curious but no less pointed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When you say special forces, are you referring to a branch of the military
            called a Marine Raider?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The slightest flicker of surprise crossed Hughes's face. It was brief-so brief
            most people wouldn't have noticed-but Agatha did. She knew she'd thrown him off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He swallowed, his Adam's Apple bobbing, before replying. "Yes. For five
            years."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded again, already knowing the answer. It had taken a ridiculous amount of
            favors and no small amount of leverage to unearth that piece of his past. Her government contacts had pulled
            strings she didn't even know existed, and she was certain the debt she owed them now was a ticking time
            bomb waiting to explode.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if you thought Wall Street was filthy, the government? It was a fucking
            cesspool. But it would be worth it in the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes bore into Hughes as she leaned casually against her table.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What does a Marine Raider do, exactly?" she asked, her tone deceptively
            light. Then, without missing a beat, she added, "The unclassified version, of course."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes's jaw ticked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was subtle, but Agatha caught it. He didn't like being cornered, and she was
            dragging him there, inch by inch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A Marine Raider," he began, his voice still gruff but now more measured,
            "is responsible for direct action missions, special reconnaissance, and foreign internal defense.
            We're trained to operate in hostile environments and neutralize high-value targets. Among other
            things."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Among other things," Agatha repeated not for her but for the jury, her
            tone carefully neutral, though her lips twitched in amusement at his vague deflection.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, essentially," she continued, "you're highly trained to assess
            threats, execute operations with precision, and ensure mission success by any means necessary. Would you
            agree with that summary, Mr. Hughes?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shifted slightly, his posture still rigid. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, letting the weight of that admission settle over the courtroom.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And would you say those skills translate well into your current role at
            Vanguard?" she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">asked, her voice smooth, almost conversational, as if she weren't about to tie a
            noose with his own words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, the familiar curl of excitement stirring in her chest-the thrill of
            laying the foundation for her case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was building something here-brick by deliberate brick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn't a criminal case, she didn't need to prove beyond a reasonable
            doubt that James Hughes was responsible for Brooke Sinclair's death. This was a civil case, and all she
            needed was a preponderance of the evidence-a tipping of the scales that suggested her version of</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">events was more likely than his.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha returned to the table, retrieving one of Harrison Smith's one-page
            logistics reports for the Meridian Star. She held it up, letting the jury take in the familiar document
            before turning her attention back to Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you sign all logistics reports, Mr. Hughes?" she asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No," he replied, his voice clipped. "That would be impossible with
            the sheer amount of work we do-I'm only one person. I have lower-level managers who sign
            off."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, taking a few measured steps forward. "So, you don't sign any
            reports yourself?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I didn't say that," Hughes snapped, his words coming out a little too
            harshly before he quickly caught himself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He exhaled, steadying his tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I sign off on our larger-level projects-depending on the cargo or if the
            destination is flagged as hostile."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved faintly, her gaze sharpening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I see. So, your signature indicates a higher level of scrutiny? That a shipment
            is significant enough to require your personal approval?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes nodded stiffly. "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the moment breathe, her silence deliberate as she scanned the jury,
            letting the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">weight of his words hang in the air. Then, she turned her attention back to Hughes,
            the report still in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When a signature is placed on a logistics report," she began, her tone
            thoughtful yet probing, "what does that mean, exactly? What do you and your team evaluate before
            approving a</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">report?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes shifted in his seat, clearly considering his response.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We look at the cargo contents," he said carefully, his voice steady but
            guarded. "We evaluate the destination, assess current threats. We coordinate with the military and the
            Department of Defense to ensure they are aware of our cargo's movement. And we select the best path
            to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ensure the shipment reaches its destination safely."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, her expression composed, though her mind buzzed with precision.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, you're telling this court that every signed logistics report represents
            a comprehensive review-cargo, route, security, coordination with external agencies-all of it?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes," Hughes affirmed, though a faint edge of impatience colored his
            tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perfect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right where she wanted him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned, walking back to her table where Lilia handed her a neatly prepared,
            vividly color-coded diagram that Rio had painstakingly put together. It compared one of the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meridian Star's routes to a standard Vanguard cargo run.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She strode forward with purpose, handing one copy to Hughes while placing another on
            the display for the jury to see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes," she began, as she gestured to the diagram, "on this
            chart, you'll notice two lines across the Atlantic Ocean. The green line represents the Queen's
            Voyager , a cargo ship carrying $11.3 million worth of equipment. All details for this shipment were
            meticulously laid out in the standard 23-page logistics report we reviewed earlier. The ship departed from
            New York on June 7th and arrived at Camp Lemonnier in Africa 15 days later."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, letting Hughes and the jury absorb the clear trajectory marked on the
            chart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Would you consider this route and timeframe typical for a Vanguard shipment of
            this scale?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes glanced down at the chart, his jaw tightening slightly before answering.
            "Yes, that's a standard route and timeframe."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved ever so slightly-a predator circling its prey.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Thank you," she said, her voice cool and sharp. She pivoted slightly, her
            hand now gesturing to the red line on the diagram, that was all over the place on the document.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And this," she continued, her tone hardening, "is the Meridian
            Star's trajectory. A cargo ship carrying $11.2 million in ' classified materials ,' according to
            your one-page report. It departed from New York on April 12th, and arrived at the same
            destination."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused again, this time locking her gaze on Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you notice anything... unusual about this path, Mr. Hughes?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes shifted in his seat, his eyes darting from the diagram in his hands to the one
            displayed for the jury. His jaw worked slightly as he stared at the red line, its erratic path unmistakably
            out of sync with the efficient trajectory of the green line.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's not... standard," he admitted, his voice tight.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her expression carefully neutral. "Not standard.
            That's one way to put it."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took a step closer to the jury, letting the diagram stay in their view.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The Meridian Star's route, as you can see, took nearly double the time of
            the Queen's Voyager to reach the exact same destination-28 days instead of 15."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to Hughes, her eyes narrowing slightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes, can you explain why a ship carrying 'classified materials,'
            requiring such high levels of security and oversight, would take an indirect, erratic path across the
            Atlantic</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ocean, extending its journey by almost two weeks?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes fidgeted, his hand gripping the edge of the witness stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"There could be several reasons for that," he said cautiously.
            "Weather, unexpected logistical changes, ensuring the ship avoided potential hostile
            territories."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let his answer hang in the air for a moment before stepping forward again, her
            heels clicking with deliberate precision.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Interesting. Because according to meteorological records, the weather was clear
            on the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meridian Star's entire route during that time. And Vanguard's own internal
            communications show no mention of logistical changes. In fact..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She returned to her table, picking up a new document with a flourish.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...this internal memo dated April 11th states that the Meridian Star's path
            was pre-approved</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">by security management. Care to guess whose signature authorized that
            pre-approval?" Hughes' jaw tightened, and a flicker of discomfort passed over his face.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yours, Mr. Hughes," Agatha said, her voice sharp. "So, again, I ask
            you-why would you send a ship carrying $11.2 million in 'classified materials' on a route that
            doubled its travel time? Was it really about avoiding potential risks? Or were there... other
            reasons?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox immediately rose to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is clearly speculating!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks raised a hand to Fox but kept his focus on Agatha. "Move it along,
            Ms. Harkness."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She walked back to the table, her heels clicking with a deliberate rhythm, and picked
            up a neatly organized stack of cargo paths Rio had meticulously created for the Meridian Star.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turning back to Hughes, she approached the witness stand slowly, her expression sharp
            but calm, every move calculated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes," she began, holding up one of the diagrams for the jury to
            see, "would it surprise you to learn that the Meridian Star-regardless of date, weather, or
            geopolitical climate-routinely takes two, sometimes three, times as long as a standard cargo ship to reach
            its destination?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes' lips pressed together so tightly they nearly disappeared, his discomfort
            palpable. "Yes," he said after a moment, his voice clipped. "That does surprise
            me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyes gleamed as she set the records down and reached for the stack of
            logistics</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reports authored by Harrison Smith. She lifted them with a deliberate flair, the
            weight of the evidence clear in her posture as she approached him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why would that surprise you, Mr. Hughes?" she asked, pausing just long
            enough to let the tension stretch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"After all..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She placed the stack of reports directly in front of him with a soft thud, her voice
            dropping into something quieter, sharper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You approved the path for every single one."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes' jaw tightened, the faintest flicker of something-panic, perhaps-passing
            through his eyes before he schooled his expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha relished the crack in his composure, knowing she was beginning to pry the lid
            off the jar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped back, letting the jury absorb the weight of her words, before
            continuing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, tell us, Mr. Hughes-why would want the Meridian Star, a ship carrying
            sensitive and classified cargo under your direct approval, to take such an inefficient, erratic
            route?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She folded her arms, her gaze unrelenting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mr. Hughes cleared his throat, his voice carefully controlled as he responded,</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's not standard. But the nature of our work can't always accommodate
            a procedure. Sometimes adjustments are necessary."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a small, calculated smile.
            "But every time, Mr. Hughes? Doesn't that seem... suspicious?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Objection!" Fox shot to her feet, her voice sharp. "Counsel is asking
            the witness to speculate."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha didn't miss a beat. She turned to the judge.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor, Mr. Hughes is a highly trained military professional. He is, quite
            literally, an expert witness in speculation."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The murmurs that rippled through the courtroom were immediate, and Judge Marks raised
            a hand for silence. His eyes narrowed at Agatha, a warning in his gaze, but his tone was even as he
            replied.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'll allow it," he said finally, though his voice carried an edge of
            caution. "But tread carefully, Ms. Harkness."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned back to Hughes, her gaze locking onto his with a sharpness that made
            him visibly stiffen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Answer the question, Mr. Hughes," she said, baiting him. "Using your
            long history in the military and examining intel, doesn't it seem suspicious to you that every single
            route taken by the Meridian Star deviates so drastically from standard procedure?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes hesitated, the tension in the room thickening as he struggled to find a
            response. His lips parted, but no words came immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was getting closer, and she wasn't about to let him wriggle free now.
            Hughes finally exhaled, his jaw tightening as he leaned slightly forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's... unusual," he admitted, his voice measured but strained.
            "But I wouldn't immediately classify it as suspicious. There are many factors that could contribute
            to deviations."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's eyebrow arched.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unusual," she repeated, letting the word hang in the air like a cloud. The
            courtroom was silent, every pair of eyes locked on Hughes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's expression didn't change, though inside, the shift in gears felt
            like sliding a blade under a gap in armor-strategic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her head slightly, her voice calm. "Did you know Brooke
            Sinclair?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes straightened immediately at the sudden change in questioning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, I never met her. But I did read the email that was escalated to me. I was
            just looking into investigating when I found out about her suicide."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha paused, letting his words hang in the room before taking a slow step closer to
            the witness stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, just to clarify for the jury, you're telling us that you never met
            Brooke Sinclair?" "That's correct."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curled into a faint, calculated smile. "Interesting,"
            Agatha said, pacing slowly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped near the jury box, her gaze sharp and calculating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Back to your military background, Mr. Hughes. From what I've learned about
            Marine Raiders, their expertise isn't limited to just protecting assets. They excel in strategic</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">offensives-calculated moves to neutralize threats before they can even become a
            problem. Would you say that's an accurate description?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes exhaled deeply through his nose.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a faint, knowing smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned and walked back to her desk. Lilia was already holding out the flash
            drive, and Agatha took it with a small nod of gratitude before handing it to the courtroom clerk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Could you display this on the monitor, please?" she asked, her tone calm
            but carrying an undercurrent of anticipation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom clerk nodded, moving to the large flat-screen TV bolted to the wall,
            positioned perfectly for the jury and the witness to view. Meanwhile, Agatha leaned against her table, her
            fingers tapping softly on the wooden surface. Her gaze bore into Hughes, who stared back, his expression
            stoic but Agatha could see the flicker of unease in his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh, she was going to bury him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's all set, Ms. Harkness," the clerk said, breaking the
            silence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded her thanks, taking the pointer remote and gesturing toward the screen,
            which displayed a grainy, black-and-white video feed of a quiet, unassuming street. The jury leaned forward,
            their interest piqued, as Agatha stepped closer to the monitor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes, do you recognize this street?" she asked. Hughes scoffed
            lightly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, it looks like any other street."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha nodded, as she picked up an affidavit from her desk, before carrying it up to
            the judge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This," she began, holding the paper aloft for the courtroom to see,
            "is an affidavit signed by Amit Kannan, owner of the Quick Stop market on the corner of Berkley and
            Kline Street, here in New York City. Mr. Kannan attests that the footage was taken by my associate Rio Vidal
            on October 12th."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused, turning slightly to point at the TV screen where the grainy footage of a
            street corner stood frozen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This camera," she continued, "is positioned to capture activity on
            Berkley Street." She paused, turning back to face the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Brooke Sinclair lived on Berkley Street. Her townhome isn't visible in this
            footage, but it's just three houses up from where the camera cuts off. So, anyone walking toward the
            camera would be heading directly toward Brooke Sinclair's home."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pivoted to James Hughes, her gaze sharp and unwavering.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mr. Hughes," she said, her voice soft but cutting, "can you read the
            timestamp in the top- right corner for us?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes squinted slightly, leaning forward. The hesitation was small, but Agatha
            didn't miss it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"July 18th, 2019, 9:13 PM," he said, his voice carefully neutral.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And where were you on July 18th, 2019, at approximately 9:13 PM?" asked
            Agatha. Hughes immediately shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That was over five years ago," he said nearly incredulously. "I
            couldn't say for sure, but I was likely at work."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You work that late?" Agatha asked, her tone almost casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm on call every day, all year round," Hughes replied, his voice
            firm, though the defensiveness in his tone was impossible to miss. "This job keeps me very
            busy."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved, the faintest flicker of a smirk threatening to surface.
            "I'm sure it does," she said almost mockingly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze never wavered from his as she brought up the remote and clicked it. The
            footage on the monitor shifted, zooming in on a black car parked under the dim glow of a streetlamp.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let's talk about that vehicle, Mr. Hughes," she said, her tone
            hardening ever so slightly. "Do you recognize it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He barely looked at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No, I don't recognize it"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you sure?" Agatha pressed, her voice sharper now, though still
            maddeningly polite. "Take your time, Mr. Hughes. It's a very distinctive vehicle-a black Cadillac
            with tinted windows. You're telling me you've never seen it before?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes's lips thinned, but he didn't answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okay then. Let's move on shall we? Keep your eyes on that car, Mr.
            Hughes," Agatha instructed as she fast-forwarded the footage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the screen, the SUV sat unmoving, all night, leaving during the day, and then
            returning every night.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"This vehicle," Agatha continued, her voice slicing through the growing
            tension in the room, "can be seen on this street every night for five consecutive days. All leading up
            to July 23rd</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-the night Brooke Sinclair died."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She paused the footage on the final night. The courtroom was so silent that the faint
            hum of the tv seemed deafening.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then she pressed play again, and the screen moved, and a figure finally emerged from
            the SUV. Their shadow stretched long and ominous across the pavement as they began to walk down the
            street.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha timed it perfectly, and paused the video just before the figure stepped into
            the pool of light cast by a streetlamp.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"When I hit this button," Agatha said, holding up the remote, her gaze
            sweeping the room, "that man will step under the streetlight, and we'll all see his face. You, me,
            the jury-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">everyone ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to Hughes, her stare unrelenting, drilling into him with the force of
            inevitability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So, Mr. Hughes," she said, her voice low and challenging, "I'm
            giving you one last chance. Would you like to change any part of your previous testimony?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hughes didn't answer. He just stared at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face was unreadable but his silence wasn't just damning- it was
            everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then for the first time since he took the stand, James Hughes looked towards
            Madeline Fox.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned watching the look catch-watching the exact moment Fox understood
            what</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that look meant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then suddenly, Agatha watched the realization flickered across Fox's
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence in the courtroom stretched unbearably until the scratch of a chair
            shifting abruptly across tile floor sounded.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your Honor," Fox said, rising to her feet, her voice tight, "the
            defense would like to request a brief recess."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Judge Marks didn't like delays, and the tight set of his jaw made it clear he was
            seconds from denying the request. But Agatha, could already see the writing on the walls.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We have no problem with the request, Your Honor," she said
            smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marks looked at her, surprise flickering across his face, before he sighed
            heavily.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Recess granted," he announced begrudgingly, banging his gavel. "You
            may step down, Mr. Hughes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His gaze flicked between Fox and Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You have twenty minutes."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The courtroom stirred as Judge Marks stood, prompting everyone else to rise.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tension that was left in the room upon his exit was palpable, thick enough to cut
            with a knife.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha returned to her table and sank into her chair beside Lilia, her eyes never
            leaving the scene unfolding across the courtroom. Hughes strode past her, glaring at her while Ratcliff
            immediately intercepted him, leaning in close and speaking in a hushed but urgent tone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Fox was glued to her phone, her posture taut with tension. Her lips
            pressed into a thin, unforgiving line as she glanced sharply in Agatha's direction. Their eyes met for a
            brief moment, and Fox's expression darkened further as she brought the phone to her ear.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yeah...we have a problem..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's voice carried faintly, her words trailing off as she moved toward the door,
            her heels clicking against the floor with uncharacteristic speed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back slightly, arms crossing over her chest as she watched each moment
            of turmoil across the aisle feeding the steady drumbeat of triumph thrumming beneath her skin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You had him," Lilia whispered, her voice cutting through the moment, low
            but insistent. "Why didn't you finish it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned her head slowly, her gaze meeting Lilia's questioning eyes. A smirk
            spread across her face, cocky and full of confidence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You'll see," she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reaching for her phone, Agatha tapped the screen to life needing the
            distraction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">100 unread emails.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">10 messages from Billy about clients. 1 message from Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She opened that one and snorted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Don't fuck it up."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes and then her attention snagged on a different message
            entirely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">1 message from Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand stilled, hovering above the notification. Slowly, she clicked it
            open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So simple, yet-the way they leapt off the screen and settled into her chest felt like
            a punch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers hovered over her phone screen, trembling slightly, before her body seemed
            to move of its own accord.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, the words "I love you too" were typed out in the reply bar, stark
            and waiting. It was right there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she had to do was push send.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thumb hovered over the button, every instinct screaming at her to press. To
            leap.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she couldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her body refused to obey-betraying her as it always did when it came to Rio Vidal.
            Because even her body knew better.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't enough to send it in a text.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't what she deserves. This would be a cop-out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hand dropped from the phone, the message bar glowing on the screen, mocking her
            with its unsent words. She stared at it, the weight of hesitation pressing heavily on her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox's voice sliced through her internal war, snapping her back to reality. Agatha
            blinked, looking behind her to see Fox standing a few feet away from her. The sharp set of Fox's jaw and
            the narrowed focus of her gaze told Agatha everything she needed to know before a word was spoken.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"A word?" Fox asked.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips twitched, half-tempted to quip back, but instead, she turned and
            lightly smacked Lilia on the arm, nodding for her to follow. Lilia gave her a questioning look but obeyed,
            the two of them standing and trailing behind Fox out of the courtroom.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox led them down the hallway with the precision of someone who knew exactly where
            they were going. She opened the door to one of the shareable attorney conference rooms, stepping aside to
            let Agatha and Lilia enter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as they crossed the threshold, Agatha froze for the briefest of moments, her
            sharp gaze landing on the man seated at the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">William Vanguard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Founder and CEO of Vanguard Industries.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the richest-and most dangerous-men in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia faltered beside her, catching herself mid-step, but Agatha didn't break
            stride. She moved forward, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the room. Ratcliff sat at one end of
            the table, his face a blank mask, but the way his hands fidgeted with a pen betrayed his unease.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">William Vanguard, on the other hand, looked perfectly composed. His tailored suit was
            immaculate, his silver hair brushed back with precision, and his steely eyes were locked directly on Agatha
            as though she were the only person in the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox closed the door behind them, and the soft click of the lock seemed to reverberate
            louder than it should have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ms. Harkness," Vanguard said smoothly, his voice carrying the polished
            weight of someone accustomed to being obeyed. He didn't stand or offer a hand-he merely gestured to
            the</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">empty chairs across from him. "Please, sit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smile was laced with mock politeness.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How gracious of you," she drawled, sliding into the chair opposite him
            without breaking eye contact. Lilia hesitated for just a fraction of a second before following suit, her
            gaze darting nervously between Agatha and Vanguard.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox moved to the side of the room, her arms crossed as she leaned against the wall,
            her sharp eyes watching the interaction like a hawk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So," Agatha began, leaning back in her chair and crossing one leg over the
            other. Her tone was casual, almost lazy, but the sharpness in her eyes was unmistakable. "To what do I
            owe the pleasure of this little meeting?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard's lips curved into a small, tight smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I thought it was time we spoke," he said, before giving her a look.
            "Man to man, so to speak."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back in her chair, a low, dark laugh spilling from her lips. The
            audacity of William Vanguard was almost impressive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha just lifted a brow at him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard leaned forward, his fingers steepled on the table before him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am prepared to settle this-privately," Vanguard said, his tone calm and
            measured, the voice of a man who believed he was holding all the cards. "Two hundred million. Here and
            now. And you drop your suit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room went utterly still.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside her, Lilia inhaled sharply, and Agatha could practically feel the tension
            radiating from her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Understandable-if they took the deal, the firm would pocket a seventy-two million
            dollar contingency fee, the largest in its history. But Agatha didn't so much as flinch. Her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">expression remained unreadable, her gaze locked on Vanguard with a searing intensity
            that could have sliced steel.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Two hundred million," she repeated slowly, as though testing the weight of
            the words. Her lips curled into a faint smirk, and she tilted her head slightly, as if considering his
            offer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, she laughed again-low and mocking.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You think this is about money?" Agatha's voice was sharp, precise,
            each word a barb aimed straight for William Vanguard's composure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, mirroring his posture, the faintest glint of malice shimmering in
            her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Do you honestly believe two hundred million is enough to make me walk away?
            After everything your company has done-not just to Brooke Sinclair, but to my family?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The weight of her words hung in the room like a thundercloud, echoing, rumbling, and
            threatening to strike.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard's jaw tightened, his mask of corporate indifference slipping for the
            briefest of moments. He exhaled sharply, his hands flattening against the table as if to steady
            himself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I did not authorize... that ," he said at last, his voice low but firm, as
            if the word alone could distance himself from the atrocities committed under his company's
            banner.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That , of course, being the murder of Brooke Sinclair and the threats made against
            Agatha's family.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"But I am the leader of this company," he continued, his tone
            shifting-hardening . "And I</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">acknowledge that my grandson is involved in this scheme. I want this resolved, Ms.
            Harkness</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-quietly. Efficiently. So I'll ask again: What is it going to take?"</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned back slightly, considering his words, the weight of them and the man
            himself. William Vanguard was powerful, yes, but he was also desperate-a cornered beast trying to salvage
            what remained of his empire.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought made her heart pound, not with fear, but with exhilaration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Let me get this straight," she began, her voice cool, calculated, every
            word dripping with controlled venom. "You want me to name my price so you can sweep this under the rug,
            protect your legacy, and keep your name out of every headline that screams 'murder,'</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">'conspiracy,' and 'corruption.' Is that about right?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard didn't answer, but the slight narrowing of his eyes was all the
            confirmation she needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her head, tapping a single finger on the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you think money is the solution," Agatha said, her voice laced with
            sharp disdain. "That throwing enough cash at me will make me forget the death threats. The attempted
            murder of the woman I love and Brooke Sinclair's blood on your company's hands."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She heard the soft intake of breath from Lilia beside her, and it jolted her. The
            weight of her own words echoed in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woman I love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd said it out loud.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not to Rio, where it belonged, but here-in a room full of adversaries during a
            negotiation. Such a Harkness, move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her chest tightened, but she shoved the thought aside. Vanguard, thankfully, seemed
            oblivious to the revelation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Then tell me," Vanguard said, his voice clipped and controlled, though the
            tension in his jaw betrayed him. "What will it take?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the silence stretch, her eyes narrowing as she searched for the perfect
            response. Her mind replayed a specific statement made by Brandon Vanguard during Fox's cross-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">examination. A smug, offhand comment that had stuck with her like a thorn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned forward, her gaze fixed on William Vanguard, her words deliberate and
            slow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Your grandson and your counsel," she said, her tone almost conversational,
            though the edge in her voice was unmistakable. She paused to flick her eyes briefly to Fox, then back
            to</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard. "They alluded earlier that as a ten-billion-dollar company, three
            hundred and sixty- one million dollars isn't outside the realm of possibility to lose without really
            noticing it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips curved into a faint, calculated smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So," Agatha said, her voice dripping with finality, " just so you
            really feel it -make it three hundred and seventy-two. Even."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room fell into a suffocating silence. Even the faint hum of the overhead lights
            seemed to dim under the weight of her words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha crossed her arms, her body language unshakable, her gaze steady as she waited.
            This wasn't a negotiation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was dictating terms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fox pushed off the wall, throwing Agatha an outraged look. "That is absolutely
            ridiculous-"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard silenced her with a single raised hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Fine ," he said, his voice cold as he moved to stand. "My attorneys
            will draft the agreement."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He paused as he reached Agatha, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. There
            was a begrudging respect etched into his expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood, meeting his gaze head-on. He extended his hand towards her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I mean this with the greatest amount of respect, Ms. Harkness-but I sincerely
            hope our paths never cross again."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha grasped it firmly, her grip steady, her eyes unflinching.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as he moved to pull away, she tightened her hold, just enough to halt him-to pull
            him closer to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Get your people in line, Mr. Vanguard," she said, her voice whispered but
            razor-sharp. "If your attack dog come after me or mine again , I can promise you one thing: our paths
            will</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">cross again. And if you put us on that road-I can assure, I will be the only one who
            makes it to the end. Do you understand?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">William Vanguard's jaw tightened, his expression hardening into a mask of
            reluctant acknowledgment before he gave a single, stiff nod.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's grip on his hand loosened, releasing him. She watched as he turned on
            his heel and strode out of the room, clothing the door behind him.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned back to find Lilia watching her with wide eyes, a faint smile curling on
            her lips- small but unmistakably proud. The sight stirred something unfamiliar and warm in Agatha's
            chest, but she quickly buried it, her focus snapping to the remaining occupants of the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, the gang's all here," she quipped, her tone light and mocking as
            she clapped her hands with exaggerated flourish. "Let's go tell Judge Marks about the agreement,
            shall we?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze landed on Fox and Ratcliffe, both of whom looked less than thrilled.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha arched a brow, her gaze sweeping over them, letting the moment stretch just
            enough to revel in their unease. Then, with a sly smirk, she flicked her fingers toward the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Vámonos ," she said, her tone dripping with wicked amusement,
            before breaking into a delighted cackle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then with her trademark flair, she pivoted sharply on her heel, the movement a
            seamless blend of precision and theatrics, before walking out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped out of the courthouse, the heavy oak doors swinging shut behind her
            with a sharp finality. The crisp evening air filled her lungs as she took in a deep breath, and for the
            first time in years, she felt something close to weightlessness. The burden she had carried for nearly five
            years-Vanguard, Brooke-was finally lifted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was over.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The preliminary agreement was signed, the case dismissed. Justice, albeit quiet and
            purchased, had been served.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Brooke Sinclair's parents had sobbed when she delivered the news of the
            settlement and they accepted the payout without hesitation. But their relief crumbled into heartbreak
            moments later, as the reality settled in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The settlement was proof.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their daughter hadn't taken her own life. She had been killed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard had finally acknowledged what they always knew, even if only in the
            shadows.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha exhaled slowly, letting the chill seep into her bones as she felt Lilia move
            to stand quietly to her side. And with that, Agatha's thoughts turned briefly to the firm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one hundred and thirty-four million dollars richer. The biggest settlement in
            the firm's history.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips quirked into a faint but tired smirk. After a while, Lilia broke the
            quiet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alice and Jen are waiting for us at Bemelmans," she said, her voice light
            but carrying a spark of excitement. "Celebratory drinks are very much warranted."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, that's exactly how she'd celebrate a victory-surrounded by
            admirers, a drink in hand, basking in the glow of recognition. The liquor warming her body, their
            compliments fueling her ego. And if there was ever a case deserving of such a triumph, it was this
            one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as the thought settled, she realized that wasn't what she wanted. Not
            tonight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her mind wandered, immediately, to Nicky's laughter no doubt echoing through the
            house. To Rio likely being the reason behind his laughter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her heart flipped, happy but certain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that wasn't answer enough, she didn't know what was. She turned to Lilia
            with a small, genuine smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rain check on Bemelmans?" Agatha asked, her voice quieter than
            usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the deviation from Agatha's
            typical post- victory routine. But then she really looked at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, of course, she saw it immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia's lips curved into a warm, knowing smile. "Go home, Harkness,"
            Lilia teased gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't stop the smile that crept onto her face-soft, almost bashful. But
            it didn't take long for her to catch herself. She quickly masked the smile with a glare, shooting it at
            Lilia as if to blame her for pulling that reaction out of her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lilia met the mock glare with an infuriatingly knowing smirk that had Agatha huffing
            and walking away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Descending the courthouse steps, Agatha strode toward her town car. Dan was already
            there, holding the door open without a word. She slid inside, settling into the cool leather seat as the
            door closed with a soft, final click behind her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, she didn't move. The weight of the day hung in the air, heavy yet
            strangely cathartic. Slowly, she reached into her purse, pulling out her phone. The screen lit up as she
            unlocked it, her fingers hesitating for a beat before navigating to her messages.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words I love you stared back at her from the text box, still unsent to Rio.
            Dan's voice crackled softly through the intercom.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Where to, Ms. Harkness?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stared down at those words. "Home, Dan. Take me home."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha wasn't sure what to expect when she walked into the house. The lack of
            greeting at the door caught her off guard-odd, considering Nicky was home. She quickly toed off her heels,
            the relief immediate, and shrugged out of her coat, hanging it neatly on the hook by the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The faint hum of the television drifted down the hallway, its volume gradually
            increasing as she moved closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sonya was in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove. She glanced up, her
            expression</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">flickering with surprise at seeing Agatha home so early. But she recovered quickly,
            offering a warm smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha returned it, brief but genuine, before heading toward the living room.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Peeking over the back of the couch, she spotted two dark heads of hair, both facing
            toward the TV. Her gaze shifted to the screen, and she had to bite back a snort of disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A documentary about bugs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bugs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seriously?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stepped forward, rounding the couch quietly to get a better view, and her
            heart nearly exploded at the sight before her. Nicky was snuggled against Rio's side, practically glued
            to her as they both watched the TV intently. Rio, still wearing Agatha's Harvard sweater, had one arm
            draped casually over the back of the couch, the other resting lightly on Nicky's shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sight hit Agatha like a tidal wave of warmth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's head turned at the sound of her approach, her dark eyes going wide in
            surprise before softening almost instantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hey," she said softly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the sound of Rio's greeting, Nicky's gaze flicked up, his eyes wide at
            seeing Agatha home way earlier than usual. But instead of scrambling off the couch to run and hug her like
            he usually would, he stayed exactly where he was-tucked against Rio's side.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hi, Mom," he said with a big smile before promptly returning his attention
            to the TV, clearly more interested in the documentary than her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shaking her head with a bemused smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bugs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bugs outranked her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She huffed as that she stepped forward and eased herself onto the couch, settling in
            beside Nicky-now sandwiched between his two favorite people. Nicky detached himself slightly from Rio, to
            press himself equally between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha reached out, fingers threading through his dark hair in a motion so familiar
            that he didn't even glance away from the screen. His focus remained on the TV.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I heard about the deal-congratulations," Rio said, her voice low and warm.
            Agatha looked over at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"News travels fast," Agatha replied with a small shake of her head, a soft
            smile tugging at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You win, Mama?" Nicky asked casually, still glued to the television, not
            even bothering to look up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes with exaggerated fondness, her hand gently ruffling his hair.
            "Of course, honey," she said with a mock air of offense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio snorted at that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three of them sat there quietly for a few moments, the only sound the
            narrator's voice on the documentary and the occasional rustle as Nicky shifted against them. Agatha
            sagged into the couch, letting the weight of the day begin to melt away.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But after a while she felt the instinctive urge to touch Rio, and let her hand slide
            from Nicky's hair, her arm draping across the back of the couch. She hesitated for a heartbeat, then let
            her fingers brush against Rio's shoulders, dancing lightly over her skin before moving up to her neck,
            playing gently with the loose strands of her hair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio relaxed into the touch, but her eyes turned to Agatha, locking onto her with a
            quiet, questioning look. Agatha's hand in her hair wasn't unusual-but in front of Nicky?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was something entirely new.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's gaze lingered, her expression asking a silent question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are you sure?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha answered not with words but with a gentle tug on Rio's hair, a small,
            playful pull that drew a smile to Rio's lips. Then, just as easily, her fingers returned to their
            soothing rhythm, combing through Rio's dark strands.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sighed softly, her eyes fluttering closed as she leaned into Agatha's touch,
            contentment radiating from her like a warm glow. They sat like that for a few quiet minutes,
            Agatha's</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fingers threading lazily through Rio's hair, the gentle murmur of a narrator
            discussing some beetle playing softly in the background.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence stretched, peaceful and unbroken, until Rio's voice emerged, carrying
            a weight of quiet curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"How does it feel?" she asked, her words soft. "To finally get them...
            to be done with it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha let the question hang in the air for a moment, her fingers pausing briefly
            before</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">continuing their movements. She contemplated her answer, carefully turning the words
            over in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Honestly, she wasn't sure how she felt about it. For years, she'd envisioned
            this exact moment. She had imagined what it would feel like to take Vanguard down, to win against all odds,
            to come out on top. In her mind, the victory had always been accompanied by a surge of power, an
            intoxicating high that she believed would fuel her for the rest of her career.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, sitting here with Nicky curled between them and her fingers threading
            through Rio's hair, the reality was so different.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vanguard-her white whale, her ultimate victory-felt so insignificant in this
            moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, as corny as it sounded, this -Nicky and Rio, together- with her , this was
            her real win.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha felt the thought settle deep in her chest, warm and so fucking unshakable
            .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze fell to Nicky, nestled comfortably between them, his wide-eyed focus locked
            on the screen. He looked so content, so at ease-so happy. Everything she wanted him to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then her eyes shifted to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, who had taken her by complete surprise. Rio, who had walked into Agatha's
            meticulously controlled life and flipped it upside down like a snow globe, scattering all her carefully laid
            pieces and rearranging them into something far more beautiful, far more</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">chaotic, and yet-far more alive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight as the weight of the question and this moment
            settled over her. She wasn't used to this-to feeling her heart so full it threatened to burst. But as
            she looked at the two of them, her son and the woman she loved, she realized something undeniable.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn't the power she'd chased or the victories she'd stacked like
            trophies.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without fully realizing what she was doing, her fingers slid behind Rio's neck,
            curling gently, and she tugged Rio forward. Rio's eyes widened slightly, but before she could say
            anything, Agatha's lips met hers in a soft kiss, right above Nicky's head.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kiss lingered just a moment before Agatha pulled back, her forehead brushing
            lightly against Rio's. Her heart hammered in her chest, but this time, she didn't hesitate.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you," Agatha whispered, her voice barely audible, yet carrying
            every ounce of truth she felt.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio blinked, utterly still for a beat, as if the world itself had paused. Then,
            slowly, that beautiful radiant smile-the one always made Agatha's heart lurch in her chest-bloomed
            across her face, reaching her dark eyes making them almost glimmer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you too," Rio murmured, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha leaned in, kissing her again, this time softer, as though sealing the words
            into each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ew, gross," Nicky's voice piped up, cutting through the tender
            moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha pulled away abruptly, expecting to see him looking up at them in horror.
            Instead, his eyes remained glued to the television, his hand out stretched and pointing at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Look how many legs that bug has," he exclaimed, scrunching up his nose in
            exaggerated disgust.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha turned toward the screen, her own nose wrinkling at the sight of a massive,
            multi- legged creature crawling across it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shivered too, because he was right-that was disgusting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"That's eumillipes persephone, " Rio said smoothly, beating the
            narrator to the punch. "It has the most legs of any known animal-up to 1,306."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha rolled her eyes fondly because-of course, Rio would know that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze drifted to Rio, who watched the alien-like bug crawl across the screen with
            genuine interest, her brow slightly furrowed in concentration. There was something so quintessentially Rio
            about it-her effortless intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved into a smile, unbidden and warm. A familiar feeling
            blossomed in her chest, spreading outward like sunlight breaking through the clouds.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She recognized it now, clearly and unreservedly: her love for Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mama," Nicky said, pulling her attention away from Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha looked down to find him staring up at her with that soul-piercing blue eyes of
            his. He reached up, his small hand brushing her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're smiling," he said so innocently, yet so yet profound.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's chest tightened at his words-and at the gentle touch of his small
            fingers tracing the faint lines on her face. Lines that had she was more than aware had grown more defined
            lately, not from stress or worry, but from the sheer amount of smiling she'd been doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze flicked upward to the woman in question, who was watching the interaction
            with an expression so achingly soft it made Agatha's breath catch in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha swallowed hard, shifting her attention back to Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today had already been full of admissions she never thought she'd voice, but this
            one came more easily. It felt natural, as though saying I love you had opened some hidden door inside her,
            one that now let all her vulnerable truths flow freely.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's because I'm happy, baby," Agatha said, her voice soft and
            tender.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nicky's face lit up at that, his thumb gently tracing the curve of her smile as
            if committing it to memory.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I like it when you smile, Mama. It's my favorite," he said with
            childlike certainty. Agatha's gaze lifted to Rio, who was watching the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Rio's hand came up to cover hers. "Mine too," she
            murmured in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's heart swelled, her fingers tightening around Rio's as she glanced
            back at Nicky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had spent her life chasing power-commanding boardrooms, conquering courtrooms,
            bending the will of some of the most powerful men in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Power had been her fuel, her purpose, her identity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, sitting here with Rio's hand in hers, Nicky tucked close, she realized:
            this was power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not the fleeting, transactional power of deals and victories, but something deeper,
            something enduring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be loved.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To build a life that was hers undeniably hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers squeezed Rio's again, and she smiled softly, feeling the warmth of it
            spread through her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mine too," Agatha echoed, her words reverberating out of her mouth with a
            newfound strength, a quiet, undeniable certainty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was in that moment, surrounded by the family she never thought she deserved,
            Agatha Harkness-the Witch of Wall Street-realized she had finally found the one thing she had been chasing
            all her life.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">True power.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And God-she felt invincible.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wow. Honestly, I can't believe its over. This journey has been nothing short of
            incredible. Thank you to all the kudos and comments, they have truly fueled me to write.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Epilogue is already planned and will be a 2 year jump into the future. I am
            hoping to get it up before the new year, but we will see. Once again, thank you all so much</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">:)With her trademark flair, she pivoted sharply on her heel, the movement a seamless
            blend of precision and theatrics, and swept out of the room with purpose.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This epilogue practically wrote itself. Tonight, I found myself with an unexpected
            gift- time. With my wife out for drinks and child at a sleepover with my MIL, I had the rare opportunity to
            write uninterrupted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here we are-it's done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not sure if I feel more relieved or emotional-maybe a mix of both? This
            epilogue has been in my head for a long time, and seeing it finally come to life after sitting as a rough
            draft for weeks feels incredibly satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I truly hope you all enjoy it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">2 years later</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat in her leather chair, one leg crossed over the other, as the soft glow of
            her office lamp illuminated the sleek, organized space. The New York Times article was splayed across her
            desk, the bold headline Vanguard's Ghosts: A Legacy of Violence nearly jumping off the screen. She
            scrolled further, pausing at the photograph of James Hughes in handcuffs, his jaw clenched and his eyes
            blazing with fury as he glared into the camera.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips curved into a slow, satisfied smirk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That glare-it felt personal, as though Hughes had aimed it squarely at her. And, to
            be fair, he had every reason to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it hadn't been for her civil case against Vanguard, the mountains of evidence
            unearthed thanks to Rio's work, and her ability to leverage that evidence in open court, he would have
            walked away unscathed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When William Vanguard had first offered the Sinclair family and Agatha an NDA and a
            generous payout, it had been a chess move. On the surface, it seemed like the company was tying up loose
            ends, silencing their adversaries with a gilded gag. But Agatha had seen the opening, the weak spot in the
            armor, and she'd taken it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting the Sinclair's to sign had been a delicate negotiation. They had balked
            at the idea of silencing Brooke's voice, of letting Vanguard appear to sweep their daughter's death
            under the rug. But Agatha had assured them, that this wasn't the end-it was a pivot.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had trusted her to take the case, and they trusted then as well, and they
            signed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The payout was substantial, but it wasn't the money Agatha cared about-it was the
            clause. The NDA barred her from disclosing what she knew about Vanguard's actions, but nowhere did it
            prohibit her from other forms of influence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That loophole became her weapon.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She made a series of generous donations to key political figures the following year,
            each</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">accompanied by well-placed hints. An investigation into Vanguard, she suggested in
            private meetings, would be the perfect statement piece for any ambitious politician's platform. After
            all, as she'd pointed out coyly, the FBI already had all the evidence they needed-the case</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">files shared before the NDA had been signed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what do you know?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within months, those long-forgotten case files were resurrected, breathing new life
            into an investigation that had once seemed doomed to gather dust on a shelf. The wheels of government
            bureaucracy turned slowly, as they always did, but with Agatha's subtle prodding, momentum built. Over
            the years that followed, subpoenas were issued, testimonies were painstakingly collected, and the walls
            began to close in on Vanguard's dirty little secret.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, justice caught up with them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked to herself, the edges of her lips curling as she scanned the article.
            It felt like finally reaching the last page of a book she'd been eager to finish for two long years. And
            now-now she could finally close that book, slide it onto her shelf, and move forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her moment of quiet triumph was interrupted by a knock at the door. Without looking
            up, she assumed it was Billy, probably with another client update or an unnecessary stack of
            paperwork.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come in," she called distractedly, still scrolling through the
            article.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound of multiple footsteps made her glance up, and her eyebrows shot up in
            surprise. Jen, Alice, and Lilia walked into her office.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's brow furrowed immediately, her mind racing to figure out why they were
            here. She mentally scanned her calendar-no meetings, no case updates, no glaring oversights she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">could think of. The blankness of it all left her uneasy, so she defaulted to what had
            always been her best defense when blindsided by this trio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Resigned, she leaned back in her chair, narrowing her eyes at them. "I
            didn't do it," she said preemptively.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jen arched a brow, Alice smirked, and Lilia outright snorted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Relax, Harkness," Jen said, crossing her legs. "You're not in
            trouble. For once."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relief flickered through Agatha, though she didn't fully trust it. Rising from
            her chair, she walked around the desk, her nails drumming a steady rhythm against the wood as she</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">rounded toward them. Her sharp gaze landed on Jen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Now you're making me want to misbehave, Jen," she teased, taking a
            seat across from them and letting her eyes sweep over the trio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She flicked her hand, gesturing for them to get to the point. "So, what's
            this all about?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three women exchanged glances, a silent battle of wills playing out between them.
            That alone was enough to set Agatha on edge. These weren't just any women-they were powerhouses, each
            one as formidable as she was. For them to hesitate? It meant whatever they were about to say, Agatha
            probably wasn't going to like.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Lilia exhaled a long-suffering sigh, muttering under her breath, "c
            owards ," before squaring her shoulders and meeting Agatha's gaze head-on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"We need you to talk to Rio."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, utterly caught off guard. For a moment, all she could do was stare at
            Lilia, before dragging her eyes to Jen and Alice, both of them nodded in confirmation-albeit a little
            shaky.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sat back in her chair, mind whirling as to why she -of all people was being
            asked to talk to Rio.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why? What did she do?" Agatha asked, her tone equal parts curiosity and
            amusement. Jen gave her a pointed look, clearly unamused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's on a rampage, Agatha. She's making the first-year associates cry.
            She's turned the bullpen into a warzone where people are afraid to even breathe in her
            direction."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha snorted, unable to hide her amusement. If there was one person in the firm who
            had zero tolerance for coddling the first years, it was her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the situation still puzzled her. Why were they bringing this to her? She leaned
            back, crossing her arms as her mind churned.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Correct me if I'm wrong," she said, her voice taking on that sharp,
            mocking edge, "but there's a very lengthy HR document on file that explicitly states I have no say
            or authority over Rio due to our... relationship."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the words hang in the air, her gaze sliding over the three women.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"And you two," she continued, pointing at Lilia and Jen, "are
            practically the patron saints of rule-following. So why, exactly, are you coming to me with
            this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room went silent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's sharp eyes scanned their faces, and as she really looked at them,
            realization struck. Her eyes widened, her mouth falling open in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait-are you... scared of her?" she asked incredulously.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three partners exchanged hesitant glances, their silence speaking louder than
            words. Finally, Alice cleared her throat, shifting slightly in her seat before meeting Agatha's gaze.
            "Agatha-your wife is terrifying," Alice said, her wide eyes emphasizing the point.
            "She</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">literally growled at me yesterday when I pointed out her page numbers were off on the
            brief she sent me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha bit her lip, fighting to keep the grin threatening to break across her
            face.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One... she would never tire of hearing someone call Rio her wife. Just the thought of
            it sent a warm flutter through her chest, and instinctively, her fingers found the wedding ring on her
            hand-a sleek gold band with a stunning 3-carat dark gray diamond at its center. She twirled it almost
            absently, a habit she developed since Rio placed the ring on her finger a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And two... the idea of Rio growling at Alice? It had her on the verge of actual
            giggles because she could picture it so vividly because Rio had been very spicy lately...understandably
            so.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little did the partners know though, she had been trying-and failing-to get Rio to
            take even the smallest step back from work. Not to stop entirely, because that wasn't who Rio was, but
            to ease off the accelerator just enough to catch her breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was like trying to convince a hurricane to take a day off.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sent a look toward the partners, noting the faint hopefulness etched on their
            faces. It was almost amusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They clearly thought Agatha took the more dominant role in her relationship with Rio.
            She was older, wildly successful, and carried a presence that commanded any room she walked into. Of course,
            they would assume she was the one steering the ship at home.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that couldn't have been further from the truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sure, Agatha had a say-of course she did. They were a team, a great fucking team, one
            that moved in sync and complemented each other in ways Agatha had never thought possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was a force of nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That natural order of all things.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio never let Agatha "dominate" anything unless they were in bed, and even
            then, that was only on the rare occasion Rio allowed it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their dynamic was entirely flipped from what anyone might expect. And Agatha
            didn't mind in the slightest-she loved it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they didn't need to know that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Agatha sighed, adding just the right amount of exasperation for dramatic
            effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine. I'll talk to her," she said, injecting as much bravado into her
            voice as she could muster</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-like she had any chance of accomplishing what they were asking without having the
            kitchen sink hurled at her head-metaphorically of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha had just stood up from the chair and was halfway to the door when a thought
            struck her. She stopped, turning slowly to face the three partners, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Wait a second," she said, crossing her arms. "You three have never
            hesitated to air your grievances with me. Does this mean"-her gaze sharpened as she pursed her
            lips-"you're more scared of her than you are of me?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea sounded impossible, ridiculous even, as she said it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words had barely left her mouth before the replies came in unison.
            "Yes."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Absolutely."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Without a doubt."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha blinked, completely stunned by the rapid-fire responses. Her mouth opened
            and</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">closed as she tried to find a rebuttal, but for the first time in a long while, she
            had nothing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three partners exchanged smirks, clearly enjoying her rare moment of
            speechlessness. Agatha shot them a glare, as she turned on her heels and walked out the door.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On her way to Rio's office, her mind was already working overtime.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Scarier than me?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The idea was ludicrous.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn't sure whether to be insulted or impressed-or maybe a little of both.
            Her fingers danced at her side as a mischievous glint creeping into her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they think I've gone soft, maybe it's time to remind them who they're
            dealing with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing too dramatic, of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just enough to reestablish her dominance and put some respect back on her name.
            Still, the fact that anyone thought Rio was scarier than her?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha snorted.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ridiculous," she muttered under her breath, but her steps slowed as she
            approached the door to the best office in the third-year hallway. Her hand hovered over the handle as she
            paused, Rio's mood this morning flashing in her mind like a neon warning sign.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness wasn't scared. She was being cautious.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was being smart.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And... oh .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her lips pressed into a tight line as the realization hit her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was being a little bitch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thought was like a slap across the face, and it snapped her out of her
            hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha Harkness didn't back down from challenges-not in the courtroom, not
            with</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">corporate overlords, and certainly not with her wife. Even if said wife had, over the
            past few months, perfected a glare so fierce it looked like she was ready to reap your soul.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With her signature flair, Agatha pushed the door open and stepped inside, her gaze
            sweeping over the space as a familiar mix of affection and amusement tugged at her lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been Rio's office for only four months, yet it looked as though she'd
            occupied the space for years. Rio, in true fashion, never did anything half-assed. Her office was a seamless
            blend of structure and life, like a greenhouse masquerading as a workspace.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't say a word about it, though, considering every single plant in
            this room had been her doing. One for Rio's first office. Another to celebrate her first chaired case.
            Another for her first win, and then her second-anniversary at the firm. And, of course, there were more than
            a handful of "apology plants" scattered about-peace offerings for when Agatha's foot had
            firmly lodged itself in her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The result was less an office and more an art gallery of rare, expensive plants. Rio
            loved them all, treating each one with the meticulous care that only she could manage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha couldn't name a single one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Rio?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew every single one, down to the tiniest detail.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk deepened as her eyes landed on Rio, seated behind the desk,
            completely absorbed in the document before her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">God, she was beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that this was news-Rio always looked beautiful-but today, she seemed to glow. It
            was an understated radiance, the kind that left Agatha a little breathless if she thought about it too
            long.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without even glancing up, Rio spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"What brings you to my neck of the woods, my love?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My love.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">No matter how many times Agatha heard it, the soft flutter in her chest was always
            the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stepped forward and took a seat in one of the dark leather chairs-ones she'd
            gifted Rio during her first year. Afterall, if Agatha was going to sit in Rio's office, she was going to
            be comfortable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"So..." Agatha began slowly, watching Rio's reaction to her words.
            "I need to talk to you about something. And I need you to not bite my head off."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio didn't look up immediately, but Agatha didn't miss the slight tension in
            her jaw. Her wife's eyes stayed fixed on the paper, as though determined to finish whatever she
            was</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">reading first. After what felt like an eternity, Rio set the document aside and
            leaned back in her chair, finally meeting Agatha's gaze.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I make no promises," Rio said evenly, her eyes narrowing just enough to
            make Agatha feel like she was being sized up for battle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha fought against the urge to fidget. Give her a high-profile suit or a
            high-stakes negotiation any day. Hell, throw her into a boardroom with ten stuffy old white guys who loved
            to mansplain corporate law-she'd take it all over this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Convincing her wife to take a step back from work?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This felt like walking into a lion's den with a steak necklace.
            "Honey..." she started, her tone laced with forced sweetness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's narrowed eyes sharpened even further, cutting through Agatha's attempt
            to soften the blow with a pet name.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha sighed, and decided to bite the bullet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"The partners," she began, bracing herself, "have asked that you...
            maybe take a step back. Work from home a couple of days? Or even take some time off?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence that followed was deafening. Rio leaned back in her chair, her expression
            inscrutable as she regarded Agatha with the weight of a thousand unsaid words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, finally, she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They asked?" Rio said slowly-dangerously, her jaw tightening. "Or did
            you plant the idea?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha winced internally, knowing exactly why Rio would jump to that conclusion.
            After all, the new plant sitting proudly on Rio's desk-was the most recent apology plant. Agatha had
            bought it after their last attempt at this same conversation went spectacularly south. Not her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">finest hour, and certainly not Rio's most forgiving mood. The fallout, despite
            the plant's hefty price tag, had left Rio a little tender on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha immediately held up her hands, palms out, a gesture of surrender. "I did
            not-I swear," she said earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn't lie to each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not even when it would have been easier. Not even when it hurt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That softened Rio slightly, her posture relaxing just enough for Agatha to notice.
            She tilted her head, her gaze sharp but tinged with curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Why? I'm still operating at my usual capacity."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha lost the fight against a smirk as her next words bubbled up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're making the first years cry too much," she said, almost proudly.
            "Which, as you know, I fully support. But apparently, it's creating a 'hostile
            environment.'"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes widened in mock outrage, her mouth opening to launch into what Agatha
            was sure would be a fiery retort-until a visible wince crossed her face. Rio closed her eyes and her jaw
            tightened as she took a deep, controlled breath.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha instantly sat up straighter, the smirk vanishing as her worried gaze locked
            onto Rio. She held her breath, every nerve on high alert.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio took a few more deep breaths before opening her eyes and leveling a pointed look
            at Agatha.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come talk to your daughter," she said, exhaling a frustrated huff.
            "She's been a menace all day."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha stood, a sly grin creeping back onto her face as she moved around the desk.
            "Funny, the partners said the same thing about you," she quipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her teasing trailed off as she rounded the desk and saw Rio's very, very
            pregnant belly fully on display now, unobstructed by the desk. Agatha's heart did that thing it always
            did when she saw it-flipped, softened, and swelled all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A soft smile spread across Agatha's face as she moved forward, lowering herself
            onto her knees in front of Rio. Her hands reached out instinctively, smoothing over the curve of Rio's
            stomach. The firm kicks that met her palm were immediate, startlingly strong, and drew a sharp hiss from Rio
            above her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's treating my insides like a rage room," Rio huffed, her voice a
            perfect blend of exasperation and reluctant affection.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, she is my daughter," Agatha quipped, her lips curling into a smirk.
            "And, if given</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">enough time, I can turn any room into a rage room. She's been in there for 38
            weeks, my love</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-of course, she's going to rage."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned closer, her face softening as she directed her attention to Rio's
            belly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I know you're getting antsy in there, sweetheart," she murmured, her
            tone shifting to something gentler, though still playful. "But I happen to be very partial to your mami
            , and you're not making this easy for her with all your little tantrums."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In true to Harkness fashion, her daughter responded with a firm kick against
            Agatha's hand. Rio groaned above her, a sound that was half frustration and half pain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I swear," Rio said through gritted teeth, glaring down at Agatha like it
            was somehow her</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">fault. "I know she doesn't have your DNA, but you've clearly managed to
            pass your attitude down to her anyway."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Well, she developed her ears like 10 weeks ago," Agatha said, smirking as
            she gently rubbed her hand over the swell of Rio's stomach. "I can't help it if she's
            already picked up on my stellar personality."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio groaned, rolling her eyes as she sank further back into her chair.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fantastic. She's going to come out negotiating nap times and winning
            arguments by sheer force of sarcasm."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Only if we're lucky," Agatha teased, leaning in to press a soft kiss
            to Rio's belly. "But let's face it-she's going to be a powerhouse. Just look at her
            parents."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips quirked into a smile despite her irritation, her fingers ghosting
            across Agatha's cheekbone.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're way too proud of her already, and she's not even here
            yet."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Of course I am," Agatha said, tilting her head up to meet Rio's gaze.
            "She's already making her mark, even if it's on your bladder."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio couldn't help but laugh at that, though the motion made her wince slightly.
            Agatha was instantly alert, concern flickering across her face.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Are you really okay?" she asked, her voice softening as her hand stilled
            on Rio's belly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I'm fine," Rio reassured her, though her voice carried the
            unmistakable weight of fatigue. "She's just... very active today."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips pressed into a thin line. The past couple of weeks had been
            grueling. Rio was barely sleeping, and their daughter seemed determined to test her limits with relentless
            kicks and flips, as though preparing for her debut with a vengeance.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Honey," Agatha said softly, her voice stripped of its usual bravado,
            replaced by pure, unguarded warmth. She reached for Rio's hand, threading their fingers together gently.
            "I know you don't want to step back. But you can't keep pushing through this on sheer</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">willpower alone. You barely slept last night, and I can see how exhausted you are.
            And now, with her kicking you like this..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice trailed off, but the concern in her eyes spoke volumes.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio sighed, leaning her head back against the chair, her free hand coming to rest
            over their intertwined fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I just... I hate the idea of slowing down," Rio murmured, her voice tinged
            with frustration and weariness. "Of feeling like I'm not doing enough."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha squeezed her hand gently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You've already done more than enough, my love. The partners wanted me to
            remind you- and I'm quoting here- that you've doubled your peers' billable hours and brought in
            three times the revenue this year alone . Slowing down? You'd still be miles ahead of everyone</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">else."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned closer, her free hand brushing softly over Rio's belly, where their
            daughter gave another assertive kick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"You're not slowing down, honey. You'd just be moving at the same pace
            as everyone else for once."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio huffed a quiet laugh, a small smile breaking through the stubborn tension on her
            face. "That's not exactly comforting, you know."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"No?" Agatha arched a brow, a teasing glint in her eyes. "Then let me
            put it another way: you can take a step back because you've earned it. And, selfishly, I want you
            to-because I need you to take care of yourself. For her."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pressed her hand gently to Rio's belly. "And for me."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's eyes softened, her resistance finally cracking under the weight of
            Agatha's words. "I hate it when you're right," she muttered, her voice tinged with
            reluctant affection.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's lips quirked into a smug grin.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Must be so hard for you to be with me, then-since I'm always right,"
            Agatha quipped, her grin unapologetically smug.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio huffed, arching an eyebrow at her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Not always wise, though-considering you think making smart comments to your
            very pregnant wife is a good idea."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha laughed softly, leaning in to press a kiss to Rio's hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I am Agatha Harkness, darling. I live on the edge. It keeps things
            interesting." Rio rolled her eyes but didn't pull away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Interesting isn't the word I'd use," she muttered, though the
            corner of her mouth betrayed a faint smile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha smirked, squeezing Rio's hand gently. "You love it."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Debatable ," Rio shot back, but her smile widened as she looked at
            Agatha. Her expression softened as she leaned back into the chair, exhaustion momentarily forgotten. "I
            do love you, though."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's smirk faded into something warmer</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I love you too," Agatha said, the words rolling off her tongue with an
            ease she still wasn't entirely used to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She still didn't say them often, but this moment warranted it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's lips curved into a soft smile, one that quickly twisted into a grimace as
            she winced in pain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha immediately felt the sharp, determined kick against her palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Hey, none of that now," Agatha chided gently, addressing the culprit
            inside Rio's belly. Rio groaned, her hand pressing against the swell of her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sing her that song," she said through gritted teeth. "The one that
            always settles her down." Agatha raised an eyebrow, her expression incredulous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were at work, and if anyone walked in on her singing to Rio's stomach, her
            reputation would undoubtedly take a hit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Agatha," Rio said firmly, sensing her hesitation. "If you want me to
            go home and stay home, I need to be able to walk. And for that to happen, she needs to calm
            down."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha was backed into a corner.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fine," Agatha huffed, glaring down at Rio's stomach as if her daughter
            could see her displeasure. "But if Jen catches me doing this, I will never live it down. And you-"
            she pointed a finger at Rio "-will never hear the end of it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another sharp kick.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Agatha ," Rio said, her tone bordering on a growl.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yup, yup. I'm going," Agatha muttered, resigned. She took a steadying
            breath, shooting another wary glance at the door, and then began, her voice a low melodic cadence.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Seekest thou the road to all that's foul and fair"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio leaned back in her chair closing her eyes, her breathing easing almost
            immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gather sisters fire, water, earth and aira</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Darkest hour, wake thy power, earthly and divine</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Burn and brew with coven true and glory shall be thine</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their daughter responded too, the fierce kicks softening into faint, rhythmic
            movements beneath Agatha's hand, as if soothed by the melody.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Agatha's voice softened further as she continued to sing, her fingers tracing
            lazy circles over Rio's belly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The song was one she'd carried with her for years, though she rarely thought
            about its origins. It was an old tune she'd learned from her eccentric elderly neighbor-a woman who her
            mother had sworn was both a witch and the devil.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, that made Agatha seek her out because coincidently, Evanora called Agatha
            the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Circle sewn with fate Unlock thy hidden gate</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Turns out, the woman was neither witch nor devil, just a lonely widow who had taken
            an unexpected shine Agatha. When Evanora was off on one of her infamous benders, Agatha would slip away to
            the widow's house. She'd sit at the old woman's worn kitchen table,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">eating food that tasted real. Marching ever forward 'Neath the wooded
            shrine</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stray not from the path</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hold death's hand in mine Primal night, giveth sight Familiar by thy
            side</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If one be gone, we carry on Spirit as our guide</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The widow always sang this song when she cooked. Said it was passed down through the
            women in her family, and since Agatha was the closest thing she'd ever have to a daughter, she taught it
            to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had stuck with Agatha ever since.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It stuck with her through the chaos, the fights, and the aching loneliness of her
            childhood years. It became her battle cry, her lullaby, her anchor. When Nicky was sick, lying in a hospital
            bed, she'd sung it to him too, softly stroking his hair while his small body fought so hard against what
            was trying to take him from the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Blood and tears and bone Maiden, Mother, Crone</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when Nicky noticed Rio wincing at their daughter's increasingly ferocious
            kicks, he'd been the one to suggest Agatha sing it to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It always makes me feel better," he'd said matter-of-factly, as if
            that alone was reason enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio, of course, had lit up at the idea. Encouraging it with her signature grin,
            knowing full</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">well how mortified Agatha would be singing to her wife's stomach. But Agatha
            never backed down from a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, she sang.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The road is wild and wicked Winding through the wood</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where all that's wrong is right And all that's bad is good</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through many miles of tricks and trials We'll wander high and low</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tame your fears, a door appears The time has come to go</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Much to her surprise-and Rio's amusement-the fiery daughter calmed immediately.
            And now, it was the only thing that seemed to soothe her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Down, down, down the road Down the witches' road</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled softly, her voice carrying the last verse with all the love and warmth
            blooming in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" Follow me, my friend ," she sang, her gaze lifting to meet
            Rio's.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rio's tired eyes softened. Her lips curved into a faint, tender smile, and Agatha
            felt their daughter's restless movements still beneath her palm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then Rio's hand came down, their fingers intertwining. The subtle bump of
            their</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">wedding rings against each other sent a quiet ripple of meaning through Agatha-a
            reminder of the life they had built, and the one they were still creating.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the last words of the song left her lips, Agatha felt it settle deep in her chest,
            filling her with a peace she never thought she'd have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"To glory at the end."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE END.</span></p>
