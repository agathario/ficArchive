     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Veteran consultant Rio Vidal is called in to assist with a presidential campaign. Rio thought she’d seen and conquered all, until the candidate’s spouse proves to be more of a challenge than she’d anticipated— both professionally and personally.
     </p>
     <p>
      An election AU that absolutely no one asked for.

      <span>
       December 4, 2023
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry?” Jen fired back incredulously.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You heard me,” Rio said firmly but distantly as she gazed out the window. “I’m not interested.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You barely even heard the pitch,” Jen let out, her frustration getting the best of her. “I know this wasn’t what you expected when we called you in this morning; consider it a favor for Lilia, one she will repay generously when the time comes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio let out a groan, spun around and walked back towards the desk behind which Jen was sitting. Through the glass window behind her, the Washington Mall was covered in a thick layer of snow. Rio always thought DC looked more appealing during winter time, when temperatures dropped and only but the toughest runners and most determined tourists ventured outside. It was quiet, and a sight to admire.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m a political consultant,” Rio said tersely, “a strategist, a spin-doctor, whatever you want to call me— just not a
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       babysitter
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen rolled her eyes, “You know that this job sometimes entails ushering family members through the election just as much as the candidates— and it requires even more tact and labor than dealing with the politicians themselves.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio slumped on the chair across from her and looked through Senator Bohner’s file again. He had just been re-elected for a second term last year, so his presidential bid was most likely just an attempt to access a higher profile office than the one he currently had. Married, no children, Republican. Rio gagged. His track record was mediocre at best, and while Rio had had no issue in the past running campaigns for both sides of the aisle, she felt a pit in her stomach at the prospect of shoving
      <em>
       Ralph-mother-fucking-Bohner’s
      </em>
      face down the American people’s throats. The last thing the country needed was another self-serving white man with no moral compass making life and death decisions on behalf of his constituents. Still, Rio hesitated — the request had come from Lilia after all, who didn’t make brash decisions and certainly wouldn’t call in a favor unless it was important to her to get her best colleagues on the case. Especially if the job wasn’t directly involved with the candidate himself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me about the wife,” Rio said defeatedly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha Harkness, 48, equity partner at a BigLaw firm out in NoVa,” Jen said without batting an eye. “I’ve met her, she’s a total bitch,” she added with a wink, “clearly Lilia thought she’d be a handful, too, otherwise…” Jen gestured at Rio with her hands, fighting back a delighted smile. The pair had known each other for over a decade, and while outwardly projected an image of professionalism, in private there was nothing they enjoyed more than riling the other up like a pair of children competing for their parents’ attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chose to ignore her, as she continued going through the folder until she came across a picture of the woman they’d just been discussing. It was a professional headshot, likely pulled from the law firm’s website. A stern-looking woman stared back at her, her bright blue eyes conveying a mixture of contempt and defiance for whoever had taken the photo, not a hint of a smile in sight.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       The kind of lawyer I would hire if I wanted to make sure someone cried on the stand
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      <em>
       ,
      </em>
      Rio mused. Yet underneath it all there was a certain sadness to her that struck a cord with Rio. This beautiful, powerful, rich woman was on the verge of being relentlessly dragged through the public eye so that her husband could score some points for his next career move. And knowing the other candidates who had already announced their run, it was shaping up to be a brutal fight, where old skeletons were all but guaranteed to come out, the benefit of the doubt scarce, and every misstep broadcast on the only thing more devastating than the 24-hour news cycle, social media. Lilia wanted to protect her as much as she could, that’s why she’d called in the big dogs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She needs someone sharp and savvy who can help her navigate the primaries,” Jen added, “an ally in her camp who isn’t on her husband’s payroll.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stared at Agatha’s eyes one more time before closing the dossier and setting it on the table. This was not how she had expected to spend the first couple of months of an election year, but there was something about this request that made her
      <span>
      </span>
      feel like this was where she needed to be.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How does Ms. Harkness feel about getting a handler?” Rio asked curiously, although deep down she had a feeling she already knew the answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen grinned knowingly. “I’m sure she’ll love the idea after you break it to her,” she added with dark satisfaction, “as a matter of fact, that’s the first item on your agenda— that is, of course, if you’re agreeing to take her on.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio face planted dramatically on Jen’s desk. She allowed herself a moment to gather her bearings, and when she straightened up, her face was resolute. She’d done much harder jobs than this before.
      <em>
       How much more difficult could this be?
      </em>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell Lilia I’m in— and that however much she thinks she owes me, she better double it,” Rio said, putting the files in her messenger bag and making a beeline for the exit. Jen’s phone began ringing, and the conversation was left at that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the cold air hit her face as she exited the office building lobby, Rio wondered for the first time if she had actually bitten off more than she could chew.

    <p>
     Rio woke up at the crack of dawn the next day to a text from Lilia
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Gave A a heads up-- she's expecting you in her office today.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stretched her arms and legs in bed, recalling her meeting with Jen yesterday while taking in her surroundings. The Coven, Lilia's consulting group, had booked her a suite at the Kimpton prior to her meeting, and it was now to become her temporary home until they hit the road with Bohner's campaign or called it quits-- whichever happened first. It was conveniently close to the Bohner-Harkness residence as well The Coven offices, but a long way from her destination today.
    </p>
    <p>
     Padding barefoot towards the bathroom, she started making mental notes on all the things she needed to prepare ahead of her first encounter. Jen's assistant, Alice, had emailed Rio the preliminary opposition research the Coven had conducted on the couple for both of his Senate campaigns, along with notes and highlights from the previous campaign managers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first thing that stood out to Rio was how uninvolved Agatha had been in her husband's previous campaigns. There were a few pictures of her on the campaign trail, and a couple at donor events, but Agatha hadn't given a single interview, or speech, or introduction for Ralph at any of his fundraisers. She hadn't leveraged her rolodex for more donations, or contributed to the campaign in any meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was also exceedingly clear that that hadn't been an accident. There were dozens of offhand comments from senior campaign staff about her reluctance or outright unwillingness to cooperate with the campaign. A former communications director wrote in the post mortem for his first run that
     <em>
      "Bohner could have greatly outperformed his divorced, openly gay rival among more conservative voters had he been able to get his wife to show an ounce of support for him in public"
     </em>
     with another staffer during his re-election bid remarking
     <em>
      "at this point, it's unclear if she would even show up to his funeral if he were to drop dead tomorrow."
     </em>
     That one earned a chuckle out of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had paid off for Agatha. Very little outside of her professional life at the law firm was known about her, and because Senate races didn't typically draw as much attention at a national stage, especially outside of swing states, she had managed to walk away unscathed from both campaigns. Even now, if you Googled her name, the first 20 results pertained to her legal work. The image search showed various professional headshots taken over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio made herself a cup of coffee with the Keurig in her room while she continued to browse through the files. She hesitated before opening the oppo research. Typically she would go over it with the candidate's consent, but seeing as she was neither the candidate nor the one who had commissioned it, she decided she'd rather have as much information as possible before the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having seen her fair share of oppo research in her lifetime, Harkness and Bohner's was... unremarkable. Which could mean one of two things: either both had led relatively quiet and private lives prior to his first run, devoid of scandal, or they'd done a damn good job at covering it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bohner came from a large working class family in Ohio, went to state school for undergrad on a scholarship then Yale for law school (on a conservative Christian fellowship), where he met his future wife. Worked for 15 years as a litigation attorney before he was tapped by a conservative group as a potential candidate for an open seat in the Senate, which he won on his first try.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha on the other hand was the only child of Ted and Evanora Harkness, a wealthy established family from Massachusetts, sole heiress to the family fortune. Her father passed when she was in her early 30s, and a small note at the bottom of the document pointed to the fact that she and her mother were estranged. Agatha had hopped around a couple of law firms before becoming a lateral hire at her current firm, where she made partner and head of practice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finished her coffee and closed her computer.
     <em>
      So
     </em>
     , she thought to herself,
     <em>
      polar opposites
     </em>
     . Ralph did everything he could to catch someone's attention to outgrow his working-class roots. Agatha used her family's wealth and position to keep a low profile and carry about her professional life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Splashing some water on her face, Rio fixed her makeup and got dressed for the day. She made a quick call to the front desk so they could find her a driver to take her out to Agatha's firm in Virginia. She took one final look in the mirror before leaving the room, her messenger bag in tow, feeling more in control regarding the job than several hours prior.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The ride was relatively quiet, but by the time she walked through the lobby doors, a strange feeling of uneasiness had taken hold of her stomach. She tried to quiet it down by doing some breathing exercises in the elevator, but she was still on the edge when the receptionist told her to take a seat while she waited for Agatha to come get her. Rio had always taken pride in the level-headed, almost nonchalant image of herself she projected to others, but that version was nowhere to be found that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a couple of minutes of waiting, a skinny, dark-haired boy approached her. He looked very young, and his dark eyeliner and nervous excitement seemed completely out of place in the office environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you Rio Vidal?" he asked quickly, and Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Great! I'm Billy, by the way, Agatha's assistant. She's waiting for you in her office. Did I pronounce your name correctly? Is it Vee-dal or Vy-dal? When I asked Agatha she just gave me her usual death stare... you know the one... wait, you actually don't! Maybe I shouldn't have said that, can you pretend I never said that, please? My mom got me this job and I would really like to keep it so I can save enough to buy tickets to the Eras Tour for me and my boyfriend in Europe this summer... and you definitely didn't need to know all that, oh my God, I'm so sorry, it's just Agatha looked so nervous before I came out here and that made me nervous too and-"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Billy," Rio said, stopping him in his tracks, "it's okay, take a deep breath for me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy exhaled dramatically, after which he gave Rio a nervous grin. She returned his easy smile, and patted him on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Relax, kid, you're too young to be this stressed out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know it's probably hard to believe after what you just witnessed, but I'm typically very calm and collected," Billy added sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave him a wide grin this time. "Are you going to take me to the dragon's lair now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right, yes, sorry. She's not that bad, you know," he added. Billy led them down a corridor to one of the corner offices. Right outside the door was a small desk and matching chair, Billy's, Rio presumed. "I would probably just say she's misunderstood more than anything."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that so?" Came a cool voice from behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Billy turned around to see Agatha Harkness, a cup of freshly brewed tea in her right hand and a look of profound irritation on her face. Billy cowered and ran back to sit behind his desk, eyes downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood impossibly tall in front of Rio, her blue eyes searching for something on her, before she abruptly turned around and walked into her office without another word.
    </p>

     Rio glanced towards Billy before following Agatha into her office. At first glance, it looked like she may have just moved in. There were boxes strewn on the floor and piles of folders balanced precariously on each chair. Two framed diplomas were haphazardly propped on a shelving unit by the wall, and there were no personal items save for the mug Agatha had just brought into the room and a briefcase hanging from the back of her seat. The only indication that this wasn’t a temporary arrangement was the elaborate computer set up on her desk.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Guarded
     </em>
     , Rio thought,
     <em>
      even at work she keeps her personal life under wraps.
      <span>
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a seat behind the desk and stared at Rio, her expression unreadable. Rio felt like she was being assessed head to toe under a microscope. Suddenly her clothes felt too tight, and she questioned her choice of attire. She’d always toed the line between looking effortlessly cool and inspiring respect in a male-dominated field. She squirmed internally and tried to gather her composure and focus on Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that didn’t help calm her nerves because the woman before her was…
     <em>
      beautiful
     </em>
     . Her deep eyes, her long, brown hair, the way she leaned forward ever so slightly on her desk… Rio was stunned. There was something magnetic about her, and Rio couldn’t stop her breath from catching and her mind from drifting.
     <span>
      She was wearing matching pantsuit combo in deep maroon colors that fit like it was custom-made (it probably was).
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few seconds that felt like hours, Agatha finally spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” she began carefully, “Lilia seems to think I could use your services.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Right
     </em>
     , Rio thought,
     <em>
      the job
     </em>
     . She put on her the most self-assured smile she could muster before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do. Or rather, you will, once your husband takes the show on the road.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for a brief second, before turning to her computer and clicking through some emails.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hope you don’t mind, I took the liberty of commissioning a background check on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio very much did mind, but didn’t reply. She had spent a good chunk of her morning digging into Agatha’s life story herself, so it only seemed fair she would do the same, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re quite young,” Agatha said after a moment, “34?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Last I checked,” Rio grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes darted towards her firmly, then turned to face her fully.
     <em>
      She’s interviewing me. Alright, let’s play.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you from?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Chicago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Family?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Both parents dead, no siblings.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed taken aback by her candor. She recovered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You went to Northwestern for undergrad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So did you.”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Agatha smiled and Rio felt like all the air had been sucked from her lungs. The longer she spent in this woman’s presence, the more she questioned whether taking this job was a terrible idea. Against her better judgement, she shrugged her internal warning off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And now you want to work for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry?” Agatha was taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t work
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     you, I would be working
     <em>
      with
     </em>
     you,
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     Lilia. She’s the one who hired me after all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Semantics,” Agatha replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Her signature will be on my paychecks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I can fire you, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can choose to stop working with me, at which point my contract with The Coven would be terminated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Coven, what a silly name,” Agatha interjected, “it makes it sound like it’s a bunch of middle-aged lesbians dabbling in the dark arts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I think that’s kind of the point, isn't it?” Rio laughed, but Agatha stared and waited. “We already get called witches and dykes behind our backs, I think this is a way for us to reclaim it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A witch or a lesbian?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Either. Both.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not quite on the first, but definitely for the latter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed taken aback by her direct answer. Her husband certainly didn’t have the best record on LGBTQ issues, Rio wondered where his wife stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will that be a problem?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” She looked away, a distant look on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great,” said Rio. “So, shall we get started?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven’t decided if I want to work with you yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, then tell me about your reservations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I…” Agatha hesitated. “I don’t like when people get in my business.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Personally or professionally?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Both.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll try to keep that from happening as much as possible.” Agatha scoffed. “Listen, I’m here to protect you. You want to stay out of the public eye? I’ll do my best to help you keep a low profile. The only thing I ask is that you’re honest with me. And I promise to be honest with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha mulled over Rio’s words for a moment. “Alright.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio beamed. “Excellent. Now how do you feel about your husband running for President?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out an exasperated sigh. “I asked him not to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you think he’s not ready? Or because you think he can’t win?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t reply right away. “He and I don’t see eye to eye…politically-speaking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was surprised by her response, but waited for her to elaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For as long as I’ve known him, Ralph’s always wanted… more. For himself, at least. I’m not saying he doesn’t have any principles, but he’s made some
     <em>
      concessions
     </em>
     to become a more appealing choice to a certain group of voters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You mean more right wing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you disagree with these… policies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m a Democrat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio had been drinking, she would’ve done a dramatic spit-take. “Let’s recap, shall we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes again. “Your conservative, right-wing leaning husband, whose views you do not share in the slightest, is running for the highest office in the land. You’ve successfully stayed out of it in the past, but are worried you won’t be able to do the same this time, so you’ve asked him not to run, a request he respectfully declined. So far so good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waved her hand. “His campaign will compromise your ability to continue leading a normal legal practice, and your image to be relentlessly scrutinized. I guess my question is… why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you still supporting him through it? What are you getting out of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because from where I’m sitting, this seems like a lose-lose scenario for you.” Agatha’s eyes were back on Rio. “What are you not telling me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     They softened for a brief moment, before she answered, “Ralph has always provided a certain degree of safety and security that I need. He’s been there for me, in ways I never expected anyone to be. This is the first time where I’m feeling like that might be compromised.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was intrigued, to say the least. “At some point, over the next couple of months, there may come a moment where you will be asked what you want. You don’t have to give me an answer right now, but I want you to think about it so you can be ready if the time presents itself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not following.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If things become too much, or if you have to do things you don’t want, or become compromised in some way, you’ll need to know what to ask for. What you want to happen. What you need.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me about the kid outside, what’s his deal?” Rio changed the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy? He’s my friend Wanda’s kid. He’s taking a gap year before college and she asked me if I could give him a job for a couple of months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can he be trusted?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. I’ve known him since before he was born.” Rio thought she saw something akin to fondness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s his work here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No comment.” At that, Rio laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, well, as a first order of business, I think you should fire him as your legal assistant. And before you protest,” Rio raised her hand, “we’ll re-hire him as your
     <em>
      personal
     </em>
     assistant. You’ll need someone qualified who you can trust to keep your legal practice afloat while on the trail. I’m sure that won’t be too difficult for a more experienced individual. It’s harder to find trustworthy people you can let your guard down with on the road.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio beamed. Agatha trusting and following her advice filled her a warm feeling. She look at the clock on the wall and turned to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have a meeting with Ralph’s campaign manager in an hour to go over some strategy points. I think we should meet again this evening to go over some details. I’ll loop in Jen and Alice, since they’ll be supporting you as well. The best way to stay in control of the narrative is to decide what and how much you want to share so that people don’t come digging on their own. With any luck, Ralph will have dropped out long before Super Tuesday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up and stretched her hand out for Agatha to shake. When their hands made contact, a shiver ran down her spine and her knees buckled minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Four to eight weeks, and then everything goes back to normal,” Rio tried to sound reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” Agatha said earnestly, “for being here. For agreeing to help.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t thank me yet,” Rio said with a wink, trying to project an air of confidence she did not feel around that woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she walked past Billy, Rio felt overwhelmed by her desire to get to know Agatha. To pick her apart, to get to know her deepest secrets. And that scared the living shit out of her.

   <div>
    <p>
     Rio took an Uber back to her hotel to freshen up before her next meeting. Agatha had left her rattled. There was something about her, about her motivations, about her support for her husband that didn’t quite seem right to her. Her carefully constructed life could very easily come apart under public scrutiny, and she seemed to recognize that, at least to a certain extent. And yet, for some mysterious reason, she was going along with it instead of calling it quits. It was the kind of unconditional support that she’d only seen before in deeply committed couples— and by all accounts, Agatha and Ralph’s relationship appeared to be a lot more detached and independent. She was looking forward to observing them interact in private, perhaps that would yield some insight into their relationship dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed in her bag, and he fished it out to find a text from an unknown number.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Billy is thrilled about the personal assistant job.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled at her text in spite of herself and saved Agatha’s number. She sent her a thumbs up emoji in reply, then asked for her home address (out of politeness, she had already found it in her file) and told her she would stop by around 6 p.m. It had been a long time since she’d felt this kind of nervous excitement regarding a job or a candidate. Rio worried at her lip, she knew better than to allow herself to give too much of herself to a campaign, from a personal standpoint. Emotions get heightened, the stakes feel impossibly high, and lines can get blurred in the late hours of the day on the campaign trail. Rio had seen too many of her colleagues make mistakes they’d come to regret. She needed to get a grip before she made some mistakes of her own. So far the woman had been enthralling, but Rio was certain she’d yet to see the darker side Jen and Billy had warned her about.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone began buzzing again, this time from an incoming call from a familiar number.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did it go?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Quite well, actually, though I’m still not sure why she’s putting herself through this unnecessary torment.”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not for us to understand, just to support her through it,” Lilia replied evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Coven ran Bohner’s previous campaigns, why aren’t you running his presidential bid?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This isn’t coming from us; a think tank is trying to raise his profile, and they wanted to use their own people this time. His positions have become more extreme since his last campaign, and I think they worried our values would stand in the way of his success.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would they have?” Rio asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe. Maybe not. It would not be a good look for either him or us, so we didn’t fight him on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Agatha…” Rio began.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha helped me out with Charlie’s legal troubles,” Lilia interrupted, but not unkindly, “Pulled some strings, got him in front of a lenient judge. She didn’t have to do it, but she looked out for us anyway. Who knows where he would be now without her. I wanted to repay her kindness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio vividly remembered Lilia’s son’s run in with the law a couple years back. It was the first and only time she’d seen her off her game. He had gotten off relatively easy, gone to rehab and turned his life around.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can trust me with her,” Rio told her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know I can. I wouldn’t have asked otherwise. Don’t let Ralph’s campaign take over her image or narrative. We’re collaborating with them, but it’s in our best interest that this gets shut down as quickly as possible. He can still be re-elected for a couple more terms if he doesn’t go off the rails. And I have a feeling that he’s being used by the think tank for some ulterior agenda, but I haven’t figured out how or why yet. Once he drops out, we’ll add him back to our client roster and we can release you from your work with Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Noted, I’ll keep my ears open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perhaps once this is over, you might reconsider coming back to work with us full time?” Lilia asked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll see… but for now, I’m yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “That’s what I like to hear. Keep me posted, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio disconnected the call. If Lilia was concerned about Bohner’s team… then Rio should be, too.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Come in, come in!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was ushered into a small conference room by a petite, blonde older woman dressed in all-floral pantsuit combo. She looked like belonged in suburbia rather than Washington, but Rio knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Especially with women. You needed thick skin and killer instincts to make it, and Sharon Hart looked like she was in her element. She made a mental note not to be lulled into a sense of comfort by her outward openness and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think we’ve had the chance to meet before, sweetie, I’m Sharon,” she said cheerfully. “I’m the interim campaign manager until Stephen Marks gets here; after that I’ll just run grassroots for Ralph.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her hand and took a seat while they waited for the rest of the team to trickle in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me see if I can get someone to get us some refreshments… how do you take your coffee dear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “Black is fine.” A lie, Rio favored sugary concoctions, but this was no place to show her authentic self.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think someone’s gone to get some… oh, let’s see, have you met Paul? Or Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The next few minutes were followed by a flurry of introductions of Bohner’s exceedingly caucasian team of advisors and aides. Finally, the man of the hour walked in, and something dark and deep inside Rio coiled, something that tasted too much like resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph Bohner couldn’t have looked more like a politician if he tried (and Rio was sure he
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     tried): his polished appearance and wide smile radiated confidence and, in his late forties, he looked he had nailed the balance between seasoned and vibrant.
     <em>
      Too bad his politics are shit
     </em>
     , Rio thought darkly. She
     <em>
      hated
     </em>
     this man she’d only just met.
     <em>
      Jealousy isn’t a good look on you, Vidal
     </em>
     , she scolded herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You must be the one working with Ags,” Bohner said to her. Rio just nodded. “She can be quite a handful, but I’m sure someone already warned you about that.” He laughed. Rio didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to make sure we’re all on the same page here,” Rio began, “I don’t need to explain to
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     what your wife’s preferences are, but since we’re here, I think we should discuss what you have in mind for the next couple of weeks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     In the 3 hours that followed, Sharon, Bohner and the rest of the team walked Rio through preliminary polling data, caucus strategy and core platform items. Rio wasn’t impressed; she was, however, surprised that they anticipated Bohner would outperform most of his opponents in Iowa and New Hampshire. If that were to be the case, Bohner would stay in the race past Super Tuesday. For now, it was all speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s your end game here? State? Veep?” Rio asked Bohner point blank.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ideally, President,” he chuckled, and the rest of the team joined in on the laugh. “But I’d be honored to serve in any cabinet position.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Right, so literally anything that made him feel more powerful than he already does. Self-serving shit.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you discussed this with Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She would rather I take any job that doesn’t involve her taking an office of her own, if it comes to that. And I will respect that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Rio thought out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If that is all for the moment, I think we should call it a day, folks,” Bohner said, “Ms. Vidal, a word?”
    </p>
    <p>
     They waited a couple of minutes for the room to clear before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, I don’t know what you’ve heard, but I need you to understand I care about Agatha’s wishes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found that hard to believe, especially after her conversation with her that very morning. She let him go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have found a way to make things work in the past and I’m hoping we can continue doing so in the future. We may want completely different things, but we’re good for each other. We’ve been married for almost 25 years, so as you can imagine this isn’t the first time we’ve disagreed on something. But I firmly believe we can both get what we want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what, in your opinion, does your wife want?” Rio challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The proximity to power, without getting her hands dirty.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That answer stunned Rio. The woman she’d met hadn’t struck her as someone who would court political power for her own personal gain. If anything, she’d seemed like she relished the power she herself wielded in her professional life, independent of her husband. She’d gone through quite the trouble to distance herself from him politically in the past, and her legal work didn’t conflict with his work in the Senate. Rio raised an eyebrow at Bohner.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe not directly… but she craves the protection a powerful man in office can afford her,” he conceded, “and if in the process, I get the privilege to serve my country in a higher office… then I think it’s a win all around.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, and Bohner offered her a ride back to their residence for their evening debriefing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio couldn’t help but wonder,
     <em>
      what did Agatha need to be protected from?
     </em>

     It was Billy they first saw when they opened the door to the residence 20 minutes later, wearing more casual clothes than the ones he’d been wearing that morning and— to Rio’s surprise and intrigue— holding a small, white and light brown fluffy rabbit in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh hi!” He exclaimed upon seeing Rio and Ralph walk in together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Billy,” Ralph replied, walking past him towards a bar cabinet and pouring himself a drink, and then heading further into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha!” Billy called out. “The dark and mysterious lady from this morning is back!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fought hard to suppress a grin, swiping her tongue against the inside of her cheek. She was starting to like this kid more with every interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She went upstairs to change, I’m sure she’ll be back any second. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee? Some wine?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you even old enough to
     <em>
      handle
     </em>
     alcohol?” Rio asked playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He is not,” Agatha called while descending the staircase into the foyer, wearing a cream turtleneck sweater and loose-fit brown chino pants. “Go put Señor Scratchy away, we don’t want him distracting our guests,” she added, motioning to the small bunny before walking away in the same direction Ralph had just disappeared in.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re not a distraction, are you?” Billy cooed at the animal, then turned to Rio. “Isn’t he cute?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and began petting the soft fur on his head. The bunny responded by closing his eyes sleepily.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you normally bring him with you to other people’s houses?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Oh! He isn’t mine, he’s Agatha’s,” Billy responded with a smile, “He was a gift from my mom years ago, she thought Agatha was lonely and he would make good company. Agatha protested at first, but it was love at first sight for both of them,” he added. “His playpen is downstairs; I’ll be back in a flash.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A pet
     <em>
      bunny
     </em>
     . This woman had so many different sides to her, and Rio couldn’t wait to unpack them all.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a minute to look around the residence. It was an old townhouse, which had clearly been meticulously renovated. The furniture looked more decorative than functional, and the artwork on the walls looked expensive. More than anything, it barely looked like someone lived in it, and more like it was a place people passed through. Everything about it screamed
     <em>
      old money
     </em>
     to Rio.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a seat on an upholstered loveseat by the window and waited for the owners to return. She had asked Jen and Alice to join them in 30 minutes to give herself some time to observe Agatha and Ralph in their home. She could overhear them talking softly in the back. Billy returned just as they emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just explaining to Ags that I got a call from a staffer in my Ohio office letting me know there’s an emergency I have to take care of as soon as possible,” Ralph told Rio. “I’m going to catch a flight back in an hour, so unfortunately I’ll be missing tonight’s meeting with the rest of
     <em>
      Team Harkness
     </em>
     ,” he added with a wink that seemed entirely misplaced. Rio got the impression this man was used to getting away with anything he wanted with a charming smile. Agatha looked sour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think we covered all the bases earlier today, so just let Sharon know if there’s anything you need from us in the meantime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, and Bohner finished his drink in one swig before heading back the way they came in.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the door closed, Agatha slumped a bit and Billy made a face. Rio gathered this was a usual occurrence and didn’t comment on it further. Agatha recovered quickly, as if her husband hadn’t just walked out on a meeting that he
     <em>
      most definitely needed to be a part of
     </em>
     since he was the reason they were all there in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll grab us some wine, let’s just sit in the kitchen, it’s more comfortable there anyway,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Billy followed her to the adjacent room, which had to be one of the largest kitchens Rio had ever set foot in. It looked slightly more lived in than the previous space, and Agatha quickly pulled out two glasses, a bottle of red wine and a can of seltzer from the fridge for Billy, which he accepted with a smile. From what she’d observed so far, Agatha’s relationship to him was more maternal than professional, which reminded her of what Billy had said that morning about her being
     <em>
      misunderstood.
     </em>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a sip from the glass that was offered to her, and then locked eyes with Agatha.
     <em>
      My turn to talk, I guess.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen and Alice will be here shortly, but before we go over some logistics, I wanted to get a chance to get to know you a bit better. On a personal level,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took in a deep breath. “What do you want to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about we start with some basic things? Tell me about your childhood.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted. “Pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You gotta give me a little bit more than that, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     At the sound of her name coming out of Rio’s mouth, her expression changed into something Rio couldn’t quite place. “It was… fine. About what you’d expect growing up in a family like mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded carefully. While her own background coming from a modest household could not be more different than Agatha’s wealthy upbringing, she had met enough Kennedy-esque families in her time in politics to know better than to assume that all that glitters is gold.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re not in touch with your mother, is that correct?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha winced, and only nodded in response. Billy looked down. Rio wondered how well he truly knew her. She hadn’t asked him to step outside while they covered these questions, which did not go unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio changed the topic. “Tell me about your relationship with Ralph. How did you two meet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You read my file, we met in law school.” Agatha poured herself another glass of wine. Rio hadn’t noticed until then how quickly she’d downed the first. She needed to find a way to make her more comfortable so she would open up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about this?” Rio began, “Since we’ll be working in close proximity for the next couple of months, I think it’s only fair you get to know me as well. If you answer one of my questions, you get to ask one in return.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I get to ask, too?” Billy chimed in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” they both replied in unison, though neither one meant it harshly. Rio used this as an opportunity to smile and roll up her sleeves, as if bracing herself for the incoming assault of questions. Agatha’s eyes immediately fell to her arms and hands, then took another sip of her wine to hide a blush. Something inside Rio stirred, warm and pleasant. She wondered if Agatha was aware of the effect she had on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Stay on track
     </em>
     .
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You go first, ask me anything you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for a moment, then she asked, “How did your parents die?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Not what I expected.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My dad got into a freak accident at work when I was 6. He worked in construction. I don’t remember much about it, but my mom never recovered from the grief. She was diagnosed with cancer when I was in college, and died 2 years later, a month before I graduated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That must have been really hard for you,” she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was, but therapy works miracles,” Rio replied, “and throughout my life I’ve had other people I could lean on, who stepped up when I needed them. They made things easier.”
     <br/>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My turn. Why did you go to law school?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wanted to change the world,” Agatha replied sarcastically, but upon seeing Rio’s frown, she reconsidered. “I’ve always liked the law. Rules, procedures, they’re predictable.” She paused. “And I actually did want to help people… corporate law may be my day job, but I take immense pride on my pro bono work. I’ve partnered with a number of nonprofits throughout the years, providing legal advice to vulnerable women and children in domestic violence situations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      There it is again,
     </em>
     Rio thought. Underneath that tough, impenetrable exterior there was a lot of softness and care in her. This was
     <em>
      bunny-mom Agatha,
     </em>
     and Rio really liked this side of her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” Rio said, then motioned with her hand that it was Agatha’s turn again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you get into political consulting?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought her answer for a moment. “It kind of just… happened. I was fresh out of college and looking for a challenge. I wanted to get out of Chicago, since my mom had just died. A close friend was relocating to DC to work for the State Department, so I helped her move across the country. I interviewed at a couple of firms and companies while I was here. I was too green for anything other than an internship or a boring entry-level job. Then, one of my interviewers offered me to work on a small congressional campaign in Rhode Island. A suburban mom whose kid had died in a school shooting, running against the incumbent in a very conservative district with the full backing of the NRA. A true underdog. No one expected her to win, but we fought tooth and nail to sway voters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did she win?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. But we came really close. Closer than her opponent even thought possible. I felt like I’d failed her, so I stuck around and worked with Moms Demand Action and other local grassroots activists. I lived with the candidate and her family for a little over a year. I felt like I was a cross between an au-pair and a campaign manager during that time, but we built a network of like-minded individuals. When she ran again the following year, people knew who she was. The donors came without us asking. And we ousted the incumbent by a margin of over 30 points.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy whistled, clearly impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I came back to DC with my head held high, as her chief of staff. Then I was recruited to run larger campaigns.” Rio made a gesture with her arms as if saying ‘the rest is history.’
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave Billy a wink, then finished her wine. She was feeling a bit tipsy, pleasantly buzzed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to know more about your relationship with Ralph.” It wasn’t a question, but an open invitation for her to share whatever she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finished her second glass in one gulp.
     <em>
      My God, this woman truly did hate talking about her personal life.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We met during my second year at Yale. He was a year ahead. We came from different worlds. My dad knew the Dean, and got the governor at the time to write me a recommendation letter so I would get in.” Agatha huffed in discontent, clear that she hadn’t appreciated the lack of confidence from her father in her own abilities.
     <br/>
     “We met at a party. We were celebrating the end of finals, and some of the guys were getting a bit… handsy. Ralph intervened and got punched in the face for his trouble. We spent the night in the ER while they patched him up, talking. He felt out of place because of his background and because he was on a scholarship. I told him about my own anxieties coming from a well-known family. We kinda clicked. He was kind, and funny, and made me feel like I could truly be myself with him, no reputation or family legacy to uphold. He became my best friend. We got engaged the next year and married two months after I graduated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sounded sincere, but there was a tinge of sadness in her voice.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And now?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now what?” Agatha fired back sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How is your relationship with him now?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked away before answering. “Twenty-five years is a long time. We’ve both changed. We’ve adapted to all the complications life threw our way. The elections… changed us both. We’ve always been on different sides of the aisle, but he’s drifted further away over the last decade. It changed how I saw him. What he wanted from us, from me, changed too. But we both ultimately agree that we are stronger together. We manage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could reply, the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll get it!” Billy said cheerfully, darting out of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not as bad as it sounds,” Agatha said while she collected the wine glasses and putting them in the sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But…?” Rio pushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I would be lying if I said this didn’t scare me. He’s going down a path that I’m not sure I can follow. For all his faults, he has always respected me and my wishes. I was very hesitant about his Senate run, but we came to an understanding. This time feels… different. The people who are backing him are more extreme, for lack of a better word. He’s always been ambitious and determined, but now…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now you feel like you might get burned.” Rio finished. Agatha nodded.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should go out there,” Rio motioned towards the living room, “But remember what I said this morning. About figuring out what you want. You have agency here. Never forget that.”

    <p>
     Over the course of the following two hours, Rio understood the warnings about Agatha’s darker, more intimidating side.
    </p>
    <p>
     It started shortly after Alice and Jen arrived, after the latter made a snarky comment about Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is there a child here?” Jen inquired, outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not a child, I just turned eighteen, actually,” Billy corrected her, cowering a bit under Jen’s stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry,
     <em>
      teen
     </em>
     ,” the last word laced with skepticism and condescension. “Why is there a
     <em>
      teen
     </em>
     here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was about to jump in and explain, but Agatha was faster. Maybe it was the two glasses of wine that she’d downed in less than half an hour immediately prior, or maybe there was a little angry monster right under the surface waiting to bear its fangs at any time, but Agatha pounced before anyone else had a chance to react.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me be perfectly clear with you,
     <em>
      Jen
     </em>
     ,” Agatha’s tone was laced with venom. “In the past, I left you alone because you were working for my husband and
     <em>
      he
     </em>
     needed you. I did not, and still do not, need
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . I do not trust you, and more importantly, I do not
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     you. I will not have you questioning my decisions in my own home. Is that clear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen stared down at Agatha defiantly. “Then let us both be on the same page. I do not want to be here, in fact, I plan to be here as little as possible. I have much better things to do with my time than holding your hand during interviews and stroking your ego when your feelings get hurt. Why do you think Lilia
     <em>
      begged
     </em>
     Rio to take you on? Nobody at The Coven wanted to work with you. Even Lilia, who somehow,
     <em>
      inexplicably
     </em>
     , likes you, knows how insufferable you are to work with.”
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio’s surprise, it was Alice who rushed to stand between the two women. “Alright, how about we all take a step back and take deep breaths for a moment? We’re all on the same team here. And you
     <em>
      will
     </em>
     find a way to put aside your differences to see this through, do you hear me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s nostrils were still flaring, and Jen looked like she wanted to tear her head off, but they both took a step back. Jen flashed Rio a quick look that screamed ‘See what I mean? Total bitch’.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good, I’m glad we got that out of the way,” Alice said. Rio was beyond impressed with the petite woman, whose red streaks in her hair shone brightly under the living room lights. When she turned and walked past Jen, Rio saw the look Alice gave her, a mixture of understanding and firmness, the kind one would award their partner when they were being rowdy.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the opportunity to steer the ship into safer waters. “How about order some takeout and get more comfortable before we get started?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen nodded noncommittally and stepped away to place an order for the group on her phone. Billy and Alice announced they were grabbing some drinks and disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Agatha and Rio alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For the record,” Rio said softly, “I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to work with you now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed in disbelief. “You are literally getting paid to say that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like…” Rio stopped herself from saying ‘you’, “what I’ve seen so far. You’re tough and driven, sure, but you care about the people around you. You look after them. Politicians usually care only about themselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared at Rio, as if she couldn’t believe what the younger woman had just said to her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Besides,” Rio continued, “I don’t usually get to hang out with cute bunnies at work, and I have a feeling I can get used to Señor Scratchy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Agatha laughed in earnest. She seemed to have relaxed a bit after her altercation with Jen, and before her brain had caught up with her body, Rio had placed a reassuring hand on Agatha’s arm. Their eyes immediately locked in response, and Rio could’ve sworn Agatha was holding her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the feeling of Agatha’s warm skin under her sweater, Rio’s heart started hammering in her chest, and her next words came out almost like a whisper.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can trust me. We’ve got this.” She gently squeezed her arm, before removing her hand completely. Against her better judgement, Rio discretely took a whiff of Agatha’s perfume. She smelled like flowers in Spring, intoxicating in the most delicious way. It made her mouth water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew at that precise moment that she was
     <em>
      utterly fucked
     </em>
     .
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Our main concern regarding your public image isn’t from a professional standpoint
     <em>
      per se
     </em>
     . Your success as an attorney speaks for itself and we vetted your clients last time,” Alice chimed in after reviewing some of the documents they’d brought with them from the office over Chinese food. “So unless you’ve taken on war criminals as clients over the past two years, I think you’re safe on that front.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen spoke up. “We’re worried Ralph’s opponents will try to paint you as a career-obsessed feminist who prioritized her professional advancement over more traditional gender roles. They’ll use that to question his masculinity and his commitment to promoting family values. Which is, after all, what the people running his campaign are going for.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s utter bullshit,” Agatha replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Rio said quickly. “We’re just trying to get ahead of the narrative and anticipate what we’ll be up against. There’s a possibility, if Ralph underperforms in Iowa that the other campaigns won’t go negative right away. But we want to get you in front of a friendly reporter sooner rather than later and have your version out first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My version of what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For instance, why you and Ralph didn’t have kids.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s none of their fucking business,” Agatha spat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’ll try to make it everyone’s business. They’ll attack Ralph through you wherever they see an opening. And they’ll start with the low-hanging fruit,” Jen added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a minute to calm herself down before speaking again. “I didn’t want kids. I didn't want to fuck them up the way everyone around me growing up fucked up theirs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did Ralph want kids?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For a while, yes. Eventually he realized he could focus all his leftover energy on his political pursuits instead and dropped it. Happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Jen replied tersely. “Alright, so if you’re asked about it, whatever you do, don’t say
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s the truth!” Agatha yelled indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The truth as it stands right now is kindling to his opponents’ fire. They’ll make it sounds like you have Ralph on a leash, like you hold all the power in your relationship. Let’s come up with another answer to that question,” Rio reasoned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wow, so we’re lying right off the bat,” Agatha fumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re pivoting,” Rio replied calmly. “You can say you tried for kids, but were unsuccessful. Don’t go into too much detail so they can’t put you on the spot. Most self-respecting reporters won’t prod. You’ve worked with children in your pro bono work, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” she said, displeased. “What about them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How does working with children make you feel, on a personal level?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like I made the right call not bringing any of my own into the fucked up world we live in,” she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Work with me, please” Rio said, her patience slipping, “Is there anything we can use to highlight your maternal instincts?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s a great godmother,” Billy interjected. “She always made me feel at home here while my parents were away for work.” He turned to look at her, “You were the first person I came out to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood up abruptly and raised her arms. “Absolutely not, Billy, I’m not dragging you into this mess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about this,” Rio regrouped, “You and Ralph were not able to conceive a child of your own, so you poured your heart into your relationships with your friends and their kids. You helped mothers and children who had suffered get a fresh start. You
     <em>
      channelled
     </em>
     your unsuccessful attempts to form a family into your chosen family, your godson and the people who needed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like Rio said, we’re trying to pivot,” Jen added, “some of those things are true, some others are not quite. We skirt over the parts that aren’t true and expand on those that are. No one’s actually going to ask about
     <em>
      how hard
     </em>
     you tried to conceive, they’d get crucified for it as being insensitive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t like it,” Agatha finally responded, “but I guess if someone were to ask me about it… I could say that instead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Finally,” Jen said. “Alright, moving on— few people noticed you didn’t spend much time around Ralph during his other races. We need to strike a balance between showing up at enough events that people can put a face to the name, but not too many so we don’t invite the press in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sharon and I discussed this earlier,” Rio jumped in, “they would like you to be next to him when he formally announces his run, and at two rallies or campaign events between now and February. They didn’t push for more guest appearances.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay…?” Agatha began.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They saw some of the pictures from the last cycle and they’re concerned about the way you looked at Ralph in them,” Rio finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You looked irritated, at him, at his campaign staff, even at the centerpieces at the event,” Jen filled in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     irritated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t
     <em>
      look it
     </em>
     this time. They’ll speculate over the state of your marriage. They’ll dig for any salacious details from anyone you or Ralph have ever worked with.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate this.” Agatha’s indignation had morphed into defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We didn’t find anything when we looked,” Alice said cautiously, “but is there anything to be found? If I may be so bold, you two looked miserable together every time I saw you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about Ralph’s abrupt departure earlier that evening. Her mind wandered while they waited for Agatha’s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know,” she said earnestly. “I haven’t cheated, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Has he? When was the last time you fucked your husband?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “JEN!” Alice and Rio exclaimed at her bluntness.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it’s time to call it a night,” Rio said, getting up and picking at the empty food containers on the table in an effort to create a distraction and disperse the tension.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agreed,” Alice added. “Agatha, Rio will continue going over some of these things with you in the coming days. Just try to hang in there. We’ll fill in Lilia, but I think we’re on the right track.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She and Jen quickly gathered up their things and headed for the door. Billy asked Alice for a ride back to his parents’ house, and she agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the second time that evening, a still-shocked Agatha was left alone with Rio. They finished collecting the containers in silence, both of them caught in their own thoughts. Finally, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t remember.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Rio asked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The last time we slept together, I don’t remember. Maybe two years ago… or maybe even longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You think he may be having an affair?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You seem very calm about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sex was never the most important thing in our marriage,” Agatha said wistfully, “that’s not to say we didn’t sleep together, but for us it’s always been more about companionship. It was never passionate love between us, but rather the love that comes with letting someone see the parts of you that nobody else does. The good and the bad. We’ve always looked out for each other, and that’s where our strength as a couple was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared, suppressing a pang of jealousy that ran through her as she listened to her talk about her life with a man she already despised.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had never worried about him looking for more outside our marriage until he got elected.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But now you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now I don’t know what to think. I don’t recognize him sometimes. The things he says, the way he acts. Around me. Even around Billy, who truly looked up to him growing up. The shit he’s said about the queer community to get a couple minutes of headlines on the news cycle. I spent hours with Billy, reassuring him that Ralph didn’t actually mean what he said. That it was a political move, that he was safe with us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why are you still married?
     </em>
     Rio wanted to ask but held her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if sensing her thoughts, Agatha said, “We’ve been through a lot together. Our lives are almost inextricably connected. We both have and still benefit from our union most of the time. You may not know this, but his first election was primarily self-funded. Mostly with the money I brought into the marriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not know that, she hadn’t looked into the previous campaigns’ finances.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And things with my family… have always been difficult. I don’t know where I would be today without him,” she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and didn’t push for more details. Agatha tried to cover up a yawn but failed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should get some rest,” Rio said, “I’ll text you in the morning and arrange for a time to stop by before noon.”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave her a friendly smile, “This is a marathon, not a sprint. We’ll take it one day at a time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, her eyes betraying her exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio waved as she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodnight… Rio.”

     Rio entered her hotel suite, tossed her shoes off to a corner and sat down on the loveseat by the window with a sigh. She thought about calling room service so they could send up a drink, but before she could move, her phone buzzed with a notification.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Working from home tomorrow-- come whenever - A
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd never been one for excessive dramatic reactions, but her subconscious instincts kicked in and she grabbed the nearest decorative pillow and screamed into it in frustration. She had only spent one day in the presence of this woman and she could already feel her control slipping. She needed to get her out of her system, sooner rather than later, so she could focus on her work. She grabbed her phone and flung herself onto the queen sized bed.
     <em>
      Stop behaving like a horny teenager
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sounds good. Get some rest, Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't resist using her name. The way she'd reacted a couple of hours prior had caused her own pulse to spike. She'd loved the way it sounded coming out of her mouth, she wanted to say it over and over, whisper it when they were alone...
     <em>
      No, Jesus Christ, get a fucking grip.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw the unmistakable three dots signaling that Agatha was typing a response, but then they disappeared. Rio overanalyzed this minuscule hesitation.
     <em>
      Maybe, just maybe, it isn't all in my head
     </em>
     . When she finally fell asleep, she dreamed of strong hands, long brown hair and piercing blue eyes.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     "Morning!" Billy greeted her as soon she walked through the door around 10 a.m. "Ooo, are those pastries I see?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have at it, kid," Rio smiled casually while Billy took the box of baked goods to the sitting area. Agatha was barefoot, wearing a similar outfit to the one she'd donned the previous evening, pacing around the living room while talking tersely to someone over the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bad morning?" Rio asked Billy curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She's having a hard time replacing me," he answered as he devoured a croissant in less than 3 bites. Agatha overheard him and rolled her eyes. She covered the microphone on her phone before chiming in, "I just need to find someone moderately competent to keep my practice afloat for 4 weeks, and no one at the firm is interested in being a team player."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not exactly shocking," Billy tried and failed to say quietly, "HR hates to see her coming. They probably have an entire drawer dedicated to her."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just assign
     <em>
      anyone
     </em>
     with half a brain to work on my clients," Agatha yelled, "it's $5 million a year in billable hours, I'm sure you will figure something out," she added before hanging up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed her phone on the table, and Rio saw her nose wrinkle minutely as she took in the smell of the pastries and watched her eyes dart to the box. Then, to Rio's surprise, she shook her head and took a sip of her mug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So," Rio changed the topic, "there are a couple of things I want to go over today, now that it's just the two of us."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Three," Billy said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, three," Rio said with a wink. "I want to get a small profile piece out by the end of the week. Mostly on your professional life, but throw in a couple of carefully selected personal details so it isn't too impersonal. I have a reporter in mind, I'll see if she's available tomorrow afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So soon?" Agatha's tone was guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I got an email from Sharon this morning, they want to announce the run on the 11th. That leaves us with under a week to prep and get something out before everyone looks our way."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha visibly flinched. Rio noticed the bags under her eyes were puffier than yesterday, she looked she hadn't gotten much sleep. She felt the urge to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know this feels overwhelming right now, but I promise you it will be okay. There are 4 other candidates in the race already, and your husband's team suspects 3 more might join, so we won't be the center of attention for long. Plus, you know, there's also the Democratic candidates grabbing headlines as well."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked away, clearly caught in her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shall we go over what the next couple of weeks are going to look like now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and motioned to Billy to take notes on his iPad.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The announcement next Monday will be here in DC, I haven't confirmed the time yet, but we should block the entire day off since we'll probably get a lot of requests for comments and interviews afterwards. Your husband has requested you be at his side during the announcement, and then he'll be heading back to Ohio to officially open his local campaign office. After that he's going to alternate between Iowa, New Hampshire and D.C. to run campaign events for 12 days. I think you should join him at one of them, perhaps a fundraiser or something behind closed doors where you won't have a microphone shoved in your face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We should have preliminary polling data for the caucuses before Christmas. Where do you two normally spend the holidays?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "At Wanda's," Agatha replied, "And I would like for that to stay that way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll make sure his team knows that," Rio added quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where do you spend the holidays?" Billy asked, reminding Rio that he was still in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't usually do anything special, I'm usually away working on campaigns."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You should definitely come to our place then! I'll talk to my mom, I'm sure she'll be thrilled to have you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I uh..." Rio began but looked like a deer caught in the headlights for a moment. She made eye contact with Agatha and instead of her usual sternness she saw something much softer, gentle even. "Sure, yeah, that would be nice, thank you." She felt herself growing warm with a blush, so she cleared her throat and continued.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Iowa caucus is on the 15th of January, New Hampshire on the 23rd. Assuming everything goes well-- and by that I mean wrong for your husband-- he should be dropping out no later than the 25th."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's a relief, right Agatha?" Billy asked kindly. Rio got the impression he knew her much better than everyone else around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What if he wins either one?" She asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think based on his current numbers, fourth place in Iowa is his best possible outcome. Something radical would need to change for him to do better than that. And even then, he wouldn't have been in the race long enough to build momentum beyond those two states, so in the unlikely event he does well, it's still a long uphill climb. And I don't know how much money that conservative think tank has earmarked for his presidential campaign, but it's hard to imagine he'd be able to carry on without any major financial support from donors. I still don't know what their game is, but at the moment it's not pressing that we figure it out."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay," Agatha exhaled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay," Rio repeated. "Let me call the reporter, and then we can go over some interview questions. Would you be okay with a photographer coming here and taking some pictures inside the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sure, whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Great, I'll be back in a few."
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     When Rio returned 15 minutes later, Señor Scratchy was in Agatha's arms, cooing at him softly and rubbing her nose on his furry head. Her eyes were half-closed, breathing softly and seemingly lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     She noticed Rio and said softly, "I asked Billy to go pick up some lunch for us. He should be back in a bit. What did the reporter say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "She's eager to work with you," Rio replied, "and she agreed to give us the opportunity to review the piece before it's published."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's awfully nice of her."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not really, she knows she's getting a scoop here and I made it clear you would not be very accessible after the campaign is announced. She knows how the game is played."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sounds like
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     know her well."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up and saw Agatha studying her carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can ask me anything, as long as I get to ask something in return," Rio echoed her words from last night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't hesitate this time. "Were you romantically involved with the reporter who will be interviewing me tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she answered truthfully, "that's also how I know she won't screw us."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her expression was unreadable. It made Rio squirm and she weighed her next question carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does that make you uncomfortable?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she answered quickly,
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     <em>
      quickly
     </em>
     , and backtracked immediately, "I mean, no, not really, if it's a thing of the past... is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, we dated a long time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," Agatha exhaled and Rio hadn't even realized she had been holding her breath. Was she
     <em>
      jealous
     </em>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that night, when she was lying in bed alone, she would replay the next interaction ad nauseam, questioning what prompted her do it and beating herself for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a step closer to Agatha, until they were merely inches away from each other and said softly, "You have nothing to worry about... for the next couple of weeks, the sole center of my attention is you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I.." Agatha shivered, then opened her mouth and closed it, at a loss for words. She looked almost vulnerable, a tinge of sadness coloring her features. Rio reached out and placed her hand over hers where she has holding the bunny up. She gave her a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't move away, her gaze on their joined hands. She was breathing unevenly and looked affected by Rio's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not alone," Rio whispered softly. Agatha's eyes softened even more and she leaned closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Scratchy kicked his hind legs into Agatha's abdomen, causing her to flinch and bend forwards, where the bunny jumped off and scurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a step back, regaining some modicum of decorum and control over her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was clearly also affected, because she mumbled some apology and followed the rabbit out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy couldn't come back soon enough.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Four hours later, they had settled on a list of topics that Agatha felt comfortable talking about (her pro bono work, her charity work) and those to be avoided at all costs (her family). Rio didn't press on the latter, but wondered how long it would take for someone to start digging up on her past to use it against her husband. While everyone has secrets that they hold close to their chest, Rio wondered if she should press her for context so they don't get blindsided. Agatha had taken a client call in the afternoon and Rio had tentatively asked Billy about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Between you and I, kid, should I be worried about Agatha's family?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy swallowed. "I've only met Evanora once, maybe 5 years ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waited for him to go on. "I knew from my mom that things between the two of them had been tense since her dad died... but that woman's a monster, there's no other way to put it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't remember all the details, but I was hanging out here after school when she came over and I overheard their argument. Evanora said something about Agatha being responsible for her dad dying, and that she was embarrassed that she was her daughter. I remember she said Agatha was 'born evil' and that everything was her fault."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flinched, partly at the realization of why bringing up her family was off limits, but mostly at the harsh, punishing words from her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To the best of my knowledge, they haven't spoken since," Billy said. Then, clearing some tension, he added, "I only just realized that that's probably why mom got her Scratchy a couple of weeks later."

    <p>
     The interview went almost without a glitch. Rio and Billy stood together a couple of feet away to give Agatha some space, but every now and then she would look their way and Billy would shoot her a double thumbs up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reporter, Cara Thompson, was calm and patient, and even made an effort to break the ice to make Agatha feel more comfortable. On two separate occasions, Agatha expressed that she wasn’t comfortable sharing more details than the ones she’d volunteered, and Cara hadn’t prodded or pushed. They discussed at length Agatha’s work with domestic violence and sexual abuse survivors, and she delivered a handful of top-notch sound bites on the importance of defending and believing the victims.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unsurprisingly, given the political climate and her husband’s past statements on family values, the journalist did ask Agatha about her lack of children. Her face remained impassive as she delivered a convincing version of the truth Jen and Rio had come up with.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Senator Bohner has been quite outspoken when it comes to traditional family models and spoken against adoptions and births by same-sex couples. Do you share his views on the matter?" Cara’s tone had dropped into a more serious one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not, but I’m not the one running for public office, he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have his public statements affected your relationship with him? Would you vote for him, if he wasn’t your spouse?”
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was, the question Rio was hoping Cara wouldn’t ask. She took a small step forward, possibly to intervene if things got heated, but Agatha remained calm in a way Rio hadn’t seen before when asked personal questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a delicate situation, supporting your husband even when you don’t agree on all issues. But I know the man I married, and I have confidence in his ability to do the right thing if and when the time comes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was certain that after the piece came out, she would like get dozens of calls from Bohner’s campaign staff, Agatha’s answer would be seen as subpar by them. But it felt truthful to Rio, in a way that didn’t compromise Agatha’s values while still showing her support for him.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, Ms. Harkness, for your time. Let’s break for an hour while the photographer gets ready for the shoot. Rio, a word?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched out of the corner of her eye as Billy brought Agatha a cup of tea and whispered some words of reassurance. She followed Cara into the backyard, where the snow had melted overnight. The perfectly kept garden still looked stunning, even though none of the flowers were in bloom. The air was quite chilly, and Rio instantly regretted not grabbing a coat.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your girl did good,” Cara said with a smile, digging into her pockets to pull out a cigarette pack and a lighter. “She’s clearly smarter than most of the political spouses I’ve interviewed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Most?” Rio asked cheekily, grabbing the cigarette Cara had just offered her and bringing it up to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cara smiled. “How have you been?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you know, busy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember. Still living out of a suitcase?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yup.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I do not miss that life,” Cara said, “I’m too old for it now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, hush,” Rio lightly jabbed her side, “How’s the wife?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very pregnant and sick of it,” she laughed. “I can’t blame her though, I would’ve made everyone around me miserable if I’d carried the kid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you would’ve had to quit smoking,” Rio added, “I’m pretty sure that would’ve done you in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Technically, I gave it up when we conceived, so please don’t tell anyone about this,” she motioned to their hands with a huff. “Old habits.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio made the gesture for ‘my lips are sealed’, then put out her cigarette in a nearby ashtray.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to ask, off the record,” Cara said seriously. “Why would a queer woman stay married to an asshole like Bohner?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was definitely taken by surprise by the blunt question. “She’s not gay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “At the very least, she’s bi,” Cara said nonchalantly. “I’m not surprised she’s closeted, with a husband like that and the family legacy to uphold.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I… don’t know what you’re talking about.” Rio had started to shiver, and she hoped it was only due to the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cara shot her a look of disbelief, then put out her own cigarette with her shoe. “Fine, don’t tell me, I would never out anyone anyway. But if I were her, I’d bolt before someone less principled than me decides to make a splash.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was too stunned to speak.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Cara squeezed her shoulder and headed back inside, leaving Rio out in the cold, alone with her thoughts. She was right about how damaging it could be for Agatha if someone decided to break that story.
     <em>
      But it’s not even true
     </em>
     , she thought. She wondered if she should ask her upfront about it.
     <em>
      I’m sure that would go down well, “Hey Agatha, are you by any chance a closeted lesbian?”
     </em>
     She would almost certainly get her head chewed off.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     But then Rio was replaying some of their interactions over the past 3 days and the idea seemed more plausible. After all, Rio was beyond affected by the woman’s presence in a way she had rarely felt around straight women. She didn’t want to scare her off, burn down the fragile bridge she’d built with her, but she also knew that she needed to know so she could do her job.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Not now, it’s too soon
     </em>
     , she decided.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It took some convincing to get Agatha to swap her business clothes for a more relaxed attire for the photoshoot. They were upstairs, going through her closet, with Agatha pulling dress shirt after dress shirt from the drawers and showing them to Rio. Every time Rio would point at a sweater and casual pants, Agatha would growl and dig deeper into her closet.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re trying to paint you in a new light,” Rio insisted, “less ‘I’m the boss’, more ‘come in for tea and biscuits’.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate that, I don’t want anybody thinking they can come over for tea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed in earnest. “Like we discussed a couple of nights ago, we think your husband’s opponents will try to weaponize your success to belittle him. We’re feeding the press a softer version of you before they can do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do you call him that?” Agatha paused the assault on her closet drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pardon?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s always ‘your husband’ or ‘Senator Bohner’ but never Ralph. Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Because I don’t like him,
     </em>
     Rio thought,
     <em>
      and that’s the nicest thing I can muster to call him.
      <span>
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m trying to maintain a bit of professionalism here,” Rio laughed it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed. “You have no problem calling me by my first name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you rather I call you Ms. Harkness? Ma’am?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw some dark playfulness cross Agatha’s face and she felt her mouth watering at the sight.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned around to hide her face, and her eyes landed on a turtleneck, light grey cashmere sweater. She pulled it off the hanger and handed it to Agatha.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why this one?” She pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s nice,” Rio answered simply. “Just try it on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed it gently along with the pants Rio had in her other hand and walked into the ensuite bathroom. When she emerged, Rio was staring and the word ‘perfect’ came out of her mouth before she could stop it. Filthy images burst into her mind of her grabbing her ass (which looked fantastic in those pants), running her fingertips over the soft fabric of her top, then softly pulling it off to reveal her perfect breasts. Rio was wet beyond measure and she prayed that Agatha couldn’t sense it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she definitely did notice, however, were Rio’s eyes, which were still fixated on her chest. She cleared her throat, which pulled Rio out of her reveries. She was too turned on to be embarrassed, and much to her surprise, the playful, no, teasing look from before was back. What Rio wouldn’t give to call the shoot off and spend the rest of the afternoon on her knees, between her legs. She needed a long cold shower (or a warm one, with a detachable shower head).
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shall we?” Agatha asked with a soft smile, sounding more confident than before she changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded dumbly, not trusting herself to open her mouth. Agatha placed her hand on the small of Rio’s back and guided her down the stairs.
     <em>
      This is a bad idea, you can’t fuck your clients, especially the high-profile married ones, oh my God, what am I doing
     </em>
     .
     <em>
      Maybe I should call Lilia,
     </em>
     she thought desperately,
     <em>
      call it quits before I lose my mind
     </em>
     . But then she realized how ridiculous it would sound to tell her former boss and mentor that she was quitting because she wasn’t sure she could keep it in her pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy was waiting at the landing and Agatha removed her hand immediately. Rio missed the warmth and Billy, ever so perceptive, raised a questioning eyebrow at the two of them.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The photoshoot took 4 hours (which was 3 hours longer than originally scheduled), mostly because Agatha’s discomfort was showing in every picture. At the beginning, she had insisted in more formal poses, but after Billy blurted out that she had a ‘resting bitch face’ (earning a sharp, scolding look from Rio and Cara), she alternated between scowling at the camera and looking away from it. They had to take multiple breaks during which Rio and Billy had tried to loosen her up a bit, eventually resorting to alcohol to calm her nerves. Two shots of tequila later (
     <em>
      off the record
     </em>
     , Rio insisted firmly), Agatha had a soft blush on her cheeks and looked visibly more relaxed, but they were still failing at getting her to smile. They only needed one good picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The idea popped into Rio’s head, remembering their exchange earlier. She approached her quietly, where Agatha was leaning leisurely on her kitchen counter, and made sure to stay out of the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep your eyes on the camera,” she whispered so nobody else could hear, “Ms. Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The desired effect was immediate. Her features softened and a relaxed, natural smile graced her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great!” The photographer shouted as he snapped the picture, clearly exhausted. “That one works, we can wrap up here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped back and took a look at the picture that had just been taken. Agatha looked confident, happy and determined. It was, in fact, exactly what they needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     After Cara and the photographer had packed up and said their goodbyes, Billy, Agatha and Rio found themselves alone once again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy was the first to speak. “I’m so so sorry about earlier.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay, don’t sweat about it,” Agatha replied. “It’s not like you were wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it still okay with you if I stay here tonight? I understand if you’d rather I go home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy, I didn’t kick you out when you used our silk wallpaper as your canvas when you were younger. I’m certainly not changing precedent tonight,” she added with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loved watching the two of them interact. Their exchanges reminded her of her mom, before she got sick.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “In that case, I’m going to take a shower and call Eddie, see if he wants to come over tonight,” he said, “Goodnight, Rio, see you tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have fun with your boyfriend, kid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not too much fun, I don’t want a repeat of Christmas 2021!” Agatha called after him. “I haven’t fully recovered from that yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought the house was empty!” Billy yelled as he ran upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I want to know?” Rio giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely not, and if I could erase those images from my mind, I would in an instant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen, about earlier,” Rio began, “I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For a split second I thought you were going to call me your
     <em>
      good girl
     </em>
     ,” Agatha said cheekily, emboldened by the lingering effects of the tequila.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t dare,” Rio laughed. “Better not start any rumors of our own.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t deter Agatha. “Maybe you should stop staring at my tits, too, that certainly would give people the wrong impression.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m so sorry,” Rio blurted out, “I didn’t mean to, I just…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cut her off, “It’s okay, I’m flattered.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her brain caught up with her mouth too late as she recalled her conversation with Cara. “Agatha, I need to ask you something important.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze in her tracks and waited for Rio to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it’s none of my business, but I need to know if… if there are any women out there who may approach the press.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not following.” Agatha was stiff as a board.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe an old flame, before you got married,” Rio said, wishing the earth would swallow her whole. “Because…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you asking me right now?” She interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh my God, she’s going to make me say it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, are you closeted?” Rio regretted asking instantly. She should’ve followed her earlier hunch to wait.
     <em>
      I fucked up
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, unkindly this time. She shook her head, then Rio felt like she was staring straight into her soul, all traces of kindness had vanished. “Was this your master plan? To get a couple of drinks in me and hope I’d reveal myself to you? You think you know me because we’ve spent what, 72 hours together? Because I didn’t call you out earlier when I caught you staring? You mistook my leniency for interest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words cut so deeply Rio thought she might cry. But Agatha wasn’t done.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me be perfectly clear, so you know where we stand right now. I don’t want any of this. I don’t want anyone, including you, in my life. And I’m starting to suspect Lilia was wrong, that this whole thing was a mistake. I think you should leave now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, please…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t know me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re right, I don’t. But I want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Just leave. Find another campaign to work on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop, just stop.” Rio noticed the emotion in her voice for the first time. She also looked like she was holding back tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stared at each other for a moment, and Rio couldn’t keep the tears at bay any longer, she felt them running down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry,” she said, “I won’t come back. I’ll let Lilia know to send someone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Not wanting to embarrass herself any longer, Rio grabbed her bag and left the house. She called an Uber when she was outside, and sobbed all the way back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d quit, no, had been fired, from a campaign for the first time in her professional career. But all she could focus on was how heartbroken she felt. How she was right, this woman she barely knew, had so quickly wormed her way into her heart. Rio cried herself to sleep.

    <p>
     Rio slept in, since she’d forgotten to set up an alarm. She delayed getting up and facing the day for as long as she could. When she finally rolled out of bed, she went straight to the shower and desperately tried to scrub the shame she felt from her body. She had pushed against her better judgement. And she was embarrassed to admit where this
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to know had come from. Because as hard as she tried to justify her actions as part of her job, she knew deep down why she wanted to know if Agatha liked women. She hoped, during some of their interactions, that the feelings were mutual. It was wrong, and she had clearly, unequivocally, fucked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts drifted to Lilia and she wanted to throw up then and there. She had trusted her with Agatha, and it had taken her less than a week to get kicked out of her home. Rio wondered if Agatha had called her the minute she left her house. She partly hoped so, just to spare her the embarrassment of being the one to break it to Lilia.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She spent so much time scrubbing her body in the shower that most of it was swollen and irritated by the time she was done. She got out, dried off and then called room service to order some breakfast. She should probably call one of her friends in DC and see if she could stay with them for a couple of nights until she had a new assignment. Hopefully something that would take her as far away from Agatha as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard a knock at the door, and an employee rolled in a cart with her food. She turned on the TV and zapped between CNN, MSNBC and FOX News to catch up on the news cycle. Three cups of coffee later, she felt ready to face the music. The clock on the bedside table informed her it was well past noon, and she got up and tried to remember where she’d left her phone last night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She found it face down, under the pillows on the loveseat. She wondered briefly how many missed calls and texts from Lilia and Jen awaited her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     But instead, there were only a handful of emails from the Bohner campaign, and a text from an unknown number sent around 2 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey Rio, it’s Billy. I talked to Agatha. Can you come by later today?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She typed up a response quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sorry, kid. I got fired. I can let you know who’s replacing me once I know more.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy began typing right away but a reply didn’t come for a couple of minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You’re not fired. She hasn’t called anyone yet. She reluctantly admits she could’ve handled things differently. It’s just a touchy subject, as you can probably tell. Please come back.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt tears blooming in her eyes again. This time she was certain working with her was a bad idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Can’t. It’s not a good fit for me. Sorry.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She started typing up an email to Lilia explaining what had happened when another text from Billy came through.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She says she’ll double whatever Lilia’s paying you if you come back.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Jesus Christ,
     </em>
     she thought,
     <em>
      what does she want from me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Tell her I signed an NDA, she doesn’t have to worry about me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy didn’t reply for a couple of minutes, so she continued writing her email. She was struggling to find the right words to explain why things had fallen apart so quickly. She was about to hit send when another message came in, this time from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She’d sent Billy her room number at the Kimpton and cleaned up a bit while she waited for them to arrive. She had no interest in ever setting foot in her house again, and figured she would feel more in control in her room. Her plan was simple: smooth things over a bit, come up with a vague explanation of why they couldn’t work together, then call Lilia. And hopefully get an assignment out West.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a knock on the door, and Rio took a moment to take a deep breath before answering.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio’s surprise, Agatha was alone. She’d expected Billy to mediate between the two of them, like he had over the phone earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha came in without Rio asking. She looked around the room for a minute, then proceeded to sit on the very loveseat Rio had cried her eyes out on the previous night. She looked at her expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Right
     </em>
     . “Listen, I’m sorry about last night. It was wrong of me to ask you something so personal so quickly, and believe me when I say I regret it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was stone-faced, unreadable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think Jen and Alice can take over from me. They have the experience and know Bohner a lot better than I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want Jen or Alice,” she said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Lilia herself might be too busy to take you on directly, so they’re the second best thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m… sorry I lashed out,” Agatha conceded, she looked defeated. “And I’m sorry I fired you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay, it’s for the best,” Rio replied quickly. Her pulse was out of control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up and she looked devastatingly sad. “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because… look, we’re not a good fit,” Rio began.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Until last night, you seemed to think we were,” Agatha countered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well, that was then, this is now.” She hated the way she sounded, like a petulant child.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So that’s it? You’re just going to walk away?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.” Her words were final. Agatha seemingly understood them as such, too, because she got up and walked towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio never could just hold her tongue. “For the record, there’s nothing wrong with being gay or bi or whatever it is you are. I’m not embarrassed of who I am or who I love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stopped in her tracks, her fists in balls. “If only it were so simple for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Help me understand, please,” Rio pleaded with her instinctively.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lip quivered, and Agatha bit down on it harshly. “I can’t.” She gave Rio a sad smile, then opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy was waiting on the other side. He took one look at Agatha, then rolled his eyes and gently pushed her back in the room. In a different context, Rio would’ve found it amusing.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The teenager seemed to be more in control of his emotions than the two adult women in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, did she apologize for reacting poorly?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, but…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have another job offer?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great, then come back and work with us until you do. And then I’ll even drive you to the airport if you want to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed at his unrestrained and unfiltered statements.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can make it work, and so can Agatha. So, are you in or out, Vidal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She had never backed away from a challenge, and certainly not from one that came from someone so much younger than her. She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, let’s go, quickly. I double-parked Agatha’s car, and it would look terrible if she got a ticket, wouldn’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pinched her nose as Rio huffed out a laugh.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The rest of the week passed in a blur. Agatha mostly kept to herself in her home office, taking client calls and onboarding her new assistant, while Rio showed Billy memos and strategy details Bohner’s campaign had sent over. She had tasked him with reviewing and indexing some of his talking points and campaign promises to have a better idea of what to expect on Monday. They’d also gotten a list of preliminary events in Iowa he’d been scheduled to attend.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio also got the profile piece from Cara on Friday morning, and she had no notes, it was as good as it could get. She forwarded it to Agatha who replied with a thumbs up emoji. The accompanying photo looked great, so Rio signed off on it and it went up later that day. Their goal wasn’t to grab headlines, but for there to be a reference piece out there ready for the announcement.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The man of the hour finally returned from his field trip late on Sunday night. Upon seeing Billy and Rio working in the living room, with Agatha on the phone in the background, he purposely made a show out of kissing his wife hello. Rio gagged silently. And next to her, Billy cast his eyes down. She made a note to ask him about Bohner privately soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I stopped by Sharon’s office before coming home, everything looks good to go,” he said smugly to no one in particular. “Ags, I think they’re sending someone to do your hair and makeup around 9 tomorrow. The announcement is at 11 on the steps of the Capitol.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Got it,” she replied, still on the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly displeased with the amount of attention he was receiving, he turned to Billy and Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Busy week, eh? It’s only going to get busier from now on,” he said giddily. “How did the interview go?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was fine, I forwarded the published story to Sharon,” Rio replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So I heard, I wish we’d had a chance to review it before it was published, though,” he admonished. “The kids thing was fine, but Ags made it sound like I would ‘come to my senses’ on some issues she disagrees on, which will not go down well with the voters and was not exactly accurate either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy jumped in. “Well, honestly, I kinda hope you do reconsider some of your stances.” This was the most serious Rio had ever seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, Billy, it’s my responsibility as an elected official to represent the views of my constituents, whatever they may be. I may not love
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     of the policies I’ve adopted, but I stand by them in so far as it’s what my people believe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Including that gay marriage is a sin, that trans kids are sick and that women who get abortions should be punished?” Billy was fuming with barely contained anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Those are just things we say in front of the cameras, kid,” Bohner said dismissively, “if you want to marry Eddie one day, I will happily attend your wedding. And between the three of us, I supported Agatha when she had her abortion, so you know I don’t really believe women should be punished.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When did Agatha have an abortion?” Billy asked, shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “RALPH!”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had just gotten off the phone, and looked scandalized at her husband’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph course-corrected, “We probably shouldn’t mention it for a while, even in private, we wouldn’t want it to get out, since it would probably hurt the campaign substantially…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped listening, all she could think of was the woman standing in front of her. She was frozen on the spot.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Bohner mumbled something about ‘getting ready for the big day tomorrow’ and left without much preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy was the first to speak, “Can I hug you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Agatha choked.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry you went through that,” he said softly into her chest. She ran her hand through his hair and placed a soft kiss on top of his head. “Does mom know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded. “Okay, I’m glad you can at least talk to her about it. I’m gonna get Scratch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As he got up, Agatha sat in his place, eyes downcast.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry he said that without checking with you first,” Rio said carefully.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t reply but felt Agatha’s hand on hers. Rio turned hers over so Agatha could hold it. The latter immediately intertwined their fingers.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat, in almost comfortable silence for the next couple of minutes without letting go of her hand, until they saw Billy return. He did not comment on their handholding, mercifully. He placed the bunny gently on the coffee table, then announced he was heading home out of fear he might ‘smother Ralph with a pillow while he’s sleeping’.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you be okay tonight?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll just sleep on the couch in my office, it’s fine.” Clearly Billy wasn’t the only one feeling homicidal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let go of Agatha’s hand. “We’ll get through tomorrow quickly, and then he’ll be on his merry way to Iowa by Tuesday morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me again that everything’s going to be fine, please,” Agatha begged before she left.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It will be. I promise.” Rio hoped it came out reassuring. She was growing more and more worried about Bohner with every passing minute.

    <p>
     There was absolute silence in the town car that had picked them up from the Capitol after the announcement was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia and Rio sat on the front-facing seats, while Agatha and Billy sat across from them. None of them dared to speak first.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a relatively short ride from the Hill to Agatha’s residence, and yet it seemed to take forever. Agatha was looking at the passing vehicles through the window, while Billy just stared at Rio and Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What in the actual fuck just happened?”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <strong>
      3 HOURS EARLIER
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio entered Agatha’s house past 9 a.m., the hair and makeup team was already there. There must have been some sort of altercation right before, because Agatha was scowling and Billy was desperately trying to engage the two beauty professionals in friendly conversation. The one fixing Agatha’s hair seemed more relaxed than the one working on her face, probably due to the constant glares Agatha was shooting her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as she hated to admit it,
     <em>
      spicy Agatha
     </em>
     was Rio’s favorite version of the woman. She was confident, sassy, and didn’t put up with anyone’s shit. Rio loved it, but since the incident on Wednesday, she was doing a much better job at hiding it. The only physical contact between the two of them since then had been initiated by Agatha the previous night.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been furious at Bohner.
     <em>
      How dare he treat his wife with such ill will?
     </em>
     If Agatha had been anyone else, Rio would have reacted more strongly. But considering she had scared her off once already, she bit her tongue and fumed quietly. The fact that Agatha had sought comfort from her, of all people, gave her some hope that they could, in fact, figure out a way forward together. So she let Agatha regain some semblance of control over the situation, at least in her interaction with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to add a little more concealer over here to make the eye bags and crows feet less noticeable,” Rio heard the makeup artist say.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     , she thought,
     <em>
      this girl has a death wish
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m 48 years old, you can’t make me look 20 no matter how much product you fucking use,” Agatha growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m just doing my job as quickly as possible, per your request,” the artist countered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you do it more quietly? I don’t need a run down of all my flaws and wrinkles,” Agatha spat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my God, I love that concealer you’re using, it’s so dewy!” Leave it up to Billy to try to diffuse the tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and went over the notes they’d prepared over the weekend. Bohner’s platform and rhetoric was very similar to that of most of the Republican Party. He’d voted along party lines since his first day in office, and the core of his platform was modeled after the RNC. He was an unsurprising candidate, not quite a moderate within his party, but certainly not the one stirring the pot. The speech that Sharon had sent over (along with a cheerful note about her taking over the campaign manager position permanently) was fairly dull, just more of the same old thing. Big government is bad, taxes are too high, liberals are destroying traditional values that are the foundation of the country.
     <em>
      How sad that this is the new normal
     </em>
     . Still, with three other people in the race already, all more prominent and established than Bohner, he would probably get a couple of hours’ worth of coverage before everyone else moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think we’re good to go,” Rio overheard someone say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled off the paper sheets they’d placed around her neck to keep the makeup from staining her clothes. She was wearing a long sleeve white blouse, deep purple pants and heeled boots, since the temperature was in the low 30s that morning and there was some wind on top of that. There was a long, navy overcoat perched on one of the chairs in the living room to complete the outfit.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hair had been perfectly curled, creating an almost artificially-perfect look. She waited exactly 10 seconds after the crew had left to shake them loose and run a hand through the strands to cut through the products they’d used to keep the curl shape.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She asked bluntly after she heard Rio let out a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised her arms in a sign of defeat, a smile still on her face. Agatha relaxed at that, and continued fixing her hair on a nearby mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have about 15 minutes until the car comes by to take us to the Hill,” Billy informed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great, I just want to go over a couple of things before we’re on our way,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had already begun fixing the excessive eyeshadow stopped and looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me guess: no rolling my eyes, no scoffing, no general hostility?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio’s tone was more serious, “but it’s more than just that. Your face can’t show any emotion whatsoever. Whatever he says, you have to school your expression into something neutral. You wait for him to be done talking, give him a quick peck on the cheek, and then straight to the car.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if he says something outrageous?” Agatha countered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No matter what he says, you cannot react,” Rio reiterated. “Billy and I looked over the speech, there’s nothing out of the ordinary— for him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it too late to call in sick?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll stop for ice cream on the way back if you behave,” Rio replied playfully.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “There, ready,” Agatha straightened herself and put the coat on. “Do you think the press will like my outfit?” She added sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, and no sarcasm from now on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re no fun,” Agatha pouted.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Sharon greeted them when they arrived. She was rearranging a large group on the steps to stand behind the podium.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so exciting!” Sharon said to Agatha as they approached her. “A historic day for our country, wouldn’t you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t reply, she just watched the crowd of journalists and cameramen as they set up their equipment. Her expression was neutral, but Rio was getting better at reading her body movements. Her fingers were tracing patterns on the hem of the coat, and her neck was stiff as a board. Rio hoped to ease her anxiety by stepping away with Sharon in tow. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Lilia a couple of feet away getting out of her car. Agatha let go of her hem when she spotted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen, Sharon,” Rio began, once they were out of earshot, “I know we’ve never worked together before, but I want us to be on the same page. Based on what I saw this week, things between Agatha and Bohner are quite strained at the moment. And while in any other context, the state of their marriage wouldn’t be our business, you and I well know that candidates in marital disputes have a harder time on the trail. With Governor Whyte in the race, who knows how low he and his supporters are willing to stoop to eliminate the competition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued, “I know we’ve agreed to do a couple of events before the caucuses, but I really think it would be best to keep Agatha in the back seat as much as possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I understand what you’re saying, dear,” Sharon said sweetly, “but Ralph really needs her this time. Two of the other people running for the Republican nomination are unmarried men. Ralph has an advantage over them only if he can show that he has the full backing of his wife. It matters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s the thing, though, you and I both know she doesn’t. I’ve prepped her for today, but she’s no puppet. She won’t say anything she doesn’t believe in, no matter how much that would help Bohner,” Rio insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How about we discuss this after the announcement? It’s almost time and we shouldn’t keep America waiting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio returned to her party to find Agatha and Lilia talking quietly. Sharon motioned for them to take their places behind the podium. Billy instinctively went to stand next to Agatha, but she immediately shook her head and nodded towards where Rio was standing, behind the cameras.
    </p>
    <p>
     A couple dozen people had gathered to watch the announcement. It was a modest crowd for these types of events, but Bohner couldn’t mobilize as many supporters as Whyte, or Taggart and McCormack, the congressmen also in the race. Still, the lack of fanfare made it seem more professional and less sensational, which could play in their favor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bohner exited the building and waved to the crowd below as he descended the steps. He smiled brightly at his wife, then at cameras before he began talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ladies and gentlemen, members of the press, thank you for joining us on this frigid morning. I promise this won’t take too long,” he added with a chuckle. Some of the people watching did the same. Even Agatha’s lips curled upwards slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For years, I have witnessed firsthand the many failings of our government. I’ve seen time and time again how Americans’ taxes are misused, and how they’re not prioritized by legislators.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time since he started, Rio realized he didn’t have a prompter, and she had not seen a printed copy of the speech on the podium. So far, it matched almost word by word the document Sharon had shared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, coming from a family of hardworking blue collar Americans, how life gets more and more difficult every year, how making ends meet is no longer the standard, but almost an unachievable goal. How jobs are fewer and harder to come by. How our communities are corrupted by radical leftist ideology.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But we can fix it. My team and I have developed an actionable plan that can be implemented quickly and precisely.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “First of all, we need to root out the evil that has been destroying our communities. We need mass deportation of illegal aliens, who are taking away our jobs and spending your tax dollars. Who are raping our women and killing our children. We have tried negotiating with our neighbors south of the border, but it hasn’t delivered a solution. I think it’s time for America to take matters into our own hands, and deploy the national guard and the army to locate and kick out America’s enemies from within.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There were some enthusiastic cheers in the audience. Agatha and Rio locked eyes. The former was clearly struggling. This was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     the speech they’d sent over. Rio mouthed
     <em>
      relax
     </em>
     at Agatha and saw her take a deep breath.
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     , Rio thought,
     <em>
      please don’t let this get any worse
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s prayers were not answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We also need to restore our traditional values. Liberals have successfully pushed their agenda down Americans’ throats, and forced them to forsake their Christian values. In the name of making minorities comfortable, they have forced the majority to compromise their morals and have profoundly damaged the Great American Spirit. But Americans across the country have risen up and said ‘no more’. I will make sure anyone who supports DEI, BLM, and Antifa end up where they belong: in prison, with all the other people who endanger our great nation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Today I join my fellow Americans in saying 'no more' and vow to devote the rest of my career to make sure their voices are heard, their values respected. We will no longer allow for our children to hurt their young bodies with gender reassignment surgery or any other fashionable trends. And we will hold the parents and doctors who hurt these disturbed children accountable for their criminal negligence.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
     </em>
     . More people had gathered to watch the speech, and Rio watched as people applauded around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As for the members of the media, who have uncritically accepted and pushed this agenda I say: we will hold you accountable for the damage you have inflicted upon the American people.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And that is why I’m asking for your support today to help me become the next President of the United States!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The crowd roared. Rio looked around and Lilia was shell-shocked. Billy looked close to tears. And Agatha… she looked she was about to throw up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We will restore our great republic, and we will fight tooth and nail against anyone who stands in our way!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Bohner waved at the crowd, still cheering, and then moved to kiss Agatha’s cheek. She subtly tried to dodge him and ended up kissing him on the lips. Someone in the crowd whistled which triggered more cheering and laughter. Sharon ushered Bohner and Agatha off the stage and towards the town cars waiting for them. Bohner got into the first car with Sharon and the rest of his team.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her hand on Agatha’s back while Lilia opened the door of the second car and all four of them climbed inside.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Someone has to say it,” Billy said, still shaking from the cold and anger, “Agatha, I think you married a fascist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t react. She was still looking out the window, fidgeting with her coat once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Didn’t they send over his speech?” Lilia asked accusatorially.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They did. None of what he just said was in it. I would’ve called you immediately if we’d read that,” Rio replied tersely. “Either he made that up on the spot, or we were seriously misled by the campaign.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It doesn’t matter now, it’s out there, and it’s going to cause a commotion.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “At least we know what the tank’s agenda is: to use Bohner to move the needle. Force the other candidates to escalate their rhetoric so they don’t look weak.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s wait and see how the media reacts. Maybe they’ll shut it down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, this is going to boost their viewership dramatically. They’ll broadcast anything he says from now on. Fear mongering sells.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The car came to a stop outside the residence. Billy and Lilia climbed out, but Agatha didn’t move from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give us a minute, will you?” Rio asked, and the two nodded. She closed the door before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talk to me,” she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to look at her, she was clearly checked out. “What is there to say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave her a moment to adjust her coat and when she reached for the handle, Rio stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, and slumped back on the seat. “You said things would be fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well, that was before your husband decided to channel Mussolini on national television. I was as surprised as you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “See, I wasn’t even that surprised, if I’m being honest. Just disappointed. And terrified. They’ll definitely come after us now. And some things… private things... will come out, eventually.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How much is there?” Rio asked. “To find.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A lot.”

    <p>
     The afternoon that followed the announcement was chaotic. Agatha had left her composure and restraint back in the car. She was pacing the living room furiously, mumbling incoherently and yelling at anyone who crossed her path. Rio decided to give her time to tire herself out before engaging with her again, since nothing productive could come from such an emotional state.
    </p>
    <p>
     At one point, multiple phones seemingly started ringing at the same time. Rio had taken Agatha’s away and silenced it after the latter threw it on the floor upon seeing the caller ID, breaking the screen.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice were at the door within minutes of their arrival, presumably because they had followed the announcement on TV, and looked thrown at the scene unfolding before them.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was wrestling Rio on the couch to get her phone back. “Give it back! Let me give that motherfucker a piece of my mind!” Lilia and Billy were trying to bring Agatha back to her senses and off of Rio. All to the soundtrack of countless alerts, text messages and incoming calls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice whistled loudly and got everyone to stop in their tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen up!” Jen yelled over the lingering noises coming from their phones. “Let’s silence or turn off all the devices so we can think for a minute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy moved quickly to locate their phones and the two iPads that were also beeping furiously. Lilia threw herself on an armchair, exhausted. Agatha finally gave up on getting her phone back and sat up, inadvertently straddling Rio. After a couple of minutes of shuffling, there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice cleared her throat, and pointed carefully to Agatha’s position on top of Rio. She climbed off her lap in a hurry but still sat down next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right,” Lilia began, “Well, that was an unexpected surprise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m never working for him again,” Jen provided, unhelpfully. “I don’t want his name staining my reputation. He’s one short step away from the KKK.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can agree on that, but this is not the right time for that discussion. We need to focus on what comes next.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her head in her hands, facing downwards. For a moment, Rio thought she was sobbing, but then realized she was still shaking with rage.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, you’re on the record saying you don’t agree with his views,” Rio tried diffuse the tension. “This is why we put that piece out, in case something like this happened.” She resisted the urge to rub soothing circles on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It doesn’t matter, I was standing next to him and kissed him after he said all that awful shit,” she said, still not showing her face. “I don’t know if I’ll ever recover from that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll do some damage control today, after we figure out where our priorities should be,” Rio replied trying to project confidence. “For the moment, don’t take any calls, don’t talk to anyone outside this room, and try not to spiral.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally looked up,
     <em>
      maybe she had been crying
     </em>
     . “Where is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He went back to his campaign headquarters here in DC. I assume he’ll come by before he leaves for Ohio tonight,” Jen offered. “I knew there was something off with him, didn’t I tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not now, Jen,” Alice interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have a bathtub?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there a bathtub in any the rooms upstairs?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s a steam shower in the master bathroom,” Billy supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do right now,” Rio began, looking at Agatha. “You’re going to go upstairs, take a long shower and then change into something more comfortable. Take as much time as you need. We’ll try to find answers while you do that and brief you when you’re done. Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going to call mom, ask her to come over,” Billy added.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha trusts her,” Rio supplied before Jen objected.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine,” Jen muttered. “Let’s get comfortable, we’re in for one hell of a ride.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio walked Agatha upstairs, since she was starting to look drained and was a bit wobbly. She began undressing the moment she crossed the door to her bedroom, and Rio averted her eyes to give her some privacy.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll come check on you in a bit,” she said while Agatha pulled off her boots unceremoniously.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up. Agatha was sitting on the bed, her shirt was open, revealing parts of her bra, and her pants were unbuttoned. She waited for her to speak.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened and closed her mouth a couple of times, and Rio saw tears forming on the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inched closer and sat on the bed next to her. She was focusing all her energy on projecting safety, but she felt Agatha’s pain and frustration as if it were her own.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned her head on Rio’s shoulder, and the latter froze. Agatha softly nuzzled her. Rio exhaled softly and placed her own head gently on top of Agatha’s. Rio wanted to kiss her pain away so badly it physically hurt her. Instead, she focused on her breathing, now almost in sync with Agatha's.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to lie. She wanted to tell her everything was going to be fine. That they would make it go away. That she was safe. But she had promised her honesty, and enough people had betrayed Agatha today already.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to go back downstairs,” Rio whispered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, stay.” Agatha stifled a yawn.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you’re able to sleep right now, you should do that. I can come get you in a couple of hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won’t be able to,” she replied, “I usually have trouble sleeping.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just lie down and close your eyes for a bit. If sleep comes, great; if it doesn’t, that’s okay, too. You need some time to process and regroup. Is Scratchy a good bedfellow?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, he ate a chunk of my hair the last time I fell asleep near him,” she said with a soft chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, too. At some point her hand had moved out of its own accord and had begun stroking Agatha’s hair. Her breathing was becoming more even and she let out a soft, almost imperceptible moan when Rio’s nails scraped at the base of her neck. Agatha curled her body into Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going back to the others,” Rio tried to sound a bit more firm. “I can’t help you from up here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” her voice sounding almost pained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood up carefully so as not to disturb Agatha. “Shower, clean clothes, deep breaths,” she repeated softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio turned and left the bedroom, her mind racing.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Someone had rearranged the TV, iPads and computers in a row, each one displaying a different news network’s live feed. They were all replaying clips from the announcement with sensational banners.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tall, redhead woman Rio didn’t recognize was talking to Lilia in the kitchen when she walked in. She turned around and greeted instantly, “You must be Rio. I’m Wanda Maximoff, Billy’s mom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nice to meet you,” Rio replied. “I wish it had been under different circumstances.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, what a clusterfuck,” Wanda said, “Ralph has been acting for the cameras for a while, but this was a new low, even for him. How is she?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Drained,” Rio answered, “I think she needs some time to process.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is exactly what she was afraid of, that he would pull some stunt to make a splash and drag her down with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We had no idea they were planning to do that,” Lilia supplied, “we think his campaign staff misled us so they could get her to show up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus,” Wanda said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if she does leave him this time. Lilia knows just how close she came during his last campaign.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It would not be a good look if she does that now. They’ll blame her for anything that goes wrong,” Lilia warned, “
     <em>
      If she’d only been a better wife, maybe he would have won…”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was taken aback by this new piece of information. So Agatha had tried to leave him before. She wondered what had stopped her from going through with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda,” Rio began, “I need to ask you about something. Lilia, you should probably hear this, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a small door connecting the kitchen to the living room, and out of an abundance of caution Rio closed it. Wanda looked at her expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to know how many people know about Agatha’s abortion.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia's eyes went wide. “That did not come up during our research, was it over the past two years?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it was a while ago,” Wanda replied, then asked accusatorially, “Who told you? I know it wasn’t her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bohner blurted it out last night to Billy and I.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He did not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He did, and then he walked away. Your kid is great, by the way,” Rio added, “He’s been a real comfort for Agatha in tough situations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Obviously we do not want this to get out under any circumstance. Is there a paper trail?” Lilia spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, she didn’t have it in the US. She flew to France under the guise of meeting with some foreign clients and got someone discreet to write her a prescription for mifepristone. She never mentioned her real name and paid in cash at the pharmacy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, well, that’s good. Who else might know about this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only the people in this room, Billy, and Ralph. And maybe Evanora, but I can’t really be sure about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would she talk to someone about it? I know they’re estranged, resentment can be a powerful motivator.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, if there’s one thing I’ve learned about Evanora for as long as I’ve known her is that she only cares about herself. And for a woman in her position, word spreading about her only daughter having an abortion would be unsurmountable. No, if she knows, she will take it to her grave,” Wanda added.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there anything else we should be on the lookout for?” Rio asked. “I know this is uncomfortable question to ask, and Agatha keeps everything close to her chest, but we can’t protect her if we don’t know what’s coming.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Other than the thing you’ve already
     <em>
      figured out
     </em>
     ,” Wanda said cautiously, “I can’t think of anything else at the moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What ‘thing’?” Lilia asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing,” Rio replied quickly, earning a soft appreciative nod from Wanda. It wasn’t her secret to share, and Wanda recognized Rio understood just how important it was to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They heard Alice call for Lilia from the living room, and the older woman excused herself and left the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How many people know about
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     ?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You, me, Billy, Vision… my husband,” she supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not Bohner?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No… or if he knows, he either doesn’t care or has given her space about it. There’s… something there as well. I don’t know what, she’s never shared it with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What kind of something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Trauma, of some kind,” Wanda replied, “I’m only sharing this with you because I think you can be trusted.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I care about her,” Rio said, leaving no room for doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you do, and so does she. Can I ask you for one thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look out for my Billy, will you? His heart is in the right place but he’s young, he has his entire life ahead of him… I just don’t want him to get hurt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I promise,” she said firmly, “and Agatha is looking out for him, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, but she has much bigger problems now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “She’s upstairs, hopefully taking a nap or a shower. Would you mind checking on her in a bit? I’m sure she’d rather see your face than mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn’t be too sure about that,” Wanda replied knowingly, “but of course, I’ll go up after I get some coffee.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “We’re declining all requests for interviews. If anyone calls and asks for comments, paraphrase what Agatha said in the interview about not sharing his views but respecting his candidacy,” Lilia instructed to the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our goal is to wait for the original buzz to blow over. Have them focus solely on Bohner. Agatha remained composed yet neutral on camera, so they shouldn’t fixate on her right away,” Jen added.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s an article on Politico profiling Agatha that came out 45 minutes ago, it looks like they mostly repurposed Cara’s piece. They’re using today’s picture, though. Oh no…” Alice added.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What now?” Jen asked, agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They listed some of Agatha’s top clients. Billy, can you get ahold of Agatha’s new secretary? Where’s Agatha’s phone?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On it, and I have it,” Billy said pulling it out of his right pocket.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go through the missed calls, do you recognize any of their names?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, these three are definitely clients,” Billy showed the phone to Alice, who was now trying to match them to the companies listed on the article.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, once she comes down, she’s going to need to call them first. Have her legal assistant organize a conference call with the other partners. See if they can make some calls, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was watching the different monitors in the living room. Most of the channels had switched from clips with audio to talking heads with muted footage in the background. Rio activated the open captioning on each one so she could get a better gist of the reactions. The general consensus from anchors appeared to be mostly outrage at the incendiary rhetoric, and some civil rights leaders were on CNN denouncing his announcement as dangerous hate speech. Fox News commentators were commending him for ‘giving a voice to the silent majority’ and vowing to take back control from Democrats. MSNBC was interviewing people on the street somewhere in South Florida, so Rio turned up the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “I mean, I’ve never heard of the guy before today, but I feel like he spoke to me… I agree that liberals have taken things too far, I mean, look at how badly BLM people destroyed cities during the pandemic? They should’ve all gone to prison for destruction of property at the very least.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The reporter moved on to another person, a middle-aged woman with white cast from sunscreen on her face and wearing an ornate sun hat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “I think he was bold… it takes a lot of guts to stand up for your beliefs. I don’t think all of what he wants to do can be done, honestly, but it’s nice to see someone try to get our country back… and I know this isn’t important, but it would be nice to have a good-looking president again.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The team had paused what they were doing and were listening to the interviews. The reporter concluded his reporting and the feed was back in the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Look, even I have to admit,”
     </em>
     said established conservative commentator Bill Walker to his liberal colleagues,
     <em>
      “Bohner does have what it takes to go to the White House. He’s been consistent yet bold, heck, he’s younger than most of his opponents by over two decades! Being politically-correct is a thing of the past, we speak truth now.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio muted the screen again, then turned away from the monitor to face the team.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think… we need to come up with a long-term strategy. Nothing’s definitive until people head to the polls, but he’s not getting the popular backlash we hoped he would… One step at a time. Let’s try to salvage her professional relationships first. I’d like to get another profile out within the next two weeks, see how far we can distance her from him without causing too much controversy. Billy, your mom hasn’t come down yet, has she?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, let me shoot her a text,” he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice, can you call Sharon and see if Bohner is stopping in person and when?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We might want to hide the knives,” Billy said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha isn’t dumb enough to stab him,” Jen replied with a snark.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who said anything about Agatha?” He countered, eyebrow raised.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No one is stabbing anyone, not today, not anytime soon, and definitely not under my watch,” Lilia spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hear them moving,” Rio said softly, angling her head towards the ceiling, “Whatever you’re feeling on a personal level, do me a favor, put in a box, then crush it. We can deal with our own shit in private later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda and Agatha came down the stairs a couple minutes later. Agatha was wearing relaxed olive linen pants and simple white t-shirt that hugged her curves. Her hair was still wet from the shower, and she wasn’t wearing any makeup, but her face was delicately framed by a pair of designer glasses.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced around the group of people camping out in her living room before announcing, “Alright, I’m ready for the shit show.”

     “Your legal assistant is convening the partners for an emergency meeting in an hour,” Billy filled Agatha in as she took a seat on the couch.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, joy,” Agatha replied sarcastically as Wanda settled next to her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve instructed her not to take any calls until a resolution is reached,” Lilia added, “They might need to pull your contact information from the firm’s website for a while, it sounded like your inbox was getting flooded with emails.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about Ralph?” Agatha asked tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still no word from Sharon or the others as to when he’s coming by,” Jen said, “There’s a small chance that he may not stop by tonight at all, given the… state of things.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If he doesn’t show up, my next call will be to a divorce attorney.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s too late for that now,” Lilia said firmly, “If you leave him, then that becomes the story. And while I’m sure moderates and Democrats will stand by your decision, the right will drag you through the mud. And that is all but guaranteed to get nasty.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can say it was an amicable divorce, irreconcilable political differences,” Agatha insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Jen said seriously, “If you leave him now, when his momentum is perilous and he has everything to lose… do you seriously trust him not to pin the whole thing on you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quiet for a while. “No,” she finally answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s shelve that for the time being,” Rio said. “You have agency here,” she added turning towards Agatha, “but we need to be smart about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I really?” Agatha snorted. “I feel like I have no control over my life whatsoever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice’s phone began ringing and she stepped away to take the call. Rio saw her lock eyes with Jen and discretely shake her head. “Hang on one second,” she said to the person on the other line.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He’s on his campaign bus, somewhere in West Virginia,” Alice said cautiously, “he wants to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t pass the phone to Agatha right away, but looked at Rio for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to take the call,” Rio said calmly, “you don’t owe him anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not going to hide from him, if anything he should be the one hiding from me!” She replied angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He clearly is, otherwise he wouldn’t have crossed state lines so quickly,” Jen added humorlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine. Give me the phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She moved to grab it from Alice, but Rio carefully blocked her. “Don’t say anything you wouldn’t want to see printed in tomorrow’s papers,” she warned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Moi?” She scoffed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talk to him as if you were talking to an opposing counsel… because after today’s ambush, it’s clear you’re not playing for the same team.”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s tone was decisive. Agatha straightened up, clear that she understood her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should I take it here, or in private?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where do you think you’ll show more restraint?” Jen said, earning an elbow jab from Alice. Rio was beginning to suspect the two were more than just colleagues, given how comfortable they acted around one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put him through.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put the phone on speaker and placed it on the coffee table. Everyone leaned in to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speak,” Agatha said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Ags, I’m sorry I couldn’t come by in person, the team was pressed to hit the road as quickly as possible, I’m sure you understand.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure,” Agatha replied sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Don’t be like that…”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t tell me how to act.” Agatha’s hands were in such tight fists Rio’s worried her nails might pierce through skin of her palms. “Was this your plan all along?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “If by that you mean standing up for the American people…”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw Agatha was about to blow up and she muted the phone before she could speak. “Don’t. He’s baiting you. Always assume someone else may be listening.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha unmuted the phone, “The American people deserve better than a man who is too cowardly to face the woman he betrayed in person.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “We can talk about this when you come to Iowa next week, how about that?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a steadying breath, likely cursing him out internally, before coolly replying, “We’ll see about that. Busy schedule, you know.”

      “I’m sure you can make some time for your loving husband.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you see him, let him know I said hi.” She hung up the phone before Bohner had a chance to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an uncomfortable silence in the room. Wanda scooted closer to Agatha and threw her arm around her shoulders, but Agatha shook her head and she removed it.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. I need a couple of minutes alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of heading upstairs to her bedroom, she headed down to the basement.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha came back up right on time for the conference call. Rio followed her to her home office while the rest of the team continued to work in the living room area.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The managing partner, Phil Jones, was already dialed in when Agatha joined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you holding up?” He asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you know, I married a fascist, who hasn’t been there before,” she answered. “Uh oh, my handler is reminding me I can’t be sarcastic anymore, womp womp,” she added after Rio’s disapproving look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If there’s anything I can do for you, on a personal level, please don’t hesitate to ask.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I appreciate that. Honestly, I just need to focus on work right now and pretend today didn’t happen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll talk more about that when everyone else is here,” Phil said. That seemed to have taken Agatha by surprise, but she didn’t comment on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dottie, is everyone here?” He asked after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re only missing Herb.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just got here, hello everyone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was some indistinct chatter on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you all for joining on such short notice. As you’ve probably heard, Politico posted an article following today’s announcement with a list of Agatha’s top clients, and our phones have been ringing nonstop since… mostly from concerned clients, but we’ve also gotten a handful of hateful messages and even some death threats.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Shit
     </em>
     , Rio thought.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve emailed most of her clients a new phone number that we established for them specifically and took down your profile page on the website, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked displeased, but they’d warned her about it earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We want to address some concerns raised over our ability to operate under such difficult circumstances. While those of us who have personally known Agatha for many years know that the controversial opinions voiced this morning are not shared by her, many of the partners and even some associates have been facing angry clients over the past 4 hours who are threatening to take their business elsewhere in light of recent events. As partners, we have a fiduciary responsibility to this firm to take any action necessary to prevent a mass exodus of clients. I believe that it is in the best interest of the firm to reassign Agatha’s clients to other attorneys and place her on a temporary leave. Paid, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was shell-shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Phil, with all due respect, I’m in the middle of Orkl’s merger with PPL Assets, and halfway through setting up Epsyn’s acquisition subsidiary for its Middle East expansion. We’re too late in the process to get another partner up to speed, and even then, these are clients that I’ve worked with for years, they trust me to deliver this in top shape. Not to mention that on a personal level, I’m being held liable for my husband’s actions—“
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, if I may jump in,” Herb said, “This isn’t a desirable outcome for any of us, we value you and the work you’ve done for the firm. We’re taking cautionary measures while the dust settles. You’re a partner here, and a damn good one. But you need to understand that we have a responsibility to ensure the firm weathers this storm, and it’s become evident over the past several hours that it would extremely difficult to do so if you continue working in your current capacity. We would come under fire every time your husband says something incendiary, and it would compromise our ability to complete work for our clients.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked like she was close to tears, and likely out of fear of showing how vulnerable she was feeling, she did not respond.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We just ask for your understanding, this is a very difficult conversation to have,” Phil continued. “We’re going to take a quick vote on the
     <em>
      temporary
     </em>
     leave of absence now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sucked in her breath as one by one, nearly all of the partners voted in favor of the measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t worry, we will take good care of your clients and once this is all over, we’ll make sure our associates return everything in even better shape that we got it, if that’s even possible, knowing your work.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just wanted to say,” another partner said, “that I’m truly sorry you’re going through this. I know how hard you’ve worked to protect the communities your husband attacked today in his speech. My wife and I are thinking about you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks, Mike,” Agatha let out softly, then disconnected the call.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t stop the tears from falling this time. Rio paced around the room, thinking about ways to spin this to alleviate her frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, maybe you can use this as an opportunity to focus all of your attention on your pro bono work,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave her a sad look, tears still streaming down her face.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you know how long I’ve worked with these people?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “15 years. I know their families, some of which we’ve even vacationed with over the years. They know… they know this isn’t me. But it’s not enough, I’m still being punished for his shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you have any idea how many hours of my life I’ve devoted to that place? How many hours of sleep lost? For what? For them to toss me aside the second something became uncomfortable?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…” Rio began.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was the point?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s temporary.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed. “How am I supposed to go back to work there after this? They handed down their sentence without letting me make my case. I don’t know how I could ever go back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t say anything. She sat down on the other side of the desk and waited for Agatha to regain her bearings.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she saw her breathing had evened out, she said, “It’s nearly 6 p.m., I’m going to ask the team to work from home for the rest of the evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda had offered to spend the night here with Billy, is that okay by you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, they should go home, I don’t want anyone to see me like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They love you, they want to be here for you,” Rio said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want them to get hurt by association.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll… let them know you want some space tonight. Does that sound okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Rio continued, “You can’t stay here alone tonight though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The only person I’d want to hurt is traveling at 70 miles an hour at present.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused and thought for a moment. Even so, she shouldn’t be left alone after a day like that. All personal feelings for the woman aside, Agatha didn’t deserve to be shunned and isolated in her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She looked up, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll stay with you tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to. I’m going to send everyone home, then we can get some dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio ate takeout on the kitchen island in relative silence. Rio didn’t want to push her to talk about her feelings on everything that had happened, and Agatha seemed thankful for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time all day, Rio’s mind wasn’t constantly occupied by the fires around her and had time to think about how
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was feeling. She had tried in vain to suppress her feelings for Agatha since she’d met her, but now it was becoming even harder to ignore them, as the life of the woman in front of her crumbled piece by piece. Every nerve in her body was screaming at her to comfort her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s phone started buzzing on the table. She turned it over and Rio saw that the caller was listed in her contacts as
     <em>
      Bitch
     </em>
     . She declined the call.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My mother,” she said without further explanation.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The infamous Evanora Harkness. It wasn’t hard to imagine why the woman would be cold-calling Agatha. Based on what Wanda said that afternoon, Rio wouldn’t be surprised if she’d called to berate her daughter for the embarrassment she’d endured. As if Agatha was to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they were done, Rio followed Agatha upstairs where she showed her the guest bedroom and bid her a quick goodnight. Much like the rest of the house, the room looked professionally decorated; it was quite spacious, with a sitting area on one end and a queen bed on the other. There was an ensuite bathroom, and upon closer inspection, a door next to the closet opened to a living area with a large television mounted on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a quick shower, brushed her teeth with an unopened toothbrush she found under the sink, before climbing into bed wearing only her boxer briefs and the t-shirt she’d worn under the many layers of clothes that day. She checked her phone one last time before setting it on the night stand, turned off the light and fell asleep almost instantly, the exhaustion catching up to her.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio stirred awake during the night. The alarm clock read 1:30 a.m., and as she looked around the darkness of the room, she heard the faint hum of a television program. Getting up from bed, Rio followed the sounds into the adjacent TV room.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was sitting on a large sectional facing away from her, watching a late night show.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “… Raping our women and killing our children? He was only missing ‘eating our babies’ to complete the Holy Trinity of Immigrant Sins, trademark pending…”
      <span>
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Audience laughter followed his joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Rio said to Agatha, causing her to jump up from the couch. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay,” she said settling back down, her hand still clutching her chest. “Did I wake you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe,” Rio said playfully, yawning. She settled on the other side of the sectional.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve never cared much for these shows,” Agatha said distantly, “It’s strange seeing yourself on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost right on cue, the comedian had a close up of Agatha’s face next Bohner.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “I mean, look at that face! That’s the face of a woman on the verge of liquidating her stock portfolio and booking a one-way ticket to a remote Caribbean island for herself and her ridiculously attractive pool boy.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprisingly, Agatha giggled. “I mean, he’s right about everything
     <em>
      but
     </em>
     the pool boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, too. After a couple of minutes of watching the show together, she said, “You should try to get some sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t sleep. Most nights it’s a struggle, tonight it feels like an impossible feat,” she said dejectedly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I may have a Xanax in my wallet, I can go check,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I already took a Valium,” Agatha replied. “My condition is now prescription-resistant. You should go back to bed, there’s no point in both of us being sleep-deprived tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered her words for a moment, then grabbed a throw blanket from a basket at the foot of the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, we can watch together,” she said, stretching her legs on the sectional and covering the lower part of her body with the blanket.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     When she woke the next morning, she was still lying on the couch, but a silk pillow had been placed under head. Turning her neck, she saw Agatha sleeping softly inches away from her. She watched Agatha’s sleeping form for a couple of minutes, taking in her relaxed features and the way her long hair fanned over a pillow similar to hers. She must grabbed them from another room after Rio fell asleep and returned to sleep next to her. A warm feeling filled her chest, and instead of getting up and ready for the day, she closed her eyes and went back to sleep.

    <p>
     By the time they both finally woke up, it was close to 11 a.m. Wanda had dropped Billy off a couple of hours prior and, upon finding the two women fast asleep on the couch, had decided not to disturb them.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     He was compiling news clippings from the announcement on his iPad while Rio and Agatha drank coffee in silence on the kitchen island. Agatha looked more refreshed than she’d seen her before, but her mood was decidedly off. Unlike yesterday, she looked defeated more than angry or sad.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a loud knock on the front door that startled them. Agatha was wearing one of her long silk robes over her pajamas while Rio was fully dressed, so she and Billy made their way to the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a couple of minutes, they returned to the kitchen followed by four men wearing dark suits.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Secret service,” Rio said calmly, “they were assigned to your detail this morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great,” Agatha said nonchalantly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, ma’am,” one of the men said solemnly. “My name is Agent Jeff Kaplan, I will be leading your security detail for the next couple of months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and shook the men’s hands as they introduced themselves one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll be stationed in an SUV outside your home while you’re here. We would appreciate if your assistant shares the details of any scheduled outside activities with as much time as possible. We will also escort you to and from your office every day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That won’t be necessary, I got fired yesterday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn’t get fired,” Billy corrected, “You were placed on an involuntary temporary leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Same thing, I’m unemployed at present,” she scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry to hear that, ma’am,” Agent Kaplan said.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly sensing the general mood of the room, he turned to Billy and added, “If Ms. Harkness needs to leave, please notify us.” The men left promptly the same way they had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What else is new?” Agatha asked no one in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph gave an interview this morning in Ohio and doubled-down on the shit he said yesterday about deporting migrants.” He had a disgusted look on his face. “On a positive note, he did not mention you at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not that we expect him to,” Rio interjected. “He got what he wanted from you yesterday, he has no reason to bring you up again anytime soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia suspects he was expecting a more aggressive response from you when he called, hence his tone and choice of words,” Billy added. “He may have been prepping for you to announce your intent to separate and was trying to keep his hands clean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed. “Separate and do what, exactly? This is a repeat of 2021.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Rio looked at her with baited breath.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head and inhaled deeply before speaking. “I’m a middle-aged, closeted lesbian who’s never even kissed a woman before… and now I’m unemployed, to top it all off. I wouldn’t even know what to do with myself if I divorced him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sucked in a breath. She suspected that Wanda had relayed portions of their conversation to her, and clearly after yesterday’s events, something had snapped inside of Agatha. Rio felt a rush of pride for her for vocalizing her identity, something she’d obviously never done before in front of a stranger. Maybe she didn’t see Rio as a stranger anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” Rio said carefully, so as to keep the mood light, “Honesty is a good start. Welcome to the queer club, we’ll send your membership card in the mail in 5 to 10 business days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have merch. Tons of flags, too” Billy added playfully, a warm smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips curled upwards, almost involuntarily. She let out a sigh and tossed her head back, staring at the ceiling.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so humiliating,” she mumbled.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “He took something from you yesterday,” Rio said, “now we’re going to work on getting it back.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha called the legal aid clinic she volunteered at next.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, Agatha. We want you here. But as you well know, some of the people who seek our services are undocumented. I don’t think asking for papers before assigning their cases to you is the way to go, but vulnerable individuals who have seen the videos may be concerned about being represented by you. Let’s set up a meeting to discuss how to best approach this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need this, Martha,” Agatha begged softly. “I can’t just stay at home and do nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I understand,” she replied patiently. “And we’re not asking you to step down or anything of the sort. We want to protect you and our clients at the same time. We’ll find out a way to make it work, it might just take some time. I’ll bring it up during our directors meeting tomorrow, try to get you back on a case as soon as possible. Does that sound good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, okay,” Agatha replied, her voice small.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Unemployment did not suit Agatha. She spent the afternoon moping around the house, walking aimlessly between the rooms, while Rio and Billy coordinated with Jen and Alice over the phone on how to proceed next.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     After sundown, she had finally resolved to settle down with Scratchy on her lap and order a new phone to replace the one she broke the day prior.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could sense Agatha’s eyes on her. Her previous admission was playing in a loop in Rio’s head, and she wanted nothing more than to climb on her lap and kiss her senseless.
     <em>
      She’s never even kissed another woman
     </em>
     , she thought sadly. She desperately wanted to change that, but the timing wasn’t right. She was too raw, too vulnerable. And Rio wasn’t about to take advantage of her when she was at her lowest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her reveries were interrupted by the sounds of a commotion happening outside. They rushed to the front door to see all four secret service agents on the sidewalk, talking on their headset and scouting the area.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What happened?” Agatha asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “An act of vandalism,” Agent Kaplan filled her in, “a tall man wearing a hoodie approached your property and then made a run for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind her Billy called for her attention. “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned and saw that a red swastika had been spray painted on her white front door. Underneath, a sentence beginning with ‘
     <em>
      Death to fa…’
     </em>
     sat unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it’s time for you to go home, Billy,” Agatha said, her voice shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
     <em>
      <span>
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s right,” Rio interrupted, also shaken up. “Call your mom, ask her to pick you up as soon as possible.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio sat in the living room while two of the agents tried to reassure them that the offender had fled the scene and was nowhere near the house.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll be on the lookout all night long, in case he returns. Ma’am, do you have strong cleaning supplies? I think it would be best to remove the sign as soon as possible so as to not draw attention.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t even know what would get that off,” Agatha replied, her head in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can repaint the door quickly. I’ll go look in your basement, see if there’s any paint we can use there,” Rio said, leaving Agatha with the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio dug through multiple cabinets while Scratchy watched her curiously from his playpen. She found an old can of eggshell outdoor paint and a rolling brush, and brought both upstairs. She went outside and began stirring the paint with a stick to mix in the components that had separated. After two quick coats, no traces of the graffiti remained.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She re-entered the house, small speckles of white paint staining her black pants. Agatha stared
     <span>
     </span>
     at her, vulnerability etched on every feature of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going back to the hotel to get a change of clothes,” she announced. “I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio changed her pants, tossing the dirty ones in a corner of her hotel suite. There was a courtesy tote bag in one of the closets, and she filled it quickly with two sets of clean clothes, pajamas and multiple pairs of underwear. After what had just transpired, she had no plans to let Agatha stay home alone, security detail or not. She called the reception desk and asked for them to call a cab to take her back to the residence.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked around the room and also packed her phone charger, face cream and slippers. The taxi was already waiting for her on the curb when she descended from her room 10 minutes later.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She found Agatha upstairs, sitting on the same sectional they’d woken up on. A bottle of whiskey, three fourths full, had been placed on the ottoman in front of her, and she was holding an almost empty glass in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You came back,” Agatha said appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “With multiple changes of clothes,” Rio replied, plopping ungracefully on the couch next to her. “And PJs, so you don’t have to endure my boxer shorts again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They were cute,” she replied shyly, tossing back the remainder of the whiskey. “Want some?” She offered, refilling her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure,” Rio said, taking a sip. “You shouldn’t take any prescription meds if you’re drinking tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Too late for that,” she replied, taking back the glass and swallowing a large gulp. “I’m kidding, I’m kidding,” she added after seeing Rio’s concerned expression. “This isn’t my first rodeo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They settled back, every so often passing and refilling the shared glass of whiskey, the bottle progressively emptying.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanna watch a movie or something?” Rio asked, refilling the glass with what was left of the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Rio smirked. The alcohol was finally starting to get to her. “What do you want to talk about then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can’t we just drink in silence?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That sounds depressing,” Rio poked Agatha’s side playfully, and the latter, clearly ticklish, let out an uncharacteristic yelp.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The booze was clearly impairing her judgment, because Rio lunged forward and began tickling Agatha in earnest. Not to be outdone, Agatha retaliated, and soon they were both panting and laughing uncontrollably on the floor. Rio called for a truce and they both laid side by side, watching the ceiling fan, catching their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned on her side, facing Agatha. She was just
     <em>
      so beautiful
     </em>
     .
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop looking at me like that,” Agatha said, a mixture of playfulness and seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like what?” Rio asked inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like you feel sorry for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s not… I’m… I wasn’t thinking that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Poor rich woman, with her asshole husband and her broken marriage,” Agatha chanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up.” It came out more firmly than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned on her side to face her as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It happened in slow motion. Agatha’s hand moved to stroke Rio’s face, causing her eyelashes to flutter, before she began leaning in. Her face was less than an inch away from hers when Rio regained her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was taken aback. “Sorry, I—“
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay,” Rio said quickly, before the shame could settle in. The momentary feeling of sobriety was gone, and Rio was running her mouth unfiltered. “I want this. Just not… we should both be sober.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared, pupils blown wide, directly into her soul. Her shoulders slumped a bit. But instead of backing away, she moved her body forward, and curled into Rio’s chest. She immediately reacted by wrapping her arms around her and placing a kiss on Agatha’s head. They stayed in that position for a while, both awake, but neither daring to address the almost kiss that wasn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s phone buzzed and the screen lit up. It was getting late.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should go to bed, my back can’t handle staying in this position much longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grumbled, clearly not wanting to let go.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” she said more insistently, “I won’t be able to walk in the morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly and looked at Rio with so much rawness she could melt. If she kept looking at her like that, she was going to do something she’d regret. Rio opted for bargaining.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you get up now, we can just move this party to the guest bedroom.”
     <em>
      Bad idea
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “My bed is bigger,” Agatha replied, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not sleeping in the same bed as
     <em>
      him,
     </em>
     ” Rio said firmly. “Go get changed.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     When Agatha entered the guest room in her pajamas, Rio was already under the covers. She pulled the sheets aside, inviting her in. They were still pretty drunk, so they laughed sloppily when Agatha’s foot got caught on the carpet, causing her to stumble over.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Watch it, I don’t want to find out where the nearest hospital is,” Rio said, still giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmm” was all the reply Rio got as Agatha resumed her earlier position in bed this time. She was surprised to see Agatha instantly relax and fall into deep slumber, occasionally letting out small contented sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio placed a small kiss on Agatha’s cheek and allowed herself to melt into their embrace.

    <p>
     Rio woke up alone in a cold bed, with a pounding headache, her memories of the previous night a blur. The clock on her phone informed her it was a little past 9 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>
     She padded her way to the ensuite bathroom and jumped into the shower. Even under the hot stream, she was having trouble remembering what had transpired the day before. She remembered the spray painting of Agatha’s door, and vaguely recalled coming back to the house and drinking with the woman.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rummaged through the tote bag and pulled out a fresh pair of underwear and clothes, took one final look at herself in the closet mirror before heading downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could hear a quiet conversation happening in the living room. She didn’t mean to overhear, but she caught some of the words spoken, ‘inappropriate’ ‘concerning’ ‘awkward’. Rio panicked. Did she do something last night that jeopardized her relationship with Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     She made a point of being noisy as she descended the staircase, giving the people talking plenty of time to react. As she looked around, she noticed that Agatha and Wanda were sitting on the dining room table, a worried look on the former’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Head still pounding, and now with an added sense of unease, Rio greeted them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,” Wanda returned.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t say anything. She was fully dressed, her skin inexplicably glowing, and upon seeing Rio’s eyes land on her, she averted her gaze and brought up her mug to her lips clearly to avoid having to talk.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Shit
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha and I were talking,” Wanda began, “About the incident last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck me, what did I do?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The vandalism,” she clarified.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh, yeah, right,
     </em>
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was thinking it might be best if we move this whole operation to my house for a little bit. We have plenty of space for the three of you to work in, and a couple of spare rooms for overnight stays as well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, truly, I would really much rather sleep in my own bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think Wanda has a point, Agatha,” Rio addressed her carefully. “We know of at least one person who has your home address and who did not hesitate to let you know. Even if the target was almost certainly Bohner, you could still get hurt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The secret service team said they can dispatch a couple more agents as a precautionary measure,” Agatha replied, still looking away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And they can station themselves at my place. It will be even better for them, our detached garage has a restroom and heating, it will make it easier for them to come and go as needed,” Wanda offered. “Besides, I’m sure Rio is eager to stay at her place again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m actually staying at a hotel.” She wasn’t sure what the point of saying that was, so she amended, “So as far as I’m concerned, I’m pretty flexible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her. She was searching for something in Rio’s eyes, in her face… maybe she wanted Rio to back off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m happy to follow your lead, I don’t mind going back to the Kimpton.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit her lip. It would have been profoundly endearing, were it not for the worried look she was sporting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their exchange was interrupted by a knock on the door.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s probably Billy, Vision said he’d drop him off since I had to rush here this morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?” Rio asked. She was truly concerned now. When had Wanda gotten there? Did Agatha call her in a panic?
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She decided to approach the topic head on. “Listen… I don’t remember much about last night, I was pretty hammered… did I do something wrong? Did I make you feel uncomfortable in some way?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was taken aback. “What? No. I… I thought I made
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     uncomfortable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat down and tried her best to sort through her memories. She remembered
     <em>
      touching
     </em>
     her,
     <em>
      holding
     </em>
     her? A pleasant warmth spread through her body as Agatha’s pleading, blue eyes flashed in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think so?” Rio replied. “Why? What happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head, hiding part of her face behind
     <em>
      that goddamn tea mug
     </em>
     .
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay, just tell me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I tried to kiss you and then I made you sleep in the same bed as me,” Agatha confessed with an embarrassed sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Really? Wow, drunk Rio showed a lot of restraint last night
     </em>
     , she thought. Instead of saying that, she just laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought the sheets smelled like you this morning, I was worried I was hallucinating from the hangover,” she replied playfully. “Water under the bridge, I slept quite well, in fact. I’d probably feel like a million bucks if we hadn’t chugged a bottle of, what was it? Vodka? Tequila?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whiskey,” Agatha said with a blush, though her body looked visibly more relaxed. “For what it's worth, I don’t think I’ve slept so soundly in years. I just woke up early, saw I was sprawled on top of you and panicked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling substantially better, Rio said, “Great. I’m going to take some Advil, and then we can head over to Wanda’s. Does she live far away?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a 15 minute drive from here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great,” she repeated, this time more energetically. She saw Wanda and Billy approaching, so she leaned in to whisper in her ear. “I’m glad your first kiss wasn’t sloppy or while drunk. You’ll remember that feeling— that
     <em>
      rush
     </em>
     —for the rest of your life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio turned around, a satisfied smirk on her face. Was she playing with fire? Yes. Was she going to get burned? Probably. But
     <em>
      my God
     </em>
     , she was going to enjoy every second of it.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It took some convincing, mostly by done Billy, but eventually Rio was talked into checking out of the Kimpton and staying at Wanda’s.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to keep a low profile anyway, right? What better way to do that than not having to step outside at all?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The kid had a point. But as Rio hauled her luggage into the room next to Agatha’s early in the afternoon, she wondered how long they would resist the magnetic pull between them and end up in bed together again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rationally, she knew it was a terrible idea to get involved with her. Not only was Rio
     <em>
      working
     </em>
     with her, on an extremely delicate situation, but the woman had also put her trust in Rio’s hands during one of the most vulnerable moments of her life.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now,
     <em>
      emotionally
     </em>
     , Rio couldn’t think of anything else she’d rather do than give herself completely to Agatha. Her pulse spiked whenever she entered the room, and every glance from her felt life-affirming. Not to mention that upon learning they had spent the night wrapped in each other’s arms, Rio had spent an inordinate amount of time in the shower before she checked out with her fingers on her clit and moaning her name. She felt slightly ashamed after she came, overwhelmed by how inappropriate what she’d done was, her only comfort being the firm knowledge that the attraction
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     mutual.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was more than physical attraction for Rio, though. She was drawn to her like a moth to a flame, and she felt an overwhelming urge to give her the world, to help her heal from her wounds and replace them with care and affection. She was head over heels for her, and she was too tired to even try to suppress her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Professionally, her instincts were urging her to back off and reminding her of the devastating consequences of an affair coming to light. And for that, Rio would never forgive herself, so she would keep reminding herself if she and Agatha ever got too close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unlike Agatha’s guest bedroom at her house, Wanda’s spare rooms were more modest, with a queen sized bed in each, an upholstered bench at the foot, a small closet with some drawers on one end, and space for hanging coats and storage on the other. Rio unpacked quickly and stuffed her now empty suitcase at the bottom of the closet, under her blazers and jackets. She laid down on the bed for a couple of minutes, staring at the ceiling. She was feeling much better now compared to when she woke up, the effects of the alcohol almost gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could hear Agatha in the next room rearranging something. Probably the chest of drawers to make room for Scratchy’s travel playpen.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just knowing she would be within arms reach for the foreseeable future sent a rush of adrenaline through her system. As long as she had control over her actions, she was letting her feelings flow freely. For now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio heard a loud thump and Agatha huff in pain. She knocked on her door only to find it open. She was right, Agatha had been moving the chest across the room.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I forgot for a split second that it was behind me,” she mumbled. She was holding her left arm tightly with her right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I take a look?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s really bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can handle it, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened as her brain caught up with her mouth. Agatha looked dumbfounded, but her pupils were blown wide and her nostrils were flaring. Rio made a mental note of her response to the pet name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recovering from her foot-in-mouth comment, she moved around to examine her arm. Sure enough, when she removed the hand covering it, there was a large gash several inches long, which was bleeding heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Coven works with a discrete medical service, let me see if they can send someone right away. Keep some pressure on the wound for now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wouldn’t it be faster if we just went to the hospital?” Agatha’s voice was pained.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s just to play it safe. It wouldn’t be a good look and might fuel speculation,” Rio replied, “Don’t worry, it will take less time than waiting in the ER.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Could this woman’s week get any worse?
     </em>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The doctor who came over worked quickly, stitched up her arm and gave her some antibiotics.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy kept Agatha company while she was getting patched up. After the doctor left, he’d made her a cup of the tea that she liked and sat with her. She got another call from her mother, which she once again declined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Lilia had decided to take a ‘wait and see’ approach for the next couple of days. Bohner was out campaigning that day, but until The Coven had a better understanding of the amount of traction he was getting, they had decided the best course of action was to give Agatha some time to catch her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Democratic hopefuls were having a field day. Bohner’s speech had given them a checklist of things with which to attack the state of the Republican Party. He was rightfully dubbed as “too extreme and dangerous for the country.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The reactions among his Republican opponents were mixed. While Governor Whyte, the frontrunner, criticized his harsh words, he acknowledged the outpouring of support Bohner had received from some marginalized blue-collar workers in mostly Southern states. “I wouldn’t go as far as to say that
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     illegal aliens are criminals… I’m sure some of them are good people. But we do have a responsibility to protect our citizens and all those who are here in this country
     <em>
      lawfully
     </em>
     .” After reading that quote from Whyte’s rally, Rio was certain the think tank’s people were pleased. Moving the needle indeed. Bruce Taggart, a congressman from Texas, had attempted to make jokes at Bohner’s expense at a campaign event, which had spectacularly backfired. Journalists had reported multiple attendees leaving early and making disgruntled comments about ‘Washington elites being out-of-touch with regular folks’. Grant McCormack, the other congressman in the race, had refrained from launching any immediate attacks. It seemed that, overall, pretty much everyone in the race had been taken by surprise by Bohner’s blunt aggressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had to admit, the campaign was being run smartly, like a well-oiled machine. The tank had launched an exploratory committee three months prior and made sure their FEC filings were in order. The formal press announcement delay seemed more and more strategic—they got the state and federal paperwork efficiently out of the way before the deadlines passed without drawing too much attention, and held off on the big show until the Iowa caucus was but a month away. Instead of the careful, extensive grassroots work needed to run such a large-scale campaign and booking prime Ad spots on local and state TV, his campaign was seizing the national news by making controversial statements and generating social media engagement. Only time would tell how well it would pay off.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Vision introduced himself to Rio during dinner; at Billy’s request, he had picked up a large order of Mexican food from a nearby taqueria on the way back from work.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “In case no one else has said this to you already, we’re glad you’re here,” Vision said thoughtfully. Billy beamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you know, there’s still plenty of time for people to change their mind about that,” Rio laughed off.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had taken a seat next to her, carefully arranging her injured arm out of the way. Rio got the impression her proximity was soothing to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     After they were done eating, Vision and Wanda retired to their bedroom, and Billy left to meet up with Eddie. They sat in comfortable silence on the couch for an hour, Agatha reading a book while Rio went through her emails. Rio was surprised when she felt Agatha tuck her feet under Rio’s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m cold.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I gathered as much,” Rio said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put her book down on the coffee table, stretched and yawned. Rio watched her mind racing, like she was working up the courage to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I slept quite well last night, even though we were plastered,” she began, “You said you did, too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Rio knew where she was going with this. She decided to spare her the embarrassment of having to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, would you like to give Scratchy some privacy tonight?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, I would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No funny business, though,” Rio said wiggling her eyebrows, but Agatha froze. “I’m joking! I wasn’t implying you were trying to get in my pants—“
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if I am?”
    </p>
    <p>
     That surprised Rio, but she decided to keep her tone playful. “Look at you, coming out on a Monday and ready for some action by Tuesday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed a laugh. “I mean, I’ve always known I liked women, not that I ever truly dared to admit it to myself out loud. The few people who know kinda figured it out on their own,” she waved her good arm in the air. “And it wasn’t until not very long ago that I realized I didn’t feel the same way about men.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gazed at her softly from the couch. “Everyone’s story is different. Nobody is ready at the same time, and sometimes it takes a while to figure out who you are. Especially if you are raised in a very traditional environment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you judge me for it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why would I? There’s nothing wrong with taking your time,” Rio added, “There’s nothing wrong with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How old were you? When you came out,” Agatha pushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I came out as bi when I was 19… another victim of comphet,” she winked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Comphet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Compulsory heterosexuality,” Rio clarified, before standing up and extending her arm to Agatha’s uninjured one, “Don’t worry, I’ll bring you up to speed on the lingo. It makes for excellent pillow talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That night, in spite of everything that had happened, when Agatha took Rio’s arm, a wonderful sense of peacefulness settled over them as they retired for the evening.

    <p>
     Thursday was a relatively peaceful day for everyone in the Maximoff family home. Rio had given Billy the day off, since he had been working without a break since she’d come on board to help Agatha. Wanda was working from home since it had snowed extensively overnight, and she seemed quite happy to be able to spend more time with her family and friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     And maybe it was due to the fact that she had woken up in Rio’s warm, soft arms after getting a solid 10 hours of sleep, but Agatha looked content for the first time since she met the woman. She got caught, on more than one occasion, glancing appreciatively at Rio, making the latter swoon on the inside. All things considered, it was a good day all around.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Lilia called Rio first thing on Friday morning. She'd been catching up on emails on her phone, stroking Agatha's hair softly while she slept soundly. She’d barely had time to peel herself away from her so she could answer the phone before it disconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It looks like all hope is not lost for the Republican Party,” Lilia chuckled.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What happened?” Rio whispered as she slipped on some socks and threw on a robe.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cushing threw his hat in the race this morning,” Lilia replied. “Why are you whispering? It’s almost 10, please tell me you’re not slacking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d finally made it out of the bedroom and closed the door quietly behind her. “I think everyone else is still sleeping here.” Rio hoped it sounded convincing, she definitely did not want to explain to Lilia who had been sleeping at her side for the past 4 nights.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Edward Cushing?” Rio asked curiously, settling in front of her laptop and opening the
     <em>
      Post
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one and only,” she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought he had announced his intent to retire last year,” Rio wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think Ralph’s hard-line crap made him change his mind,” Lilia laughed, “It’s good news for us, he can’t compete with Cushing’s reputation, the man radiates assertiveness and control. Certainly an appealing choice. And he has the full backing of the RNC leadership, and a long list of wealthy donors at his disposal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked through the announcement. Sure enough, the Senator from Massachusetts was running as the conservative candidate that would ‘restore sanity’ and return the party to its small government roots- and away from right-wing extremists. He was sure to get support from moderates who were already on the fence about the other candidates in the race.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Terrible news for Democrats, though,” Rio commented. “Still, I’d take him over Bohner or Whyte any day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It won’t be easy. He probably missed more than one filing deadline to appear on some primary ballots; organizing a write-in campaign in more than one state is going to be a nightmare.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not our circus, not our monkeys,” Rio chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How’s Agatha holding up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about the woman still sleeping in her bed upstairs.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s doing better than expected,” she answered, “Better than I would be doing if I were in her situation. At least we don’t have to go to Iowa in this weather.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “True, it’s freezing out here already. I have to go, let me know if anything changes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will do.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Something was off about Agatha, likely due to the fact that her mother was becoming more insistent with her calls. After her phone rang for the third consecutive time, Agatha brought it upstairs and threw it in a drawer.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could tell she was having trouble focusing on the book she was reading, worrying at her lip and often staring at nothing in particular, concern etched across her features. She knew better than to ask about Agatha’s family.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to ignore the feeling of uneasiness as she reviewed the coverage of Cushing’s announcement. His favorability ratings in the past had been steady, and it looked like his campaign was gaining followers by the hour. Great news for Team Harkness indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone rang mid-afternoon, an incoming call from an unknown D.C. number.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello,” she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Ms. Vidal? It’s Senator Bohner,”
     </em>
     came from the other end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s spine straightened, and she saw Agatha’s attention turn to her, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Is Agatha there with you? I’ve been trying to get ahold of her all day but she isn’t picking up her phone.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s here, what do you want?” Rio did not even try to hide the hostility in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Can you put her through?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled, covered the mic and turned to Agatha.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s Bohner, he wants to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t have time to remind her that she did not need to take his call, Agatha had gotten up and snatched it from her hand in a flash.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, give me a second,” she said to Bohner. She didn’t look back as she made her way upstairs, whispering something unintelligible.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     And that… stunned Rio. It hurt deeper than she’d care to acknowledge, how easily she’d shut her out. Not that she
     <em>
      shouldn’t
     </em>
     be able to take private calls, but that she’d seemingly forgotten what her husband had done to her days prior.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts raced at a thousand miles an hour. Had something happened to her mother? Is that why he had tried so hard to reach her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty minutes had passed and Agatha was nowhere to be seen. Rio decided to wait another twenty, and if she still wasn’t back she’d resolved to go look for her under the guise of retrieving her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t need to. Agatha returned downstairs, gave her Rio her phone back without uttering a single word, then retreated to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio found her pouring herself a glass of wine and downing it in a single gulp. She made a move to pour a second one before Rio stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy there,” she said carefully, “you should eat something first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not respond, she merely stopped what she was doing, almost in a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talk to me,” Rio said gently.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m starting to get worried,” Rio confessed. Upon a closer look, she noticed dry tear marks on her cheeks, her eyes red and puffy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s nothing,” she finally said, her voice only above a whisper. “I don’t… I don’t want to talk about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Rio replied, “If there’s anything I can do, please, just ask.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, then left the room, leaving the half-poured glass of wine behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Something was wrong.
     </em>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha kept to herself the rest of the afternoon, but she had dinner with the rest of the group. She was making an effort to sound natural, but Rio could see behind the façade. She didn’t comment on it, figuring she could try getting her to open up when they were alone in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Except that Agatha did not come to sleep with her that night. Rio waited until close to midnight, before turning the lights off and rolling over. She missed Agatha’s warmth, and the way the woman would spoon her immediately after falling asleep. Rio slept like shit, tossing and turning all night, restless.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha spent the weekend working with Wanda in the greenhouse behind the house. Wanda had a beautiful collection of rare flowers, and the two spent the day tending to them and talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Rio only crossed paths with them during their evening meal. She had taken Billy to see The Coven offices at one point and they’d gone over preliminary polling data with Jen and Alice.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not knock on her door on those nights either.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     On Monday morning, Rio got an email from Sharon asking to confirm if Agatha would be attending the White House Christmas Party on Wednesday. Rio was tempted to say no, still resenting the campaign manager over how she’d blindsided her, but seeing how secretive and reserved Agatha had been the previous 3 days, she simply told her she’d check and then get back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She found her in the kitchen, having breakfast with Billy. He could clearly sense something was off, but was following a similar strategy to Rio’s and waiting for her to open up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sharon wants to know if you’ll be attending the White House party on the 21st with your husband,” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s this Wednesday, right?” Rio nodded. “Yeah, I can do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy choked on the coffee he was drinking. He looked at Rio with eyes that screamed ‘what the fuck?’
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure that’s a good idea?” He questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m going, it’s not up for discussion,” she replied firmly. “I need a new gown, do you think I can sneak out to Saks for a couple of hours?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh.”
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     . “Sure, we’ll come with you so it can be as quick as possible.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio did not follow Billy and Agatha into the dressing rooms. She sat on the couch alongside a couple of men, faces buried in their phones, presumably waiting for their wives to be done shopping. It was busier than usual because of the holiday season, but that seemed to have worked out in their favor, they blended in with the crowds of shoppers seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     They emerged with a couple of bags an hour later, and caught up with the secret service agents that had escorted them in at a careful distance before heading back to Wanda’s.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “Ralph is coming back tomorrow, ahead of the party, so I was thinking I could go back to my place in the afternoon,” Agatha announced on Tuesday night.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked at her funny, like she couldn’t quite compute the words coming out of her mouth. “Are you sure? He can just swing by before the party and pick you up then. You don’t have to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it might be good for him and I to be in the same place, at least for a day or two,” she said, not looking up from her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had no idea what was happening.
     <em>
      What had changed?
     </em>
     She felt a sharp pain in her chest at the realization that Agatha would be unlikely to seek her out intimately in the near future. And if she did… Rio didn’t know if she would let her in so easily again. Her inexplicable rapprochement to Bohner felt more and more like a betrayal to her. She thought Agatha trusted her enough by now to open up a bit; clearly, she’d been wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll get out of your hair, too,” Rio added, “I truly appreciated your hospitality, Wanda.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to leave!” She protested. “I like having a full house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a shorter commute from the hotel to the Coven offices, and I’ve been asked to consult on a congressional race this week.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re leaving me?” Agatha asked, her voice strained.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I’m doing this on the side, it shouldn’t take too much of my time. And I get to do it remotely, which is nice. We can reconvene on Thursday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stared at her, for the first time in days. She worried at her lip, but didn’t say anything else.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They said their goodnights and Rio packed up her suitcase in her room. She shot a quick text to Alice to see if she could set her up in another hotel, and then there was a knock on her door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was wearing her pajamas, her arms crossed across her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can we talk for a bit?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure, come in,” Rio replied emotionlessly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat at the edge of the bed and looked at Rio’s suitcase.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to leave, Wanda really wants us all to stay here until at least Christmas.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s just easier for me this way,” Rio lied.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her skeptically. She was fidgeting with her top, something Rio now knew was a sign of profound anxiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you’re probably wondering why I’m going back to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You think?
     </em>
     Rio thought sarcastically. She let her continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I… He…” She was struggling to get the words out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t owe me an explanation,” Rio said firmly. “I’m your employee, not your partner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked like she’d been punched in the gut. Tears welled in her eyes. Rio ached for her but held her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Things are complicated,” Agatha managed to get out. “I’m just… scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of this?” Rio motioned between them. “Of us?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “No. I… have never wanted anything else —anyone else— more,” she confessed quietly, tears still at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fell to her knees in front of her and pleaded with her. “Just tell me what’s wrong, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a sob. “I can’t. I don’t know how.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up and sat next to her, their foreheads and noses touching, holding hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is he blackmailing you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is he hurting you? Has he hurt you before?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shook her head, not trusting her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it about your mother?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Indirectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you in imminent danger?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated. Then shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you tell me at some point?”
    </p>
    <p>
     More tears fell. “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, baby,” Rio said. “Do you want to stay with me tonight?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please.”

    <p>
     On Wednesday, Rio discovered that there was one thing she hated more than seeing Agatha break down in tears, and that was watching her and Bohner arm in arm, pretending nothing had happened and everything was normal.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d spent the majority of the day working out of The Coven offices, reviewing strategy documents for a congressional campaign in Idaho. There wasn’t anything particularly surprising to see, the Democratic challenger didn’t stand much of a chance in his extremely conservative district, but that hadn’t deterred him from running. Rio appreciated those who would fight the good fight until the end and was happy to advise on possible areas of opportunity to connect with undecided voters.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have plans tonight?” Lilia asked after knocking on the door of the conference room where she was working.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she replied, “Agatha and Bohner are going to the White House, and Billy has the evening off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When was the last time you had a meeting with Chris Matthison?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was curious as to why her meeting with the President’s chief of staff was of interest to Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d have to look at my calendar, but probably two months ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So your security clearance is probably still good,” Lilia added knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Probably.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My plus one canceled on me last minute, do you want to come to the party tonight?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Absolutely not
     </em>
     , the last thing Rio wanted was to spend an evening watching Agatha cozying up to Bohner in public.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if Lilia could sense her hesitation, she added, “Sarah asked about you the last time I saw her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That piqued Rio’s interest. While the breakup had been painful for both of them, inevitable, Rio might say giving their different careers, they were still on good terms. And Rio’s need for self-preservation was at an all-time high, she wasn’t sure how long she could go enduring the situation with Agatha. She’d woken up before Rio, and when she ran into her in the living room, she had avoided her gaze before asking Agent Kaplan to drive her home without another glance. It had hit her like a bucket of cold water, waking her up from whatever fantasy dream she’d been having about actually being with Agatha, and left her cold and aching for some comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should I pick you up from the Kimpton at 6?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I actually checked into the Conrad this morning, but I can just meet you there.”
     <br/>
     “Wear something nice,” Lilia threw a wink her way as she left the space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wondered if she should give Agatha a heads up before they ran into each other at the party. She wrote and deleted multiple texts to the her, then ultimately decided against it.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she ordered a new emerald green designer pantsuit combo that she could wear without a bra, modest enough for a formal affair, but also bold and daring, and placed it on a pick up hold for that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she was getting dressed for the event and fixing her makeup, Rio wasn’t entirely sure if all the effort she was putting into her look was for Agatha’s or Sarah’s benefit. Either way, she was sure to get some looks that night.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha did a double-take when she spotted Rio across the room, but the latter pretended not to notice. Bohner’s hand was on the small of her back as he talked to Congressman McCormack and his wife, and another couple Rio didn’t immediately recognize.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     The dress Agatha and Billy had picked was stunning, a navy blue gown with delicate sequin accents, and long sleeves to cover up the gauze still covering the stitches on her arm. Her hair was up in a ponytail, and she looked at least a decade younger. In spite of being surrounded by politicians and getting some odd looks from Democrats, she looked like she was in control, confidently laughing at what Rio presumed were some terrible jokes, and exchanging playful banter with the other spouses. At one point, Bohner leaned over to whisper in her ear and she placed a gently kiss on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s insides churned. If she hadn’t still been reeling from the cold shoulder she had gotten not even 12 hours prior as well as her apparent change of heart regarding her sleazy husband, Rio would have ogled and kept a watchful eye on her all evening. Instead, as she saw the White House press secretary approaching, Rio turned towards her and put on her most seductive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look what the cat dragged in,” Sarah said cheekily at Rio. “They’re letting just about anyone in here these days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I recall you crashing more than one party back in the day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sarah was only a couple of years older than her, and in spite of having one of the most public-facing roles in the administration, she still managed to sound genuine and relaxed. Rio had forgotten how easy it was to talk to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What brings you here tonight?” She asked, grabbing two flutes of champagne from a nearby tray and passing one to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia,” Rio replied, “in her down time, she still likes to play matchmaker.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank goodness for that,” Sarah replied earnestly. “I’ve missed seeing you around.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words made Rio’s heart flutter involuntarily. Flirting out in the open, in a room full of strangers without drawing any attention or fearing someone might use it against them, it made Rio smile widely.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whose campaign are you working on this cycle?” Sarah asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m working for Bohner’s wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yikes,” Sarah replied, “poor woman. I saw her earlier, though she didn’t look as furious at her husband as I expected her to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me either,” Rio replied before she could stop herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? Do you think she’s coming around to his campaign?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I doubt it, but maybe she’s realized by now that she can use it to her advantage. Who knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doesn’t she talk to you?” Sarah asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want to talk about Agatha anymore,” Rio changed the topic quickly, “tell me about what you’ve been up to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you asking me if I’m seeing someone?” She asked with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe, are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perhaps we should change that,” Rio said, toying with the fabric of Sarah’s dress.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the latter could reply, someone cleared their throat behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was standing there, with Bohner on her side. He spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ms. Weissmann. And Ms. Vidal, fancy seeing you here,” he said with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Senator,” Rio replied tersely. She looked over at Agatha, her blue eyes were shooting daggers at Sarah. It didn’t seem like she’d noticed, but if Agatha didn’t school her features soon, someone else might.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio said acknowledged casually, forcing her to tear her eyes off of Sarah. When she met Rio’s, she shook her head discreetly, hoping the message was clear that she should stand down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve made quite an impact on the American people over the past two weeks, Senator,” Sarah said conversationally, “I wonder, however, if a less explosive path may have been more prudent in the long run.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll just have to wait and see how things play out, won’t we?” He was undeterred. “I had a wonderful chat with Governor Whyte over there, I’m eager to debate him and my other opponents next month. I think he and I both have a pretty solid understanding of what America needs right now, even if we disagree on the finer points.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s bandwidth for Bohner had run out, so she excused herself, walking down the hallway towards another room and hoping Sarah would do the same and follow her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened a door to reveal a smaller, empty sitting room, with a multiple chairs and a sofa, with some classic paintings hanging on the walls. She was sure that room was named after a former President, but at the moment she couldn’t recall which one. She heard the door open and close behind her, so she turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t Sarah who had followed her, but Agatha. And she looked… furious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was that about?” She asked indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know what you mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t act coy with me,” Agatha spat.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I assure you, I don’t know what I’ve done to upset you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes bore into hers, then she huffed and sat down on the sofa, frustrated.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her from where she was standing, aware of their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did something happen with Bohner?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No. I mean, nothing other than what you already know about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then what’s the matter?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you here tonight?” She asked accusatorially. “Why didn't you tell me you were coming?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t know I would be until earlier this afternoon,” Rio answered, her tone betraying her frustration, “I wasn’t aware I owed you a play by play of my schedule.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would have appreciated some warning. So I could have prepared.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Prepared for what? I’m on
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     team,” she asked indignantly. “You prepare for your opponents, not your allies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To see you… out and about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, is this about Sarah?” Rio asked incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lack of response was all the confirmation she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So I ran into my ex at her place of employment, I don’t see how that’s a problem for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood up abruptly. “Are you trying to get back together with her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe, I don’t know, we were rudely interrupted,” Rio fired back. She was getting angrier by the minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about me?” She asked, a rawness to her voice she hadn’t heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about you, Agatha?” Rio wanted to scream.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought… you know what, never mind.” She bit her lip, then turned to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re back with Bohner. And while you’re free to go back to your husband whenever you want, you can’t expect me to stick around and wait for you,” Rio added tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not
     <em>
      back
     </em>
     with him,” Agatha said loudly, prompting Rio to move towards her so she would lower voice. “We’re just… coordinating.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Coordinating
     <em>
      on what
     </em>
     ?” Rio gritted through clenched teeth. “How am I supposed to do my job if you don’t tell me what’s going on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked like she was on the verge of tears. Rio took a steadying breath, hoping to diffuse the tension.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that all I am to you? A job?” Agatha asked, vulnerability clear on her features, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio closed her eyes for a moment. She couldn’t think straight, not when Agatha looked at her like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want from me?” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I…” Agatha began. “I want…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perhaps you should figure that out first,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached out for her hands, took a step close and whispered, “I want… you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t know that I could even feel this way about anyone,” Agatha confessed. “I wasn’t even sure of what I was until I met you. I had my suspicions, I told you, but I didn’t know
     <em>
      for sure
     </em>
     until
     <em>
      you.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s pulse was out of control, but Agatha didn’t stop, she didn’t look like she could stop even if she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t stop thinking about you. I can’t sleep when I’m not with you. And I can’t
     <em>
      stand
     </em>
     seeing you with other women.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I’m terrified because I don’t know how to make it stop,” she took another step closer, their faces an inch from each other. “I’m terrified because I don’t want it to stop. I feel like I’m going insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And then you call me
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     and my brain just shuts down,” Agatha pressed her nose to Rio’s. “Tell me that you want me, too,” she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Rio said without hesitation. “But this… us… it won’t be easy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” she replied, rubbing the tip of her nose against Rio’s cheeks. “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threaded her fingers behind Agatha’s neck and pulled her closer gently. When their lips touched, they both melted into the kiss immediately.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Every nerve on her body was awake, their kiss quickly becoming passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt Agatha’s hands exploring her body as she moaned into her mouth. She pulled her a bit closer so that their fronts were pressed together, the warmth of her skin radiating through her dress. Agatha pulled back slightly to breathe before diving back with more force.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt like she was being consumed by the intensity of the kiss. She never wanted to stop, and when she felt Agatha’s tongue softly begging for entrance, Rio opened her mouth so they could taste each other fully. She felt herself soaking her underwear, arousal dripping down her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were interrupted by the sound of something breaking in a nearby room. They pulled away minutely, Rio’s hands stroking Agatha’s face and arranging her stray hairs behind her ears. The latter’s eyes were still closed, and she let out a contented sigh when Rio started placing soft kisses on her neck and collarbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should go back before someone starts missing us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to let go so quickly, but she had regained some of her senses and had become acutely aware of their surroundings.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted in response, then pressed another kiss to her lips. “Are you sure you want to go back?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio growled, “but we should still do it.” She gently pressed Agatha backwards to put some space between them. She looked positively debauched, and Rio couldn’t get enough of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me see if I can fix your make up before we go out,” Rio muttered softly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe we should let them see,” Agatha replied playfully but earned a look from Rio.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to be discrete with this,” she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But how will other women know not to flirt with you?” Agatha half-joked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let them flirt, I only have eyes for you,” Rio said honestly. “Just please don’t fuck your husband, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, making Rio feel warm and safe. “Not a chance… sweetheart.”

    <p>
     After assuring Rio that she would not, in fact, share a bed with her husband, they went their separate ways for the night. Bohner was catching an early flight back to Des Moines, so Rio texted Billy to meet her at the residence at 11 a.m. She herself was planning on getting there an hour earlier so she could get on the same page with the woman.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She contemplated asking Lilia for advice. Pursuing Agatha romantically was diametrically opposed to her job as her handler. She was supposed to help her keep a low profile and reduce the chances of further scandal and damage to her reputation, not potentially creating one of her own. Her professional responsibilities and her personal aspirations were at odds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waved at the secret service detail that now followed Agatha around wherever she went. She spotted Agent Kaplan on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette, and he nodded in her direction as she approached the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t set foot near her house since they had relocated to Wanda’s the week prior, so she took in the sight of the vandalized door. She’d done a pretty good job at repainting it in her rush of adrenaline. Agatha could’ve paid someone to refinish it and erase all traces of the incident before moving back in but hadn’t. Rio wondered why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha opened the door a split second after she knocked, beckoning her inside. She shut the door behind them with more force than necessary and pinned Rio against it, causing her to gasp in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips smashed and Agatha’s soft moans were the only sounds she could hear in the quiet of the house. Her hands wandered freely this time, and Rio took her time to enjoy touching her as well, albeit with a bit more restraint so as to not scare her off. Agatha pressed her entire body against her, seeking some friction, and Rio wad more than happy to oblige, slipping her thigh between her legs. Agatha whimpered at the contact and tightened her hold on Rio’s ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let them both enjoy the proximity and intimacy for as long as they could. At one point Agatha pulled up for air and Rio took a quick glance at the clock on top of the fireplace. They only had 20 minutes before Billy came by, and she wanted to lay some ground rules with the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Darling,” she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha beamed. She clearly enjoyed the pet names Rio had for her. She leaned back in for another messy kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We need to go over some things,” she struggled to get the words out one by one since Agatha was now kissing the shell of her ear in a way that made Rio shiver and her nipples harden.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do we?” Agatha countered playfully, her right hand trailing around Rio’s abdomen lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio hissed as she felt her hand reach the underside of her breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me, baby,” she said, nipping at her earlobe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just let out a strangled moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I distracting you?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was enjoying teasing her way too much. Rio would’ve found it profoundly arousing if she didn’t have a nagging feeling of dread regarding their situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She straightened up, grabbed Agatha’s hand and led her into the kitchen. Definitely a less sexy position than being pinned against solid wood with a thigh against her core.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need to understand,” Rio began, “that pursuing this thing between us… puts us both at risk. If word got out that you were gay and having an affair with your handler, it could haunt you for the rest of your life. And I would never be able to work again in politics.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, so we have to be discrete,” Agatha said calmly, echoing her words from last night, her hands inching towards Rio’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s more than just that. You can’t text me about anything that isn’t work-related. We need to operate under the assumption that anyone can be watching us at all times.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, pondering her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t like hiding,” Rio said honestly, “I spent a good chunk of my life hiding who I was and don’t want to revisit that feeling .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve never not hidden.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, baby,” Rio stroked her injured arm affectionately, “but now is definitely not the right time for you to come out. Not publicly, at least. If you want to tell Wanda or Vision, I’m sure they would keep your secret. But I… I don’t want to be forced to lie—about us— if anybody comes asking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned into Rio’s touch. “I don’t want to lie either. I’m too old and too tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio huffed a laugh at her comment. “There’s something else, too. If you really want to be with me, to try to make
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     work between us, I really need you to be honest with me. Not in my capacity as your advisor, but as a partner. I can’t… know you less well than
     <em>
      him
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Somethings are… hard for me to share with anyone,” she replied thoughtfully, “There are things about me that even he doesn’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you at least tell me what he has on you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He doesn’t have anything on me,” Agatha said, confused.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then what made you change your mind about supporting him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Something
     </em>
     changed,” she said cautiously, “and he’s trying to protect me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can protect you, too,” Rio said with an edge in her voice. “I want you to at least let me try.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears welled in her eyes and she looked away.
     <span>
     </span>
     There was a knock on the front door. “Maybe I can share some things later, when Billy goes home for the day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just bear with me, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and placed a soft, chaste kiss on Rio’s lips before heading to the foyer.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     “I have good news,” Billy announced cheerfully. “I found something for you to work on!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah?” Agatha asked, intrigued.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eddie’s classmate at Georgetown, he was asked to leave a lecture because of a shirt he was wearing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did the shirt say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      ‘Gay for Jesus’
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio made a disgusted face. Figures they would overreact to anything queer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s a private university… and a Jesuit one at that,” Agatha began, “It’s a tricky situation, from a legal standpoint.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about his First Amendment right to free speech?” Billy asked indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s not how that works,” Agatha said, almost with a chuckle, “the First Amendment protects citizens from
     <em>
      government
     </em>
     abuse and censorship. A private university can have their own policies regarding dress codes and other forms of expression.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So what you're saying is you won’t do anything about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never said that,” Agatha replied, smiling, “I’ve rarely ever gotten to play David in my corporate career.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure the Georgetown board of directors would object to their biblical characterization,” Rio added. “And as much as I would like to heal my childhood religious trauma vicariously through this kid, I don’t think Agatha should get involved in this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why not?” They both asked in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A discrimination lawsuit brought by the spouse of a Presidential candidate on an election year will in no uncertain terms make the news,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “On top of that, it also happens to be an issue of LGBTQ rights— a hot topic, thanks to your husband and his colleagues. And we don’t want to draw attention to ourselves on that front for obvious reasons.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, please, this can be my Christmas gift this year,” Billy begged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And then what would I do with those Eras Tour tickets I got for you and Eddie?”
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You bought us the tickets?!” Billy was close to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I guess I could resell them,” Agatha feigned seriousness, “I’m sure someone might want them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine, not my Christmas gift, my
     <em>
      early birthday present
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your birthday was last month,” Agatha deadpanned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said
     <em>
      early!
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio caught Agatha’s eyes. As much as she would love to spearhead a civil rights crusade, it would draw a lot of scrutiny their way. The exact thing they wanted to avoid if they were going to be sneaking around to be together. “You can’t have both things,” Rio said quietly, only for Agatha to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s also the issue of going against Bohner’s
     <em>
      traditional values
     </em>
     campaign,” Rio added, for everyone in the room this time. “And we’re cooperating with them, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since when?” Billy all but yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph and I talked yesterday and we agreed that it would be best if we showed a united front in public for now,” Agatha acquiesced.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy turned to Rio in shock. “And you’re okay with this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If it’s what Agatha wants, yes,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But why? After what he did to you? Why would you help him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would also like to know the answer to that question. Agatha raised her hands defensively.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s just something we decided makes sense for us right now.” There was an air of finality to her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you’re just going to forgive him and take him back?” Billy sounded betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t leave him right now,” she said, then looked towards Rio, “but I will. When this is all over. And I did tell him I wanted to separate… at least in private.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t realized she was holding her breath. Some of the weight on her chest had been lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did he accept it?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Reluctantly, but yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about it for a moment. “Let me see if Jen and Alice know of someone in the DMV running for the Democratic nomination in a solidly blue district, see if they want to take on the case. Does that sound good, Billy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” he said, still looking at Agatha with a strange look on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do think it’s a good idea to look for projects Agatha could work on during her leave,” Rio said, “Have you heard back from the legal aid clinic?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Martha emailed me on Monday, they’re still mulling things over.” Agatha looked sour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, so maybe something else, something that doesn’t require a law degree,” Rio said, “We can also work on your hobbies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have hobbies!” She said indignantly. “I read, I cook, I organize the house— I look after Scratchy!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Most of those things are chores, not hobbies,” Billy nudged her playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine. What do you suggest?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could get into running,” Billy suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Outside? In this weather? Pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think it would be better to find something you could do with others, possibly meet new people,” Rio commented.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t need new people,” she said petulantly, “I have all the people I need.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All four of them,” Billy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, and I can afford to lose one,” she glared at Billy, who faked shock and offense.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In all seriousness,” Rio said, “Scratchy is not a hobby. We need to find something you want to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha mouthed
     <em>
      ‘I know what I want to do’
     </em>
     seductively at Rio, making her blush.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe an animal shelter?” Billy suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want to worry about bringing fleas and disease home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was the last thing you did for fun?” Rio asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know. Work, probably.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s so depressing,” Billy mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t appreciate where this conversation is going,” Agatha huffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just think about what brings you joy,” Rio interjected, “We can circle back to that after Christmas.”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio had Billy walk Agatha through the latest polling data. He was quickly learning how to evaluate them for accuracy, and quite enthusiastically relayed to Agatha just how and why Nate Silver’s model failed to predict the results of the 2016 election. He had probably been listening to political podcasts, and the thought made Rio proud. Billy was quickly growing into his role.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the holidays were over, Bohner would begin debate prep ahead of the Iowa caucus, and Sharon had emailed asking for volunteers to play his opponents during debate prep. Rio suggested Agatha should play Cushing since she grew up in his home state, but she declined, saying she didn’t want to be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     involved with his campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around 5 p.m. they called it a day. Billy tried to convince both Agatha and Rio to return to the Maximoff residence until the 26th. Agatha said she wanted some privacy and time alone ‘to think’. Rio almost laughed when she heard her say that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should go back to the hotel, too,” Rio said, eyeing Agatha to gauge her reaction. She didn’t want to push her luck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And leave me here, all alone and in danger?” Agatha pouted dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     in danger, there’s four secret service men stationed outside.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not to mention the
     <em>
      cold
     </em>
     ,” Agatha continued, “Am I expected to warm myself up
     <em>
      all night long
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You might want to look into community theater as a hobby, you’re quite the actress,” Rio replied without bite, putting down her bag and taking off her jacket. “Tell me more about
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     you would like to be warmed up tonight.”

    <p>
     Rio followed Agatha upstairs and into the guest bedroom. The bed wasn’t made and she noticed that she hadn’t changed the sheets from when she had stayed there— the blue and white flower pattern was quite distinctive and memorable.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Agatha curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I liked the way they smelled,” she shrugged, feigning casualness.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhm,” Rio replied playfully, “I like the way
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     smell.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever confidence Agatha had displayed downstairs, it had evaporated as they entered the bedroom. She sucked in a deep breath before confessing, “I’ve never done this before. With a woman.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked over to sit on the bed and pulled Agatha to stand in front of her, looking at her from below to give her a sense of control.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You take the lead,” Rio said reassuringly, “Show me what you like, tell me what you’re ready for. I’m in no rush, and I want you to be comfortable.” She pressed a soft kiss to her abdomen and looked up at her in a way that she hoped conveyed her affection for the woman but also projected safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit her lip. “I have… trouble. Trusting people… intimately.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Rio said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Even with Ralph, it took me a long time to open up to him like this,” there was a nervous edge to her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not want to think about Bohner at that moment, but she had struggled to get Agatha to be honest with her and she wasn’t about to interrupt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We don’t have to do anything you aren’t comfortable with. Not tonight, not ever. I want you to be happy, and I want to learn what you need and want. If you’ll let me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A single tear slipped down Agatha’s cheek, and Rio moved to wipe it gently with her thumb. Agatha was frozen on the spot and Rio noticed something was off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I… have always struggled with intimacy,” she confessed, her voice raw. “When I was 15, I…”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh no
     </em>
     , Rio thought. She stroked her hands reassuringly and encouraged to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “One of my dad’s friends. I think he could tell I was gay. He was kind at first, he gave me the kind of attention no one had ever paid me before. He would seek me out at social events, try to make me laugh.” Agatha shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s sense of dread was back. She did not interrupt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t remember exactly how it happened. All I know is one minute I was eating and talking to people at a party, and the next he had cornered me in another room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby,” Rio kissed her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “He made me feel used, and dirty, and broken,” Agatha said, her tears flowing freely now, “he told me no one would ever want me if they knew who I truly was, what I had done. And he used that against me— over and over, every year until I left for college.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was crying, too. He wanted to tear the head off of whoever this man was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For all his faults, Ralph was good to me,” she said quietly, “he taught me how to love myself again. I trusted him with the truth, and he didn’t back away. He made me feel safe for the first time in my life. And while I may not have loved him in the same way I could ever love a woman, I did love him as a partner. He took good care of me. He helped me heal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time since she met him, Rio’s feelings towards him were not negative. She could tell what a lifeline he’d been to Agatha. She felt some of her previous hostility towards him ebb away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think that’s why, even as coming out and being gay in public became more socially acceptable, I still couldn’t do it. I didn’t know if anyone else would ever accept me after what had happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her hands again, stroked the back of her palms soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think my mother knew what I was, too,” Agatha continued, “but in my family, you don’t get to be anything other than perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are perfect, Agatha, just the way you are.” Under any other circumstance, Rio would have thought it sounded cliche, but she wanted Agatha to feel the conviction in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want to be perfect, I want to be me,” Agatha said with a frustrated huff. “Even after hiding the things she didn’t like about me, I still wasn’t good enough for my mother. Ralph didn’t have the pedigree she wanted. I worked too much. And we never had kids. That was impossible to accept. I was a failure, and she has never ceased to remind me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands were now stroking her face. Agatha was blinking slowly, relaxing into her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re not a failure. You’re a strong, beautiful, brilliant woman. The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew I was a goner. That’s the effect you had on me. And I don’t want the manicured version of you that people expect. I want you, all of you. Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved forward carefully and straddled Rio’s lap. Instinctively, the latter encircled her waist with her arms, holding her closer.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry I come with so much baggage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t,” Rio said firmly, “anyone who doesn’t respect you and accept all of you doesn’t deserve you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed her forehead against Rio’s. She exhaled a deep breath and let herself melt into her embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think we should take things slowly,” Rio said, stroking her long hair, placing gentle kisses anywhere she could reach. “I don’t expect you to trust me right away. I want to earn your trust, baby. You can show me what you need as we go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want this,” Agatha whispered. “I want to let go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her lips softly. “I’m not going anywhere,” she reiterated. “I want this so much it fucking hurts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at Rio. She stood up and went to lie down next to her. Rio leaned backwards to meet her there.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m crazy about you,” Agatha confessed, “I never knew I could feel this way. It feels so… right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For me, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m embarrassed I don’t know how to touch you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be,” Rio said nuzzling her nose, “I’ll show you. And you’ll show me what you like.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not even sure if
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     know what I like.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then we’ll figure that out together, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that night, Rio pulled Agatha’s back into her chest and stroked her hair until she fell asleep, whispering sweet words of reassurance and affection.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They woke up early, before their alarms went off and stayed in bed for a while, admiring each other. When Agatha’s alarm finally rang, she rolled out of bed and stretched leisurely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should shower, I feel like a mess.” Rio watched her pause in her movements, then turn to face her. “Would you… would you like to join me… in the shower?” She asked hesitantly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     As if Rio could say no to that offer. She jumped out of bed immediately.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, ma’am,” she said playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled at her then, and her face was radiating joy. She looked down at Rio’s clothed body. Neither of them had changed for the night, they fell asleep in their day clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I…?” She asked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please,” Rio whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers were precise yet delicate. She gently began to undress Rio, button by button, inch by inch. After she removed her shirt, and her pants pooled at her feet, Agatha stepped closer and began peppering kisses on Rio’s skin, making her moan in pleasure. This felt more intimate than anything she had ever done before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt Agatha’s fingers reach behind her to unhook her bra, and when it joined her other clothes on the floor, Agatha pulled back to look at her. She glanced at Rio’s eyes as if to ask for permission, and Rio nodded frantically.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She began exploring her breasts with the tips of her fingers, and Rio shivered and her nipples pebbled in response. Agatha gave her right breast a gentle squeeze, and Rio’s head fell backwards in response. She placed a gentle kiss on top of it, before her tongue darted out and licked a small stripe near her nipple.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out another pleasured moan, and before she knew it Agatha had drawn her nipple into her mouth and was sucking it energetically. She released it with a soft pop and moved over to her other breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was desperately trying not to move so Agatha could stay in control, but she was becoming painfully aroused. She was going to be reduced into a whimpering mess soon. Agatha stepped back and turned on the shower, adjusting the water temperature before returning to Rio. She hooked her fingers on her panties and pulled them down carefully. Rio was certain Agatha could probably smell how aroused she was. She was sure she looked it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed Rio’s hands and brought them up to her own shirt. With the same care Agatha had shown her, she undressed her piece by piece. Before she could follow suit and ravish her breasts, Agatha led them into the shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Underneath the hot stream, Rio bent over and licked the water off of her breasts. Agatha moaned, then grabbed Rio’s head and brought it closer to where she wanted her mouth.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio devoured her. She listened for her moans and whimpers to see what she needed next, felt herself being guided from one nipple to other. She thought she might pass out from the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I—Do you want me to get you off?” Rio offered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just nodded, she didn’t trust herself to speak. With her right knee, Rio nudged Agatha legs apart and placed her upper thigh directly against her wet core. Agatha moaned wantonly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it okay if I—“ Rio motioned to her own cunt, which lingered a mere inch above Agatha’s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” she hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all the encouragement Rio needed. She began rocking herself against her, creating enough friction to stimulate them both. Within a minute, Agatha was panting, close to release. She flung her arms around Rio’s neck and orgasmed as she kissed her fiercely. Rio followed suit with a cry a moment after.
    </p>
    <p>
     They held each other for a while, gasping for air under the hot water. When they finally pulled apart, Rio grabbed some shampoo and began to lather Agatha’s locks.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love your hair,” she mumbled as she gently massaged her scalp, Agatha’s naked ass pressing against Rio’s front. She let out a content hum.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they were both clean, they shut the water off and kissed in the lingering steam, making them both dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     They got dry and dressed for the day, Rio borrowing one of Agatha's sweaters. When they descended the stairs, hair still wet and with a pleasant flush on their cheeks, they spotted Billy in the kitchen, a wide knowing grin on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Under any other circumstance, I would be pretty horrified if I’d walked into you freshly fucked,” Billy said cheerfully, and Agatha let out a horrified gasp. “Today, I’m just happy for you.”

     “Should I leave?” Billy asked mischievously, “I don’t actually want to walk into the two of you going at it, that would actually be traumatic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was so embarrassed she couldn’t speak. Rio recovered faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think you’ve earned a couple of days vacation,” Rio said grinning, “perhaps you and Eddie can do something fun?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!” Agatha exclaimed, but the woman shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to tell mom about this, she’s going to be so happy you finally made a move,” Billy beamed at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Finally?
     </em>
     ” Rio mouthed playfully at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s it, both of you, out,” she grunted, sans malice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy, I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you what a delicate situation we're in,” Rio said, her tone more serious, “you can’t tell anyone about any of this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not even your mom, or Eddie,” she added.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Believe or not, Eddie and I have much better things to do than talk about you two,” Billy said, smiling. “Mom, on the other hand… she doesn’t have a lot going on, she
     <em>
      will
     </em>
     ask me for details if you tell her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll talk to her at some point,” Agatha got out, her voice strained.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <em>
      am
     </em>
     happy for you,” Billy reiterated while packing his things, “for both of you. You deserve to be happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw tears well in Agatha’s eyes and ran her hand soothingly on her back, before pressing a kiss on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my God, can’t you wait two seconds for me to leave the room?” He said indignantly, covering his eyes. “Rio, will you walk me out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure, kid,” she answered while Agatha eyed them curiously as they walked to the foyer, away from her reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So…” Billy began awkwardly. “Wow, this whole situation seemed easier in my head.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to threaten me with bodily harm if I hurt her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, basically.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed. “You have nothing to worry about. I care for her, deeply.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.” Billy released a breath he was holding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I will make sure no one else hurts her, either. Asshole husband included.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Noted.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her wallet, pulled out a hundred dollar bill and handed it to Billy. “Go, take Eddie out on a nice date. God knows I would like to do the same for her but can’t. Consider this my Christmas gift to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled widely and gave Rio a hug. “You’re both still coming to our place for dinner in two days, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I can still walk in 48 hours, yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “OH MY GOD! I’m leaving NOW!”
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio lounged around the house the rest of the morning. A little before lunch time, Rio went back to the hotel to grab fresh clothes (“I don’t understand why you can’t just wear my stuff, it fits you,” Agatha protested) and some food. They took a long nap on the couch afterwards, Rio holding her impossibly close.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio woke up, Agatha was once again sprawled on top of her, making her chuckle. She hadn’t lied to Billy, she truly lov… cared about Agatha.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She began placing barely there kisses on the woman’s face, until she finally stirred awake.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” she croaked sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey to you,” Rio replied, running her fingers through her scalp, making her moan. The sound reminded her of their earlier shower and made her cunt pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if her mind was also replaying scenes from that morning, she turned to Rio, raising her leg over her body and placing her knee directly above Rio’s core, who hissed in response, nostrils flaring.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look Agatha was giving her could move mountains, and she was suddenly overwhelmed by the desire to make her hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to taste you so bad, baby,” was all she managed to get out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned in response, her hands running under her shirt and up to Rio’s naked breasts. She pinched a nipple softly, making Rio scream and arch her back in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, baby, can I put my mouth on you? Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flipped them over, making Agatha yelp in surprise, then let out a laugh at being handled that way.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy tiger,” she said playfully, pulling Rio up her to lips so she could kiss her deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands were working desperately to remove her pants and divest Agatha of her shirt and bra. Once she was left in only her underwear, she began kissing the way down her body, paying special attention to her breasts. She licked, sucked and bit gently on her nipples, making Agatha buck forward, desperate for some friction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Patience, my darling,” she said as her mouth covered her breasts again.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, just fucking touch me, anything,” Agatha whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the desperation on her face, Rio took mercy on her and continued her descent, positioning herself between the woman’s legs.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha had a chance to react, she began rubbing her over her underwear.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re so wet baby, is this all for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just moaned in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I bet you taste delicious,” she added, pushing her panties to side and running her tongue up and down her slit. “So much better than I imagined.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was too far gone to get any words out. Rio removed her underwear and hooked her legs over her shoulders so she could have more access.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmphh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Show me how you touch yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand found her way to her clit and she began rubbing it furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah ah,” Rio corrected, “slowly. I can’t learn what you like if you go that fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her pace slowed, and Rio took note of her movements. She gently withdrew her hand and replaced it with her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a shocked gasp, followed by an extremely loud moan. Rio couldn’t have possibly been more turned on. She worked her clit relentlessly, alternating between sucking it into her mouth and dipping her tongue into her wet folds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was mumbling something incoherent, but Rio made out the words “so close.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s right baby, come in my mouth,” Rio beckoned her, returning to her ministrations with even more vigor. She felt Agatha tremble and grab the back of her head to push her against her clit harder before she climaxed.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio placed soft kisses on the inside of her thighs after she stopped shaking before climbing back up to her lips.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You did so good, baby,” Rio mumbled, almost in a trance. Agatha mewled in response. “Can you take me again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was still panting and recovering from her orgasm, but Rio’s face must’ve conveyed the desperation she felt because Agatha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lying flat on her back, Rio swung Agatha’s left leg over her body, her right hand immediately going down to stroke her folds. Agatha sighed and let herself be consumed by the pleasure and the softness of her lover’s embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     She teased her entrance with one finger, before asking her if she enjoyed penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like anything you do to me,” was Agatha’s response. Rio growled in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Rio dipped her finger into her warmth, eliciting a strangled moan from Agatha, and began pumping it inside her.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a minute, she heard Agatha croak, “More.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio beamed at Agatha for asking for what she wanted, quickly withdrew her finger before entering her again with two.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yes, that’s it, baby, please don’t stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio brought her left hand down to meet the other, pressing her palm against Agatha’s swollen clit while maintaining a steady pace with her right hand.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gonna come,” Agatha warned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, baby, come for me,” Rio replied, kissing her chest and pumping inside her faster. Agatha fell apart, shivering and trembling around her fingers. She let out a sigh when Rio finally withdrew them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She flipped them over again so that Agatha could recover on her back.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I blacked out there for a minute,” she said once her breathing had slowed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It happens.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does it really?” Agatha asked incredulously.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Rio replied, grinning madly. “Have you ever squirted before?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I- I don't think I can.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll see about that,” she added with a wink.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     They moved upstairs to the bedroom some time later, once Agatha was able to stand again. Rio was checking her phone when Agatha all but pounced on top of her, making her laugh uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I see you’ve regained some of your energy,” she said playfully, “Wanna ride my face?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blushed, but shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to touch you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Rio’s voice came out strangled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit her lip and nodded mischievously. Rio was so turned on she could barely talk anymore. As Agatha began undressing her, she gasped and moaned some.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she was bare, Agatha knelt before her and tentatively touched her folds. Rio shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
     She expected Agatha to tease her, to explore her mound carefully; instead, the woman dove head first and began sucking on her clit in earnest. Rio came within less than thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     She would have been embarrassed had she been with anybody else, but Agatha looked up at her with a wild look that made her look dangerous. It excited Rio so much it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better than good,” Rio answered truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha beamed and crawled up to lie next to her. “I think… I think I would like to fuck you from behind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and let Agatha take charge.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It shouldn’t have surprised Rio that Agatha would be a top. She was still recovering from their latest tryst in the TV room when Agatha approached her, wearing an open robe with only her underwear underneath. Her eyes were half-closed, and she was sprawled ungracefully on the sectional, her legs unresponsive.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened her eyes when she felt something soft being placed on her chest. Señor Scratchy eyed her curiously before sitting on her stomach. Her hands immediately went to pet his soft fur, humming contentedly.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I had a bathtub, I’m very sore,” Agatha said, “Do you want to shower with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think I can move,” Rio replied truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha placed a soft kiss on her forehead before she headed to the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your mother is insatiable,” she whispered to the bunny, before rearranging herself on the couch so she could doze off for a couple of minutes.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was undeniably in love with her. Her heart nearly beat out of her chest at the realization.
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you think, mister? Too soon to tell her I love her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she heard Agatha say from across the room where she had just exited the bedroom, her robe replaced a matching set of pajamas. Rio froze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You weren’t supposed to tell,” she berated the bunny, who hopped off towards Agatha as she approached. The older woman sat next to her, eyeing her nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really?” She asked, her eyes wide and vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Rio said lovingly, sitting up to face her. “I’m completely, unequivocally and madly in love with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned forward to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For what it's worth,” she whispered, stroking Rio’s face, “I love you, too.”

      “Merry Christmas!” Rio said cheerfully.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha eyed the toy she’d just unwrapped skeptically where it sat on the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We don’t need this,” she said frowning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nobody
     </span>
     <span>
      <em>
       needs
      </em>
     </span>
     <span>
      a strap,” Rio poked her side playfully, “it’s a little treat. Look, I got the one with the textured base.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hm,” Agatha replied, “it’s massive.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s a…
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       generous
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      <em>
       size
      </em>
      . You can touch it, it won’t bite you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t think it’s going to fit,” a frown still on Agatha’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It will,” Rio replied confidently.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think I’d much rather you fuck me with your mouth,” she muttered apprehensively.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh no, my love,” Rio snickered, “this for
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to fuck
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       me
      </span>
      <span>
       .”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha arched her eyebrow, anxiety on her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And here I thought I was keeping you happy on my own.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You do, baby,” Rio said, grabbing her hands and bringing them up to her lips. “You take very good care of me,”  she added, placing tender kisses on her dominant fingers, “I just thought, since you like topping me, that you might enjoy being inside me this way.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes widened curiously, and Rio watched as her hesitation progressively vanished.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How about this: you take it out for a spin, and if you don’t like it, I won’t bring it up again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded, intrigued. “How do I put it on?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll do the honors,” Rio said kneeling in front of her, undressing her bottom half while Agatha took care of her upper body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once she was fully naked, Rio lifted one of her legs carefully so as to not knock her off balance and held her foot against her leg as she leaned forward and captured Agatha’s clit in her mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her hands instinctively traveled to grab Rio’s hair and she bucked into her face while the latter lapped away happily.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Agatha tugged her hair backwards to look down at her, Rio replied, “Just warming you up, baby.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiled, her mouth dry and eyes closed as Rio continued pleasuring her. When she was satisfied with her work, Rio reached on the bed behind her and grabbed the harness, setting it on the floor so Agatha could step into it. She adjusted the straps and gave her ass a playful smack, making the older woman moan.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Filing that for the later,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio thought greedily.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She placed the silicone toy through the designated hole and leaned back on her heels to admire her work.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tah-dah!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha burst out laughing, joined in by Rio. “It looks ridiculous.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’ll see if you still feel that way about it in a couple of minutes,” Rio said with a wink.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why is it purple?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugged, “I thought you might like it. And there weren’t that many colors in stock in that girth.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You like them big, huh baby?” She asked, stroking it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes,” Rio hissed, her pupils dilated at the sight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Get on all fours,” Agatha commanded, emboldened by Rio’s reaction. “Do we need lube?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio assumed the position, Agatha ran a teasing finger through her folds. “So wet for me already?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio just whimpered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha angled the toy at her entrance, running it up and down her slit to coat it thoroughly. She let out an appreciative hum. “I’m starting to see the appeal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed forward a bit, and Rio let out a loud moan.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck, I can feel you stretching,” she croaked. She held on to Rio’s ass as she filled her completely. Rio cried out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh my God this feels so fucking good,” Agatha moaned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She quickly set a punishing pace, egged on by Rio’s begging for more. Agatha began slurring her words as the textured base stimulated her clit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want to come inside you, baby,” Agatha moaned loudly, “can I come inside you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes, please, my love,” Rio cried, reaching her orgasm and shaking uncontrollably. Agatha came a minute later, panting and collapsing on top of Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was so hot,” she managed to get out, still buried to the hilt, placing tender kisses on her shoulder blades.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When her breathing went back to normal, Agatha pushed herself up, resuming her earlier position and giving Rio an experimental spank.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love my new gift, thank you, baby,” she said before resuming her earlier pace, much to Rio’s delight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just one more,” Agatha begged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was bent over the kitchen counter, legs trembling, stark naked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I
      <em>
       can’t,”
      </em>
      she whined, tears in her eyes from her previous orgasm. “And if we don’t shower soon, we won’t make it to Wanda’s for dinner. And I’m really looking forward to that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fine, the strap is waterproof anyways, right? I’ll just fuck you in the shower. Win-win.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <em>
       Oh my God
      </em>
      ,
     </span>
     <span>
      she thought, a mix of horror and arousal,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       I’ve created a monster
      </span>
      <span>
       .
      </span>
     </em>

     <span>
      Christmas dinner at the Maximoff residence was a relatively quiet affair. Wanda had ordered a catered meal, which they consumed at what Rio would’ve normally considered an ungodly hour were it not for the fact that she was constantly starving due to her lover’s relentless appetite for sex.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy caught her wincing when she sat down at the table, her core sore from Agatha’s earlier pounding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nooo,” he complained, horrified, “she’s my
      <em>
       godmother
      </em>
      , I can’t know these kinds of things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha blushed but said nothing. She’d quietly retreated with Wanda for a couple of minutes before, and Rio guessed she’d told her about them because she overheard Wanda scream “Oh my God, yes!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was thankful her partner had such a supportive and caring chosen family. The five of them chatted pleasantly over food and it reminded Rio of the last Christmas she’d spent with both of her parents and their extended family. Instead of the pain she’d felt for years at the memories, the sight of the people around her brought a sense of warmth to her recollections.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Vision suggested they watch a movie, they all followed him to the living room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Which vaguely Christmas-y movie shall we watch this year? Love Actually?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not again, dad, please.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe Rio should pick, since she’s new to our cliché family traditions,” Wanda suggested.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m happy with anything you guys pick.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once they’d settled on a movie (Nightmare before Christmas), Wanda poured them some eggnog and they curled up on the multiple couches. Rio leaned back into Agatha’s chest and she felt her arms tighten around her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At some point early into the movie, Rio fell asleep, exhausted from their activities and lulled to slumber by Agatha’s soft warmth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wanda convinced them to spend the night there, and they walked upstairs to the bed they’d shared last time. Earning one final warning from Billy (“My room is right next door and the walls are paper thin”), they retreated for the evening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio insisted they sleep in the nude, promising Agatha that she was too tired and too full to initiate anything.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They laid side by side, facing each other. Agatha absentmindedly traced circles on Rio’s back, deep in thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio kissed the tip of her nose to get her attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was just thinking,” she began, “about how you’re so much younger than me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio scoffed and shushed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m serious, I mean, your whole life is ahead of you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh yes, and you’re ancient, is that right? Do I need to start looking for retirement homes?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What I mean to say is that I don’t want you to be stuck with me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you trying to break up with me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? No!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then shut up,” Rio said, kissing her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighed and rolled on her back to stare at the ceiling.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What if I can’t make you happy?” She asked sadly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why would you think that? Does it look like I’m not happy when I’m with you?” Rio asked curiously.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha took a deep breath. “There are some… other things… that I haven’t told you about.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did you kill someone? Did they deserve it?” Rio wasn’t being dismissive, she was trying to get Agatha to relax.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, Agatha said nothing. Rio sat on her elbows, giving the woman her full attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t pull the trigger,” she said carefully, “but someone did die.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tried to school her features. The professional handler in her was on high alert, but the woman was trying to talk to her partner, not her teammate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It was a long time ago. I… I promised someone they could trust me, that I would protect them. And I failed.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What happened?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She killed herself.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sucked in a breath. Agatha was crying softly now, so she pulled her closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was young, and I felt like I could help her. She was so young, so vulnerable and she put her trust in me. And things went horribly wrong.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “A week after her funeral I found out I was 4 weeks pregnant. I had wanted to get pregnant for so long, we really wanted a baby. But her death broke me. I flew to France a week later and terminated the pregnancy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I couldn’t protect a teenager, how was I supposed to look after a helpless baby?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      “I don’t regret what I did. Ralph supported me through it, but he always hoped we would try again. I just couldn’t do it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry you went through that, my love.” Rio placed tender kisses on her body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you want kids?” Agatha finally asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know. I can be happy either way. I always figured that if the partner I settled down with really wanted them, I wouldn’t hesitate.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was silence between them for a moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s too late for me now anyway,” Agatha said sadly. “My eggs are probably crispy at this point.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mine aren’t,” Rio said quietly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Way to rub it in,” Agatha attempted a laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s not what I meant.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They stared at each other, the air thick.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I do see a future with you,” Rio whispered. “I hope with time you’ll feel the same way about me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I already do, my love, that’s why I’m so scared you’re gonna run off.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not going anywhere,” Rio replied, before breaking her promise and going down on Agatha, who did a pretty good job at staying quiet through it all.

      The days preceding the New Year were spent quietly. Since most of the country was still enjoying the holiday break, political canvassing had slowed down and candidates were not grabbing the headlines as much. Disturbing the peace with controversy would not be welcomed by the American people.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha and Rio took the time to get to know each other better. They were still in the honeymoon phase of their relationship, so they spent an inordinate amount of time in close proximity. Agatha’s appetite for intimacy did not die down, as Rio expected, once the novelty passed; if anything, she had gotten more ravenous. The more they learned how their bodies reacted, the more they wanted to keep exploring. Every now and then, some things slipped up in the heat of the moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Like when Agatha told her she wanted to
      <em>
       put a baby in her
      </em>
      while Rio was riding her, causing her to climax immediately. They didn’t address that particular slip up once their raging hormones had settled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In the quiet of the night, when they were sated and curled up under the covers, Agatha kept opening up to Rio. She told her about her childhood, her parents, how she was raised.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “My mother had multiple miscarriages before she had me. She told me they were all boys, and that she never wanted a daughter, but my father insisted she keep me. I think I truly started disappointing her at birth. I don’t think she ever loved me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio listened and showed her as much love and tenderness as she could muster when she reminisced the pain of her teenage years, but never pressed for further details. They found a balance where Agatha would let her in without feeling pressured or uncomfortable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio would share stories from her youth in Chicago as well. When they were making dinner together one night, she told her about the time her mom and grandmother had taught her how to make empanadas.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I made such a mess. I could tell they were struggling not to lose it so that my first experience in the kitchen wouldn’t be traumatic. Eventually I managed to make one on my own and I’ll never forget my abuela’s proud smile when I showed it to her.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio learned a number of things about Agatha that she hadn’t seen coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one, she soon discovered that the woman enjoyed walking around the house naked whenever the opportunity presented itself. Rio wasn’t sure if she’d always done that, or if it was a new development arising from her own sexual liberation. Either way, she got a glimmer in her eyes whenever she would catch Rio appreciating her naked form, and on one occasion she sat across from her on the dining room table, spread her legs and put on a show for Rio from which she was sure she would never recover.
    </p>
    <p>
     She also got to see a side of Agatha that made her heart beat out of her chest. The
     <em>
      real Agatha
     </em>
     , as Rio was now referring to her in her mind, was tender and loving and generous. While Rio recovered from the vigorous pounding she was receiving multiple times a day, Agatha would dote on her with the utmost devotion. Every sore inch of her body had been massaged, every involuntary bruise kissed. Warm drinks, sweetened exactly to her liking, were placed on her lap without a request ever being made. After some particularly intense lovemaking, Agatha had kissed the entire length of her body, uttered sweet words of affection and stroked her hair until Rio had fallen asleep, feeling more loved than she ever had before.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     To no one’s surprise, however, Agatha’s jealous side reared its ugly head on a quiet evening. Rio had gone to take shower while Agatha made them dinner and Rio’s phone had dinged from an incoming text message from Sarah. Agatha, ever so subtle with her emotions, had burst into the bathroom where Rio was still under the hot stream, anxiety etched across her face and a nervous tremble on her lip. Under different circumstances, Rio would have had some choice words for her partner, but she could tell just how insecure Agatha felt about the newness of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Why is Sarah texting you at this hour?” Agatha asked accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”I don’t know, can you read me the text? The passcode is 8167.”
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha was taken aback by Rio casually giving her access to her private messages, she did not comment on it out loud. Agatha huffed as she open the (extremely short) text chain between the two exes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She wants to know if you have any plans for New Year’s Eve.” Agatha sounded irate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t communicated with Sarah since the party at the White House. She contemplated how she should respond so that there wasn’t any confusion about her intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Well?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m thinking about how to frame things,” Rio said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lizard brain had taken over, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can make plans with her, I don’t care.” Her tone said otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My love,” Rio tried to sound calm, “I can’t just tell her I’m going to spend the night with my girlfriend because she’s going to ask follow-up questions. I’m trying to figure out how to turn her down without making a big deal out of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened the shower door to clear out some steam so she could look at the woman. When she finally caught her eyes, she saw the steady stream of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry,” she sobbed, “I’ve never… I don’t know why… what came over me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     ”It’s okay, baby.” Rio turned off the shower and wrapped herself in a towel. “I’m yours. Only yours. You have nothing to worry about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally stopped crying, Rio gently pinned her against the bathroom wall, her hand stimulating her core while Agatha threw her arms around Rio’s neck and surrendered to her lover’s caring touch.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The night before New Year’s Eve, Rio had to put Agatha’s strap on a time-out. She was actually struggling to cross her legs and desperately needed some time to recover. Agatha pouted all day on the 31st, and the frown on her face didn’t go away until the two shared a midnight kiss in bed, full of promise for a better year ahead, together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then, the day immediately after, the campaigns picked up again in full swing. Bohner’s team reached out to try to get Agatha to join events in Iowa before the debate. Rio had wondered if their separation would change his strategy of painting himself as a family man and the embodiment of traditional family values; it didn’t. He went out on stage every day and lied through his teeth about the importance of “healthy” opposite-sex marriages like his.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Asshole,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio thought privately.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had yet to tell him about her new relationship with Rio. The latter could tell why she was hesitant; while Bohner had somehow regained his wife’s support, it would not be a good look for him if it got out that his wife was dating another woman in secret. His opponents would dub him a cuckold, and a humiliated man is a dangerous one. Nonetheless, Agatha had assured her she would come clean next time she had the opportunity to spend some time alone with him. Preferably not before a national, televised debate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio also contemplated how she would break the news to Lilia. Would she be mad for putting the woman she was entrusted with at further risk of scandal? Or would she more forgiving if she knew how sincere their feelings were? She had yet to find the right time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      On January 10, two days before the first debate, Rio, Agatha, Billy, Jen and Alice had flown to meet the team in Iowa, in great part to make sure there wouldn’t be any unexpected surprises. For the first time in weeks, Rio and Agatha were forced to sleep apart, something that proved more difficult for the latter than the former.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hadn’t lied when she said sleeping was almost impossible for her most nights. It became abundantly clear that the only reason why she’d been in a much more amiable mood over the past month was due to the fact that she was actually getting some shuteye with Rio. Sleep-deprived Agatha was
      <em>
       extra spicy
      </em>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The first recipient of her frustration was, unsurprisingly, Jen. They’d spent the day at the hotel with Bohner and his staff doing some last minute debate prep. Agatha looked as miserable as she probably felt, and Jen made the mistake of telling her she needed to fix her face for the cameras. The argument ended with Rio and Alice breaking up a fight before either woman ripped the other’s head off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The polling data predicted Bohner would come in third place in the caucus if all things remained the same, with Cushing in the lead and Whyte not too far behind. It was starting to look more and more a like a three-way race, and while the moderate may have been in the lead, Whyte and Bohner put together had a much larger share of the Iowa electorate. It was too early to announce a full ticket, but Rio wouldn’t be surprised if Bohner eventually joined Whyte’s as his vice president. Their performance in the debates would give everyone a much more accurate picture of how things were going.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      While the Iowa caucus was very often not reflective of the electorate as whole, Rio expected McCormack and Taggart would drop out shortly after if they performed ad poorly as expected. It looked like Cushing’s run had actually strengthened Whyte’s lead, since the man was now positioning himself as the middle-ground candidate. Rio scoffed at idea that a man as conservative as Cushing could ever be considered “too liberal for the Republican Party.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The day of the debate, Rio took pity on Agatha and snuck into her room mid-afternoon. She made sure no one would interrupt them for a couple of hours, and climbed into bed with her so the woman could get some sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Go take a shower, babygirl,” Rio mumbled sleepily when her alarm went off 3 hours later.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t want to,” Agatha protested like a toddler, “let’s skip it, stay here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I have to go, so if you decide you want to stay here alone, I can cover for you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glared since Rio knew fully well that the second she left her embrace, the older woman would not be able to go back to sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do I get if I cooperate?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughed out loud, amused by her lover’s attempted negotiation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know, what do you want?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “To fuck you from behind with the strap. But
      <em>
       someone
      </em>
      made me leave it at home,” she said petulantly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “My love,” Rio replied, trying to stay composed, “if someone at TSA saw it in your luggage, the tabloids would have had a field day.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We could’ve put it in yours!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That would’ve still ended up somewhere public, probably not in print but definitely on Twitter. Come on,” Rio added, smacking her ass loudly, “get a move on.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will you eat me out at least?” She asked as she stood up and stretched dramatically.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looked at the watch on her wrist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can you come in less than 10 minutes?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know I can,” Agatha fired back, her pupils fully dilated, before pushing Rio to kneel on the rug in front of her, unbuttoning her own pants while giving her a seductive look. “Now be good for me and put your mouth to good use, sweetheart.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio, knowing her body expertly by then, made her orgasm in three.
     </span>

      Rio blow dried Agatha’s hair while she applied some makeup. Every now and then she would place soft kisses on her bare shoulders and neck, making Agatha pause her movements and try to capture her lips in hers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you so much,” Rio got out in between kisses, earning a contented hum from Agatha. “You make me so happy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t think I’ve ever been as happy as when I’m with you,” Agatha confessed, stroking Rio’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After a couple of minutes, Rio realized they were dangerously close to running late. They powered through finishing her appearance and gathered their things before heading out the door, only to find Billy patiently waiting for them right outside, scrolling through his phone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look better,” Billy grinned cheekily at Agatha. “Less like you want to punch a hole through a wall.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha only grunted in response, clearly still trying to wrap her head around the idea of his godson having insights into her sex life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen says there’s two cars waiting to take us to Drake University.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is Ralph riding with us?” Agatha inquired.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, CNN sent a separate town car hours ago, this is just for us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Down in the hotel lobby, Rio was surprised to see Lilia conversing with Jen and Alice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t know you were flying in for this,” Rio said after giving her mentor a hug, “you do know we have everything under control, right?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I trust
      <em>
       you,”
      </em>
      Lilia replied, looking at the other women and Billy, “it’s
      <em>
       them
      </em>
      I’m skeptical of. I want to keep a close eye on Sharon and her people.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shall we get going?” Alice asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah,” Rio replied, “I’ll ride with Agatha and Billy, you guys can take the other car.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      They pulled into the parking lot at Drake after a short ten minute ride. Billy got out of the car, and before Rio could follow him, Agatha placed her hand on her arm asking her to wait.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Give us a minute, will you, kid?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sure.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio closed the door and sat across from Agatha. There was a frown on her face, all of the previous contentment and peacefulness gone. She looked tense.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s wrong?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I need to tell you something,” Agatha replied, her tone somber and her words barely above a whisper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, tell me, my love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha opened and closed her mouth several times but no words came out. She let out a frustrated sigh and bit her lip.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Someone outside rapped their fingers against the window of the car.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe you can tell me tonight? I asked Alice to schedule us on the 11 PM flight so we can go home tonight,” Rio added, stroking her hands, trying to alleviate her lover’s visible anxiety.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I have… I have to tell you now. I just… I can’t.” Agatha looked like she was on the verge of tears.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The rap on the window was more insistent, and Rio heard Jen’s voice telling them to get a move on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Listen,” Rio began, “let’s go inside, so they can show us our places. Then we can sneak out to the bathroom for a couple of minutes and you can tell me. Does that sound okay?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded minutely, and Rio brought up her hands to her lips and placed a soft kiss on them. “It’s only a couple of hours. Then it’s just you, me, and Scratchy, okay?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The space where CNN was hosting the debate was chaotic. They had decided last minute to allow for locals to attend in the audience, and security was tight. A PA ushered them through a side door and into a long hallway leading to the dressing rooms where the candidates were getting ready. Rio spotted Marion Whyte, Governor Whyte’s wife, at the end of the hallway talking animatedly with a campaign aide. She didn’t know the woman well, but Agatha had told Rii she’d been very amiable when they met at the White House party several weeks prior. “She seemed very submissive,” Agatha had said, “mostly nodding along to anything her husband was saying.”
      <em>
       Agatha’s complete opposite
      </em>
      , Rio smirked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The PA walked them through the timeline. Several chairs had been set up on the sidelines of the stage for the three candidate spouses, along with two spare seats each for their handlers. Lilia suggested Rio and Billy stay with Agatha, while she and Jen and Alice watched from a monitor in one of the viewing areas.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The expectation is for spouses to embrace the candidates on stage after the debate is over, as a show of marital support.” The team nodded tersely. “I’m just waiting for the producer to give us a green light to move you into your seats. Could I get you something to drink in the meantime?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you have any bourbon?” Agatha asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s joking,” Jen jumped in, “some coffee all around would be great.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the assistant retreated, Agatha muttered, “I wasn’t kidding.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Have you forgotten these people are journalists?” Jen asked incredulously. “If you want to drink yourself senseless, wait until you get home. Out here, we’re not giving them any reasons to include your name in news stories.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She just needs a minute to settle down, let’s go find a restroom,” Rio suggested, glancing over at Agatha knowingly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before they could move, the PA approached them again, balancing 6 cups of coffee and a handful of stirrers and sugar packets. “They’re actually ready for you, so if Ms. Harkness and her companions could take their seats, that would be great.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy grabbed the coffee and followed Rio and Agatha down the hall, to where Marion was now standing alone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’re only waiting for Mrs. Cushing now,” the assistant announced.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A beautiful older woman, likely in her late 60s emerged from her husband’s dressing room, a wide smile on her face. She was wearing a Chanel suit and high heels that gave her an air of timeless elegance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you ready for us?” She asked PA, who nodded and looked almost in a trance. “Then let’s not keep them waiting.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looked at the other people in the hallway before turning to them. “Agatha, lovely to see you, dear.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio hid her surprise at the revelation almost as well as Agatha was hiding her anxiety.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s been a while,” Agatha nodded, her voice steady.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You should call your mother, Evanora would like to hear from her daughter every now and then,” Mary Cushing added, in a way that was both scolding and intimidating.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio expected Agatha to spit out a biting comeback, but she remained silent and did not engage with the woman further. Mary just smirked and began walking towards the stage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy and Rio looked at one another briefly, before Rio placed a hand on the small of Agatha’s back, trying to convey some comfort. Billy opened his mouth as if to say something, but Agatha shook her head ‘no’ and stared straight ahead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The debate went on as smoothly as one could’ve hoped, that is to say, without any audience interruptions or microphones getting disconnected. The candidates were quite civil towards one another, though at times it seemed like Whyte and Bohner had formed a sort of alliance and had teamed up to paint Cushing as a “weak liberal”. And they had been somewhat successful at it, if the reactions from the audience were any indication, since at times the conservative moderate was booed when he refused to take a harsher line on certain issues.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Bohner had delivered his fair share of sound bites that were sure to be replayed by all major news networks until the caucus. In Rio’s opinion, the most alarming thing about it was how normalized extremism had become in the Republican Party. For all his posturing as the “great moderate who would restore the party to its former glory,” Cushing did not attack his extremist rivals. He accepted the premise of some of their unhinged policies— such as illegal immigration being the root of criminal activity in the country— and proposed an alternative solution (mass incarceration instead of mass deportations). His presence seemed to legitimize Bohner’s views, and the latter seemed emboldened by it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After the roaring applause from the audience ceased a bit, the same PA from earlier motioned for the wives to come on stage. Agatha was stiff as a board as she approached Ralph, but he pulled her closer in a way that seemed almost affectionate. The bell indicating the end of the live transmission rang, and the candidates began to exit the stage. Rio saw Cushing walking over to Agatha and Bohner and shaking his hand, Bohner’s arm holding her waist in a possessive way that made Rio want to throw up. Rio approached them, hoping to get Agatha on a taxi to the airport as soon as humanly possible.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So inspiring.” Rio heard Cushing say to Agatha. The woman looked more stern than she’d ever seen her before.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It really is shame you were put on administrative leave,” Cushing added, “you’ve always brought so much passion to your work.” There was something in the Senator’s voice that made Rio shiver. “Campaigns really do bring out the worst in people and turn your world upside down. At least this will all be over soon— hopefully, that is.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We’ll see about that,” Bohner said firmly, a practiced smile plastered on his face. “Darling, we should go find our people, they’re probably eager to debrief. A pleasure as always, Edward.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “See you around,” Cushing replied, his eyes on Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Bohner led them to his dressing room and asked his team for a couple of minutes alone. Rio and Billy didn’t make a move towards the door.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’d like to have a word alone with my wife.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Billy, you go find the others, we’ll come meet you in a couple of minutes,” Rio instructed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “By alone, I meant just the two of us,” Bohner said sternly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio can stay,” Agatha chimed in, her eyes distant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I really don’t think…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She knows.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio did not know what they were referring to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Bohner eyed his wife curiously. “She
      <em>
       knows?”
      </em>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Bohner turned to Rio and looked her up and down, searching for answers. Seemingly finding none, he turned back to Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You heard what he said, about the story. It clearly scared him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He didn’t seem scared. If anything, he seemed… ready for a fight,” Agatha retorted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It would certainly explain the timeline of his announcement. That and the fact that my polling after my speech went through the roof.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry,” Rio jumped in, “I’m lost here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I thought you said she knew?” Bohner asked pointedly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She knows about the abuse,” Agatha replied, tears in her eyes. “I didn’t… I wanted to tell you earlier.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me what?” Rio’s heart was beating frantically, a mix of anticipation and dread.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “My dad’s friend… the one who—you know— it was Edward Cushing.”
     </span>
