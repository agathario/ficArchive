<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness had it all — and she wore her success like armor. The sharp designer suits tailored to accentuate her figure, the glossy black electric coupe purring in the private bay beneath her penthouse, the kind of apartment that made architects and magazine editors lose sleep — all of it was meticulously curated.</p><p>The money seemed to multiply in her accounts without her lifting a finger. She was a partner at one of the city’s most prestigious PR firms, lauded as a media savant with a tongue like a scalpel and the poise of a queen. She had clawed her way to the top before thirty-five and had never looked back.</p><p>And then there was Rio.</p><p>Stunning, brilliant Rio.</p><p>If Agatha’s life was a portrait in black and white, Rio was color — wild, radiant, intoxicating. She was everything Agatha had never known she was missing until the night they met, when Rio had laughed at something Agatha didn’t even realize she’d said and it cracked something open in her.</p><p>Rio, with her dirt-stained hands and her sunlit smile. With her mind that moved a mile a minute — unexpected, dazzling, sometimes too fast for Agatha to follow.</p><p>Agatha had fallen hard, fast and completely.</p><p>In the beginning, it had terrified her, that kind of love. Not the shallow, transactional affection she was used to — the kind that came with expectations and careful consideration— but something fierce and unguarded. Rio had seen her, truly seen her, in ways no one else ever had. All her sharp edges, her wounds disguised as strength, her need for control. And still, Rio had wanted her. Not in spite of the mess, but because of it.</p><p>The morning it all began to unravel came softly, peacefully. There were no warning bells, no loud thunder rolling in the distance. Just light, and warmth, and the deceptive sweetness of routine.</p><p>Agatha stirred in their king sized bed, silk sheets tangled around her legs, the weight of Rio's arm draped over her waist. Her head rested on Rio’s chest, listening to the rhythmic pulse of her heartbeat — steady, grounding, the one sound in the world that could silence her racing mind.</p><p>Rio’s fingers were splayed wide, even in sleep, as if instinctively holding Agatha close. Possessive, but gentle. Protective. The scent of her skin , lavender and something earthy, like sun-warmed moss and deep woods, filled Agatha’s senses. It was a smell she associated with home now, the first place she had ever truly belonged.</p><p>In Rio’s arms, Agatha could soften. Here, she didn’t have to be the woman with teeth to her smile, the fixer of crises, the one who always had a plan. She could be vulnerable. She could breathe.</p><p>And God, she loved her.</p><p>Not in the timid, safe ways most people loved. But completely. Recklessly. Like if she let go, she’d fall and not care how far. Agatha had spent so much of her life carefully constructing her world — brick by polished brick — and then Rio had come in like a wild wind and made her want to burn it all down, just to feel more of this.</p><p>She had been thinking, lately, about proposing.</p><p>The idea sat heavy in her chest. Terrifying. Thrilling. She would imagine it at odd moments — in a quiet café when Rio reached across the table to wipe lipstick from her mouth, or at night when Rio fell asleep mid-sentence, one leg tangled over Agatha’s. She had already started looking at rings, half-ashamed at how much she cared about getting it right. The thought of slipping a ring onto Rio’s finger filled her with terror and awe in equal measure. Not because she feared commitment — but because she feared losing the one person who made her feel known.</p><p>Because Rio deserved perfection. She deserved security, and joy, and every damn dream come true that Agatha could give her.</p><p>She loved the way Rio’s eyes lit up when she talked about her students, the way she hummed when she cooked, barefoot in their kitchen, an old record playing in the background. She loved the little furrow between her brows when she was lost in thought, the way she held Agatha’s hand when she was anxious, grounding her without a word.</p><p>She loved her laugh — loud, unguarded — and the way it made everything else in the world seem a little less sharp.</p><p>But even Rio had her shadows.</p><p>Beneath the serenity, there was a fragile thread of insecurity that ran deep. A quiet, relentless fear of being left behind. Sometimes, that fear twisted itself into jealousy — fierce, irrational, and gone as quickly as it came. Agatha had never blamed her for it. She knew what it meant to be afraid of losing something precious. She had thought that trust, time, and love would ease that ache. She had thought Rio knew she was the only one Agatha could ever want.</p><p>She thought wrong.</p><p>But she didn’t know it yet.</p><p>And as the soft morning light spilled across their bed, painting Rio in gold and shadow, Agatha believed, with her whole heart, that their forever was still intact.</p><p>That morning, Agatha sighed and pressed closer into the heat of Rio’s body, seeking her touch instinctively. The warmth of her girlfriend’s skin, the steady rise and fall of her chest, the faint thrum of her pulse beneath Agatha’s cheek — it all wrapped around her like a lullaby she never wanted to leave.</p><p>Then came the kiss, soft lips brushing her forehead, featherlight and reverent, as if Rio feared she might break her with too much force. A kiss that carried so much tenderness it ached in Agatha’s chest, a reminder of just how deeply she was loved.</p><p>“Wake up, my love,” Rio murmured, her voice still husky with sleep, resonating through Agatha’s bones as much as her ears. Her fingers traced slow, idle patterns along Agatha’s spine — familiar, comforting, absentmindedly affectionate.</p><p>Agatha smiled against the warm skin of Rio’s chest, eyes still closed. “I don’t want to,” she whispered. “You know I’d rather stay here forever.”</p><p>Unlike Agatha, Rio wasn’t chained to a strict schedule. She moved through life at her own tempo — not sluggish, but intentional, aligned with the natural rhythms of the world she studied.</p><p>As a botanist, Rio’s work lived in greenhouses and wild places, in sun-drenched conservatories and research labs tangled with vines and glass beakers. Her days were marked not by calendar alerts but by blooming cycles and the slow, patient art of cultivation. She studied soil as if it held secrets, whispered to seedlings as if they might answer. And somehow, she made it all work — her career as successful as Agatha’s, though painted in an entirely different palette.</p><p>Together, they had built a life that should have been flawless. The penthouse, the careers, the love — not just convenient love, but real, soul-deep devotion.</p><p>But perfection, as she would learn far too soon, was a mask. Beautiful, delicate — and always waiting to shatter.</p><p>Still, for a few precious minutes more, Agatha let herself enjoy it. She stayed nestled in the cocoon of their shared warmth. She wanted to stay. She always wanted to stay.</p><p>But duty was calling.</p><p>With a reluctant groan, she peeled herself from Rio’s embrace and sat at the edge of the bed. The cool air kissed her bare shoulders, and she reached up to rake her fingers through her tousled hair. Behind her, Rio shifted slightly, one arm stretching toward where Agatha had been, her breath soft and steady.</p><p>Morning light filtered through the gauzy white curtains, spilling golden ribbons across the room. It caught in Rio’s hair, turned her skin to bronze, bathed her in a glow so radiant that Agatha had to look away before it broke her resolve.</p><p>Her bare feet touched down on the cold hardwood floor — a sharp, bracing contrast to the warmth she’d just left — and the jolt it sent through her was enough to snap her fully into wakefulness. The day had begun.</p><p>In the bathroom, steam unfurled around her in lazy tendrils as the shower hissed to life. She stepped beneath the stream, tilting her face up into the heat, letting it wash away the remnants of sleep. The water ran down her body, tracing every sharp line and curve, every muscle.</p><p>When she stepped out, she wiped the fog from the mirror with the side of her hand and stared at her reflection. The face that looked back at her was all angles and elegance — high cheekbones, a mouth made for smirking, and eyes that missed nothing. Bright, discerning, dangerous when she needed to be. With practiced hands, she smoothed moisturizer into her skin, swept subtle makeup into place, and twisted her damp hair into an elegant, no-nonsense knot.</p><p>The transformation was precise, ritualistic — the building of armor.</p><p>From the walk-in closet, she chose her battlewear: a tailored black pantsuit with whisper-thin pinstripes, cut to perfection, the lines of it hugging her body like a secret. A crisp white blouse with a soft sheen, tucked in neatly, and a narrow silver watch that gleamed like a scalpel on her wrist. Her heels — towering, lethal stilettos in patent black and sealed with red — clicked against the floor like a warning. Around her neck, she clasped a delicate pendant. A gift from Rio on their last anniversary, and the only softness she allowed herself to wear into the world.</p><p>When she finally stepped into her Maserati the last of her tenderness slipped away. The driver’s seat molded to her body like it knew her, the engine responding to her touch with obedient, luxurious power.</p><p>Agatha adjusted her rearview mirror, glanced once at the penthouse rising high above the city behind her, and then looked ahead.</p><p>By the time she pulled into traffic, the woman who had awoken in Rio’s arms was gone — folded neatly away, hidden under silk, steel, and diamond-edged poise.</p><p>The drive into the city passed in a blur the car weaving through morning traffic with obedient grace, barely touching the road. Tall glass buildings sliced through the sky like knives, glittering in the pale light of early day. The usual chaos of the morning rush pressed in around her — honking horns, flickering billboards, pedestrians in stiff suits and slumped shoulders.</p><p>Agatha noticed none of it. Her mind was already several steps ahead, assembling the day’s challenges like puzzle pieces: a pitch to revise, a scandal to extinguish, a brand teetering on the edge of collapse.</p><p>Emails pinged on her phone in rapid succession. She ignored them, her fingers drumming against the steering wheel in time with the music pulsing low from the speakers. She arrived outside the sleek, mirrored tower that housed Harkness &amp; Stark and swept through the entrance.</p><p>The marble foyer gleamed beneath her stilettos, every polished surface reflecting a sharpened version of the world. Her employees moved aside instinctively as she passed — some offering murmured greetings, others simply stepping out of her path with quick, deferential nods. She didn’t break stride. Her presence alone carved space around her like a force field.</p><p>But just as she neared her office — the corner suite with floor-to-ceiling windows and a view that whispered empire — something made her pause.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>A woman stood just outside Tony Stark’s office — striking, unfamiliar. She was shorter but poised, with a figure that curved in all the right places beneath a deep navy dress that clung like liquid silk. There was an effortless, studied elegance to the way she carried herself — a confidence that didn’t try to blend in. Her auburn hair tumbled down her back in a cascade of wild waves, defiantly unrestrained amidst the firm’s curated severity.</p><p>She didn’t belong here. Not in the way most people didn’t belong. She stood like she knew something, as if the room were already hers.<br/>Agatha’s pace slowed. A flicker of unease rippled down her spine, too fast and fleeting to name, but impossible to ignore.</p><p>The woman turned, as though pulled by the weight of Agatha’s gaze. Their eyes met — and locked.</p><p>Green. Not a soft, mossy green, nor the warm shade of sunlit leaves. No — this was something mutated. Agatha had the sudden, absurd thought that no eyes should look quite like that.</p><p>There was no politeness in the woman’s stare. No professional reserve. It was direct. Intentional.</p><p>And hungry.</p><p>Not in the way people often looked at Agatha — with ambition, or admiration, or envy. This was something else entirely. A kind of recognition that felt premature and unsettling. As though this woman already knew her. As if she'd been waiting for Agatha long before they met.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach curled.</p><p>Then came Tony’s voice, oblivious as always, cheerful and brash from the doorway: “Agatha! Morning. I want you to meet someone, Wanda.”</p><p>Agatha tore her eyes away from the woman — Wanda, apparently — and turned to her partner.</p><p>“She’s my new assistant,” Tony continued, already retreating into his office. “Wanda Maximoff. Brilliant. Highly recommended. I think she’s going to be a perfect fit.”</p><p>Wanda smiled then — slow, enigmatic, the corners of her mouth curling like smoke. She extended a hand.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move immediately. Her instincts, honed from years of cutting through façades and smelling rot beneath polished veneers, screamed a silent warning. She didn’t like this woman. There was something off about her — something coiled and waiting. Her very presence made Agatha feel... watched. Not admired. Not assessed. Watched.</p><p>But years of boardroom battles had taught Agatha how to wear composure like a second skin. So she smiled — the kind of smile she used to disarm men twice her age — and took the offered hand.</p><p>Wanda’s fingers were cool and smooth, her grip firm. The handshake lasted a beat too long, lingering just at the edge of intimacy. Her eyes never wavered, her smile never shifted.</p><p>“Welcome to the firm,” Agatha said, voice calm and unreadable. “I’m sure you’ll find your time here… enlightening.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile deepened slightly, almost imperceptibly — not wider, just deeper, like a secret sinking further into shadow.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it,” she murmured, her voice low and velvet-soft. And then, almost as an afterthought: “It already feels familiar.”</p><p>Agatha released her hand first, resisting the urge to wipe her palm on her pants. Her heartbeat had quickened, though her expression betrayed nothing.</p><p>She offered a tight nod and turned away, the clip of her heels sharper than before. Her office door closed behind her with a soft snick. Alone, in the cool hush of her sanctuary, she exhaled slowly and leaned back against the wood.</p><p>Something had shifted.</p><p>It wasn’t dramatic — not yet. But it was there. A ripple. A fracture in the seamless glass of her world. And though she couldn’t quite name it, every instinct whispered the same word.</p><p>Danger.</p><p>And Agatha Harkness had learned, long ago, never to ignore a whisper.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The rest of the morning unfolded like a slow, creeping itch beneath Agatha’s skin — subtle, persistent, impossible to ignore.</p><p>It started with small things, the kind most people wouldn’t even notice, but Agatha was not most people.</p><p>Wanda hovering just a beat too long after delivering files — files that could’ve easily been emailed or passed through Agathas assistant Jen. Wanda always seemed to arrive in person, silently materializing outside Agatha’s office like a shadow at the edge of her vision. She barely knocked. Just waited. Smiling.</p><p>Then there was the way she watched.</p><p>Agatha had worked with hundreds of people over the years — professionals, sycophants, rivals. She knew how to recognize when someone was paying attention. But this wasn’t attentiveness. It was fixation. Whenever Agatha spoke during meetings, she could feel Wanda’s gaze settle on her like heat. Not just eye contact — observation. Intense. Concentrated. Her eyes didn’t flick away when caught. They held. Studied.</p><p>And it wasn’t just her face Wanda focused on. No, her eyes tracked the movement of Agatha’s hands when she gestured, lingered on the curve of her mouth when she spoke, and once, disturbingly, followed a drop of liquid that had trailed down her wrist from a coffee cup.</p><p>By late morning, Agatha’s spine felt stiff with tension. She found herself gripping her pen with white-knuckled precision during a budget review, her usually fluid handwriting turned to sharp, irritated slashes. She folded her arms more often than usual — not out of defiance, but defense. She could feel Wanda’s presence even when she wasn’t in the room.</p><p>Twice, she caught Wanda lingering in the hallway outside her office without any discernible reason. The first time, the redhead was pretending to read the company’s mission statement, emblazoned in brass on the wall. But her eyes weren’t on the words — they were locked, unmistakably, on Agatha through the glass wall of her office. Wanda didn’t look away when Agatha met her gaze. She simply tilted her head, as if contemplating something deeply personal. As if deciding something.</p><p>The second time, Agatha had been standing by her shelves, flipping through a client dossier, when movement in her periphery caught her eye. She turned — and there was Wanda again, standing by the coffee stand across the corridor, idly spinning a paper cup between her fingers, her gaze unwavering.</p><p>Agatha closed her blinds with a sharp tug them rattle.</p><p>She paced her office for a moment afterward, telling herself it was nothing. New assistants sometimes fumbled boundaries at first. Some were overeager, others awkwardly deferential. Maybe Wanda was trying too hard to impress her. Maybe she was nervous, or simply inexperienced.<br/>But a darker possibility flickered at the edge of her thoughts — one she didn’t want to name yet.</p><p>Agatha tried to bury the thought, redirect her energy into her work, but the damage had been done. Every interaction, every subtle shift in the air outside her office, made her nerves prickle.</p><p>Even her seasoned composure, so carefully cultivated, began to fray.</p><p>She snapped at an account manager for misplacing a client brief. She couldn’t recall the last ten minutes of a call with a long-time investor. Her hands trembled slightly as she reapplied her lipstick at noon, and she cursed herself for noticing.</p><p>By the time the gold hands of the office clock finally swept past five, Agatha felt frayed at the edges — not from the workload, which she could have handled in her sleep, but from something deeper. Something psychological. The sheer, exhausting effort of trying to maintain her calm under the weight of someone else’s unrelenting attention. Still she lingered, giving enough time for Wanda to leave first.</p><p>It wasn’t panic. Not yet. But it was close.</p><p>She packed her briefcase slowly, deliberately. Her hands moved with careful precision as she shut down her MacBook, tucked away a sheaf of contracts, and adjusted the sharp lines of her blazer in the reflection of her darkened monitor. Her reflection stared back at her — elegant, composed, but somehow more brittle than usual.</p><p>She needed to go home. She needed Rio.</p><p>Not in the abstract way she sometimes felt at the end of a long day — not a casual desire for warmth or wine or familiarity. This was deeper. Urgent. She needed to be wrapped in Rio’s arms, to press her face into the crook of her neck and inhale that grounding mix of lavender and earth. She needed the world to stop spinning. She needed someone who saw her without expectation or judgment. Someone who reminded her of who she was underneath all the polish.</p><p>Agatha buttoned her coat with sharp, practiced movements, slung her briefcase over one shoulder, and made her way out of her office — not looking toward the assistants desks, not even glancing to see if Wanda was still there.</p><p>Because she already knew she was.</p><p>And she knew she’d feel that gaze — watching, lingering, wanting — all the way out the door.</p><p>The drive home felt endless. The city’s lights bled across her windshield. Traffic buzzed in low, congested murmurs around her, but Agatha barely registered it. Her thoughts were too loud, her nerves too frayed.</p><p>By the time she keyed into the apartment, her entire body ached with a weariness that lived somewhere deeper than her bones. But the moment she stepped inside, the familiar scent of fresh flora — Rio’s doing, always — mingled with the comforting vanilla warmth of her partner’s lotion, enveloping her like a balm. It smelled like home. Like safety.</p><p>“Hey, you’re home late,” came Rio’s voice — low, melodic, tinged with concern. She stepped out from the kitchen, barefoot and beautiful in her quiet, effortless way. She was wearing one of Agatha’s old hoodies, sleeves pushed up to the elbows, the fabric falling off one shoulder like it had been made for her and only her. She held a glass of wine in one hand, her bare legs visible.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She just let Rio come to her, let her press a soft kiss to her mouth — warm, slow, tasting faintly of merlot, and for a moment, Agatha melted. She needed this: the quiet of their home, the anchor of Rio’s touch.</p><p>But then she exhaled, the tension pressing too tightly against her ribs to be ignored. She set her briefcase gently by the door and slipped off her heels, sighing as her sore feet met the cool wood floor.</p><p>“You would not believe the day I’ve had,” she muttered, rolling her neck. “Tony brought in a new assistant. Wanda. And she’s...”</p><p>She trailed off, uncertain how to even frame it.</p><p>Saying strange felt childish. Saying dangerous felt paranoid. “…..strange.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, sipping her wine with slow curiosity. “Strange how?”</p><p>Agatha leaned against the edge of the sofa, arms crossed tight over her chest. “She’s just... intense. The way she looks at me, it’s not professional. It’s like she’s dissecting me with her eyes. There’s something off. She watches me like I’m some kind of puzzle.”</p><p>Rio’s posture didn’t change, but something in her eyes did, just slightly. A flicker of something dark and familiar passed through her expression, and when she smiled, it was the kind of smile Agatha had learned to decode over the years. Too bright. Too quick. A shield, not a gesture.</p><p>“Well,” Rio said, her tone light but edged with something brittle, “can you blame her?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>“You’re stunning, Agatha. Brilliant. Powerful. Half the city would kill to be in a room with you. Maybe she just has a little crush,” she added with a shrug, turning back toward the kitchen with pretend nonchalance.</p><p>But Agatha caught it — the tension in her shoulders, the tight grip on the wineglass stem, the way Rio didn’t quite meet her eyes. And just like that, the warmth Agatha had clung to flickered.</p><p>Her stomach twisted. God, not this again.</p><p>She followed Rio across the living room and caught her hand, gently but firmly. “Hey,” she said, coaxing her to stop, to look at her. “This isn’t about how I look. Or her. I don’t know this woman. I don’t care about her. But she’s... strange. It’s not admiration. It feels invasive. Shes giving me the creeps.”</p><p>Rio looked at her then, finally — eyes wide, guarded, trying to read between Agatha’s words.</p><p>“I’m telling you this because I need to vent to you,” Agatha said softly. “Something feels wrong with her, Rio. I don’t want this to become a thing between us. Please.”</p><p>There was a beat — just long enough to sting — before Rio’s shoulders relaxed. She let out a soft breath and stepped closer, resting her palm lightly on Agatha’s hip.</p><p>“I do trust you,” she murmured. “I just… sometimes I worry. It’s hard not to, when everyone sees you the way they do.”</p><p>Agatha reached up and cupped Rio’s face in her hands, brushing her thumbs gently along her cheeks. “I dont care about anyone else, only how you see me. You see the real me. Not the woman in the suits, not the name on the door. Just… me.”</p><p>Rio’s smile returned, softer now, and she leaned into the touch with a quiet nod. But Agatha could still feel it — the hairline crack that had opened between them. Small. Invisible. But there.</p><p>She kissed Rio’s forehead, lingering longer than necessary, as if hoping to smooth over what words couldn’t. When she pulled back, she forced a smile, willing levity into her voice. “So… tell me you made dinner. Or else I’m ordering enough pizza to put me in a coma.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound light and familiar, and tugged her toward the kitchen. “I made your favorite. But you’re getting garlic knots too.”</p><p>Agatha let herself be pulled along, smiling back. But inside, something remained unsettled — a small, insistent thrum at the base of her skull.</p><p>That night, after the plates had been cleared and the last remnants of wine sat forgotten in their glasses, Agatha found herself in Rio’s arms again.</p><p>They moved together in silence, slow and reverent, like worship. Not the frenzied, breathless kind of desire that burned too quickly — but something deeper. Something sacred. As if both of them, without speaking it aloud, understood each others souls.</p><p>Rio’s hands roamed Agatha’s body with the gentle certainty of someone who had memorized her — the curve of her hip, the delicate dip at the base of her spine, the place just below her collarbone that made her breath hitch. Her fingers traced each line with unspoken promises, with desperate tenderness. She touched Agatha not like she was just a woman, but like she was home.</p><p>And Agatha gave herself over to it. She let herself fall open in Rio’s arms, all her sharp edges dulled by love and longing. She arched beneath her mouth, gasped softly into her throat, and whispered Rio’s name like a mantra. With every touch, every breathless kiss, she tried to say the things she couldn’t always find the words for: You are everything. You are the only place I’m ever safe. I choose you. Always.Again and again.</p><p>When it was over, they lay together in the still dark, legs tangled beneath the sheets, their breaths slowly finding one rhythm. The world outside had vanished — all the noise, the unease, the strange woman at the office — gone. For these few quiet hours, there was only this: the familiar beat of Rio’s heart under Agatha’s cheek, the warmth of her skin pressed against hers.</p><p>Agatha lifted Rio’s hand and pressed a kiss to the inside of her wrist, just over the steady thrum of her pulse. She lingered there, her lips barely moving, murmuring a soft, silent vow to herself: Don’t let anything break this. Don’t let this be taken away.</p><p>The next morning arrived with a soft grey hush, the kind of overcast sky that made the city look smaller and quieter than usual. Rain clung to the windows in a fine mist, and the air held a sleepy chill that made the apartment feel even more cocooned, tucked away from the world.</p><p>Agatha stirred slowly, stretching beneath the covers, her body deliciously sore, her heart aching with something she couldn’t name. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filtered in from the kitchen, followed by the soft clink of dishes and the low hum of Rio’s voice as she moved around the space.</p><p>By the time Agatha stepped into the kitchen, wrapped in a purple robe and toweling her damp hair, Rio was already pouring coffee into two tall travel mugs, her sweater sleeves pushed up past her elbows. She looked impossibly soft, almost ethereal, wearing one of Agatha’s oldest sweaters — the hem hanging nearly to her thighs, sleeves falling past her fingertips when she didn’t roll them. Her dark strands were still wet, curling slightly at the ends as they brushed her neck.<br/>Agatha stopped in the doorway, just watching her for a moment. Something about the quiet domesticity of it — the scent of coffee, the way Rio swayed slightly as she moved, barefoot on the tile — made her chest go tight.</p><p>God, she thought, I’d burn everything down to keep this.</p><p>“Have a good day today, my love,” Rio said when she noticed her, her smile warm as she handed her a mug. She leaned up to kiss Agatha’s cheek, light and fleeting.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t ready to let go just yet. She caught Rio by the waist, drawing her in slowly, deliberately, and kissed her the way she needed her to feel it — deep, unhurried, full of the words she still didn’t know how to say.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, Rio laughed softly, breathless against her lips. “If you kiss me like that, I’m not letting you leave.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, but the smile reached her eyes this time. She brushed a stray strand behind Rio’s ear and held her gaze. “Just… know I mean it. All of this. You. Me. This life we built.”</p><p>Rio’s smile wavered for half a second — just a flicker — then steadied. “I know,” she whispered. “I believe you.”</p><p>And Agatha wanted to believe that was true. Wanted it so fiercely she didn’t question the quiet sadness in Rio’s eyes, or the way her fingers clutched the hem of Agatha’s suit jacket just a little too tightly.</p><p>“Don’t burn the place down without me,” Agatha teased, lightening the moment as she stepped back, reaching for her briefcase.</p><p>“I make no promises,” Rio called after her with a grin.</p><p>And with that, Agatha stepped out into the cool grey morning, the city yawning open before her. Her heels clicked across the wet pavement, her coat cinched tightly against the wind, and a rare lightness lifted her chest.</p><p>At first, the day unfolded like any other. Morning meetings bled into back-to-back calls, emails multiplied faster than she could answer them, and the contracts waiting on her desk loomed like a paper mountain. Agatha moved through it all with her usual precision, her mind sharp, her focus honed. The comforting rhythm of control — routine as armor.</p><p>But then — there she was.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Leaning casually against the edge of the coffee station as Agatha approached to refill her mug, her posture loose but too deliberate to be casual. She pretended to scroll through her phone, but her eyes flicked up the moment Agatha came into range — and didn’t look away.</p><p>Agatha felt it before she saw it. That prickling crawl across the back of her neck, the sudden sense of being seen in a way that didn’t feel flattering or innocent. Wanda’s gaze was direct, steady — unnervingly so. Not shy admiration. Not even flirtation.</p><p>It was possession. Quiet and dangerous.</p><p>“Good morning, Ms. Harkness,” Wanda said, her voice silky smooth, the formal address undercut by the intimacy of her tone. There was something knowing behind her smile, a smirk that belonged to someone with secrets she wasn’t ready to share.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her as she pressed for a black coffee, pretending to focus on the slow, steady pour of dark roast into her mug. “Good morning,” she replied coolly, her voice clipped, professional.</p><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and walked briskly away, coffee sloshing slightly against the lid in her haste.</p><p>But Wanda was everywhere.</p><p>By midmorning, the pattern had emerged — subtle but inescapable.</p><p>Files still delivered by hand that could have easily been emailed. Forms requiring signatures appearing conveniently whenever Agatha passed through the common areas. Wanda loitering near the elevators, offering those tight, unreadable smiles that never reached her eyes. And always, always that look — like Agatha was a puzzle she was close to solving, or a possession she had already claimed.</p><p>It wasn't overt. Wanda never crossed a line anyone else would notice. But the tension curled tighter with every interaction, a slow constriction Agatha couldn’t quite shake.</p><p>By the time noon arrived, she was frayed at the edges.</p><p>During the monthly luncheon — a sleek, catered affair in the sun-drenched glass-walled conference room — Agatha sat beside Tony, half-listening as he and a few senior colleagues discussed a contentious merger. Her body was present, her expression composed, but her mind was distant, still replaying the way Wanda’s hand had brushed hers that morning when passing a folder — the touch light but deliberate, as if savoring the contact.</p><p>Then Tony leaned toward her, his voice pitched just low enough for only her to hear. “Looks like you’ve got an admirer.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, drawn back into the moment, confused — until Tony tipped his chin, ever so slightly.</p><p>Wanda. Standing along the far wall, unobtrusive in her assistant’s role, tablet in hand.</p><p>But she wasn’t looking at the speaker. Or taking notes.</p><p>She was watching Agatha. Again.</p><p>Unapologetically.</p><p>Her gaze was too intense to be professional, too focused to be accidental. She didn’t look away when Agatha met her eyes. In fact, she smiled — faint and unreadable.</p><p>“I’ve heard she’s quite taken with you,” Pepper murmured from Tony’s other side, her voice dry. Her “ brow lifted in pointed amusement. “You do have that effect, Agatha. Best not to encourage it.”</p><p>Agatha felt the heat crawl up her throat before she could stop it — not from flattery, but from something uncomfortable.</p><p>“I’m sure it’s nothing,” she replied smoothly, schooling her expression into polite neutrality. But her hand curled slightly in her lap beneath the table, fingers tightening into a white-knuckled fist.</p><p>Tony chuckled and turned back to the conversation, but Pepper’s eyes lingered on Agatha a beat longer. There was something in her gaze — not concerned exactly, but assessing. As if she was beginning to see the full picture.</p><p>When the meeting finally broke, Agatha escaped as quickly as she could, retreating to the sanctity of her office. She shut the door with more force than necessary, the soft click of the latch feeling almost like a lock on a cage.</p><p>She pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the window and closed her eyes, exhaling slowly.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>The feeling had taken root beneath her skin — subtle, insistent, like the distant rumble of thunder miles offshore.</p><p>Agatha straightened, adjusted the cuffs of her suit jacket, and tried to draw in a steady breath. Her reflection stared back at her from the dark glass — polished, composed, powerful.</p><p>But she couldn’t shake the strange, unwelcome sensation that she was being watched even now.</p><p>That somewhere beyond the door, behind walls or corners or smiles, Wanda was waiting. Calculating. Getting closer.</p><p>Stay focused, she told herself. Stay in control.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, Wanda’s boldness didn’t just grow — it unfurled, creeping like ivy through every crack in Agatha’s work life.</p><p>No matter how many boundaries Agatha set, no matter how sharp her tone or cold her silence, Wanda simply smiled and stepped closer.</p><p>At first, it was subtle. Almost plausibly innocent.</p><p>Notes began to appear — not official memos, not typed and emailed like every other assistant in the firm managed, but handwritten slips of paper nestled inside manila folders or tucked beneath Agatha’s keyboard when she returned from meetings. The writing was neat but childlike, loopy and soft, the kind of script that seemed deliberately nonthreatening — which only made the contents more jarring.</p><p>“Thought you might need a break. You work too hard.”<br/>“You looked beautiful today.”<br/>“No one sees you like I do.”</p><p>Agatha would stare at them for a beat, her pulse cold in her throat, then crumple them in shaking fingers and bury them deep in the trash under discarded drafts and shredded memos. But the words stuck to her like static. Long after the paper was gone, they still echoed, clinging to her thoughts like cobwebs.</p><p>She never responded. Never acknowledged. But Wanda didn’t need a reply. She was watching.</p><p>The stares became more brazen.</p><p>Wanda no longer even tried to mask it — her gaze followed Agatha across rooms, lingered at the ends of hallways, stared unblinking from the elevator as the doors slid closed between them.</p><p>Her eyes had lost the faux-professional sheen.<br/>They were hungry now. Intimate. Like she already thought Agatha belonged to her somehow, like she was simply waiting for her to realize it.</p><p>One morning, Agatha stopped at the café opposite the office to grab a real espresso. She sat by the window, skimming her phone, trying to breathe through the fatigue curling beneath her ribs.</p><p>Then she looked up — and froze.</p><p>Wanda was standing on the other side of the glass, unmoving, her arms loose at her sides, no drink in hand. Just… standing there. Watching.</p><p>Her expression unreadable, lips curled in a faint, eerie smile.</p><p>The pane of glass between them may as well have been smoke. It didn’t feel like a barrier — it felt like a promise.<br/>I’m here. I see you. I’m not going anywhere.</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly, nearly knocking over her coffee. By the time she pushed through the café doors, Wanda was gone.</p><p>She tried to convince herself she was imagining things. That she was reading too much into gestures and glances. But Wanda didn’t stop.</p><p>She pressed closer — not physically, but emotionally, psychologically — until Agatha felt like her very space was no longer hers.</p><p>A brush of fingertips across her sleeve in the hallway, so brief it could have been accidental… but wasn’t.</p><p>A box of macarons left on her desk one morning in her favorite flavor — violet and lemon — though she’d only mentioned that to Pepper in the privacy of Tonys office.</p><p>And then, the roses.</p><p>After a long, grueling board meeting, Agatha returned to her office to find a bouquet placed neatly at the center of her desk. Deep red roses — dark, almost black at the edges — their scent rich and cloying, curling through the room like smoke. At first she relaxed, hoping they were from Rio. But there was no card. No name.</p><p>She stared at them for a long time.</p><p>They were the exact shade of Wanda’s lipstick.</p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled slightly as she pulled forward the trashcan and shoved the bouquet inside, slamming the lid shut with a violence she rarely allowed herself. Her mouth was dry. Her pulse unsteady.</p><p>She’d been watched before — she’d dealt with difficult clients, overly friendly colleagues, aggressive competitors. She knew how to stand her ground. She knew how to fight.</p><p>But this was different.</p><p>This wasn’t a challenge. It was an invasion — slow, insidious.</p><p>By Friday night, the tension had worked itself into her very bones. She was jumpy, hyper-aware of every sound in the corridor outside her office, every unexpected knock, every flicker of shadow.</p><p>Her thoughts were looping, spinning, chasing dead ends — What does she want? Why is she doing this?<br/>And worse: Doesn’t anyone else see it?</p><p>She left late again, after most of the firm had emptied out, hoping the silence would calm her.</p><p>Instead, it amplified everything. Her heels echoed in the underground parking garage like gunshots. She clutched her keys between her fingers, the way Rio had once shown her, a makeshift weapon in a trembling hand.</p><p>She checked the back seat before unlocking the car. Twice.</p><p>As she drove home, her hands were steady on the wheel, but her chest was tight, as though something unseen was pressing against her sternum.</p><p>She tried to tell herself she was safe.</p><p>But the truth was, she didn’t feel like the protagonist in her own life anymore.</p><p>She felt like prey.</p><p>Rio was curled up on the couch when Agatha walked in, legs tucked beneath her, an old, dog-eared journal resting in her lap. The glow from a nearby lamp lit her in gold, softening the sharp angles of her cheekbones, casting long shadows on the walls. Her dark hair was piled into a loose bun on top of her head, tendrils slipping free around her temples in a way that always made Agatha ache with affection.</p><p>Normally, the sight would have soothed her — Rio, in her sanctuary of warmth and familiarity, waiting like a safe harbor.</p><p>“Hey, you’re late, again,” Rio said, stretching as she stood, her bare feet silent on the hardwood. She walked toward her with an easy, swaying grace, her smile soft and welcoming — until she saw Agatha’s face.</p><p>Her expression faltered, brows knitting together. “Long day?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She slipped out of her blazer with slow, mechanical movements, draped it over a chair. Her shoulders were tense, her jaw clenched tight. She pressed the heel of her palm against one eye socket, trying to stave off the headache blooming behind her eyes.</p><p>Rio’s smile dimmed further. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily and let her hand fall.</p><p>“She’s getting worse,” she said quietly. “Wanda. It’s not just the staring anymore.”</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>“She’s leaving me things,” Agatha went on, her voice low and raw. “Notes. Flowers. Watching me through windows. I saw her outside the café — just standing there. No reason to be there, just... watching.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio said nothing. Then, slowly, she crossed her arms over her chest. Her posture shifted, her shoulders drawing back, chin lifting just slightly — a defense forming.</p><p>“Well,” she said evenly, her tone carefully measured, “what exactly have you done to make her think she could?”</p><p>The words hit like ice water.</p><p>Agatha stared at her, stunned, as though the floor had cracked beneath her feet. “What?”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. “I mean, you’re not exactly a wallflower, Agatha. You can be... intense. Charming, even when you’re not trying to be. Maybe she misunderstood something.”</p><p>“I haven’t encouraged her,” Agatha said, her trembling with restrained disbelief. “I’ve spoken to her only when absolutely necessary. I’ve been professional, distant. Hell, I’ve been rude.”</p><p>Rio shrugged one shoulder, mouth tightening. “You don’t see how you can come across. You walk into a room and people light up. You look at someone for five seconds and they think they’ve been chosen. Maybe she just got the wrong idea.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands curled into fists at her sides, nails biting into her palms. Something cold and sour twisted deep in her stomach — betrayal and hurt tangled together.</p><p>“So now it’s my fault,” she said, voice quiet. “That I’m being basically stalked. Harassed. You think I asked for this?</p><p>“I’m not saying that—”</p><p>“You are,” Agatha snapped, cutting her off. “You are, Rio. Without even thinking about it. You didn’t ask if I was okay. You didn’t ask what she did. You just assumed I must’ve led her on somehow.”</p><p>Rio’s face hardened, the lines around her mouth drawing tight. “I just don’t get why this keeps happening with her. This has been going on since she started. Maybe — maybe there’s a pattern.”</p><p>Agatha recoiled like she’d been struck. “A pattern?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but it’s true,” Rio said, her voice sharpening now, rising with each word. “People don’t just act this way out of nowhere.”</p><p>Agatha let out a bitter laugh, disbelieving, wounded. “Jesus, Rio. You think I want this? That I’m somehow inviting it? I’m trying to tell you I’m scared and instead of helping, you’re dissecting me like I’m the problem.”</p><p>“I’m trying to understand,” Rio shot back. “Because from where I’m standing, it looks like maybe — just maybe — you might enjoy the attention a little more than you want to admit.”</p><p>That did it.</p><p>The space between them turned icy in an instant.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her eyes wide with shock. “That’s what you think of me?” she whispered. “That I’m... what? Flirting? Playing games with a woman who’s creeping through my life like a fucking shadow?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Her eyes glittered, jaw clenched, arms crossed so tightly she looked like she might fold into herself.</p><p>Agatha took a shaky step back, suddenly cold all over. “God. I came home to feel safe. To feel seen. And you — you think I deserve it.”</p><p>“I never said that,” Rio murmured, but the words were too late, too limp.</p><p>“You didn’t have to,” Agatha said, her voice cracking. “You don’t believe me. You don’t trust me.”</p><p>The silence that followed was sharp-edged and thick. A wall rising fast and high between them.<br/>Agatha stood there a moment longer, trembling, her breath unsteady. Then she turned, walking stiffly down the hallway toward the bedroom. Her heels thudded dully against the floor. She didn’t look back.</p><p>Behind her, Rio didn’t follow.<br/>She didn’t call her name.<br/>She didn’t say a word.</p><p>And Agatha had never felt so alone in a place that usually was her safe place.</p><p>Later, lying awake in the dark, Agatha stared at the ceiling, feeling the cool sheets against her skin, a yawning emptiness beside her where Rio usually slept pressed close, but tonight she’d opted to sleep on the couch.</p><p>Outside the bedroom window, the city breathed and pulsed in the night.</p><p>And somewhere — she was certain of it — Wanda Maximoff was thinking about her.</p><p>The morning light crept into the apartment. It was quiet — not the comforting quiet of shared solitude, but the brittle kind that came after words you couldn’t take back. The air felt thick with everything unsaid the night before, each silence laced with fragments of what had been spoken, or worse, implied.</p><p>Agatha moved through the kitchen like she was underwater. The coffee machine hummed steadily, the scent of dark roast curling into the space like a ghost of normalcy. She didn’t even realize she’d begun making toast until she was halfway through buttering it, the knife moving in slow, repetitive strokes. She wasn’t hungry. She hadn’t been able to stomach much of anything recently.</p><p>Her chest still ached — not with the fire of anger, but with the slow, suffocating weight of sadness.</p><p>She didn’t hear the footsteps at first — only felt the subtle shift in the room, the change in the atmosphere that told her she was no longer alone.</p><p>Rio stood in the doorway.</p><p>She looked small. Fragile in a way Agatha rarely saw. One of Agatha’s old T-shirts hung off her like a borrowed memory, the sleeves swallowing her arms. Her hair was a mess of sleep-tangled strands, and her eyes — god, her eyes — were swollen and rimmed in red. From sleep, maybe.</p><p>But Agatha knew better.</p><p>The knife froze mid-motion, poised above the toast. Agatha didn’t turn. Her spine went stiff, breath shallow, as though bracing for another blow — a careless comment, a defensive shrug, anything that might confirm the terrible fear blooming quietly inside her: that Rio didn’t believe her. That maybe, deep down, she never had.</p><p>But when Rio spoke, her voice was small. Unsteady. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha set the knife down carefully, her fingers trembling. She turned slowly, cautiously, as if she weren’t sure whether Rio would still be standing there.</p><p>She was.</p><p>“I was unfair to you,” Rio continued, stepping into the room like someone approaching a wild, wounded thing. Her voice cracked in places, softened in others. “I know you haven’t done anything wrong. I just… sometimes I get so scared that one day you’ll wake up and realize you could have anyone. And I’ll lose you. And I wouldn’t know how to breathe.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, a choked sound in her throat. Her hand reached for the edge of the counter to steady herself, her knuckles white against the marble. For a moment, she couldn’t speak. Her mouth opened once. Closed.</p><p>Then her eyes filled involuntarily.</p><p>“Rio…” she whispered. But it came out broken.</p><p>The dam snapped. She didn’t even try to stop it.</p><p>She covered her face with both hands as the sob wrenched out of her — raw and sudden, like something torn from the deepest part of her. All the days she’d spent holding it in, all the quiet moments where she’d swallowed her fear and tried to keep her usual armour, cracked wide with vulnerability.</p><p>Rio was there in a heartbeat.</p><p>She closed the distance between them and wrapped her arms around Agatha without hesitation, pulling her in so tightly it hurt. Agatha clung to her like a lifeline, pressing her face to Rio’s shoulder, her whole body trembling with the force of everything she had tried not to feel.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Rio whispered, over and over again. Her hands moved through Agatha’s hair, her lips brushing her temple, her jaw, her hands. “I’m so sorry, my love. I trust you. I do. Please don’t doubt that. I just — I get scared. But I know you’d never betray me.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t answer at first — her throat was too tight, her heart too bruised. But she held on, breathing in the familiar scent of Rio’s skin, the vanilla warmth of her, the safety she so desperately needed.</p><p>It had hurt more than she wanted to admit — Rio’s doubt. The way she had turned suspicion on Agatha instead of comfort. It felt like being left in the cold by the person who was supposed to be her shelter. And yet… here Rio was. Apologizing. Reaching. Holding her again like she meant everything.</p><p>After a long while, Agatha pulled back, her eyes swollen, her face damp, but the weight in her chest a little lighter.</p><p>“I just need you to believe me,” she said hoarsely. “I didn’t need you to fix it. I just… needed you with me.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio said fiercely, cupping her face with both hands. Her thumbs wiped gently at the tear tracks on Agatha’s cheeks. “I am. Always. I’m sorry I made you feel like I wasn’t.”</p><p>They stood like that for a long time, forehead to forehead, breath mingling. The city murmured faintly outside — car horns, distant sirens, the low hum of traffic — but none of it touched them.<br/>Here, in this little kitchen with cold toast and lukewarm coffee, something had been cracked open, but not broken. Agatha felt it — the slow rebuilding, the tenderness folding in where anger had lived.</p><p>It was nearly six by the time Agatha finally stepped out of the towering glass atrium of Westview Global, her client’s downtown headquarters on the following Monday. The sky had deepened into a bruised violet, and the wind cut sharp against her cheeks as she paused at the top of the broad steps, letting the last remnants of adrenaline drain from her system.</p><p>The crisis had been defused — at least for now. A volatile whistleblower, a leaked memo, a boardroom full of men ready to point fingers anywhere but inward. She’d spent the better part of eight hours smoothing egos, reshaping narratives, turning chaos into something that looked like control. It was the kind of high-wire work she excelled at — ruthless, strategic, exhausting.</p><p>And today, she had won.</p><p>She exhaled slowly, letting the cold settle into her lungs.</p><p>That’s when she saw her.</p><p>Across the street, half-enshrouded in the shadows cast by the building’s floodlights, Wanda stood beneath a lamppost, one hand tucked casually into the pocket of her coat, the other holding a takeaway cup she wasn’t drinking from. Her hair was loose, spilling around her shoulders, her red coat cinched tight at the waist.</p><p>Her smile was too bright. Too wide. Too sure.<br/>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Wanda wasn’t supposed to be here. She had no reason to be anywhere near this part of town — certainly not loitering across from a corporate office where Agatha had spent the day putting out fires.</p><p>And yet there she was.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes scanned the street instinctively — a few suits heading toward the metro, a cluster of smokers gathered near the corner, a delivery driver wrestling with a stack of boxes. No one else seemed to notice the sudden shift in the air, the quiet pressure that settled over the scene like the stillness before a storm.</p><p>She descended the steps slowly, one hand slipping into the pocket of her coat, fingers curling around the familiar shape of her phone.</p><p>Her other hand stayed free, ready.</p><p>She was nearly at the curb when Wanda stepped off the sidewalk, weaving through the idle traffic like it was parting just for her. Her boots made no sound on the pavement. Her eyes never left Agatha’s.</p><p>“Agatha,” she called, her voice sweet and sing-song, like a child calling a pet.</p><p>Agatha stopped. Everything inside her screamed to keep moving — to turn, to walk briskly away, to vanish into the crowd. But she stayed rooted, the practiced calm of crisis management rising like a wall around her.</p><p>Wanda approached slowly, that unblinking gaze fixed on her like a spotlight. She stopped just a foot away — close enough that Agatha could smell her perfume: some sickly floral thing, syrupy and cloying, the scent of artificial sweetness over something rotting underneath.</p><p>“I just wanted to congratulate you,” Wanda said softly, tilting her head like a bird might, watching for the moment to strike. “You obviously handled things differently so beautifully in there. You really are… extraordinary.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, jaw tight, the rhythm of her pulse hammering in her ears.</p><p>“Ms. Maximoff,” she said, voice clipped and cold, “this is entirely inappropriate. If you don’t leave right now, I’ll be forced to escalate this.”</p><p>Wanda’s expression didn’t falter. If anything, it brightened — her smile stretching a fraction wider, like someone hearing a joke only they understood.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” she murmured, voice tinged with something both fond and mocking. “We’re long past pretending.”</p><p>Agatha took a slow, deliberate step back, phone clenched tight in her palm. She could call the police. She didn’t care how it looked anymore — she just wanted Wanda gone.</p><p>But Wanda only laughed — a soft, breathy thing that danced like mist in the chill air.</p><p>“I’m not going away,” she whispered, her voice dropping to a near-purr. “I know what this is. You’ll see soon enough. You belong with me, Agatha. You just don’t know it yet.”</p><p>And then — as casually as she’d appeared — Wanda turned and walked away. Her red coat flared like a banner behind her. She didn’t look back.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen on the sidewalk, her breath shallow, the night pressing in around her.</p><p>She had spent her career fixing disasters, defusing scandals, taming chaos.</p><p>But this wasn’t something she could control with strategy and spin. This wasn’t about narrative.</p><p>This was personal.</p><p>And for the first time in years, Agatha Harkness felt like prey.</p><p>Agatha barely slept that night, after pretending all evening that she was fine. She lay awake beside Rio, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Every creak, every groan of settling beams felt amplified — like the building itself was holding its breath with her.</p><p>By morning, her decision was made.</p><p>She wasn’t going to wait for Wanda to escalate again. She’d tried silence. She’d tried distance. None of it had worked. This time, she needed to act — officially, and decisively.</p><p>By midday, after pushing through two strategy calls and a damage-control debrief that felt like wading through mud, Agatha requested a private meeting with Tony and Pepper.</p><p>They looked worried.</p><p>Lisa from HR was already waiting in the conference room when Agatha arrived — lips pursed, a slim black folder under one arm, like she’d anticipated what was coming before the invite was even sent.</p><p>Agatha laid it all out: the notes, the glances, the bouquet, the confrontation outside Westview Global. She spoke clearly, methodically, but her voice wavered in places. Wanda’s name caught in her throat like a splinter.</p><p>With every new detail, the mood in the room shifted — from curious concern to chilled, careful silence. Tony sat back in his chair, one ankle crossed over a knee, his fingers steepled in front of his face — but the easy charm he was known for had drained away, replaced by something far more serious. Pepper remained still beside him, her brow furrowed, her expression unreadable.</p><p>Lisa Tran took quiet, unrelenting notes. The scratch of her pen was the only sound when Agatha finally stopped speaking.</p><p>When the silence stretched too long, Tony blew out a breath and raked a hand through his hair. “Well. This is one hell of a Tuesday.”</p><p>“She’s unstable,” Agatha said. “She’s obsessed. And I don’t feel safe with her in the building.”</p><p>Pepper nodded, slow and deliberate. “This goes far beyond anything we can handle in-house,” she said, her voice calm but steely. “It’s a liability. And a threat.”</p><p>Lisa closed her notebook with a soft, decisive snap. “We’ll proceed with immediate termination and revocation of access credentials,” she said. “Effective today.”</p><p>Agatha sagged in her seat. Just a little. But even that felt dangerous — like letting go of too much at once might undo her entirely.</p><p>They didn’t wait.</p><p>Within the hour, Tony himself placed the call summoning Wanda to the conference room — a sleek, modern space enclosed by floor-to-ceiling glass, the skyline sprawling in jagged silhouettes beyond.</p><p>Agatha remained hidden in her office, as Lisa had insisted. “For your own protection,” she’d said, gently but firmly. “And for plausible deniability. Let us handle her.”</p><p>Wanda arrived promptly, her appearance deceptively normal. She wore a soft pink sweater and fitted jeans, her coat unbuttoned and flaring slightly as she walked. A leather tote hung from her shoulder. Her hair was freshly styled — curled at the ends, like she was heading to brunch, not a termination meeting.</p><p>She looked like any other young professional, summoned to HR.</p><p>But they saw it immediately — the tightness behind her smile, the too-bright gleam in her eyes.</p><p>Wanda entered the room with casual grace, taking her seat with a tilt of the head and a soft smile. “Mr. Stark. Ms. Potts,” she said, as though greeting friends at a dinner party.</p><p>Then Tony started speaking.</p><p>And the smile cracked.</p><p>As he gently explained the nature of the complaint — without naming Agatha, though the implication hung thick in the air — Wanda’s face began to change. Not in a single dramatic moment, but in degrees. Like layers of a mask peeling away.</p><p>First came confusion. Her brows drew together. She tilted her head, as though she simply didn’t understand the words being said. “I’m sorry, what is this about? I don’t... I don’t follow.”</p><p>Then came the denial. “That’s absurd,” she said, laughing softly. “You’ve all misunderstood. Agatha and I — we have a connection. She’s just scared to admit it.”</p><p>Pepper remained silent, her hands folded neatly in front of her. Lisa kept writing.</p><p>Then the hurt hit — theatrical and sudden. Wanda’s breath caught. She brought one hand to her chest like she’d been shot. “She thinks I’m dangerous?” Her voice trembled. “I’ve only ever cared about her. I would never hurt her.”</p><p>But the real shift came when Tony said the words: “We’re going to have to ask you to leave the building. Today. Permanently.”</p><p>Something inside Wanda snapped.</p><p>She surged to her feet, the chair screeching backward. Her tote slipped from her shoulder and hit the ground with a thud, spilling papers and pens in every direction. Her face twisted — not with sadness, but rage. Her voice rose sharply, echoing off the conference room glass.</p><p>“You’re making a mistake,” she hissed. “She doesn’t understand yet — but she will. I know what we are. I see her! I see her, and she needs me!”</p><p>Several heads in the bullpen turned. The office hushed like a power outage had just swept through it.</p><p>“She’s mine!” Wanda screamed, pointing toward Agathas office.“You don’t get to take her away from me!”</p><p>Pepper remained seated, eyes narrowed, not flinching once.</p><p>Tony stood slowly, voice low and even. “Security’s on its way, Wanda.”</p><p>Lisa didn’t say a word.</p><p>Wanda's hands curled into fists. Her breathing came fast and sharp. “You think this ends because you say it does?” she snapped. “You think locking me out of a building will stop what’s between us? She belongs with me!”</p><p>Security arrived less than a minute later — two uniformed guards with calm, practiced movements. One stepped in front of her, the other flanked her side.</p><p>“Ms. Maximoff,” one said firmly. “You need to leave. Right now.”</p><p>Wanda’s chest heaved. She looked between them, eyes wild. Then she bent, snatching up her spilled papers with clumsy, angry motions, shoving them back into her tote in a crumpled mess.</p><p>As the guards led her out — not touching her, but close — Wanda cast one last look over her shoulder. Her gaze swept the bullpen, desperate, searching.</p><p>Searching for Agatha. But she wasnt there.</p><p>Later, Tony came by her office, looking paler than usual, the creases around his eyes deeper than she’d ever seen.</p><p>“She’s banned,” he said shortly. “Security has her photo. If she even shows up near the lobby, they’ll call the cops.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p>Tony hesitated at the door. Then, with uncharacteristic seriousness, he said, “You did the right thing, Agatha.”</p><p>She didn’t answer.</p><p>Because in her gut — deep in the quiet, primal part of her that still hadn’t stopped trembling — she knew this wasn’t over.</p><p>Wanda had shown her true face today.</p><p>And obsession doesn’t disappear. It waits. It festers.</p><p>The office had mostly cleared out by the time Agatha returned from the rooftop garden.</p><p>She hadn’t meant to go up there — she’d just needed air. Space. A horizon. Something that wasn’t glass walls and sympathetic looks and the distant echo of Wanda’s voice shrieking she’s mine.</p><p>Now, the floor was silent. Lights dimmed, only the faint buzz of the emergency fixtures still humming above. Her heels clicked softly across the marble as she made her way back to her office.</p><p>Pepper was waiting.</p><p>She stood just inside Agatha’s door, one hand resting lightly on the edge of the desk, her posture casual but her eyes serious. She looked elegant— crisp blouse, coat slung over her arm, hair pulled back in a low twist. But there was a softness in her expression now that Agatha rarely saw. Not professional. Not managerial.<br/>Something like worry.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to ambush you,” Pepper said gently. “I saw you come in. I thought… maybe you shouldn’t be alone right now.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated in the doorway, suddenly unsure how to hold herself — how to stand, how to breathe. Her body felt like a borrowed suit of armor, too heavy in all the wrong places.<br/>“I’m fine,” she said automatically.</p><p>Pepper didn’t move. Just looked at her with that quiet, uncanny knowing she had — like she could hear the cracks even when Agatha was whispering through a smile.</p><p>“No, you’re not,” she said.</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She just walked past her, setting her bag down with a thump on the edge of her desk. She stood there a moment, her back to Pepper, gripping the edge of the wood until her knuckles turned white.</p><p>“I barely spoke to the woman,” she whispered. “I don’t understand why she fixated on me .”</p><p>A silence fell. When Agatha turned around, Pepper had stepped closer.</p><p>“She scared you,” Pepper said softly. “I saw it today. You were terrified.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth — to deny it, to deflect, to turn it into a joke — but nothing came out. Her throat tightened. The mask cracked.</p><p>“I’ve dealt with powerful men,” she said, voice brittle. “CEOs. Lobbyists. Threats wrapped in five-thousand-dollar suits. But she…” Her voice wavered. “She made me feel hunted”</p><p>Pepper’s jaw tightened, and something flickered in her eyes. Regret. Guilt. “I should have seen it,” she said quietly. “Earlier. Weeks ago, even. I noticed how she looked at you. The way she found excuses to hover when you were presenting. That time in the elevator — she didn’t even try to hide it.”</p><p>Agatha gave a hollow laugh. “And you didn’t say anything?.”</p><p>“I didn’t think it was dangerous,” Pepper admitted, her voice low. “Just... awkward. Inappropriate. I thought it was an unrequited silly crush. And maybe I wanted to believe it wasn’t as dark as it felt.”</p><p>Agatha blinked fast, the sting building behind her eyes again. “I kept second-guessing myself,” she said. “Thinking maybe I was imagining it. That I was being dramatic. And the more I avoided her, the worse she got. But I didn’t want to say anything because — because I didn’t want to seem paranoid. Or fragile.”</p><p>“You are not fragile,” Pepper said sharply, stepping forward. “You’ve held this firm together through more crises than I can count. You’re the reason half our clients haven’t imploded. But even the strongest people have limits, Agatha. And she crossed them.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. For a second, the ice around her chest loosened, she offered up a half smile, stepping out together, hoping that this was the end.</p>

<p>The next few days passed in a brittle kind of silence.</p><p>No one at the firm mentioned Wanda directly, but her absence hung over the office like a bad smell, clinging to the walls. Every time Agatha walked through the halls, she felt eyes flick toward her and quickly away, a hundred unasked questions hovering in the stale, recycled air.</p><p>Agatha buried herself in her work, sharpening her focus into a weapon. She dressed sharper, spoke colder, stayed later. She had survived worse storms than this.</p><p>At least, that’s what she told herself.</p><p>But then the packages started.</p><p>The first arrived two days after Wanda’s removal: a slim box, wrapped in matte black paper, left at the reception desk with no return address. Inside was a single white lily — a flower Agatha despised — with a note tucked beneath it. The note was blank, except for one word, scrawled in red ink: Soon.</p><p>Agatha said nothing. She slipped the box into her bag and fed it into the office shredder that evening, standing there long after the paper had been ground into unrecognizable scraps.</p><p>The next day, a leather-bound journal appeared on her office chair — brand new, except the first page had been filled in a jagged, looping hand: Every thought of you is a prayer.</p><p>She threw that one into the trash without even touching it.</p><p>She reported all of it and Lisa became increasingly more alarmed, pushing for restraining orders and official complaints. But Agatha, ever careful, ever guarded, refused to show fear.</p><p>Wanda wanted her afraid. Agatha refused to give her the satisfaction.</p><p>At least publicly.</p><p>At home, Agatha said nothing at first.</p><p>She didn’t want to burden Rio further — not after the last disagreement over Wanda. Rio had been trying so hard lately, making an effort to listen without judgment, offering reassurances without smothering.</p><p>Agatha didn't want fear to be the thing that defined them.</p><p>But it crept into the corners of her life anyway — in the way she triple-checked the locks before bed, how she pulled Rio a little closer at night without even realizing it.</p><p>She wasn’t even sure when it began — the sense that things were... wrong inside the apartment.</p><p>It started small. A coffee cup left slightly askew on the counter when she knew she hadn't touched it. A faint trace of unfamiliar perfume clinging to the hallway — sweet, cloying, unmistakably not Rio’s.</p><p>Once, she came home to find her favorite cashmere scarf draped neatly over the back of the living room couch — the scarf she hadn’t worn in weeks, the one that had been buried at the bottom of her closet.</p><p>Rio shrugged it off at first. “We probably just forgot,” she said, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s temple. “We’ve been stressed. You’re tired. It’s nothing.”</p><p>But Agatha knew better.</p><p>Something — someone — had been there.</p><p>The confirmation came one rainy Thursday evening.</p><p>Agatha and Rio had gone out to dinner, a rare occurrence at a cozy Italian restaurant downtown. They returned around ten, laughter and the rich smell of wine lingering between them, their hands entwined as they pushed through the apartment door.</p><p>Agatha’s body went still the moment they stepped inside.</p><p>It was subtle. Barely noticeable at first. The faint metallic tang in the air, like cold coins. The way the hallway light flickered once, twice, before settling.</p><p>And then — the living room.</p><p>The cushions on the couch had been rearranged.</p><p>Their photo — taken at a friend’s vineyard in a moment of rare, unguarded joy — had been taken down from the mantle and placed face-up on the coffee table.</p><p>Propped neatly against it was a single rose — blood red, dewy, fresh.</p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped into her stomach.<br/>Rio froze beside her, her fingers tightening painfully around Agatha’s.</p><p>“Agatha...” she whispered. “What the hell...?”</p><p>Without a word, Agatha moved through the apartment, checking every room.</p><p>Closets. Windows. Balconies.<br/>Everything was locked. Everything was silent.</p><p>And yet she could feel it — the aftertaste of presence, thick and heavy in the air, like a handprint on glass.</p><p>They had been watched.</p><p>Touched.</p><p>Known.</p><p>Agatha returned to the living room slowly, her face pale and expressionless.</p><p>She picked up the rose carefully by its thorny stem and carried it to the kitchen sink, dropping it unceremoniously into the garbage disposal. The petals whirled and shredded under the grinding blades, disappearing into pulp and water.<br/>She didn't look at Rio as she spoke, her voice a low rasp: “She was here.”</p><p>The next morning, Agatha sat in the dim, sterile waiting room of the 21st precinct, the fluorescent lights buzzing faintly overhead, a clipboard clutched tightly in her hands.</p><p>Her fingers shook as she filled out the forms: Name of Respondent: Wanda Maximoff. Nature of Incident: Stalking, harassment, unlawful entry.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, their knees touching. Every few minutes, Rio’s hand would drift to Agatha’s thigh, squeezing gently, as if grounding her to the earth.<br/>"I'm here," she whispered once, and Agatha nodded stiffly, not trusting herself to speak. When an officer — a weary-looking woman in her mid-forties with deep lines around her mouth — called Agatha’s name, they stood together.</p><p>It took over an hour to file the official complaint. Agatha recounted everything in precise, clinical terms: the notes, the packages, the appearance at her clients base, the break-in.</p><p>The officer’s face remained neutral throughout, though something flickered behind her eyes when Agatha described finding the rose on the coffee table.<br/>“Obsession cases are tricky,” she said grimly as she slid a heavy sheaf of paperwork across the desk. “But you’re doing the right thing. We’ll get the restraining order filed. In the meantime — keep your doors locked. Stay aware. If she shows up again, call us immediately.”</p><p>The words sounded good. Comforting, even.</p><p>But Agatha knew, deep down, that paper alone couldn’t stop someone like Wanda.</p><p>Over the next few days, Rio became fiercely protective — always checking the locks herself, insisting on meeting Agatha at the garage so she didn’t need to walk up on her own. They cooked dinner together in the evenings, the television murmuring mindlessly in the background, pretending life was normal.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha let herself believe it could be.</p><p>Until Rio’s phone buzzed one night while they were curled up together on the couch.</p><p>Rio frowned, lifting it from the coffee table.</p><p>Agatha barely glanced up at first — until she heard Rio’s sharp intake of breath.</p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked, heart already dropping.</p><p>Rio’s face had gone pale, the phone trembling slightly in her hand. Wordlessly, she turned the screen toward Agatha.</p><p>It was a text.<br/>A number Rio didn’t recognize.<br/>The message was short:<br/>She’s lying to you. She’s been with me all along.</p><p>Attached was a photograph. It showed Agatha, blurry but unmistakable, standing on a city sidewalk — speaking to someone whose face was just out of frame. It looked… intimate. Deceptively so.</p><p>Agatha felt like the floor shifted under her feet.<br/>“Rio, that’s not—” she began, but Rio cut her off with a weak shake of her head.</p><p>“There’s more,” Rio said, her voice tight with something — hurt, fear, confusion — and tapped into the second message.</p><p>A video this time.</p><p>It was filmed inside their bedroom.</p><p>The camera panned slowly over their bed — their bed — the covers rumpled, the pillows indented as if someone had just risen from them.<br/>And then —</p><p>Wanda appeared in the frame.</p><p>She was wearing one of Agatha’s shirts — the soft grey one Agatha often slept in — and nothing else. She crawled slowly, languidly across the bed, her hair wild around her face, her eyes dark and burning.</p><p>She looked straight into the camera — straight at Rio and Agatha now — and smiled.</p><p>The video cut out abruptly.</p><p>The silence in the apartment was deafening.<br/>Agatha could barely breathe.</p><p>“Rio,” she croaked, reaching for her. “This isn’t real. She broke in — she filmed this when we were out—”</p><p>Rio flinched back, her face crumpling. “How can I know that, Agatha?” she whispered, and it shattered Agatha’s heart into a thousand jagged pieces.<br/>“I—I want to believe you, but how can I be sure?”<br/>The room seemed to tilt, the world narrowing into a tunnel.</p><p>Agatha had fought in boardrooms, destroyed opponents with a single cutting glance. But this — being doubted by the woman she loved most — left her completely defenseless.</p><p>Tears burned behind her eyes, but she blinked them back fiercely. “Because I love you,” she said, voice breaking. “Because I would never touch her. I don’t even know how she got in— Rio, please.”</p><p>Rio covered her face with her hands, struggling to breathe, struggling to think.</p><p>Agatha could only stand there, trembling, watching helplessly as the poison Wanda had planted began to bloom between them.</p><p>At first, Rio was just crying — deep, silent sobs, her shoulders shaking under the loose sweater she wore. Agatha reached for her again, desperate to pull her close, to explain, to fix this somehow — but Rio recoiled as if Agatha’s hands could burn her.</p><p>And then it snapped.</p><p>The grief, the betrayal, the fear — it all cracked open inside her like a dam bursting, and suddenly Rio was screaming accusations.</p><p>“You think I’m stupid, don’t you?” she shouted, her voice breaking against the walls of their home. “You think you’re so clever! Going to the police, filing reports, getting that damn restraining order — God, you must have thought you covered everything!”</p><p>Agatha stood frozen by the coffee table, her hands dangling uselessly by her sides, her heart splintering with every word.</p><p>“That was all part of it, wasn’t it?” Rio choked out, her fists clenching and unclenching. “You cheat on me with her — and when you realized you’d screwed up, you panicked. And did what you do best, looked to fix it. You wanted to look like the victim.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head wildly, tears slipping down her cheeks unchecked now.</p><p>“No,” she rasped, barely able to force the word out. “No, Rio, it’s not like that—”</p><p>“Our doors are always locked!” Rio shrieked. “You’re so paranoid about it! You check them three times every night, Agatha! Explain to me how she got in!”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth — but no words came.</p><p>Because she didn’t know.<br/>Because logic didn’t apply to this nightmare anymore.<br/>Because Wanda wasn’t acting like a normal person — she was moving through their lives like smoke, invisible and poisonous and unstoppable.</p><p>And Rio — her Rio, the one who had once looked at her like she hung the moon — was looking at her now with such disgust, such betrayal, that Agatha could barely stand.</p><p>“You lied to me,” Rio hissed. “You lied to me. How many times over the years?”</p><p>Agatha just stood there, every ounce of strength she had used up holding herself upright.</p><p>Silent tears streamed down her face — hot, relentless, shameful.</p><p>She didn’t defend herself anymore.</p><p>She didn’t argue.<br/>She didn't scream back.<br/>She just took it — every word, every accusation, letting them slam into her like tidal waves she could not escape. Because there was nothing she could say.<br/>Nothing she could do to tear the poison from Rio’s mind once it had rooted there.</p><p>Wanda had made sure of that.</p><p>And Agatha — trapped in her own private hell — could only stand there and bleed as Rio’s voice rose to a fever pitch, the words cutting through the air like shards of glass.</p><p>“I’ve seen you at work how quickly you make issues disappear,” she spat, her hands trembling in the air. “I knew what you were, Agatha. I knew it. But I thought you were different at home. You can’t love anyone. Not me. Not even yourself. And I was stupid enough to believe you could.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her chest, as if something sharp had lodged there, a knot of pure agony that tightened with each passing second. She opened her mouth, but no words came. She couldn’t speak. Not now. Not with the world crumbling beneath her feet.</p><p>And then Rio’s next words hit her like a sucker punch, stealing the air from her lungs completely.</p><p>“You know, your mom was right about you,” Rio hissed, her voice now trembling with venom. “She said you couldn’t love anyone — that you were incapable of it. That ruin everything you touch.”</p><p>It felt as though the floor had vanished, as if she were standing on air, and the world had tilted sideways into some dark abyss.</p><p>Agatha’s legs wobbled. She stumbled back, her chest tightening, the weight of Rio’s words pushing the air from her lungs.</p><p>Your mother was right about you.</p><p>It wasn’t just an insult.</p><p>It was a nightmare realized.<br/>Her mother’s voice, long buried in Agatha’s memory, roared to life in her mind: “You were born evil. I should have killed you the moment you left my body.”<br/>A voice that had echoed in the silence of her childhood — cutting, mocking, suffocating. And now Rio was saying it too. Rio was echoing her mother’s words.</p><p>“You don’t know how to love,” Rio repeated, her eyes narrow and hard, every word a cruel verdict. “So go. Go be with Wanda.“</p><p>Agatha’s heart shattered into a thousand jagged pieces. It wasn’t just Rio’s anger or her accusations that hurt. It was the truth in them. The cruel, twisted truth that Agatha had spent years trying to rationalise was wrong — that she was somehow broken. That love was something she couldn’t understand, that wasn’t meant for her, no matter how much she loved Rio with what felt like every fibre of her soul.</p><p>Rio’s gaze burned into her, and the finality of the words sank deep, like a blade thrust into her chest.</p><p>“Leave,” Rio spat, her face flushed with emotion. “I don’t want you here anymore. Just get out.”</p><p>Agatha barely registered the words. She didn’t feel the ground beneath her feet as she turned and walked toward the door, each step like a hollow echo of her existence. The apartment felt like a stranger’s house now — the walls closing in, suffocating her.</p><p>She stepped out into the cold hallway, not bothering to look back. No card, no cash, no keys. The door slammed shut behind her, but the sound felt like the finality of a coffin lid.</p><p>Her eyes burned with tears. She wandered aimlessly, her feet carrying her through the darkened streets, unaware of where she was going. It was late, the world silent except for the distant hum of traffic, the muted thrum of city life.</p><p>But all Agatha could hear was the hammering of her own pulse in her ears, the rushing blood that felt like a distant, cold thing inside her.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her pocket, but she ignored it. She couldn’t bear to look at it. Not now.</p><p>She ended up in the parking garage, sat atop her car, staring at the fluorescent lights, her mind empty, hollow. She couldn’t go back inside. Not after what Rio had said. She couldn’t.</p><p>She’d never felt as alone as she did at that moment.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Morning arrived like a dull bruise across the horizon. The parking garage hummed with an artificial stillness, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like some kind of mockery. Agatha stood unmoving beside the Maserati, arms wrapped around herself, as if she could hold her shattering pieces together with sheer force of will.</p><p>She hadn’t slept. Just sat on the hood of the car all night, numb and cold, staring into the empty dark, trying to breathe through the ache in her chest. Trying to work out how to make this right. But now, in the pale, unforgiving light of day, it all felt worse. More real.</p><p>She turned toward the building, the private elevator doors still closed, the entrance like the mouth of something hungry, waiting to consume her. And then—</p><p>Footsteps.</p><p>Sharp. Deliberate.</p><p>Her heart clenched.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She stood there, arms folded tight across her chest, jaw clenched, her dark eyes unreadable but brimming with something fierce and wounded.</p><p>There was no trace of softness in her. None of the warmth Agatha had memorized like scripture. The air between them was charged—static, dangerous.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. “Rio…”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak. Her gaze flicked to the Maserati.</p><p>Then she walked past Agatha without a glance, shoes clicking against the concrete like a countdown. She moved to the trunk, shoved a key into the lock, and with a violent snap, threw it open.</p><p>A suitcase hit the boot with a thud that echoed through the garage.</p><p>“This is it,” Rio said, her voice flat, like she’d rehearsed it all night. “I packed what I could. The rest you can send someone for.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the suitcase, vision swimming. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. The weight of this moment crushed her chest, made her lungs useless.</p><p>“Rio—please.” Her voice was raw, whispering through cracked lips. “Please, just listen to me. Let me explain. It’s not what you think. I didn’t do anything. I never—”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flared as she turned on her heel “Don’t,” she snapped. “Don’t insult me..”</p><p>She could barely breathe, let alone speak. “Rio, please,” Agatha whispered, her voice hoarse and raw from the hours of crying. “Can’t we talk? Can’t you just hear me out? This is all Wanda's doing! You have to know I didn’t—”</p><p>Rio's head snapped up, her face hardening. “No,” she interrupted sharply, her voice harsh. “I know exactly what’s been happening, Agatha. You’ve been lying to me this entire time.”</p><p>“Rio, no, I haven’t!” Agatha’s breath hitched, her hands shaking as she reached out, but Rio stepped back. “I haven’t been lying to you. Wandas setting this up, she made you think things that aren’t true—”</p><p>“And you have nothing to do with it right?” Rio’s voice rose just a notch, a trembling undercurrent surfacing beneath the calm. “I’m not stupid, Agatha. You think just because you’re some high-powered fixer with a smile and a silver tongue, you can twist this too?”</p><p>Agatha recoiled like she’d been slapped, the accusation reverberating through her. Her lips parted, but no sound came out. She had nothing left to say that wouldn’t sound like another carefully crafted line.</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, and the look she gave Agatha felt like a punch in the gut. “You really think I can’t see what you’ve done? You cheated on me, Agatha. And now you’re trying to cover your tracks. You’re a professional fixer, this is what you do.”</p><p>Agatha recoiled, her chest tight, her mind spinning with the force of Rio’s words. It felt like being slapped again and again, each word more brutal than the last. She opened her mouth to protest, but Rio wasn’t done.</p><p>“I should have known,” Rio muttered bitterly, more to herself than to Agatha. “I should have known you were too perfect. That it was all just some game. I was just a fool to believe in you, to think I could trust you.”</p><p>Her voice broke as she said it, the sharp pain in her words punctuating the hollow space between them. “Like I said last night, your mom was right. You can’t love anyone. You never could. And I’ve been an idiot to think otherwise.”</p><p>Rio’s composure faltered just slightly—just enough for her voice to crack at the edges. “God, I was so stupid. I believed in you. I loved you.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha breathed, tears spilling freely now. “I do love you. I didn’t cheat on you, I didn’t—Rio, please—”</p><p>“You don’t know how to love.” Rio’s words came out quietly, like a final verdict. “You only know how to survive. And love doesn’t survive with someone like you. It gets consumed.”</p><p>Silence fell between them like ash after a fire. The finality in Rio’s voice was like a knife twisting deeper into Agatha’s heart. Agatha’s legs felt weak beneath her, her breath shallow and erratic.</p><p>The weight of the betrayal, the weight of losing Rio — it crushed her, suffocated her.</p><p>And then, Rio gave her one last cold, cutting glance. “Take your things. Your phone and cards are in the side zip. Go. I don’t want you here anymore. Just go.”</p><p>It was the dismissal. The last nail in the coffin.<br/>Agatha stood there, frozen, as Rio turned and walked away, disappearing back into the apartment building. The slam of the door behind her echoed in Agatha’s ears like a gunshot. She hadn’t even gotten a chance to beg — to fix it, to make Rio believe her.</p><p>She stood for a moment longer, the suitcase still sitting tauntingly in the open boot, the weight of the world pressing down on her chest. Then, mechanically, she moved to the trunk of the Maserati, closing the car, each motion robotic, each second more numbing than the last.</p><p>Hours later, Agatha’s mind was a blur of fragmented thoughts. The car engine hummed as she drove through the city streets, trying to outrun the hollow ache in her chest. She drove without any destination in mind, only knowing she needed to get away, to find somewhere — anyone — who could give her a sliver of understanding.</p><p>Her fingers gripped the wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white. The tears had stopped. She felt like there was no more room in her for them. No more room in her for anything.</p><p>Her heart had found the only place it remembered as safe. The building stood quietly. She barely remembered parking. Her body moved on instinct, one step at a time, until she stood before the door. Her hand trembled as she knocked—three soft, brittle taps.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>And there was Lilia — her best friend, her lifeline.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened the moment she saw Agatha standing there, broken, hollow. Without a word, she pulled Agatha into her arms, and Agatha crumpled.</p><p>“Agatha,” she whispered, voice thick with worry. “Sweetheart, what happened?”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t answer. Her mouth opened but no words came—only a choking sob that tore from her throat like a scream swallowed too late.</p><p>Lilia pulled her inside without waiting, guiding her gently to the couch. Agatha clutched at her like she was the only solid thing left in the universe, her hands shaking, tears soaking through the fabric of Lilia’s cardigan.</p><p>“I need you, Lilia,” she whispered through sobs, clutching Lilia’s shirt with desperate hands.</p><p>Lilia said nothing, just held her tighter, running a soothing hand over her back as Agatha’s body shook uncontrollably. It felt like a dam had broken inside of her — the walls she had kept up for so long, the strength she had clung to, it all shattered in an instant.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Lilia whispered softly, her voice a balm to Agatha’s wounded soul. “It’s okay. I’ve got you.”</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t stop. The sobs racked her body, painful and primal, as she finally told Lilia everything — about Wanda, about Rio, about the lies, the betrayal, and the crushing weight of everything that had happened.</p><p>Between sobs, Agatha managed to explain the restraining order, the break-in, the lies that had unraveled everything. Lilia’s expression shifted between anger and concern, but she said nothing, just listened, providing Agatha with the one thing she had craved more than anything — someone who believed her.</p><p>When Agatha finished speaking, her voice was raw, barely above a whisper. “I don’t know who I am anymore, Lilia. I don’t know how to fix this.”</p><p>Lilia’s hand gently cupped her face, pulling Agatha’s tear-streaked face up to meet her gaze.</p><p>“You don’t have to fix anything right now. We’ll get through this together. You’re not alone, Agatha. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha could only nod, her body trembling, her heart still broken, but for the first time in what felt like forever, she didn’t feel completely lost.</p><p>“I tried,” Agatha gasped eventually, her voice raw, trembling. “I tried, Lilia. I told her everything—Wanda, the restraining order, the break-in—everything. But she still thinks I—” Her voice cracked, her face twisting in pain. “She thinks I cheated. She thinks I lied.”</p><p>Lilia said nothing, just rubbed soothing circles into her back, grounding her.</p><p>Agatha shook her head violently, curling in on herself. “She said this whole thing was a setup to cover my tracks. And then—” She broke off, another sob ripping through her.</p><p>Lilia leaned closer, voice gentle. “What did she say, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her hands, as if she no longer recognized them. Her voice was hollow now. “She said... maybe my mother was right about me.”</p><p>Lilia froze.</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled, eyes going distant. “She said maybe I can’t love. That I just pretend—that I don’t even know how.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, and when she looked at Lilia, her eyes were full of something ancient. Something wounded and bottomless. “My mother was right wasn’t she.”</p><p>Lilia’s breath hitched.</p><p>“She used to look at me like I ruined her life just by being born,” Agatha said softly, as if remembering from a place far away. “She said I born evil. That I’d destroy everything I touched. I spent years trying to unhear that.” She blinked rapidly, her face crumpling. “But Rio thinks that too….”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” Lilia murmured, pulling her in again, this time with both arms holding her tighter than before. “No. No, love, no. That’s not who you are.”</p><p>Agatha buried her face in her shoulder. “Then why does everyone I love turn on me? Or see the worst in me, even when I’m trying so hard to do everything right?”</p><p>“Because people fail,” Lilia said softly but firmly. “Even the ones we think are ours. Especially them, sometimes. But their failure isn’t a mirror. It doesn’t define you.”</p><p>“She didn’t even hesitate, Lilia,” Agatha sobbed. “All Wanda had to do was send a video, and Rio was done with me.”</p><p>“You gave her the truth,” Lilia said. “You gave her love. She chose to believe a lie. That’s not on you.”</p><p>“But what if it is?” Agatha whispered. “What if I’m the problem? What if she’s right?”</p><p>Lilia gently held Agatha’s face in her hands, forcing her to meet her gaze. “Listen to me, Agatha. Your mother was cruel. And Rio—whether out of pain or fear—chose to echo that cruelty. But you? You are not unlovable. You are not some broken soul incapable of feeling.” Her voice cracked with emotion now. “You are full of love. Even when the world gives you every reason not to be. Even now, after all this.”</p><p>Agatha’s tears fell faster, her breathing sharp and ragged. “I don’t know how I’ll ever come back from this.”</p><p>“You don’t have to know,” Lilia whispered. “You only have to let me be here with you. That’s it. One breath at a time. We’ll find your way back.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond—not in words. But she collapsed again into Lilia’s arms, her body still shaking, her heart still shattered.</p><p>Days passed in a haze for Agatha. Time didn’t seem to move forward, it simply stretched and pulled in every direction, suffocating her under its weight. After that night, when she had finally allowed herself to break down, she had managed to gather enough strength to take one more step — though it felt more like a crawl.</p><p>Lilia had insisted, with quiet but unshakable certainty, that Agatha needed to go back to the police. The idea terrified her. But there was no choice. Wanda wasn’t going to stop. Wanda was watching, waiting, and Agatha couldn’t let this thing — this nightmare — destroy anymore of her life.</p><p>So, after days of sitting in silence, staring at the walls of Lilia’s guest room, unable to escape the dark thoughts that ran through her mind like a broken record, Agatha had made the call.</p><p>She returned to the police station, every step heavier than the last, feeling like she was walking through wet cement. The officer she’d spoken to before greeted her kindly — too kindly — like they were all used to hearing horror stories like hers, but Agatha couldn’t find the strength to care about how professional they were. She needed this. She needed to do something.</p><p>She sat in the small interview room, her hands gripping the edges of the chair until her knuckles ached. The officer, a woman with short brown hair and a kind face, sat across from her, taking notes, her pen scratching against the paper like a metronome counting the seconds of Agatha’s misery.</p><p>“I’m afraid you’re not going to like what I’m about to tell you,” the officer said gently, looking up at Agatha, her eyes filled with pity.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. She braced herself, but she didn’t speak, just nodded. What else was there to say? Nothing had been normal since Wanda had come into her life. Nothing would ever be normal again.</p><p>The officer took a deep breath. “We’ve pulled up Wanda Maximoff’s records,” she began. “It turns out she has a history. A serious history.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. “What do you mean?” she asked, her voice strained. Her throat felt tight, as if the air had thickened with the gravity of the situation.</p><p>The officer set down her pen and leaned forward slightly, her expression solemn. “Wanda Maximoff has a documented history of obsessive behavior. She was admitted to a mental institution several years ago after a series of incidents just like what you've described. Stalking, harassment, manipulation, and even physical aggression. The facility was a private one — she was discharged after a few months, but...” The officer paused, and the silence felt like a suffocating force.<br/>“...but she was never truly cured. In fact, it seems she was released under the assumption that she was stable enough to integrate back into society, but based on our records, that stability clearly didn’t last long.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, the knowledge of what Wanda had done before crashing down on her.<br/>She tried to breathe through the wave of nausea, but it clung to her, cold and thick.</p><p>“So... I’m not being crazy?” Agatha asked, her voice barely above a whisper. The question had been clawing at her since the first day Wanda had appeared, her strange obsession twisting everything Agatha thought she knew about her own reality.</p><p>The officer shook her head. “No, Agatha. You weren’t. This is her pattern. You were just... unlucky enough to be the focus of it.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, letting the truth sink in, the crushing weight of her reality settling over her. She hadn’t done anything wrong. She hadn’t caused this. It wasn’t her fault. But that didn’t make it easier to bear. Wanda wasn’t just some girl with a crush. She wasn’t just a stalker. Wanda had a history of this — a deep, twisted obsession that had driven her to hurt other people before. And now, Agatha was the one paying the price.</p><p>The officer finished taking notes, then stood up, offering Agatha a small but reassuring smile. “We’ll do what we can to help. You’re not alone in this.”</p><p>But Agatha’s mind was already elsewhere — the dread pooling in her stomach, the thought that no matter how much she tried, no matter how much she hoped, Wanda would never stop. She was always there, lurking in the shadows, watching.</p><p>Back at Lilia’s home, Agatha sat in the same spot she had for the past few days, staring out the window. The view of the garden below was now just a blur to her. Her phone sat on the coffee table, still silent. Rio had blocked her number — and Agatha couldn’t blame her. She’d tried still, messages and voicemails, trying to pull her love back from the dark pit it had descended into.</p><p>She knew Rio would never believe her, even after everything.</p><p>Her phone buzzed suddenly, pulling her from her thoughts. It was a message from Tony and Pepper. It was short, just a single line: “Take the time you need. Don’t worry about the office. We’ve got everything covered.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the message for a long time, her mind fogged and distant. Work? She couldn’t focus on work right now. Hell, she couldn’t focus on anything.</p><p>“Maybe some time off will help,” Lilia had suggested gently the day before. She had insisted that Agatha take the time to heal. But how could she heal? How could she go back to any semblance of a normal life when everything had been ripped away from her so suddenly?</p><p>A sob caught in her throat, and she pressed a hand to her mouth, trying to stifle the overwhelming rush of grief. She had never felt so small, so powerless, so utterly alone. Rio was gone. She had lost the love of her life because of lies and a woman who had twisted everything.</p><p>And now, Wanda was still there — still stalking her, still hovering on the periphery of her existence.</p><p>A soft knock on the door interrupted her spiral. She didn’t move, just stared at the door, knowing exactly who it was.</p><p>Lilia entered without waiting for Agatha’s response, her face soft with concern. “Do you want to talk?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Agatha nodded, but no words came. She just sat there, broken, trembling with the weight of it all.</p><p>Lilia’s hand found hers, warm and steady. “You don’t have to go through this alone,” Lilia whispered. “I’m here.”</p><p>And for the first time in days, Agatha felt a spark of something — maybe not hope, but humanity. Maybe she wasn’t as alone as she had feared.</p><p>The nights felt too long, filled with the silent whispers of her mind — the same loop of painful thoughts playing on repeat: Why didn’t Rio believe me? Why did she think I could betray her? I didn’t do anything wrong.</p><p>She would lay in Lilia’s guest room, eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling, her body aching from the emotional weight pressing down on her chest. The sound of her own heartbeat was deafening in the silence. Each thump a reminder of everything that had crumbled — her relationship with Rio, her trust in herself, and now, the suffocating fear of Wanda.</p><p>Wanda hadn’t stopped. She never did. Every morning when Agatha woke up, it felt like the world was a little more twisted, a little more suffocating. The days blurred into a haze of fear, anxiety, and unrelenting dread. It was like a dark cloud hung over her every step.</p><p>She couldn’t escape Wanda’s presence, no matter how far she ran.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in the middle of the night again.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped as she saw the name on the screen: Unknown Caller. The calls that had started her first night at Lilias. She didn’t pick up. She never did. But the fear was always there, gnawing at her, knowing Wanda was lurking — somewhere, somehow, still trying to break through every barrier Agatha had erected.</p><p>The constant stress, the sleepless nights, the weight of everything... it all began to take its toll on Agatha. She found herself zoning out— no longer able to focus, no longer able to find the same passion she once had.</p><p>But what hurt the most was how she found herself missing Rio. She hadn’t spoken to her in over a week. Rio’s social media accounts were now set to private, and Agatha had been left in the dark, left to twist in the wake of Rio’s abandonment. She missed the sound of Rio’s laugh, the softness of her touch, the way Rio had made her feel safe. Agatha had never thought Rio could turn on her, never thought that her jealousy would cloud the reality of their love.</p><p>But Rio had believed Wanda. She had chosen to believe the lies that Wanda had spun, rather than trust the woman she had loved for three years.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t make sense of it. She couldn’t understand how, after everything they had been through, Rio could walk away so easily — as if all those memories, all the shared moments of affection, meant nothing.</p><p>Why didn’t you trust me, Rio?</p><p>How could Rio believe Wanda’s lies when she had known Agatha’s heart for so long?</p><p>One night, lying in bed at Lilia’s place, Agatha couldn’t shake the thought. It gnawed at her, her chest tight with a constant, aching emptiness. As the hours slipped by in the dead of night, Agatha finally broke — tears spilling from her eyes, hot and sharp, as the reality of it all washed over her. Rio had believed Wanda’s lies, had let jealousy and insecurity overshadow everything they had built together.</p><p>She had been faithful. She had loved Rio with every fiber of her being. And now, all that was gone. All because of Wanda.</p><p>The sickening feeling that Wanda was watching her every move — it was unbearable.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, trying to drown out the thoughts, the memories of Rio.</p><p>The following morning, Agatha barely had the energy to leave the bed. She made her way to the kitchen, still bleary-eyed and exhausted, the weight of the sleepless nights pulling at her. Her phone buzzed again — another unknown number. She didn’t answer. But the message that followed was enough to send a cold shiver through her veins.</p><p>“She never deserved you. I always knew we were meant to be together. You’re the only one who truly understands me, Agatha. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I’m here for you. Always.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the phone, her hands trembling. She didn’t know what was more disturbing — the fact that Wanda had managed to get her private number and was still sending these messages or the way they made Agatha feel sick to her core.</p><p>She had to keep it together. She had to stay strong for herself. But the mounting pressure was too much. Her emotions felt like a dam ready to burst.</p><p>Lilia had noticed the change in Agatha, the way she had become more withdrawn, more anxious. She had been a silent presence through it all, offering comfort when she could. But Agatha knew she couldn’t keep hiding, couldn’t keep pushing everything down like it was just going to magically go away.</p><p>She had to confront it. She had to do something.<br/>“I can’t keep doing this,” Agatha said, voice shaking as she sat across from Lilia, her hands clenched tightly in her lap. “I can’t keep pretending like everything is fine. It’s not. Wanda won’t stop. She’s everywhere. I can’t even breathe without feeling like she’s watching me.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened, her expression full of concern. “We’re going to figure this out, Agatha. You’re not alone.”</p><p>But deep down, Agatha didn’t know if anyone could help. She didn’t know if anything would ever stop Wanda from getting what she wanted. The woman’s obsession was like a force of nature, unrelenting and cruel.</p><p>And then it happened. When Agatha returned to Lilia’s home after a long, draining day of debriefing Tony and Pepper and organising another week away from work, the feeling of dread settled over her like a weight. It was so thick, so overwhelming, that she couldn’t shake it.</p><p>When she unlocked the door, she froze.</p><p>On the kitchen counter, there was a single red rose.</p><p>The note attached read simply, “You’ll see. We’re meant to be together.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach churned as she stood there, motionless. The message, the rose, it was all too much. Wanda was watching. Wanda was closer than she had ever been.</p><p>And Agatha had no idea how to escape it.</p>

<p>The situation was spiraling beyond both Lilias and Agatha’s control. Every day that passed seemed to stretch Agathas sanity thinner, each moment tainted by the feeling that Wanda was one step ahead, always watching, always lurking, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>It had become clear to Lilia that something needed to be done. The police had been involved, but the lack of concrete evidence kept them from taking drastic action, and that sense of helplessness had been eating away at Agatha’s already fragile state.</p><p>Lilia could see it. She could see how Agatha was withering. Her vibrant, intelligent friend had become a shell of the woman she once was. The light in her eyes had dimmed, replaced by a haunted look that spoke volumes about the terror she had been living with. The steady, confident consultant had become a shadow of herself — someone who flinched at every unknown sound, who could barely hold a conversation without breaking down. And it wasn’t just Agatha. Lilia could feel the weight of it pressing on her too — the helplessness, the suffocating uncertainty.</p><p>But there was something she could do.</p><p>That afternoon, after yet another agonizing conversation with Agatha about her heartbreak that devolved into tears, Lilia decided to take matters into her own hands. She knew Rio still loved Agatha, despite what had happened. Her jealousy and Wandas lies had clouded Rio's judgment, but deep down, Lilia believed Rio had to understand the truth.</p><p>She drove straight to what was now Rio’s apartment, hoping that she could reason with her, even if it meant facing the raw emotions and pain that still lingered between them. The thought of confronting Rio was hard. Lilia was disgusted by her reaction, but she couldn’t stand by and watch Agatha continue to deteriorate.</p><p>When she arrived at Rio's apartment, she was met with a silence that felt almost suffocating. Rio answered the door, looking disheveled, her eyes bloodshot as if she hadn’t slept in days. Her gaze was distant, her face pale, and Lilia could see the raw anguish in her expression.</p><p>"Rio," Lilia said, her voice gentle but firm. "I need you to listen to me. Please."</p><p>Rio blinked, and for a moment, she looked like she might turn away. But then her shoulders slumped, and she stepped aside, allowing Lilia to enter. The apartment was in disarray. Clothes were scattered across the floor, dishes piled up in the sink. It was clear Rio hadn’t been taking care of herself, too consumed by her own heartbreak, her own emotions, to focus on anything else.</p><p>Lilia sat down across from her on the couch, taking a steadying breath before speaking. “I know you're hurting, Rio. I know you’ve been deceived by Wanda, but you have to understand — Agatha isn’t the one at fault here.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lilia held up her hand. “Let me finish,” she said quietly. “I’ve known Agatha for over a decade, and she’s one of the most loving, faithful people I’ve ever met. You think she cheated on you, that she betrayed your trust - I can categorically say she didn’t. Wanda has been playing you, manipulating you. She’s been stalking Agatha, lying to you, and now she's twisted everything around.”</p><p>Lilia paused for a moment, her own voice thick with emotion. "You’ve haven’t seen how Agatha is now. How broken she’s become. She barely sleeps. She’s a shadow of herself. You’ve helped take the woman she was, the woman you loved, and turned her into someone unrecognisable, all because of lies."</p><p>Rio’s face contorted with disbelief, and Lilia could see the cracks forming in her composure. She clenched her fists, her lips trembling. “I didn’t want to believe it. I couldn’t... I couldn’t imagine Agatha would hurt me. But the video, the messages...”</p><p>“Those were all lies,” Lilia interrupted, her voice more urgent now. “Wanda fabricated those. She’s been manipulating you this whole time. She’s not some innocent person. She’s dangerous, Rio. Agatha is terrified of her.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes filled with tears as she looked away. “I didn’t... I didn’t know. I thought— I thought I was losing her.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said softly, her heart aching slightly for Rio too. “But you’ve been pushing her away, believing something that wasn’t true. Agatha loves you. She always has.”</p><p>Rio’s face crumpled as she started to cry. “I never wanted to hurt her. I just... I just didn’t understand.”</p><p>Lilia stayed with her for a while longer, letting Rio cry it out, listening as Rio spoke of her insecurities, the overwhelming jealousy that had poisoned her thoughts. It was a raw conversation, filled with the kind of pain that only comes from realizing you’ve made a terrible mistake. But as the conversation wore on, something shifted in Rio. She slowly began to see the truth of what had been happening, and the guilt of her actions started to take root.</p><p>"I... I need to make things right," Rio whispered, her voice shaking. "I need to apologize to her. I need to tell her I believe her."</p><p>Lilia gave a soft nod, her own throat tight with emotion. "Come on," she said gently, reaching for Rio’s hand. "Let’s go see her. She’s staying at my place. You can talk to her there."</p><p>For the first time in days, Rio felt a fragile thread of hope pulling at her chest. She wasn’t sure if she could ever undo the hurt she had caused, but she knew she had to try. Agatha had loved her through everything — all the insecurities, all the fear — and Rio had thrown it all away because she hadn’t trusted that love. She deserved to hear how sorry I am, Rio thought, even if she never forgives me.</p><p>Together, Rio and Lilia hurried toward the car, neither of them realizing that time was already slipping away — that something unspeakable had already happened while they sat talking, oblivious.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Wanda had been watching, waiting, and when she saw Lilia leave, she acted.</p><p>It hadn’t been difficult. She knew the security codes. She knew the layout. She had been inside before — unseen, undetected.</p><p>The house was dark when Wanda slipped inside, moving like a shadow through the hallway, her breath slow and deliberate. She could hear Agatha moving around the kitchen — soft, weary footsteps — completely unaware of the danger closing in around her.</p><p>Wanda’s heart pounded with anticipation. Mine, she thought. She’ll finally be mine.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear the first creak of the floorboard, but she heard the second — the wrongness of it making the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She turned toward the hall, heart stuttering in her chest.</p><p>"Wanda," Agatha whispered, her voice cracking.<br/>Before she could even think to run, Wanda was on her.</p><p>It was brutal. Violent.</p><p>Agatha fought, clawing, kicking, struggling with everything she had, her adrenaline flooding her veins. She managed to land a hit — her elbow connecting sharply with Wanda’s face — and there was a spray of blood. Wanda snarled, grabbing a heavy glass vase from the table and smashing it into Agatha’s temple.</p><p>The world tilted.</p><p>The sharp crack of pain lit up Agatha’s skull, and she collapsed to the ground, dazed. Blood trickled down the side of her head, warm and sticky. Wanda crouched over her, breathing hard, eyes wild with furious devotion.</p><p>"You’re coming with me," Wanda hissed, her voice trembling with emotion. "We’re leaving all of this behind. You’ll see. You’ll love me once you understand."</p><p>Agatha tried to scream, but Wanda pressed a hand over her mouth, dragging her limp body toward the door. Agatha kicked weakly, but the world around her was swimming, black spots clouding her vision.</p><p>The last thing she saw before darkness fully claimed her was the overturned kitchen chair, the shattered glass, the smear of her own blood across the tiled floor.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio and Lilia pulled into the driveway of Lilia’s house, Rio’s heart pounding with nervous hope. She could already imagine it — walking inside, seeing Agatha’s beautiful face, maybe broken but still there, still waiting for her. She would fall at her knees if she had to. She would do anything to fix what she had broken.<br/>She unlocked the door quickly, her hands shaking.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio called softly, stepping into the entryway.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>A terrible, cold feeling swept through her.</p><p>"Agatha?" Lilia called this time, louder, urgency sharpening her tone.</p><p>They stepped into the kitchen — and froze.</p><p>The room was in complete disarray. Chairs knocked over. Shattered glass littering the floor. A trail of red across the tiles — stark against the pale stone. Blood.</p><p>Rio’s hand flew to her mouth as she stumbled backward in shock. "No," she whispered. "No, no, no—"</p><p>Lilia moved forward, more cautiously, her sharp mind trying to process the scene even as her own heart raced with panic. Her eyes followed the faint trail leading toward the back door, which now hung ajar, the lock broken.</p><p>Agatha was gone.</p><p>The house was silent, the only sound their ragged breathing, and the faint, swinging creak of the broken door in the air.</p><p>Rio turned to Lilia, her face crumpling in horror. "She’s gone. Oh my God, she’s gone—"</p><p>Lilia grabbed her phone with trembling fingers, already dialing the police. "We have to find her," she said, her voice shaking with fury and fear. "We have to find her before Wanda does something we can't undo."</p><p>As she pressed the phone to her ear, Rio dropped to her knees amid the broken glass, her fingers curling into her hair as she let out a heart-wrenching sob — the full weight of her mistakes crashing down on her all at once.</p><p>And somewhere, wherever Wanda had taken her, Agatha was alone, terrified, and still bleeding.</p><p>The police arrived within minutes, lights flashing blue and red against the walls of Lilia’s home, their radios crackling with clipped urgency. Lilia and Rio were separated immediately, officers moving methodically through the house, taking photographs of the broken glass, the bloodstains, the shattered vase. Everything felt surreal — the house, the night air, the horrifying emptiness where Agatha should have been.</p><p>Rio sat numbly on the edge of the couch, her hands trembling uncontrollably in her lap. She could barely register the questions the officer was asking her — her mind kept replaying the last few days over and over in agonizing detail.</p><p>How had it come to this?</p><p>You did this, a cruel voice inside her whispered. You doubted her. You left her vulnerable.</p><p>She answered the officer's questions in a monotone, telling them everything — about the restraining order, about Wanda’s stalking, about the messages, the video. Her voice cracked when she admitted that she had believed Wanda over Agatha, that she had accused Agatha of things she never would have done.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio whispered hoarsely, mostly to herself. "I'm so sorry..."</p><p>Across the room, Lilia spoke sharply with a senior officer, demanding they escalate the case — that they understand how truly dangerous Wanda Maximoff was.</p><p>"She’s mentally unstable," Lilia said, her voice low and furious. "You don’t understand — this isn't just harassment anymore. She’s kidnapped her. She’s hurt her."</p><p>One of the detectives, a tall woman with sharp eyes, stepped forward, holding a thin file. “We’ve pulled Maximoff’s records,” she said. “She has a history of psychiatric institutionalization. Several years ago, she was admitted for obsessive behaviors... towards another woman.” The detective paused, her face grim. “It ended badly.”</p><p>Rio felt her blood turn to ice.</p><p>“She’s done this before?” she choked out.</p><p>The detective nodded. “The last victim barely survived. You’re partner took the early steps of reporting everything. Stalking cases however are difficult, alot of  people don’t get believed until it’s too late.”</p><p>Rio’s vision blurred with tears. Agatha had done everything right. She had gone to the police. She had gotten a restraining order. She had taken precautions.</p><p>And still, she had lost everything.</p><p>Because you didn’t trust her, Rio thought miserably. She remembered Agatha’s silent tears as she stood there and took all the blame, all the screaming, and it physically hurt to know she had been so wrong — that the woman who had loved her without question was now missing, hurt, possibly worse, because Rio had allowed Wanda to slip between them like poison.</p><p>Lilia came to stand beside her, placing a steadying hand on Rio’s back. "We're going to find her," she said fiercely. "No matter what it takes."</p><p>But Rio wasn't sure she could ever forgive herself — even if they did.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the city, Agatha drifted in and out of consciousness, her world a spinning, disjointed nightmare of cold concrete and blinding fluorescent lights.</p><p>Her head throbbed violently, every pulse of blood sending a sickening wave of pain through her skull. She tried to open her eyes fully but the room swam around her, everything blurring at the edges. She was dimly aware of the fact she was tied to a chair, her wrists raw where the ropes bit into her skin.</p><p>And then she heard her.</p><p>Wanda’s voice, low and frantic, coming from just a few feet away.</p><p>"Wake up," Wanda whispered, her tone switching between desperate and furious. "Come on, Aggie, open those beautiful eyes for me."</p><p>Agatha whimpered softly, the sound escaping her without meaning to. Her mind felt sluggish, uncooperative, as she tried to move, tried to understand.</p><p>Wanda’s patience shattered like glass.</p><p>"You’re ruining everything!" Wanda shrieked, her voice bouncing off the small, windowless walls of the room. In a fit of rage, she grabbed Agatha by the front of her blouse and shook her, hard, causing Agatha’s head to loll limply against the back of the chair.</p><p>Tears burned at Wanda’s eyes — a twisted mirror of love and hatred. She dropped Agatha roughly, pacing back and forth across the room like a caged animal.</p><p>"This isn’t how it was supposed to be," Wanda muttered to herself, clawing at her hair. "You’re supposed to wake up and see! You’re supposed to love me!"</p><p>Agatha stirred slightly, a weak, pained sound leaving her lips, and Wanda fell to her knees beside her instantly, stroking her blood-matted hair with trembling fingers.</p><p>"There you are," Wanda cooed, her voice going soft again, as if her rage hadn’t just burst free a moment ago. "It’s okay. Don’t worry, my love. You’re safe with me now. Nothing can hurt you anymore. Not anyone."</p><p>Agatha tried to focus on her face, tried to summon the strength to fight, but her body betrayed her. Every movement felt like wading through wet cement. Her heart beat weakly against the ropes, terror thick in her chest.<br/>She wanted to scream. She wanted to run.</p><p>But all she could do was pray someone — anyone — would come find her before it was too late.</p>

<p>The fluorescent light above Agatha flickered and buzzed, casting long shadows across the room. Hours blurred into an endless stretch of pain and confusion. Agatha’s head lolled weakly against her shoulder, the blood drying stickily at her temple. Her wrists were raw, her skin clammy, her breathing shallow. Every part of her ached.<br/>She could hear Wanda moving around — pacing, muttering under her breath in a low, frantic rhythm. The sharp scrape of furniture being dragged across the concrete floor echoed around the empty space.</p><p>Reality was slipping further and further from Agatha’s grasp, but even in her haze, she could feel it: the storm brewing in Wanda, growing more violent with every minute Agatha didn’t conform to the fantasy Wanda had built in her mind.</p><p>"You’re supposed to be better by now," Wanda hissed from the far side of the room. Her voice cracked with barely contained rage. "You’re supposed to wake up and smile at me. Tell me you love me. Tell me you chose me."</p><p>Agatha let out a faint, incoherent moan — her head throbbing mercilessly with every small noise. The injury from earlier, the head wound, was doing more damage than Wanda realized.</p><p>Agatha's skin had taken on a worrying pallor, and her responses were slowing, her consciousness slipping deeper into darkness.</p><p>Wanda spun around, her hands trembling. She stomped back toward Agatha, grabbing her chin roughly and forcing Agatha’s vacant, glassy eyes to meet hers.</p><p>"Look at me!" she screamed. "Look at me, Agatha! Say something!"</p><p>Agatha whimpered — a broken, wordless sound — and that was all.</p><p>Something inside Wanda snapped. With a feral scream of frustration, she backhanded Agatha hard across the face. The force of it snapped Agatha’s head to the side, blood smearing across her already bruised cheek.</p><p>Agatha sagged in the chair, her body going slack. She wasn’t unconscious — not fully — but she was dangerously close.</p><p>Wanda immediately recoiled, staring in horror at what she'd done. "No, no, no..." she whimpered, falling to her knees again. "I'm sorry, baby, I'm so sorry. I just... I get upset when you don't see me. When you don't understand."</p><p>She cradled Agatha’s battered face between her palms with a sickening tenderness, rocking slightly. Agatha didn’t even have the strength to flinch away.</p><p>Meanwhile, the city had become a hive of police activity.</p><p>Detectives worked late into the night, radios squawking with urgent bulletins. BOLOs — Be On the Look Out orders — were issued for Wanda Maximoff. Her photograph was distributed to every patrol unit, her car’s plates flagged in every system. Airports, bus stations, and train terminals were all put on high alert.</p><p>Every second counted now.</p><p>At Lilia’s house, Rio paced relentlessly across the floor, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as if trying to hold her own body together.</p><p>She listened numbly as the lead detective filled them in.</p><p>“We believe Wanda has moved Agatha somewhere isolated,” the detective said grimly. “Given her mental state and past behavior, her obsession could escalate into violence if it hasn’t already.”</p><p>Rio's knees gave out, and she sank into a chair, her face pale with horror.</p><p>"She's hurt, isn't she?" Rio whispered hoarsely. "She was bleeding when we found the house... she's hurt."</p><p>The detective didn’t sugarcoat it. "Given the evidence, yes. And the longer she's missing, the worse the outcome tends to be in cases like this."</p><p>Rio closed her eyes tightly, guilt crushing her chest until she could barely breathe.</p><p>Agatha had been brave. Agatha had tried to protect herself — and Rio had failed her. She had let her jealousy, her own broken insecurities, blind her to the truth until it was too late.</p><p>You have to find her, Rio thought, a fierce scream in her mind. You have to.</p><p>Back in the darkened room, Wanda wiped Agatha’s bloody lip with trembling fingers, humming a soft, tuneless lullaby under her breath.</p><p>Agatha stirred slightly, her broken body trying feebly to respond — some instinct buried deep inside her refusing to give up, to let go.</p><p>But her body was losing the battle faster than her mind could keep up. She needed medical attention. Soon.</p><p>Or she wasn’t going to survive.</p><p>And still, Wanda stayed beside her, whispering promises of a perfect life together — promises that Agatha couldn’t even hear through the heavy fog of pain.</p><p>Time was running out.</p><p>The air in the room grew heavier by the minute, thick with the stench of fear and something sharper — blood, sweat, desperation.</p><p>Wanda sat cross-legged on the floor now, just a few feet away from Agatha, her red hair tangled around her face, her nails chewed to the quick. Her green eyes, once bright with a manic sort of adoration, were now dark, hollow, feral.</p><p>She was muttering to herself — low, broken strings of words — as she stared at Agatha’s still, slumped form.</p><p>“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be... this isn’t how it’s supposed to be...” she whispered over and over, rocking slightly, the rope burn from where she had tied Agatha staining the floor with tiny, dark marks.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t made a sound in nearly an hour.</p><p>Her breathing was shallow, and her skin was growing frighteningly cold to the touch. Wanda had tried to rouse her again — slapping her cheeks gently at first, then harder when Agatha didn’t respond — but nothing worked.</p><p>The injury to her head, the dehydration, the trauma — all of it was dragging Agatha further away.</p><p>Panic started to claw up Wanda’s throat.</p><p>"No, no, no..." Wanda whimpered, crawling toward Agatha on her hands and knees. She shook her lightly, her voice cracking with terror. "Stay with me, Aggie. Please, baby, please. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just needed you to see. I just needed you to choose me."</p><p>Agatha’s head lolled to the side again, her lips parting slightly as she gave a faint, barely-there exhale.</p><p>Wanda’s panic morphed into rage. She recoiled, stumbling backward until she hit the wall, grabbing fistfuls of her own hair. Her screams were silent at first — mouth open, chest heaving — before they tore free from her throat, raw and ragged.</p><p>"I did everything for you!" she howled at Agatha’s limp form. "I gave up everything! And you still love her instead of me! Even after she threw you away!"</p><p>Her fists slammed into the wall, once, twice, three times, until blood splattered across the paint. She gasped for breath, her entire body trembling with fury and grief.</p><p>Wanda pressed her forehead against the wall, sobbing brokenly. "I’ll fix this," she whispered. "I’ll make you love me. Even if it’s the last thing I do."</p><p>She turned around slowly, her face twisted into something unrecognizable — something monstrous — and stalked back toward Agatha.<br/>Her mind fractured in real time, splitting into sharp, splintering pieces.</p><p>In one breath, she was tender — brushing Agatha’s hair back from her forehead, murmuring endearments.</p><p>In the next, she was violent — gripping Agatha’s jaw too tightly, shaking her hard enough to rattle her broken body, screaming in her face for attention, for love that wouldn’t come.</p><p>The cycles of madness spun faster and faster, the violence bleeding more heavily into the tenderness until they were indistinguishable.</p><p>And all the while, Agatha slipped further away — body failing, mind fading — caught in the crosshairs of a fantasy she could never survive.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the city, police scanners buzzed with new urgency. Patrol cars crisscrossed the streets. Detectives traced every tip, every flicker of a lead. Wanda’s face was plastered across every precinct bulletin board.</p><p>But she had vanished into the city’s cracks, a ghost driven by obsession.</p><p>The night was thick and humid, pressing down over the city like a heavy blanket. The police precinct was a hive of tense energy, phones ringing, radios crackling. Rio sat rigid in a chair, her fingers digging into her thighs, every nerve stretched taut like wire. She hadn’t slept. She couldn’t.</p><p>And then — a break.</p><p>One of the officers came rushing in, his face alight with urgency. "We’ve got a hit on Maximoff!" he barked. "Pharmacy on West 19th — she was caught on the security cameras buying medical supplies. Gauze, antiseptics, heavy-duty painkillers."</p><p>The room snapped to life, officers grabbing radios, shouting coordinates. Rio stood so fast the world tilted for a second.</p><p>"Was she alone?" she demanded, her voice rough.</p><p>The officer nodded grimly. "Alone. Paid in cash. In and out in less than five minutes."</p><p>Lilia was at her side a second later. "You have to move now," she said sharply. "Before she disappears again."</p><p>The detectives agreed. Within minutes, unmarked cars were flooding the nearby blocks, a perimeter forming around the area. But the city was vast — and Wanda was desperate.</p><p>Inside the darkened room, the atmosphere had turned violent, suffocating.</p><p>Wanda was spiraling — faster now, more dangerously than before. Her pacing had become frenzied, her movements jerky and erratic. The small pharmacy bag sat on a battered table nearby, half-ripped open, the contents strewn across the surface.</p><p>Gauze, tape, peroxide. Supplies that suggested some part of Wanda still wanted to keep Agatha alive.</p><p>But she didn’t know how. Her rage kept overriding her panic, twisting every instinct into something darker, crueler.</p><p>Agatha’s body barely reacted when Wanda approached this time. Her head slumped forward, hair shielding her battered face, breath so faint it barely stirred the air. Her lips tinged a worrying shade of blue.</p><p>"Come on, Aggie, stay with me," Wanda muttered under her breath, yanking the chair upright with a vicious jerk that almost toppled Agatha onto the floor.</p><p>When Agatha only gave a weak, pained gasp, Wanda’s face twisted into a mask of fury. She grabbed Agatha by the shoulders and shook her, hard enough to wrench her body back and forth.</p><p>"You’re being so difficult!" Wanda screamed into her face. "I’m trying to help you! I’m fixing you!"</p><p>Another rough shake, another guttural scream when Agatha's eyes rolled back instead of focusing.</p><p>In her madness, Wanda didn’t see — or didn’t want to see — that every moment she lost control, she was pushing Agatha closer to death.</p><p>Blood trickled sluggishly from Agatha’s temple again, the reopened wound staining her blouse in dark, slow patches. Her body was a broken marionette now, hanging by threads too thin to hold her much longer.</p><p>Wanda let go abruptly, and Agatha sagged in the chair, her head thunking softly against the wooden backrest.</p><p>For a moment, Wanda just stared at her, breathing hard, her hands trembling violently.<br/>"I didn’t mean it," she said, voice cracking into a broken sob. "I didn’t mean it, my love. Please don’t leave me."</p><p>She stumbled to the table, fumbling with the medical supplies, sloshing peroxide onto gauze, her hands clumsy, frantic. She pressed it against Agatha’s wound with too much force, eliciting a faint, broken moan.</p><p>"There," Wanda said, a desperate smile pulling at her lips, wild and wrong. "All better. You’ll see. You’ll see how good we can be together."</p><p>Tears streaked Wanda’s face, carving clean tracks through the grime on her cheeks.</p><p>In the dim light, with Agatha slumped and broken before her, Wanda whispered her final, terrible promise: "I’ll take you somewhere no one can find us. Somewhere you’ll have to love me." Her voice dropped lower, almost tender. "Even if I have to break you completely to do it."</p><p>Outside, the police cars began tightening their net. Rio sat rigid in the passenger seat of the lead detective’s car, heart hammering against her ribs so hard she thought it might burst.</p><p>Hold on, Agatha, she prayed silently, clenching her hands together until her knuckles went white. Please, just hold on a little longer.</p>

<p>The walls of the police station felt like they were closing in. Rio sat rigid on a hard plastic chair, her arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly as she stared at the door like she could will it to open, for someone, anyone, to walk through and tell her they had found Agatha.</p><p>Lilia sat beside her, one hand pressed tightly over Rio’s. She hadn't spoken much, both of them were operating on pure survival instinct now, but her steady presence was the only thing keeping Rio from unraveling completely.</p><p>The lead detective had made it brutally clear when they’d pinpointed Wandas location, driving her back to the station: Rio and Lilia were not permitted on the raid team. They couldn't risk civilians at the scene. Rio had tried to argue, pleaded even, but the law was firm, and the detective’s hard stare had finally broken her protest.</p><p>Now she could do nothing but wait and imagine every terrible possibility.</p><p>Please be alive. Please be alive. Please be alive, she repeated silently like a prayer, squeezing her eyes shut against the wave of helplessness crashing over her.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the city, the officers were moving.</p><p>The BOLO alert had triggered automatic surveillance flags: Wanda’s car had been spotted parked behind an abandoned warehouse on the edge of the industrial district.</p><p>Unmarked cars pulled into the area silently, engines killed blocks away. Officers in tactical gear moved like shadows, surrounding the building. Radios buzzed with clipped commands.<br/>Inside the warehouse, the air was thick and heavy, the sickly metallic scent of blood hanging in it like fog.</p><p>Wanda was frantic now, stuffing what few supplies she had into a battered duffel bag. She kept casting wild glances at Agatha’s limp figure, panic mounting with every second.</p><p>She tried to lift Agatha from the chair, dragging her upright by sheer force. Agatha’s head lolled against her shoulder, her body too weak to even attempt to stand.</p><p>"Come on, baby," Wanda panted, straining under Agatha’s dead weight. "We have to go. We have to go somewhere safe. Somewhere you’ll finally see it’s just us now."</p><p>Agatha groaned weakly, a pained, unconscious sound that only made Wanda more frantic.</p><p>"You’ll love me," Wanda whispered fiercely into Agatha’s hair. "You’ll see. You’ll see."</p><p>When Wanda couldn't get Agatha upright, she snapped again, a vicious twist in her mind that turned fear into rage. She shoved Agatha back down into the chair so hard the legs screeched across the floor.</p><p>"You’re making this harder than it needs to be!" Wanda shrieked. "You’re making me do this!"</p><p>In a violent fit, she slapped Agatha again, harder this time, a sickening crack echoing off the concrete walls. Blood welled at the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>And still, Agatha didn’t stir.</p><p>It only terrified Wanda more. In her broken mind, she thought if Agatha wouldn’t wake up, wouldn’t fight, then she was losing her forever.</p><p>"No," Wanda hissed, grabbing the rope she had used before, twisting it viciously around Agatha’s wrists again. "No one is taking you from me. Not ever."</p><p>Outside, the tactical team was in position.</p><p>The lead officer gave the signal, two quick taps to his earpiece. In perfect silence, they breached the back door, sweeping through the crumbling hallways with lethal precision.</p><p>One of the officers pointed to fresh scuff marks on the floor, signs of struggle, a chair dragged across the concrete and the team pivoted, weapons drawn, breath tight in their throats.</p><p>Every second mattered now.</p><p>They could feel it.</p><p>Back at the station, Rio jolted upright when the radio crackled with an urgent update.</p><p>"We have entry. Hostage located."</p><p>The words slammed into her like a physical blow.</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes instantly.</p><p>But then came the second message, and it turned her blood to ice.</p><p>"Subject Wanda Maximoff is still present. Hostage appears unconscious. Immediate medical requested. We need an ambulance, now."</p><p>Rio gasped, her hands flying to her mouth, a low sob ripping from her chest. Lilia immediately wrapped her arms around her, holding her tightly as Rio shook and cried.</p><p>"She's alive," Lilia whispered fiercely against Rio's hair. "She’s alive, Rio. They're going to get her out."</p><p>But Rio heard the unspoken truth in her tone, too. Agatha might be alive... but she might not survive if they didn’t get to her in time.</p><p>Inside the warehouse, chaos unfolded.</p><p>Wanda screamed when the officers burst into the room, throwing herself protectively over Agatha’s limp body, shrieking curses and sobs.</p><p>It took three officers to tear her away, kicking and clawing. She fought like a wild animal, her shrill, broken wails echoing in the cavernous building.</p><p>Agatha remained slumped in the chair, unmoving, blood smearing her clothes and skin.</p><p>One of the paramedics rushed forward, heart hammering as he checked for a pulse.</p><p>"Got one!" he shouted over his shoulder. "Weak, but she's breathing!"</p><p>They worked quickly, stabilizing her neck, setting up IV fluids, gently easing her onto a stretcher.<br/>Agatha moaned faintly, her head rolling to the side, her eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Still unconscious. Hanging on by a thread.</p><p>"You're okay," one of the EMTs whispered soothingly as they lifted her. "You’re safe now. We’ve got you."</p><p>But deep down, everyone in that room knew: The real battle for Agatha Harkness was just beginning.</p><p>The ambulance tore through the city streets, lights flashing, siren howling a mournful, urgent wail that cut through the night air.</p><p>Inside, the atmosphere was a controlled kind of chaos.</p><p>Agatha lay strapped to the stretcher, her skin pallid under the harsh fluorescent lights, dark bruises blooming across her cheekbones, blood matting her hair. A paramedic hovered over her, his gloved hands moving fast but precise, calling out her vitals to his partner.</p><p>"BP dropping, she's hypotensive!"<br/>"She's losing airway patency, prepping to intubate!"</p><p>The medic’s voice was tight with urgency as he tilted Agatha’s chin up, slipping a breathing tube between her lips. Another paramedic squeezed a bag valve, forcing air into her failing lungs.</p><p>"Stay with me," the medic muttered under his breath, as if his words alone could anchor her to life.</p><p>But Agatha was slipping further and further from them.</p><p>Her heart monitor, steady but weak at first, gave a sharp warning beep. Then another. Then a shrill, continuous wail.</p><p>"She's crashing!" the paramedic shouted.</p><p>"Initiate CPR — now!"</p><p>The stretcher jostled violently as he started compressions, his hands pumping hard and fast over Agatha’s fragile chest.</p><p>"One, two, three, four, come on, come on, Agatha"<br/>Another medic jabbed a syringe into her IV line, flooding her system with adrenaline. The ambulance swerved around a tight corner, the siren screaming louder, drowning out the desperate rhythm of the medics fighting for her life.</p><p>Agatha’s body jolted under the force of the compressions, but her heartbeat refused to return.</p><p>Minutes stretched into eternity.</p><p>Back at the police station, Rio and Lilia stood frozen, staring at the door as an officer hurried toward them, radio pressed against his ear.<br/>The look on his face made Rio’s stomach drop.</p><p>"No" she choked, before he even spoke. "No, please"</p><p>"There’s been a complication," he said grimly, voice low. "The ambulance had to divert. She's critical."</p><p>Lilia caught Rio as her knees buckled, clutching her tightly against her side.</p><p>"What does that mean?" Rio cried, her voice breaking. "What does that mean? Is she…?"</p><p>The officer hesitated, the tension in the room tightening unbearably. "They're doing everything they can."</p><p>The words were meant to be comforting.<br/>They weren’t.</p><p>Inside the ambulance, the paramedics were still locked in a grim, desperate ballet over Agatha’s body.</p><p>"Charging!"<br/>A defibrillator was slapped onto Agatha’s chest, the gel pads hissing slightly.</p><p>"Clear!"</p><p>Agatha’s body arched violently off the stretcher as the electric shock ripped through her.</p><p>Her heart monitor flatlined.</p><p>The medic cursed under his breath, sweat dripping down his forehead.</p><p>"Again!"<br/>Another charge. Another shock.</p><p>Then - A flicker.</p><p>The faintest blip of a heartbeat struggled to appear on the screen.</p><p>"She’s back, sinus rhythm, weak but present!"</p><p>The medics sagged with momentary relief, immediately stabilizing her vitals, pushing fluids faster, checking her oxygen saturation.</p><p>"Stay with us, Agatha," the paramedic whispered hoarsely, almost a prayer now. "You’ve fought this hard. Don’t you dare give up now."</p><p>They barreled toward the hospital entrance, where a trauma team waited with a gurney and a crash cart, ready to take over the moment the ambulance doors flew open.</p><p>As Agatha was rushed inside under a canopy of frantic doctors and nurses, the only sounds were the squeal of wheels against linoleum and the steady, fragile beep of a heart still fighting to beat.</p><p>Still alive but hanging by a thread.</p><p>Meanwhile, locked in a holding cell in the back of a police van, Wanda Maximoff sat in bloodstained clothes, her hands twitching in her lap, rocking back and forth.</p><p>She wore a smile that didn’t belong to sanity anymore.</p><p>The moment the officer gave them clearance, Rio and Lilia sprinted to the car like their lives depended on it.</p><p>Rio barely remembered the drive to the hospital. It was a blur of flashing streetlights and breathless, choked sobs, her hands white-knuckling the steering wheel. Lilia sat stiffly beside her, her face pale and grim, one hand pressed hard over her mouth to contain the sound of her own heart shattering.</p><p>When they stumbled into the trauma unit, they were immediately hit by the acrid stench of antiseptic, the too-bright fluorescent lights buzzing in the high ceilings.</p><p>A nurse met them with a grave expression, blocking their path.</p><p>"Miss Harkness is in surgery," she said gently. "It’s critical."</p><p>"Is…" Rio's voice broke. She swallowed hard and tried again. "Is she…"</p><p>The nurse hesitated, her eyes softening in sympathy.</p><p>"She coded in the ambulance. Twice. She’s very, very sick. The doctors are doing everything they can."</p><p>It was the same phrase as before - everything they can - and it still offered no comfort.</p><p>Rio staggered back, almost falling, catching herself against the wall. She slid down to the floor, pulling her knees up to her chest, burying her face against them.</p><p>Lilia crouched beside her, her hand trembling as she rubbed Rio’s back.</p><p>The silence between them was thick, a heavy, suffocating thing.</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the reel playing over and over in her mind.<br/>Agatha’s face, smiling at her with such raw, open love.<br/>Agatha’s soft laugh against her neck as they lay tangled in bed.<br/>Agatha’s silent tears as Rio accused her of betrayal, had thrown the worst insults she could at her, the heartbreak she hadn't even tried to defend herself against.</p><p>And now this.<br/>Because Rio hadn’t trusted her. Because she had believed Wanda, believed her own festering insecurities over the woman who had never done anything but love her, protect her, put her first.</p><p>You did this.<br/>The thought was merciless. You left her alone. You made her vulnerable. You broke her heart and now she might die believing you hated her.</p><p>"God," Rio gasped, clawing her fingers into her hair, her whole body shaking. "God, what have I done?"</p><p>Lilia just sat there beside her, silent, grieving. She knew no words could undo the damage.</p><p>Minutes felt like hours.<br/>Hours felt like lifetimes.</p><p>A doctor finally appeared through the trauma doors, blood smeared across the front of his scrubs, his eyes exhausted.</p><p>"Family of Agatha Harkness?"</p><p>Rio and Lilia shot to their feet at the same time.</p><p>"I'm her…" Rio stopped, her throat closing up. "I love her."</p><p>The doctor’s face was kind, but grave. "She’s alive," he said carefully. "But just barely."</p><p>Rio sagged forward, a broken sob ripping from her chest.</p><p>"She has a traumatic brain injury, broken ribs, extensive bruising, and internal bleeding. We’ve managed to stabilize her - for now - but the next 24 hours are critical. If she wakes up... it will be a miracle."</p><p>"If?" Rio croaked, her knees buckling again.</p><p>The doctor’s silence was answer enough. "If she wakes up, she’ll need months of rehabilitation. She may never fully recover." He hesitated, then added, "We did find defensive wounds. She fought very hard."</p><p>Rio pressed her hand to her mouth, a strangled sound escaping her.</p><p>Of course she did.<br/>Even beaten and betrayed and broken - Agatha had fought.</p><p>Because she had wanted to come back.<br/>Wanted to come home.</p><p>And Rio hadn't been there. She had thrown her away. "Can I…can I see her?" Rio whispered.</p><p>The doctor nodded. "Only briefly."</p><p>They led her down a long, sterile corridor, the walls a blur around her. When Rio stepped into Agatha’s ICU room, her heart shattered all over again. Agatha looked so small lying there, swallowed by the tangle of wires and machines.</p><p>Tubes snaked from her mouth and arms; a ventilator hissed steadily, breathing for her. Her skin was pale as marble, her eyes shut, a brutal gash cutting across her hairline.</p><p>Monitors beeped a weak, uncertain rhythm beside her bed - each one a fragile tether to life.<br/>Rio sank into the chair beside her, tears spilling unchecked down her cheeks.</p><p>"I’m sorry," she whispered brokenly, reaching out to take Agatha’s limp hand in hers. It was cool to the touch, the skin bruised and scraped. "I’m so sorry, my love." She pressed her forehead against Agatha’s knuckles, rocking gently, weeping. "You did everything right," Rio sobbed. "You tried to protect us. You tried to protect me. And I failed you."</p><p>Agatha didn’t stir.<br/>Didn’t squeeze her hand.<br/>Didn’t even flinch.</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut and let the sorrow consume her, pouring out all the pain and guilt and love she had held back for far too long.</p><p>If Agatha died - if she slipped away before Rio could ever make this right - it would be a wound she would carry for the rest of her life.</p><p>And she would deserve every second of that agony.</p>

<p>Rio didn’t leave Agatha’s side.<br/>Not for a second.</p><p>She sat curled in the stiff hospital chair, gripping Agatha’s bruised hand between both of hers, her thumb brushing lightly over Agatha’s knuckles as she whispered promises into the sterile air.</p><p>"I’ll never doubt you again," she said hoarsely, resting her forehead on the edge of the bed. "Just come back to me, please, my love... please..."</p><p>The machines continued their fragile symphony of beeps and hisses, the ventilator doing the work Agatha’s battered body couldn’t.</p><p>It was agony, to watch her like this.<br/>Agony Rio knew she had helped cause.</p><p>It was sometime later, Rio didn’t know how long; time had lost meaning, when the door creaked open quietly behind her.</p><p>She looked up with swollen, red-rimmed eyes to see Tony and Pepper standing hesitantly at the threshold.</p><p>Tony looked tired, worn down by stress and grief. Pepper clutched a bouquet of lilies in shaking hands.</p><p>"We heard from Lilia what happened," Tony said quietly, stepping inside. "We came as soon as we could."</p><p>Rio rose to her feet on trembling legs, wiping at her tear-streaked face.</p><p>"Thank you," she whispered, voice cracking. "She’ll appreciate it... when she wakes up."</p><p>Tony exchanged a heavy look with Pepper, then gently guided Rio into the hallway, just outside Agatha’s door.</p><p>"We didn’t want to say this in front of her," James began, voice low and grave. "But I feel I need to say it, as her friend."</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, dread coiling in her stomach.<br/>"From the first day Wanda started at the firm," Tony said, "Agatha raised concerns. She said Wanda made her uncomfortable. That something felt off."</p><p>Rio pressed her lips together, shame rising like bile.</p><p>"At first, we thought..." Tony hesitated, guilt flashing across his face. "We thought maybe it was just a newbie with a crush. You know how it is. But Agatha kept insisting. She documented everything — the staring, the strange comments, the feeling of being followed."</p><p>Pepper stepped forward, her face stricken.<br/>"And then we started seeing it too," she said softly. "The way Wanda would look at her. Like she was... obsessed."</p><p>Tony nodded grimly. "It wasn’t just paranoia. It was real."</p><p>Rio’s knees buckled and she braced herself against the wall, her stomach lurching violently.</p><p>"She was so stressed, Rio," Pepper whispered. "She stopped eating, she hasn’t been at work. She lost weight. She looked exhausted all the time."</p><p>Tonys voice thickened. "When you... when you kicked her out... she broke. She looked like a ghost. Said she was fine. But she wasn’t."</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut, a fresh wave of tears spilling over.</p><p>"She loves you," Tony said, his voice trembling with emotion. "God, she loves you so much. She wouldn’t let us call you. That it wasn’t your fault. Even when we saw what it was doing to her, she protected you. ."</p><p>Rio let out a broken, choked sound, sliding down the wall until she sat crumpled on the floor, covering her face with shaking hands.</p><p>She protected me even when I betrayed her.</p><p>Even now, lying broken and bleeding in that hospital bed, she was still protecting Rio from the truth of just how much she'd been hurt.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio whispered, the words barely audible through her sobs. "I'm so sorry."</p><p>Tony crouched down beside her, resting a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>"Don't waste time, Rio," he said softly. "Be here when she wakes up. If she wakes up. She’s fought so hard already. Don’t make her fight alone."</p><p>Rio nodded frantically, her throat too tight to speak.<br/>She would never leave Agatha’s side again.<br/>Not until Agatha threw her out herself.</p><p>Later that night, after Tony and Pepper had gone, Rio sat in the ICU room again, holding Agatha’s limp hand against her heart. Lilia had been and gone, pressing a soft kiss to Agathas forehead and making Rio promise to call if anything changed.</p><p>The room was dim now, lit only by the soft glow of the monitors.</p><p>Rio stroked Agatha’s bruised knuckles with her thumb, her voice a broken whisper.</p><p>"I love you," she said. "I’m going to spend the rest of my life proving it, if you let me."</p><p>She pressed a trembling kiss to Agatha’s hand, the salty taste of her own tears on her lips.</p><p>"I need you, Agatha," she whispered. "Please... please come back to me."</p><p>Outside the window, the sky began to lighten with the first fragile threads of dawn.</p><p>And inside the room, the heart monitor beeped on, steady, but fragile, as if Agatha was still holding on.</p><p>Somewhere, deep inside herself, Rio prayed harder than she ever had in her life.</p><p>The days blurred into one another.<br/>Nurses came and went, adjusting the machines, checking Agatha’s vitals, but Rio stayed.</p><p>She only left Agatha’s bedside to use the restroom, or when a nurse gently coaxed her into eating something — small, reluctant bites, like a child forced to eat while grieving.</p><p>Every spare moment, she was right there, fingers tangled around Agatha’s, murmuring soft, desperate things into the stillness.</p><p>"I love you," Rio would whisper again and again, her voice growing hoarse from overuse. "You’re not alone. Please, baby... please come back to me."</p><p>Sometimes she read to her, though her vision blurred so badly she could barely make out the words.<br/>Sometimes she just sat and cried quietly, her hand never letting go of Agatha’s.</p><p>The doctors were cautious, their faces carefully blank whenever Rio asked if there was hope.<br/>"Her body’s healing," they said. "But the brain is unpredictable. We have to be patient."</p><p>Patient.<br/>As if patience could keep Rio from breaking apart with guilt and longing every second that Agatha didn’t open her eyes.</p><p>It was five days after the surgery when something happened.</p><p>Rio was half-dozing in the chair, her head bent awkwardly against the side of the bed, Agatha’s hand cradled to her chest. Her fingers absentmindedly stroked Agatha’s knuckles, the same soothing pattern she’d used for years, in the dark when they lay together, when words weren’t needed.</p><p>She barely noticed the slight twitch at first.<br/>It was so small, she thought she had imagined it, the faintest flutter of Agatha’s fingers beneath her own.</p><p>Rio sat bolt upright, heart hammering against her ribs.</p><p>"Agatha?" she breathed, leaning in so close she could feel the faint warmth of Agatha’s breath against her cheek. "My love, it’s me. I’m here."</p><p>The fingers twitched again, unmistakable this time, a weak, unconscious attempt to move.</p><p>Tears sprang to Rio’s eyes so fast it blinded her.<br/>"Nurse!" she gasped, half-shouting, fumbling for the call button with shaking hands. "Please! She moved! She moved!"</p><p>A flurry of activity erupted around them as the nurses rushed in, checking monitors, flashing lights into Agatha’s eyes, murmuring hurried medical jargon Rio could barely process.</p><p>But all Rio could focus on was the way Agatha’s hand, bruised and battered, squeezed hers faintly.<br/>The tiniest, weakest squeeze.<br/>But it was real.</p><p>She collapsed forward onto the bed, pressing trembling kisses to Agatha’s hand, whispering over and over, "You’re fighting. Keep fighting, come back to me, sweetheart. I’m right here. I’m never leaving."</p><p>The doctors warned her it would be a slow recovery.</p><p>"Don’t expect her to just wake up and be herself," they cautioned. "There might be confusion, memory loss. It will take time."</p><p>Rio didn’t care.<br/>She would take any version of Agatha.<br/>As long as she came back to her.</p><p>Over the next few days, there were more flickers.</p><p>A flicker of eyelashes.<br/>A tiny furrow in her bruised brow when Rio spoke softly to her.<br/>The faintest groan of pain when a nurse adjusted her IV.</p><p>Each sign was a miracle.<br/>Each one fed the fragile, desperate hope blooming in Rio’s chest.</p><p>She kept talking to her, kept reminding her:<br/>"You’re not alone, my love. You’re safe. I’m here."</p><p>She confessed everything, too, all the guilt she carried like a brand burned into her soul.</p><p>"I should have trusted you," Rio sobbed one night, her forehead resting against Agatha’s blanketed arm. "You did everything right. You fought so hard for us. And I... I let you down."</p><p>Her voice cracked, the weight of her regret crushing.</p><p>"I love you, Agatha. I love you more than my own anything. I’ll spend every day proving it to you, if you’ll let me."</p><p>The machines kept their steady rhythm around her, filling the silence, both supporting and hindering Agathas reemergence into the waking world.</p>

<p>Agatha’s awakening was slow - excruciatingly slow.</p><p>A struggle between light and darkness, between pain and peace.</p><p>It began with a sharp stab of pain in her chest.</p><p>Her ribs, bruised and cracked from the relentless force of CPR, screamed as the tight bandages around her torso shifted. She flinched involuntarily, groaning in discomfort.</p><p>The pain was overwhelming, like fire under her skin, and yet — amidst the haze of the ache — there was something else.</p><p>A soft, familiar touch.</p><p>A voice.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio whispered, so close she could feel the warmth of her breath on her skin. "It’s me. I’m here."</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. It hurt to move, to try to open her eyes. Her lids felt heavy, like lead. She tried to speak, but the sound that escaped her lips was a faint croak, barely more than a whisper.</p><p>"Rio..." Her voice sounded raw, like the smallest motion could shatter her.</p><p>And Rio — Rio was there.</p><p>"Shh, baby, don’t try to talk," Rio murmured softly, her voice trembling. Her hand gently cupped Agatha’s bruised face, her thumb stroking over the cold skin of her cheek with such tenderness Agatha felt a tear slip from her eye. "You’re safe. You’re going to be okay."</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, fragile, shallow. Every inhale felt like it was drawing her ribs together, an aching pressure against her chest that made the world spin around her. She barely had the strength to focus on anything, but the sound of Rio’s voice — Rio’s voice had always been a lifeline, something that anchored her even in the darkest moments.</p><p>"Rio..." she whispered again, this time with more strength, even if only slightly. "I—"</p><p>"Shh, don’t try to speak," Rio repeated softly, her fingers gently caressing Agatha’s hair. "I’ve got you. I’m here. You don’t have to say anything."</p><p>But Agatha needed to say something.</p><p>She needed to ask why — why she was here, why her body was aching in ways she could barely understand, and why she couldn’t remember how she got here.</p><p>Her memory felt like a shattered mirror.</p><p>The pieces wouldn’t fit together.</p><p>Only flashes — broken, jagged, terrifying.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>The fear.</p><p>The darkness.</p><p>"Please, Agatha," Rio whispered, her voice softening even further, as if she could sense the storm of confusion and terror inside her. "Please, don’t try to remember. It’s okay. Just focus on me."</p><p>But it wasn’t okay.</p><p>Agatha could feel it in her bones, the thick, suffocating weight of it. Something had happened. Something so terrible, it seemed to have swallowed her whole.</p><p>She tried to speak again, pushing past the pain in her chest, trying to form words.</p><p>"Can... can’t breathe... too... hard..." Agatha gasped, her voice breaking with the effort.</p><p>Rio’s face twisted with panic, and she immediately leaned closer, her hands trembling as she tried to adjust Agatha’s position. She gently propped her up, easing her back into the pillows, holding her close in a way that was both careful and protective.</p><p>"I’ve got you," Rio soothed, voice thick with emotion. "Just breathe slowly, okay? In... out... nice and slow."</p><p>Agatha’s body felt fragile. Every movement was like a crack in her brokenness. Her chest felt tight, the bruising from the CPR unbearable — a crushing weight that made it hard to think, hard to breathe. She struggled to draw in air, gasping with shallow, ragged breaths.</p><p>"I... I can’t... feel..."</p><p>"Yes, you can," Rio whispered urgently, her hand on Agatha’s, squeezing so tightly it almost hurt. "You’re alive, Agatha. You’re here. You’re breathing, and that’s all that matters."</p><p>But Agatha’s mind was far away, drifting.<br/>She wanted to cling to Rio, to the comfort of her voice, but her mind couldn’t stay focused.</p><p>And then — a sudden burst of clarity.</p><p>A flicker.</p><p>A memory.</p><p>Wanda.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open, wide and panicked, searching Rio’s face for any explanation, but Rio just stared back at her, confused and distressed, trying to calm her down.</p><p>"Rio!" Agatha croaked, the panic flooding her voice. "Wanda—"</p><p>"Shh, it’s okay," Rio’s voice was soft but firm, trying to calm Agatha’s erratic breathing. She wiped a tear from Agatha’s cheek, leaning closer.</p><p>"Wanda is gone, my love. You’re safe now. I swear to you, she can’t hurt you anymore."</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t quiet the terror that clawed at her.<br/>The memory felt real — like something sharp digging into her chest.</p><p>"I— I don’t..." Agatha’s words were slurred, breathless. "I don’t remember... everything. Just... flashes..."</p><p>Rio leaned over her, gently cupping Agatha’s face with both hands, her gaze filled with sorrow and tenderness.</p><p>"You don’t have to remember it all right now, baby," Rio whispered, her voice low and soothing. "You don’t have to carry it. All you need to focus on is getting better. And we’re going to do that together."</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue, wanted to push her away, wanted to scream about how wrong this all felt. But her body was so weak. Her chest hurt so much that even lifting her hand to wipe away a stray tear felt like it might shatter her.</p><p>She closed her eyes, defeated, surrendering to the exhaustion that threatened to pull her under.</p><p>"Stay with me," Rio whispered. "I’m not going anywhere."</p><p>Agatha couldn’t respond, but she felt the warmth of Rio’s hand as it stroked her hair, the soft sound of her voice weaving a thread of safety through the tangled mess of Agatha’s thoughts.</p><p>And for a moment, just a moment, she let herself believe it was true.</p><p>The world outside felt like it was moving on without her, while she lay there, fragile and broken. Her body, bruised and battered from Wanda’s hands, was beginning to heal, but there was something deeper that Agatha couldn’t put into words — something that no amount of physical recovery could cure.</p><p>She lay on her back, her eyes closed, staring at the ceiling, trying to ignore the pain that still throbbed through her chest from the fractured ribs. Her body ached, but the pain was nothing compared to the quiet ache inside her heart. The emotional wounds, the ones Rio had inflicted with her words — they festered quietly, a silent storm in her mind.</p><p>Rio hadn’t left her side, her presence constant. At first, Agatha had been grateful for it — for Rio's touch, her whispered apologies, her promises to make things right. But now, as the days passed, Agatha felt nothing but a dull weight pressing down on her chest. She couldn’t bring herself to believe Rio anymore.</p><p>She couldn’t help but wonder — was Rio only here because Agatha was broken, because Agatha was fragile and in need of care? Maybe that was the only reason Rio was so gentle, so patient now.</p><p>Maybe, if Agatha had been whole, if she hadn’t been shattered both physically and emotionally, Rio wouldn’t have stayed.</p><p>There was a painful truth that Agatha couldn’t escape: She wasn’t worthy of Rio’s attention. Not anymore.</p><p>She had tried to tell herself otherwise, but every time she thought about the way Rio had kicked her out, her words — you can’t love — echoed in her mind, louder than the pain of her ribs, louder than the cold metal of the hospital bed. How could she believe in any of the love Rio was offering now when it had been so easy for her to discard Agatha when she was most vulnerable?</p><p>Agatha didn’t let Rio see her struggle. She hid it behind a mask of quiet, withdrawn silence, clinging to the few moments of peace she found in the empty spaces of her mind. She didn’t know how to explain the storm inside her head, the way it swirled and twisted, or how the weight of Rio’s earlier words had made her feel like an unlovable failure.</p><p>So she said nothing. She let the silence hang in the air between them, thick and suffocating.</p><p>Rio, for her part, sat beside Agatha, her hand resting gently on Agatha’s, her thumb softly stroking the back of her hand. She thought Agatha’s silence was because she was still so physically fragile, still recovering from the trauma, and she didn’t push. She thought that with time, Agatha would open up, that things would get better.</p><p>"How are you feeling today?" Rio asked gently, though she could already tell that Agatha wasn’t quite the same.</p><p>Her eyes were distant, her movements slow and careful, as though she was deliberately holding herself together. But Rio attributed it to the physical toll Wanda’s abuse had taken on her body, not realizing that it was her own words — the words that had broken Agatha’s spirit — that were the real cause.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She just stared out the window, watching the city beyond, its bustling life feeling so far away from her own. She didn’t want to look at Rio, didn’t want to face the pity in her eyes, the false sense of care that Rio was showing. She wasn’t sure how to handle it, how to let Rio in when it felt like if she did, Rio would just pulled away eventually in the most hurtful ways.</p><p>"I’m fine," Agatha replied quietly, the words soft and distant. She didn’t have the energy to pretend, but she also didn’t want to tell Rio the truth. You kicked me out. You told me I couldn’t love you.</p><p>Rio nodded, but Agatha could see the concern in her eyes. She could see the way Rio’s lips quivered, as if she was waiting for Agatha to say something — anything — that might make everything okay again. But Agatha didn’t have the words. She couldn’t speak the truth, not yet.</p><p>She couldn’t tell Rio how much she was hurting, how everything felt like it was unraveling, and how the more Rio hovered around her, the more distant Agatha became.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, squeezing Agatha’s hand, but she didn’t press. She seemed to believe that the silence between them was just another part of Agatha’s healing process, another stage she needed to go through.</p><p>But Agatha knew, deep down, that it wasn’t just about the physical recovery. It was more than that. The distance between them wasn’t because she was still healing, it was because Agatha had nothing left to give. She was empty, hollowed out from the inside. Rio’s attention — her concern — felt suffocating now, not comforting.</p><p>Every time Rio spoke, every time she tried to comfort her, Agatha felt like she was drowning in an ocean of guilt and shame. I’m not worth this. I’m not worth this care. Not anymore.</p><p>Days passed in a quiet blur, each one blending into the next, and Agatha remained withdrawn.</p><p>She didn’t engage in conversations. She didn’t share her thoughts or feelings. It felt easier to keep everything locked inside. When Rio would ask how she was doing, Agatha would only nod, pretending everything was fine. She was so careful not to say too much, not to reveal too much, because if she did, she was afraid it would break her. And if it broke her, she wasn’t sure she would be able to survive it.</p><p>Rio, for her part, grew increasingly concerned.</p><p>She couldn’t understand the silence. She kept waiting for Agatha to open up, for her to ask for what she needed, but Agatha’s quietness only made Rio feel more helpless. She tried to make her feel better with gentle words and touches, but it never seemed to reach Agatha.</p><p>One evening, as the hospital lights flickered softly overhead, Rio looked at Agatha with a pained expression, her eyes filled with worry. "You know you can talk to me, right? You don’t have to go through this alone. I’m here. I love you."</p><p>But Agatha only nodded, her lips pressed together, her eyes downcast. She couldn’t bring herself to tell Rio the truth. She couldn’t bring herself to admit that the distance between them wasn’t because of her physical healing. It was because Agatha didn’t feel like she could trust Rio anymore. She didn’t feel worthy of the love Rio was offering.</p><p>"I’m here," Rio whispered again, this time her voice barely audible, as though the weight of Agatha’s silence was breaking her.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, not responding. The quiet stretched on, and the space between them grew heavier with each passing minute.</p><p>As the days dragged on, Agatha’s emotional state only worsened, but Rio remained unaware of the depth of her inner turmoil. She still thought it was the physical scars Agatha was carrying, and that time would heal those too. But Agatha knew the truth — some wounds couldn’t be healed by time. Not when they were buried so deeply inside.</p><p>She felt fractured, pulled apart in ways that no physical healing could fix.</p><p>Lilia entered the room quietly, her footsteps light, almost hesitant. She had been there every day since Agatha had come to the hospital, but today, she couldn’t ignore the deep concern that gnawed at her chest.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t spoken much since she’d woken up, and her withdrawal from Rio seemed to be more than just the aftermath of the traumatic events she’d endured. Agatha had always been strong, always kept things together — but Lilia could see the cracks now. She could see how badly Agatha was hurting, and it terrified her.</p><p>"Hey," Lilia said softly, pulling a chair closer to Agatha’s bed. She didn’t want to push her, but she needed to ask. "How are you holding up?"</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond at first. Her eyes remained closed, her hands lying limp at her sides, fingers slightly curled. The silence between them felt heavy, and for a moment, Lilia didn’t know whether to push or let Agatha be.</p><p>Finally, Agatha shifted her head slightly, just enough to acknowledge Lilia’s presence. Her voice was quiet, as though it took too much effort to speak.</p><p>"I’m fine," Agatha murmured, her gaze still distant. She was always fine, wasn’t she? She was always fine, even when she wasn’t. Even when everything was falling apart inside her.</p><p>Lilia sighed softly, the weight of her concern pressing down on her. She had seen Agatha go through hell, but this... this was something different. Something darker. Agatha’s resilience had always been her strength, but it was also her weakness. She’d kept everything locked inside for so long, and now it was all coming undone. Lilia couldn’t stand watching her like this.</p><p>"You know you don’t have to pretend with me, right?" Lilia said, her voice gentle but insistent. "You’ve been through too much, Agatha. This—" she gestured to the stillness in the room, the silence in Agatha’s eyes, "this isn’t you."</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She didn’t know how to.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she even wanted to answer. What could she say? The truth felt too heavy to bear. How could she tell Lilia that she felt like she was slipping away from herself? That everything she thought she knew about love, about herself, had shattered into a thousand tiny pieces? How could she explain that the love she had for Rio, the love she thought would be enough, felt like a cruel joke now?</p><p>Lilia’s voice broke through her dark thoughts. "I know you love Rio. I know you do. But Agatha..." Her voice softened with compassion. "You can’t keep carrying all of this by yourself. You’ve been through hell. You need to let people help you."</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, the weight of Lilia’s words pressing on her chest like a heavy stone. She didn’t want to be weak, didn’t want to be a burden. She didn’t want to be the kind of person who needed others to take care of her.</p><p>But that was the problem, wasn’t it? She didn’t know how to let others help her, especially not Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t told Lilia the full extent of her own internal battles — how deep the wounds cut, how much they hurt. The emotional scars, the way Rio had made her feel as if she were incapable of love, as if she didn’t deserve to be loved. Agatha had always struggled with the idea of love. Her mother had told her she was unlovable, that she was broken, that no one would ever want her.</p><p>She’d spent so long trying to prove her wrong, trying to prove to herself that she could love, that she was capable of giving and receiving it. But now, after everything that had happened, after Rio’s words — Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe her mother had been right all along.</p><p>She was unlovable.</p><p>"She deserves better than me," Agatha whispered hoarsely, the words barely audible, as though they were too painful to say out loud. Her eyes remained closed, her hands tightening into fists on the bed. "Rio deserves someone who can love her the way she needs to be loved. Someone who isn’t... broken."</p><p>Lilia’s heart broke for her. She leaned forward, taking Agatha’s hand gently, but Agatha didn’t respond, her body stiffening slightly under the touch. It was as if Agatha was pulling away from everyone, even from her closest friend.</p><p>"You are not broken," Lilia said firmly, squeezing Agatha’s hand. "You’ve been through hell. What Wanda did to you — that’s not something anyone should have to go through. And Rio... Rio made a mistake. She didn’t see what was right in front of her, but that doesn’t mean you’re unlovable. That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve love, Agatha. You do. You deserve so much more than what happened. And Rio—she realize thats. She came back to you. You just need to let her. Let yourself heal."</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t hear it. Not right now. Her mind was too clouded with self-doubt, with the belief that she wasn’t worthy of Rio’s love. How could she be, when Rio had kicked her out so easily, when Rio had believed Wanda’s lies? How could she be worthy of love when she couldn’t even trust herself to make the right choices?</p><p>"I don’t think I can fix this," Agatha whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. "I don’t know how to fix me. I don’t know if I can ever trust anyone again... not the way I trusted Rio."</p><p>Lilia’s face softened with empathy, but she refused to let Agatha retreat into herself completely. "You don’t have to fix yourself alone, Agatha. You don’t have to do this alone. You have me. You have Rio. Don’t push her away, okay? Don’t push everyone away."</p><p>Agatha said nothing, her silence like a heavy weight in the room. She didn’t have the strength to argue, and she didn’t know how to make Lilia understand. The part of her that wanted to trust again, that wanted to believe Rio would be there when she was ready, felt like it was buried under an avalanche of hurt and betrayal.</p><p>She couldn’t be fixed, not in the way Lilia hoped.</p><p>She was too far gone, lost in a web of her own insecurities. The woman she had been before — strong, confident, capable of loving — seemed like a distant memory now.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It had been a week since Agatha woke up, and Rio couldn’t shake the guilt gnawing at her. She was holding it together on the outside, but inside, her heart was breaking.</p><p>The woman she loved, the woman who had given her everything, love, trust, loyalty, was broken, and she had played a part in it. She had let her insecurities cloud her judgment, had let Wanda’s manipulation push her into thinking that Agatha was capable of betraying her.</p><p>Rio had spent hours staring at the ceiling in her apartment, their apartment, wrestling with the shame and regret when she had been ordered to leave until formal visiting hours.</p><p>She had tried to text Agatha, tried to reach out, but the messages went unanswered. She knew why. She could feel the distance, the walls Agatha had put up between them, the one word responses. Rio had ruined everything, and now Agatha wasn’t just physically healing, she was emotionally shattered.</p><p>She’d put Rio’s trust above everything, above even her own well-being. And Rio, in her jealousy and insecurities, had repaid that with doubt and harsh words.</p><p>"She’s been through more than we’ll ever probably know, Rio," Lilia had said earlier, her tone firm but kind. "And now, you’ve got a chance to make it right. To show her that you do love her. She’s in her head at the minute."</p><p>She was scared, scared that Agatha would never forgive her, scared that she might lose her forever.</p><p>She couldn’t keep hiding from the hurt she had caused. She had to try fix it, no matter how hard it was.</p><p>The door to Agatha’s room opened with a soft creak. Agatha was sitting up in the bed, her face pale, her head wrapped in bandages, but the most painful thing was the emptiness in her eyes.</p><p>She didn’t look like the fiery woman Rio had fallen in love with. She didn’t look like the woman who had stood beside her through everything.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio whispered, her voice trembling as she stepped inside. "I…"</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up at first. Her hands were folded in her lap, her gaze fixed on the them, as though the weight of the world had taken residence inside her. Rio felt a lump form in her throat, the emotions flooding her chest, but she forced herself to take a step forward.</p><p>"I know I don’t deserve it, but I need to talk to you about that night, when we fought," Rio continued, her voice soft but full of emotion. "I was a fool. A complete fool. I let my jealousy, my insecurities, get in the way of seeing the truth. I listened to Wanda. I let her poison my mind, and I hurt you in ways I can never take back."</p><p>Agatha’s eyes remained fixed on the bed, but Rio could see the tension in her shoulders, the slight tremor in her hands. She was listening. Agatha was listening, even if she didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>"I… I thought I was protecting myself. I thought you were lying to me. But I was wrong. So wrong. I should’ve believed you, Agatha. I should’ve been there for you when you needed me. And instead, I hurt you. I betrayed you." Rio’s voice cracked with emotion. "I don’t expect you to forgive me right away. I know I have to earn back your trust. But please, Agatha… I need you to know how sorry I am. I love you. I love you more than anything, and I can’t lose you."</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, and Rio could see the way her shoulders stiffened further, the way she seemed to retreat even more into herself. It was like Agatha was trying to shut her out, to protect herself from the hurt that Rio had caused.</p><p>"Agatha," Rio said again, her voice barely above a whisper. "Please. Look at me."</p><p>Slowly, as if it took all the strength she had, Agatha raised her gaze to meet Rio’s eyes. Her face was drawn, her eyes dark and hollow, as if the light inside her had been dimmed. But there was something in her expression, something fragile and raw, that made Rio’s heart ache.</p><p>"I’m here," Rio continued, her voice shaking with emotion. "I’m here for you. Please… let me be here for you. Let me help you. Let me make this right."</p><p>There was silence, a heavy, painful silence that seemed to stretch for eternity. Rio waited, her heart pounding in her chest, her hands trembling. She didn’t know if Agatha would ever be able to forgive her, but she had to try. She had to show Agatha that she was ready to fight for them, to fight for their love.</p><p>And then, Agatha spoke, her voice so soft it was almost a whisper. "I don’t know if I can ever trust you again, Rio. I don’t know if I can love you the way I did. You… you hurt me. You said things to me that can’t be taken back."</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at the words, the pain in Agatha’s voice cutting through her like a knife. This was the truth of the situation that had been hovering on the precipice the last week.</p><p>She didn’t know how to make it right, how to fix everything that had gone wrong. But she knew one thing for sure — she couldn’t give up on Agatha.</p><p>"I’m so sorry," Rio whispered, her voice breaking. "I will do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to prove to you that I love you. You are enough, Agatha. You always have been. I didn’t mean what I said. You’re everything to me."</p><p>With that she pressed a kiss to Agathas temple, eyes closed as though in prayer, before leaving the room.</p><p>“I’ll be back tomorrow, I’ll be here everyday until you tell me not to.”</p><p>The days had passed slowly for Agatha, each one bleeding into the next, a blur of hospital visits, quiet nights filled with painful memories, and the heavy weight of the silence between her and Rio.</p><p>It was hard to tell whether she was making progress, or simply surviving. But somewhere beneath the layers of hurt and trauma, there was a spark of something that hadn’t gone out.</p><p>Agatha's body was slowly healing. Her ribs, still tender and fragile, had begun to mend, though the deep bruises that marked her skin were a reminder of just how far she'd fallen, how much she'd endured. Each day, she moved a little more, walking with the aid of a cane at first, then without. But the physical progress felt almost secondary compared to the emotional and mental toll that weighed her down.</p><p>The nightmares still haunted her. She would wake up, gasping for air, her heart pounding in her chest, the memories of Wanda’s touch and her crazed eyes never far from her mind. But with each passing night, the nightmares became less frequent, less vivid. And in those rare moments of peace, when she lay awake in her hospital bed, Agatha would allow herself to think of Rio.</p><p>She had never imagined the distance between them could be so loud. The words Rio had said, the cruelty of them, were like a jagged knife lodged deep in her heart. But as the days went by, Agatha found herself questioning everything she had believed in that moment. She had always known Rio’s insecurities - her jealousy, her fear of abandonment. Agatha had accepted it, had loved her despite it, but now, the love felt tainted.</p><p>Could it ever go back to what it was?</p><p>It was a question she wasn’t ready to answer, but she didn’t have to. Not yet.</p><p>Rio had been there every day, waiting, hoping.</p><p>She’d come with flowers that Agatha barely looked at, with cards that were never opened in front of her and apologies that were swallowed by the silence. It was torture, but Rio knew she deserved it. She had let her jealousy, her fear, destroy the one thing she had always relied on - Agatha’s unwavering love.</p><p>But the nights were the hardest. Rio would sit by Agatha’s side, the quiet tension thick between them, both afraid of breaking the silence, both afraid of what it meant if they did. She had no idea how to fix what she had broken. Every time she tried to speak, Agatha’s closed-off demeanor felt like a wall, something too strong for her to break down.</p><p>And yet, every day Rio noticed little things - how Agatha’s eyes seemed to soften when Rio brought her favorite coffee, how her fingers would twitch when Rio touched her hand, how there were moments, fleeting but there, where Agatha’s walls would crack, just enough to let a little light in.</p><p>It was progress, Rio told herself. And that was all she could hope for, all she could work towards.</p><p>On one particularly quiet afternoon, as the hospital room was bathed in soft sunlight, Agatha found herself sitting at the edge of the bed. Her legs were still weak, her body still a shell of what it once was, but the cane she had been using for support now rested against the chair in the corner. She hadn’t been ready to face Rio in full yet, hadn’t felt strong enough to speak the words she wanted to say. But something about the stillness of the room - the quiet hum of the machines, the soft rustle of paper from Rio’s unread cards - made her feel like maybe, just maybe, she could try.</p><p>Rio was standing by the window, her back to Agatha, her face still etched with the stress and guilt that never seemed to leave her. Agatha had noticed the way Rio had stopped looking at her directly, as if afraid to make eye contact, afraid that the weight of the past few weeks would crush her.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper. The sound of her own voice startled her, after so much time in silence.</p><p>Rio froze, her hand gripping the windowsill a little too tightly. "Agatha," she said softly, turning toward her, her eyes full of hesitation.</p><p>"Can you... can you sit with me?" Agatha asked, her voice cracking on the last word. She wanted to say so much more, but she didn’t know how to articulate it all. She didn’t know how to tell Rio that she was still so broken, so unsure of what their future looked like, but she needed to take the first step.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened with a mixture of surprise and relief, and she walked over, slowly, as though afraid to move too quickly. When she sat down beside Agatha, their shoulders barely touched, but it was enough to send a jolt of warmth through Agatha’s body. The contact felt like a lifeline, and she clung to it, afraid to let it go.</p><p>"How are you feeling?" Rio asked, her voice tentative, as though she were still testing the waters, unsure if she was walking on fragile ground.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, trying to push down the overwhelming wave of emotions. Her head still ached from the injuries Wanda had inflicted, and her body still felt weak, but what hurt most was the emptiness she felt inside. The woman who had once been her rock, her constant, was now a stranger to her. Rio’s questions, her attempts to make amends, felt distant, like an echo from the past.</p><p>"I’m getting better," Agatha replied quietly, unsure whether she meant physically or emotionally.</p><p>Maybe it was both. Maybe it was neither. But it was the first time she had said it aloud, the first time she had even allowed herself to consider that things could improve.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she reached out, her hand trembling as it hovered near Agatha’s. "Agatha, I—"</p><p>"Rio," Agatha interrupted, her voice firm despite the tremor in her chest. "I need you to understand that I don’t know if I can go back to how things were. I don’t know if I can just... forgive you."</p><p>The words hung heavy in the air between them, but Agatha didn’t look away. It was hard, so hard, to say those things. To admit that there was a part of her that didn’t know if she could let Rio back in completely. But the honesty was necessary. The truth was necessary.</p><p>"I love you," Rio whispered, her voice breaking. "I love you, Agatha. And I will do whatever it takes to make things right. Please... just let me try."</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the sincerity in Rio’s voice, and her eyes burned with unshed tears.</p><p>She wanted to say she could forgive her, wanted to believe that everything could be fixed with time, with effort. But the words wouldn’t come.<br/>Not yet.</p><p>She didn’t know if she could ever trust Rio the way she once had, but she was willing to try. For herself. For them.</p><p>And that, in itself, was progress.</p><p>As the days passed, Agatha continued her slow journey back to herself. The physical recovery was difficult, but the emotional healing was what truly took time. She spent her mornings with Rio, talking in quiet, uncertain tones. And though their conversations were awkward, strained, Agatha began to notice the small shifts, the little steps that led to something more.</p><p>Eight weeks in, Agatha’s body had come a long way since the days when she could barely lift her hand, let alone walk. Her injuries, the broken ribs, the bruises, the deep gashes, had all healed, but the trauma to her head had been something entirely different. The doctors had warned her that the brain injury might take months, maybe longer, to fully heal, and that it would require patience. It wasn’t just about regaining physical strength; it was about her mind relearning how to function in the way it had before.</p><p>For weeks, Agatha had attended physical therapy sessions that tested her patience and her resolve.</p><p>At first, she had been frustrated, angry at how slowly her body responded. Every step felt like an immense effort, every movement felt like she was pushing her body through mud. Her therapists had worked with her tirelessly, encouraging her to push past the pain and the self-doubt, reminding her that healing wasn’t linear.</p><p>But slowly, the frustration began to fade. With each session, she gained a little more control over her movements. It had taken a lot of work, a lot of gritted teeth and silent tears, but Agatha was starting to walk again without the cane, her body still weak, but not as fragile as it had been.</p><p>The steps, though tentative, were hers. The feeling of the floor beneath her feet no longer terrified her; it grounded her.</p><p>When she finally made it through an entire morning of therapy without needing a break, she couldn’t help but feel a small spark of pride. She was moving forward. She was healing.</p><p>The next step was returning to her life, her job, her apartment, and possibly, to the life she had shared with Rio.</p>
