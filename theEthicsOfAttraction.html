     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Agatha Harkness prides herself on being a no-nonsense ethics professor, keeping students in line with sharp lectures and sharper looks. But when Rio Vidal—brilliant, sarcastic, and infuriatingly captivating—decides to test those boundaries, Agatha finds herself facing dilemmas that have nothing to do with her syllabus. As playful banter gives way to undeniable attraction, the two must navigate the fine line between rules and reckless abandon. In this classroom, the lessons go far beyond ethics.
     </p>
     <p>
      THEY ARE BOTH CONSENTING ADULTS THIS IS A DOCTORATE PROGRAM NOT UNDERGRAD THANK YOU!

     Academic Disharmony
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha Harkness had developed a reputation for being an unshakable, no-nonsense professor. Her tall, graceful frame stood out in every room she entered, a force to be reckoned with. Her silver-streaked dark hair was always neatly pulled into a bun, yet a few strands would often escape, framing her face in a way that only enhanced her sharp features. There was a striking elegance to her—her tailored blazers and pressed trousers hinting at her strict professionalism—but also something undeniably alluring. Her piercing blue eyes, set beneath arched brows, could silence even the most disruptive students with a single glance, and yet, when she smiled (which was rare), the faintest hint of warmth seeped through her tough exterior.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn't just command the room; she owned it, moving with the kind of precision that made you think every step, every look, was calculated. She was the kind of professor who didn’t tolerate nonsense, and everyone in the room knew it. Everyone, except Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio Vidal—brilliant and utterly infuriating—was the exact opposite. Where Agatha was controlled, Rio was wild, all rough edges and mischievous smiles. She never seemed to sit still, her dark hair (always just messy enough to look like she didn’t care but in a way that suited her perfectly) falling into her deep brown eyes as she lounged in her seat. Every time she spoke, it was with a sarcastic drawl that made it sound like nothing was serious. But behind those half-lidded eyes and slouched posture, Rio was watching everything.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Miss Vidal," Agatha began, glancing up from her desk as she collected papers. "I assume you have something insightful to add to today’s discussion on modern ethical dilemmas?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked, leaning back further in her chair, arms crossed over her chest in a way that made her shirt ride up just slightly, revealing the toned sliver of her midriff. "Insightful? I thought I was just here to look pretty, Professor."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's gaze didn't waver. She simply lifted an eyebrow, unimpressed but vaguely amused. "Unfortunately for you, I'm not interested in students with nothing but good looks to offer."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's smirk widened. "So you’re admitting I’m good-looking?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha exhaled through her nose—an almost imperceptible reaction. "That’s your takeaway from all of this?" She turned her back to the class, walking toward the whiteboard, the sound of her heels clicking with authority. “Perhaps next time, try focusing on the material rather than whatever it is you think you're accomplishing."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio watched her, eyes flicking over the curve of Agatha’s back as she moved, appreciating the way her blazer hugged her waist just enough to hint at the figure beneath. Rio wasn’t subtle. She never was. She knew she was baiting Agatha, and that was the fun of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m focusing,” Rio drawled, her voice low and playful. “Just not on what you want me to.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t turn around, but Rio caught the slightest hesitation in her stride. Something about that pleased her. Maybe, just maybe, the professor wasn’t as immune to her as she let on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Agatha finally did face her, her expression was cool, composed, but her eyes flashed with something that Rio couldn’t quite place. “Perhaps you’d care to demonstrate your focus in a paper, Miss Vidal. I’m sure you’re aware that your essays are due at the end of the week.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A challenge. Rio grinned.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve got it handled,” she said, leaning forward just enough for her voice to take on a more serious tone, though her eyes sparkled with mischief. “I’m sure you’ll be impressed.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha met her gaze and, for just a fraction of a second, something softened in her eyes. She knew Rio wasn’t all talk. As much as the girl infuriated her with her constant teasing, Rio’s papers were always a stark contrast to her behavior in class—sharp, thoughtful, even brilliant at times.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Agatha wasn’t about to let her know that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I look forward to reading it,” she said, her voice measured, though Rio could hear the faintest hint of something else—approval, maybe? It only fueled her further.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As class ended and students began to filter out, Rio hung back, lounging at her desk while the others left. Agatha was packing up her things, her movements precise, her gaze firmly on her bag. Rio took the opportunity to push her luck, as always.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know,” Rio said, her tone just a bit softer, almost intimate now that they were alone. “You could just admit it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t look up. “Admit what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That you think about me,” Rio said, standing up slowly, her steps purposeful as she approached the desk. She leaned over, close enough that Agatha could feel her presence without having to look. “Even when you don’t want to.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s hands froze for a moment, still hovering over the stack of papers she was organizing. For a split second, Rio thought she had finally cracked her, but then Agatha straightened, sliding the last of the papers into her bag. She turned to Rio, her expression unreadable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Miss Vidal,” Agatha said smoothly, her voice like silk, “if I thought about you, you’d know.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With that, she brushed past Rio, leaving her standing there, watching her retreating form with a mixture of frustration and admiration.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She’s good,” Rio muttered to herself, smirking despite the fact that Agatha had—once again—evaded her flirtations.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio wasn’t one to give up easily. If anything, she enjoyed the chase.

     <span>
      Rio leaned against the picnic table outside the campus café, legs crossed and eyes hidden behind a pair of oversized sunglasses. She was tapping away at her laptop, the sun glinting off her dark hair, when her friend Jen plopped down next to her, carrying a crumpled bag of chips. A few others were gathered around, sprawled on the grass or sitting on the benches nearby, lazily discussing their workload for the week.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Man, Professor Harkness is a real piece of work,” Jen grumbled, shoving a handful of chips into her mouth. “I don’t get how she expects us to keep up with all this. Like, we’re not all trying to be geniuses.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio glanced up from her screen, lifting an eyebrow over the rim of her sunglasses but saying nothing just yet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Seriously,” added Alice, another friend, lounging next to Jen. “I mean, who cares about ethics, anyway? We’re all just here to get a degree, not to spend hours trying to impress some uptight professor who probably hasn't smiled in ten years.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The others chuckled, nodding in agreement. Jen leaned back, shaking her head. “And don’t even get me started on her comments. I put in
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       so
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      much work on my last paper, and she tore it apart like it was nothing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt her irritation flare. Sure, she joked about Professor Harkness, but she actually admired the way Agatha challenged them. The class wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t supposed to be. She glanced up at her friends, the lazy afternoon suddenly feeling a little less fun.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe if you put in more effort than you do complaining, she wouldn’t tear your paper apart,” Rio said, voice casual but pointed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen looked at her, half-grinning. “Oh, come on, Rio. You don’t seriously think Harkness is fair, do you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shut her laptop with a quiet snap, pulling off her sunglasses and narrowing her eyes at him. “Actually, yeah, I do. She doesn’t coddle anyone, but she’s not unfair. If your paper sucked, that’s on you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snorted. “You’re only saying that because you get off on pushing her buttons. Everyone knows you’re her favorite.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Favorite
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ?” Rio scoffed, standing up from the table. “Right. Because constantly being called out in front of the entire class for ‘wasting potential’ is exactly what I’m aiming for.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen raised her hands in mock surrender. “Whoa, whoa, calm down. Didn’t realize you were Harkness’s number one fan.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shot her a look that could cut glass, her frustration bubbling over. “You know what? Screw this.” She grabbed her bag, slinging it over her shoulder, her irritation growing. “Just because you can’t handle the work doesn’t mean she’s the problem.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Without waiting for a response, Rio stormed off, leaving her friends behind, mouths hanging open in shock. She wasn’t even entirely sure why she was so pissed. Maybe it was because she knew Agatha was a tough professor, but a good one. Maybe it was because deep down, she
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       wanted
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha to notice her for more than just the sarcastic troublemaker she pretended to be. Or maybe—Rio’s stomach tightened as the thought hit her—it was because she was starting to realize she actually cared what Agatha thought of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn’t have time to unpack all of that right now. Instead, she found herself heading straight for the administration building, feet moving faster as her thoughts whirled. She wasn’t planning to actually
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       talk
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      to Agatha—well, not beyond what was necessary—but maybe just being near her would settle her nerves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s office hours were quiet when Rio arrived. The halls were mostly empty, the faint hum of a vacuum down the corridor the only sign of life. The door to Agatha’s office was cracked open, and Rio hesitated outside for a moment, debating whether she should just turn back. But then the door opened fully, and Agatha’s sharp blue eyes landed on her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her voice a perfect blend of curiosity and skepticism. “Didn’t think you’d be one for office hours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gave her a half-shrug, leaning against the doorframe with that casual, lazy smile she always wore when she was feeling uncertain. “Figured I’d get some extra work in. You know, since you seem to think I have all this ‘wasted potential.’”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stepped aside, her eyes holding Rio’s for a beat longer than necessary, before gesturing for her to enter. The gesture was casual, but Rio noticed the way Agatha’s veins stood out against her pale skin, the subtle blue tracing the path along her forearm. Damn, how could something as simple as a hand make her pulse race? There was something about the quiet power in Agatha's movements that always drove her a little crazy, like she was holding back more than just her words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re always welcome to prove me wrong,” Agatha said, her voice carrying that smooth, almost teasing edge. Her lips barely quirked in what might’ve been amusement, though Rio could never quite tell.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Rio stepped past her, she let her fingers skim lightly along the doorframe, a casual move that belied the intentionality behind it. “Depends. Maybe I just like the company.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She felt Agatha’s eyes on her back as she moved further into the office, her smirk growing. Rio made a show of dropping her bag onto the chair in the far corner, all while sneaking another glance at Agatha. Agatha raised an eyebrow, watching Rio settle in like she belonged there. “Your paper was already done, as far as I recall. What’s this really about?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio flashed her a teasing grin, but there was something sincere underneath. “Maybe I’m just a perfectionist.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sat down at her desk, shaking her head with a small sigh. “I doubt that.” Rio did’t respond, pretending she was hard at work. Once she felt Agatha’s gaze fall off of her she chanced a glance back up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Today, Agatha was dressed more casually, a fitted button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to her elbows, exposing more of those damn arms. Her collarbone peeked out from where the top button was left undone, and Rio couldn’t help but imagine tracing the line with her thumb, feeling the warmth of her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Focus, Rio. She tried to steady herself, but her gaze kept drifting back. Agatha was at her desk now, sorting through papers with the same meticulousness she applied to everything. Rio caught sight of a strand of Agatha’s dark hair that had come loose, dangling dangerously close to her face as she leaned over. For a split second, she imagined tucking it behind her ear, feeling the soft texture between her fingers. She clenched her jaw, annoyed at how easily her thoughts ran wild around this woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glanced up, catching Rio’s eye, and Rio quickly looked away, pretending to dig through her bag. But she could feel Agatha watching her, could feel the weight of that knowing gaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If you’re actually here for work, Rio, why does it feel like you’re stalling?” Agatha’s voice broke through her thoughts, as cool and steady as ever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio bit back a grin. “What, no faith in my ability to multitask?” She raised an eyebrow, her tone dripping with mock innocence as she pulled out her laptop and opened it on her lap. She wasn’t fooling anyone, least of all Agatha, but the game had become half the fun.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes narrowed slightly, though there was no real heat behind the look. “Let me guess—you're here to charm your way into an extension you don’t actually need?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leaned back in the chair, crossing one leg over the other. “Nah, paper’s finished. It’s brilliant, actually,” she added with a smirk, watching Agatha’s reaction closely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolled her eyes and turned her attention back to the stack of papers on her desk, her lips twitching as if fighting back a smile. “Well, if that’s the case, you know where the door is.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio didn’t move. Instead, she stayed put, letting the quiet between them stretch out. She wasn’t here to leave—not yet. No, there was something about this shared silence, the space between their words, that kept pulling her in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Agatha continued grading, Rio kept stealing glances, trying not to be too obvious. Her fingers tapped idly against the keys of her laptop, but she wasn’t really typing. Not with Agatha sitting there, looking like that—focused, intense, and completely unaware of the effect she had on Rio. Or maybe she knew. She always seemed to know more than she let on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      From the way Agatha’s shirt clung to her frame, to the curve of her wrist as she flipped through the stack of papers, it all drove Rio insane in the best possible way. She shifted in her seat, biting her lip as her gaze lingered just a second too long on the way Agatha’s fingers moved across the desk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glanced up suddenly, catching Rio staring. “You’re quiet today,” she remarked, one eyebrow raised.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grinned, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Figured I’d try something new. You know, to keep you on your toes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mm-hmm,” Agatha murmured, her eyes sharp as they met Rio’s. The air between them felt heavy, electric. “Is that so?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t help but laugh softly, shaking her head as she leaned back in the chair. “You always know when I’m up to something.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ve had enough practice,” Agatha said, a smirk playing at her lips as she went back to grading. Rio was happy she hadn’t asked her to leave yet, the silence was comfortable. She figured she may as well finish up work from her other classes. Refocusing on her laptop, Rio dove back into her work, following Agatha’s lead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At one point, Agatha looked up, her gaze flickering over Rio as she leaned forward in her chair, the sunlight streaming through the window casting shadows along the sharp lines of her face. Agatha couldn’t help but notice the way Rio’s shirt clung to her shoulders, or the way she chewed on her bottom lip in concentration. The shift in Rio’s mood, from playful to serious, was intriguing. It made her wonder what lay beneath the sarcasm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      On the other side of the room, Rio glanced up just in time to catch Agatha watching her. She didn’t look away, not immediately. There was a flicker of something between them—recognition, maybe? Or just an understanding. Agatha looked beautiful, sitting there so composed in her tailored suit, her lips pursed in concentration, the stray strands of silver hair catching the light just so.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Rio asked, her voice low but teasing. “Didn’t know you were capable of staring.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, and she turned her attention back to her work. “Finish your work, Miss Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled softly, shaking her head. “Yes, ma’am.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They worked in silence again, but the air between them was thick with unspoken words. Neither would acknowledge it aloud, not yet. For now, they were content to steal glances, to play the same game they’d been playing for weeks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The only difference was, now, they both knew they weren’t just imagining the heat.

    <p>
     <span>
      The sun had dipped below the horizon by the time Agatha Harkness unlocked her front door, stepping into the quiet sanctuary of her home. The sharp click of her heels on the hardwood floor echoed through the entryway as she tossed her keys into a bowl on the console table, exhaling the stress of the day. She pulled off her blazer, draping it over the back of a chair before making her way to the kitchen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She loved this part of the evening—the stillness, the solitude. It was her chance to unwind, to shed the tough exterior she wore at work and allow herself to simply be. The days were always long, filled with students, meetings, papers. But nights? Nights were hers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Pouring herself a glass of wine, Agatha leaned against the counter for a moment, taking a sip of the dark red liquid. The smooth warmth of it slid down her throat, and she let her eyes close briefly, savoring the silence. The wine was rich, the kind that usually calmed her nerves and allowed her to settle into her evening routine. Tonight, though, something felt... off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed the thought aside and made her way to the living room, glass in hand. Flipping through the channels on the TV, she landed on a classic black-and-white movie, something familiar and mindless. The kind of movie she didn’t need to focus on, where the dialogue was predictable and the plot could be forgotten. It was exactly what she needed. Or so she thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The first half hour passed without much trouble, her attention drifting between the movie and her thoughts. But as she took another sip of wine, her mind wandered back to the office, to the unexpected visitor who had stayed longer than anticipated.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s grip tightened slightly on the glass as the image of Rio leaning against her doorframe, that lazy, confident smile playing at her lips, flashed in her mind. Rio always walked into her space like she belonged there, like the room was hers to command, no matter how much Agatha tried to keep control.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She swirled the wine in her glass, feeling the tension begin to rise in her chest. Her eyes focused on the screen, but all she could see was Rio—lounging in the student chair, her legs stretched out casually, fingers tapping against the laptop keys in a rhythm that seemed more for show than actual work. Agatha had seen the way Rio's shirt had ridden up slightly, exposing that strip of tan, smooth skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her breath hitched, just for a second.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The memory was too clear, too visceral. She could almost feel the heat radiating off Rio as she sat across the room, the air between them charged with something unsaid, something unacknowledged. It wasn’t like Agatha to be so distracted, least of all by a student. But Rio wasn’t like the others, was she?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Another sip of wine, another wave of frustration. This was ridiculous. She had always prided herself on her control, her ability to compartmentalize. But Rio... Rio made it difficult. She had that way about her, that effortless confidence, the way she could say something seemingly innocuous and yet it would linger, gnawing at Agatha's thoughts long after the conversation had ended.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's eyes drifted to the half-empty wine glass, her thoughts growing louder with every sip. She could still hear the sound of Rio’s voice in her head, low and teasing. The way Rio would push and pull, knowing just how far to go without crossing the line—though sometimes she danced right on the edge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I just like the company.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha huffed a small laugh, shaking her head as she set the glass down on the coffee table. She had brushed it off in the moment, her usual cool demeanor in place. But the truth was, Rio's words had struck a nerve. There was something in the way Rio said it, something in the way she lingered in the room even after the work was done, that had stuck with Agatha longer than it should have.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She ran a hand through her hair, letting it fall loose from the tight bun she wore all day. The strands tumbled down, framing her face, and she leaned back into the cushions, closing her eyes. Her mind kept wandering, and despite her attempts to push it away, she couldn’t stop thinking about the way Rio watched her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Those deep brown eyes, tracking her every movement. It wasn’t subtle, and it wasn’t just admiration for a professor’s authority. It was something else—something more intense, more focused.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha could still feel it, the weight of that gaze lingering on her even after Rio had left the office. The way Rio’s eyes had followed her hands as she sorted papers, her fingers tracing the grain of the desk, the soft flick of her wrist as she jotted down notes. Agatha had pretended not to notice, but of course she had. She noticed everything. Especially when it came to Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Damn her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With another sigh, Agatha reached for the glass again, taking a longer sip this time. The warmth of the alcohol spread through her, loosening the knot in her chest. But her thoughts didn’t settle. They only became clearer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was something about Rio that unnerved her, but not in the way that most students did. Rio wasn’t just a challenge because of her sharp wit or her tendency to push Agatha’s buttons. No, it was something else—something about the way Rio didn’t seem intimidated by her, how she treated their exchanges like a game.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And maybe, just maybe, Agatha had started to enjoy the game too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her thoughts wandered to the way Rio’s voice dipped lower when she was teasing, that playful drawl that Agatha was beginning to associate with more than just sarcasm. There was something intimate about it, something that set her on edge. The kind of edge that had her thinking about Rio even when she was supposed to be relaxing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha closed her eyes again, tilting her head back against the cushions. She could still hear the soft echo of Rio’s laugh from earlier, the way she had said, “Yes, ma’am,” like it was some kind of joke, but with a tone that made Agatha’s pulse quicken.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was supposed to be watching TV, enjoying her evening, not thinking about the way her student’s shirt clung to her shoulders or how her eyes sparkled when she was up to something. She wasn’t supposed to be picturing Rio’s tan skin or imagining what it would feel like to—
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sat up abruptly, the movement breaking her train of thought. This was absurd. She was a professional, a grown woman. This was nothing more than a passing distraction. She stood up, pacing to the kitchen and back, glass still in hand. Maybe another glass of wine would help calm her nerves, or maybe she just needed to get out of her own head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She glanced at the bottle but hesitated. The truth was, it wasn’t just the wine that was making her thoughts drift toward Rio. It was Rio herself—her presence, her attitude, the way she seemed to seep into Agatha’s mind without even trying.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pressed a hand to her temple, letting out a long breath. Tomorrow, she would focus. Tomorrow, she would get back to her routine, her control. But tonight, in the quiet of her home, with the taste of wine on her lips and the image of Rio lingering in her mind, she allowed herself a moment of weakness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just one moment to admit to herself what she would never say aloud.

      The air in Agatha Harkness's lecture hall always seemed thicker on debate days. As she stood at the front of the room, her sharp eyes tracked the students filing in, taking their usual seats. Jen and Alice chatted quietly as they settled into their places, their usual energy on display. Lilia entered with her head down, unassuming as ever, and took a spot by the window. Billy, of course, strolled in with an air of self-importance, immediately taking a seat toward the front where Agatha couldn't miss him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it was Rio Vidal, entering last, who held Agatha’s gaze a little longer than necessary.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s presence had a gravitational pull of its own—there was a natural confidence to the way she moved, like she belonged wherever she was. Today, her shirt rode up slightly as she tossed her bag onto the desk, revealing a glimpse of tan skin that caught Agatha’s attention before she could stop herself. Rio’s jeans were slung low on her hips, casual and yet somehow deliberate, and the edge of a smirk tugged at her lips as she stretched lazily in her chair, her eyes flicking up to meet Agatha’s.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Caught.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio didn’t look away. In fact, she leaned back in her seat, making a point of letting her eyes sweep over Agatha with the same intensity. The playful push and pull between them hummed in the air, unspoken but undeniable. Agatha raised an eyebrow, forcing herself to appear unaffected, but her heart skipped an unexpected beat at the boldness of Rio’s gaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A tease, Agatha thought, with a sharp inward breath. Always teasing. And yet, it was working—more than it should have.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s smirk deepened as if she could read Agatha’s thoughts, her fingers tapping a slow, deliberate rhythm on the edge of the desk. Agatha finally tore her gaze away, her face perfectly composed, though she could still feel the heat of Rio’s eyes on her. Rio was playing the game again, pushing Agatha’s limits while barely moving from her seat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned her attention back to the class. She needed to focus. She was their professor, after all. But the energy between her and Rio lingered like a static charge, crackling beneath the surface.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Today, we’re diving deeper into ethical theories and their applications in modern society,” Agatha began, her voice as steady as ever. “I expect everyone to engage in the discussion. This is not a time for passivity.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she scanned the room, her gaze landed on Rio once more, who was now casually reclining in her chair, watching her with that same glint in her eyes. Their silent battle continued, a delicate dance of power and intrigue. Rio would push, Agatha would resist. But both of them knew they were walking a very fine line.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Across the room, Billy was sitting upright, his pen twirling between his fingers as he prepared for his moment to shine. Agatha always had his attention, though today it seemed more intense. Lilia, sitting beside him, glanced over at him, her quiet presence a stark contrast to Billy’s obvious ambition. Jen and Alice were in their usual spots near the middle, chatting quietly until Agatha’s voice brought them to attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “As we consider utilitarianism and Kantian ethics, I’d like to hear some practical examples of where these theories might come into conflict,” Agatha said, pacing slightly. She liked watching the wheels turn in her students' heads, though some—like Billy—tended to try too hard.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy raised his hand confidently. “Professor, wouldn’t you say that utilitarianism is ultimately the more humane approach because it seeks the greater good for the majority? Kantian ethics, while noble in principle, is too rigid. It doesn’t allow for the nuances of real-life situations.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turned to him, her expression impassive but interested. “An interesting point, Billy, but it’s worth noting that Kantian ethics centers on the intrinsic value of human beings and their rights. It doesn’t justify using individuals as mere means to an end.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio, who had been half-paying attention, glanced over at Billy, her mouth twitching as if she were holding back a comment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy pressed on. “But isn’t that idealistic, Professor? In the real world, sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. Kantian ethics doesn’t account for that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nodded thoughtfully, not giving Billy the immediate praise he seemed to be seeking. “Sacrifice, yes, but at what cost, Billy? Who gets to decide who’s expendable?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy smiled, leaning forward, his tone dipping into something almost smug. “Well, I’d imagine people in positions of power, people like yourself, have to make those tough decisions all the time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a pause, the weight of his words hanging in the room. Rio’s fingers stopped drumming as she narrowed her eyes at him. Something about the way Billy spoke, like he was trying to undermine Agatha while playing at respect, irritated her. She leaned back in her chair, raising her hand with exaggerated calm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha noticed immediately. “Yes, Miss Vidal?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked, her voice slow and casual as she locked eyes with Billy. “I don’t know. It sounds like you’re just trying to impress the professor, Billy. Last I checked, we’re not running the world from this classroom. Maybe leave the power decisions to someone with more experience.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy shot her a look, clearly not expecting to be called out. “I’m not trying to impress anyone, Rio. I’m just stating facts. The world isn’t black and white.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugged, feigning indifference. “Neither is ethics. But your argument sounds pretty black and white to me. You’re acting like you know exactly how the world works, but maybe what you’re missing is that Professor Harkness isn’t asking for simple answers.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy frowned, leaning back in his chair. “And what exactly are you suggesting, Rio? That we should just sit around debating theoreticals while the world moves on without us?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leaned forward, her tone sharpening slightly, her eyes flicking between Billy and Agatha. “No, I’m saying that you’re missing the point. You’re talking about making sacrifices, but who’s deciding that? Because last I checked, Kant cared about people. Real people, not just numbers or some theoretical ‘greater good’ that sounds nice on paper but doesn’t play out in reality.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy scoffed, clearly growing more defensive. “So you’re saying Kantian ethics should always apply, no matter the situation? What if the stakes are life and death?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s smirk faded slightly as her eyes turned serious, her gaze cutting through the room. “I’m saying it’s not that simple. Ethics is messy. Maybe instead of playing philosopher-king, you should try listening.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha watched the exchange with increasing fascination. There was something undeniably attractive about Rio’s boldness, the way she defended her stance without falling into the same traps Billy had. She didn’t posture, didn’t need to prove herself the way he did. Instead, she seemed to be focused entirely on cutting through the noise, getting to the heart of things.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The tension between Rio and Billy filled the room as the other students watched the verbal sparring. Jen and Alice exchanged glances, and even Lilia looked a little more attentive than usual, her eyes darting between the two.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha finally intervened, though her voice remained calm and composed. “Both of you raise valid points. It’s important to understand that ethical theory rarely provides clear-cut answers. That’s what makes it so challenging.” She paused, her eyes locking with Rio’s for just a moment longer than necessary. “But what I appreciate is the willingness to engage with the complexity, rather than reduce it to something simple.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy, still looking slightly disgruntled, crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair. “I suppose that’s fair.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio, sensing victory, gave Billy a final, knowing glance before relaxing back into her seat, her smirk reappearing as she crossed her arms lazily. “Glad we cleared that up.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The class settled into a quieter rhythm after that, though Agatha couldn’t shake the charged energy in the room. As she continued the lecture, she found herself more aware of Rio than ever before, glancing her way when she made another witty comment or responded to a question with her usual mix of sarcasm and brilliance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy’s attempts to redeem himself in the discussion felt flat after that, and while the other students chimed in here and there, it was Rio who held Agatha’s attention—Rio, who had managed to defend her without ever making it obvious, who spoke with a confidence that both impressed and intrigued her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When the class ended and students began to filter out, Rio hung back as usual, taking her time gathering her things. Agatha stood at the front, watching the others leave, her thoughts already starting to drift toward the quiet that would follow once the room was empty.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But as Rio approached her, that familiar smirk tugging at the corner of her lips, Agatha felt a spark of something else—something she was less and less inclined to push away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’ve been busy defending me today,” Agatha said smoothly, crossing her arms as she leaned against her desk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “I mean, someone had to. Can’t let people like Billy think they know everything, right?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s lips quirked into a small smile. “I can handle my own battles, you know.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grinned, her eyes twinkling with that playful light. “Yeah, I know. But where’s the fun in that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t reply right away, her eyes lingering on Rio a moment too long. There it was again—the pull between them, the electric charge that neither of them acknowledged out loud. Instead, Agatha simply nodded toward the door. “I’ll see you next class, Miss Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio winked as she turned to leave. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the door closed behind her, Agatha let out a slow breath, her thoughts swirling once again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This game between them wasn’t ending any time soon, and truth be told, she wasn’t sure she wanted it to.

      The diner wasn’t Rio’s usual spot—too far from campus and not the trendy kind of place she typically liked. It had a retro charm, with checkered floors and neon signs that buzzed softly in the window, and tonight it felt perfect. Quiet and familiar. A place where she could meet up with an old friend without the constant pressure of school.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio arrived early and slid into a corner booth, stretching her legs out in front of her and pulling her phone from her pocket. She wore her usual laid-back outfit: a crop top that showed just a hint of her midriff beneath the loose plaid shirt she had layered on. It wasn’t flashy, but it was enough to make her feel like herself—confident, comfortable, and effortlessly cool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she tapped through her messages, her eyes wandered to the other patrons, idly observing. It wasn’t until she turned toward the back of the diner that she saw a familiar figure sitting in a booth, engrossed in a menu. Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest.
     </span>
     <b>
      Agatha? Here?
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sat with her legs crossed and her hair falling in soft waves around her face. She looked out of place in the relaxed diner, her tailored blouse and dark jeans giving her an air of elegance that seemed to attract attention even in such a laid-back setting. Agatha, so often poised and professional, looked almost relaxed tonight—her guard down in a way Rio rarely saw.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiled to herself, slipping her phone into her pocket as she got up and made her way over to Agatha’s booth. She was curious, almost excited. There was something thrilling about seeing Agatha outside of school, away from their usual boundaries.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Didn’t think I’d find you here, Professor,” Rio said as she reached the booth, her voice low and playful.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looked up, surprise flashing across her face before it softened into something warmer. “Rio,” she replied, her lips curving into a small smile. “What a coincidence.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mind if I sit?” Rio asked, already sliding into the booth across from her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha raised an eyebrow, but there was no real protest in her eyes. “It’s a free country.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grinned, settling in and leaning back comfortably. “So what brings you to this fine establishment?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Dinner,” Agatha said, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Believe it or not, I do eat.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I figured you survived on the tears of overworked students,” Rio teased.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “Only on particularly difficult grading days.” Agatha’s smile widened just slightly, a rare sight that made Rio’s stomach do a little flip. “And what about you? What are you doing all the way out here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Meeting up with an old friend,” Rio said, her tone casual. “Thought I’d branch out a little. Try a different scene.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hummed, nodding slightly. “You’re braver than most of my students. They rarely venture beyond the campus bubble.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I’ve always been a bit of a risk-taker,” Rio replied, leaning forward slightly, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “But you already knew that, didn’t you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “I did.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So,” Agatha asked, breaking the comfortable silence, “what do you do with your time when you’re not terrorizing my classroom?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled, pretending to think hard about it. “Well, apart from plotting your demise?” She leaned back in her seat, a teasing grin spreading across her face. “I’ve been binging this new show, actually.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Binging?” Agatha echoed, arching an eyebrow. “Isn’t that something the ‘youth’ do when they should be working?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please, you’re not that old,” Rio shot back, earning a laugh from Agatha. She felt a spark of satisfaction at making her laugh so easily. “Anyway, it’s called
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Twisted Fates
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      —super dramatic, ridiculous plot twists every other episode, and characters that are somehow both infuriating and lovable. It’s amazing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Twisted Fates
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ?” Agatha repeated, an amused smile tugging at her lips. “That sounds… intriguing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s not ‘intriguing,’ it’s a train wreck in the best way possible,” Rio corrected, leaning forward in her excitement. “There’s this one character—totally unhinged but also kind of brilliant—and she has this habit of breaking the fourth wall. I swear, every time she does it, it’s like she’s calling me out personally.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sounds like you’ve found your spirit animal,” Agatha quipped, her eyes sparkling with humor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right?” Rio laughed, shaking her head. “But seriously, it’s one of those shows where you think you know what’s coming, and then—bam—everything’s upside down. The main characters are always making these terrible decisions, and it’s like watching a car crash. You want to look away, but you can’t.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Rio talked, she gestured animatedly, her eyes lighting up with genuine excitement. Agatha noticed how different Rio seemed in this moment—her usual sarcastic edge softened, replaced by an earnest enthusiasm that made her look almost… happy. It was a side of Rio Agatha hadn’t seen before, and she found herself leaning in, genuinely captivated.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And the drama,” Rio continued, her voice rising with excitement. “It’s so over the top! There’s this love triangle that keeps getting messier and messier, and it’s like every time they resolve something, a new problem pops up. It’s exhausting, but I can’t stop watching.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn’t help but smile, charmed by the way Rio was geeking out. “It must be quite the spectacle to keep you so invested.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You have no idea,” Rio said, shaking her head. “I’m halfway through the latest season, and I already know I’m going to need therapy by the end of it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughed, a warm, genuine sound that made Rio’s grin widen. “I didn’t take you for the dramatic type,” Agatha remarked, her tone teasing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, I’m dramatic,” Rio replied, leaning back with a mock sigh. “But only when the situation calls for it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what calls for it in this show?” Agatha asked, genuinely curious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Everything,” Rio replied, eyes wide. “There’s betrayal, forbidden love, a mystery subplot that keeps getting darker… and did I mention the soundtrack is incredible? They play this haunting melody whenever the main antagonist shows up, and it’s like—chills every time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sounds like it’s got everything,” Agatha mused, resting her chin on her hand as she watched Rio with a look of quiet amusement. “And here I thought you only watched documentaries or those true-crime series everyone seems to be obsessed with.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, I have layers,” Rio said defensively, though she couldn’t help but laugh. “Besides, watching real life gets depressing. I need an escape every now and then.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can understand that,” Agatha admitted, her tone softer, more thoughtful.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a beat of silence between them, and Rio felt a strange warmth in her chest, realizing that Agatha wasn’t just humoring her. She was listening—really listening. It was a small thing, but it felt different from most conversations Rio had with other people. She was used to being seen as the troublemaker, the joker. But Agatha seemed genuinely interested in what she had to say, and it made Rio want to keep talking, to keep sharing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, do you watch anything?” Rio asked, tilting her head curiously. “Or are you all business, all the time?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha considered the question for a moment, her lips curving into a small, almost shy smile. “I have a few guilty pleasures,” she admitted, glancing away as if she were embarrassed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, this I have to hear,” Rio pressed, leaning in with a playful grin. “What’s the big secret, Professor?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighed, but the smile didn’t leave her face. “If you must know… I have a weakness for period dramas.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Like
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Pride and Prejudice
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      and all that?” Rio guessed, her eyebrows rising in surprise.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Something like that,” Agatha confirmed, looking almost sheepish. “There’s something soothing about the slower pace, the attention to detail. And yes, perhaps the romanticism appeals to me on occasion.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wow,” Rio said, a little awestruck. “Here I thought you were all books and no fun.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can be fun,” Agatha protested, her eyes narrowing playfully. “You just never give me the chance to show it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, is that a challenge?” Rio quipped, grinning. “Because I’m up for it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but at that moment, the door to the diner swung open, and a familiar voice broke the bubble around them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha! Sorry, I’m late!” Wanda called as she approached, oblivious to the shift in atmosphere. She slid into the booth next to Agatha without a second thought, wrapping her arms around her in a tight hug. “Sorry babe, I was stuck in the worst traffic.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiled, and it was a genuine smile, not the controlled one Rio was so used to seeing. “It’s fine,” she replied, resting a hand on Wanda’s arm in a gesture that felt far too intimate for Rio’s liking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, hi!” Wanda said, turning to Rio with a bright smile. “I didn’t see you there! Are you a friend of Agatha’s?” She was gorgeous. Long red hair, emerald eyes, soft curves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio forced herself to smile at Wanda’s bright greeting, but something twisted uncomfortably in her chest. It was as if the easy connection she and Agatha had just shared was suddenly severed. She hated how quickly that wall went up between them, hated that the moment was over.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio wasn’t the only one affected. Agatha could feel the shift too, and when she glanced back at Rio, there was something almost apologetic in her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, I should get back to my table,” Rio said, her voice betraying none of the jealousy simmering beneath her words. “My friend will be here soon.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of course,” Agatha replied smoothly, but Rio could see the reluctance in her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Rio walked away, she couldn’t help but feel that she had gotten closer to seeing the real Agatha—only to have that glimpse snatched away. But it wasn’t over yet. Not by a long shot.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio returned to her booth, trying to shake off the lingering irritation. Amora arrived shortly after, breezing in with her usual confidence. She slid into the booth and planted a kiss on Rio’s cheek, her lips lingering just a second longer than necessary.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look amazing, as always,” Amora said, her voice smooth and flirtatious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thanks,” Rio replied, forcing a smile as she glanced over her shoulder. Agatha was watching them, her expression unreadable, but Rio could see the tension in the set of her jaw.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They ordered, and Amora started chatting animatedly about her recent travels, but Rio’s focus kept drifting back to the other booth. She saw the way Agatha and Wanda laughed together, the way Wanda’s hand lingered on Agatha’s arm, the way Agatha’s eyes kept flicking back to Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was infuriating, but Rio refused to let it show. She laughed at Amora’s jokes, leaned in close when Amora showed her pictures on her phone, and pretended she wasn’t watching Agatha’s every move.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For her part, Agatha tried to focus on Wanda’s stories, but her mind kept drifting. Every time she glanced over at Rio, she felt a flash of something that she refused to name. When Amora kissed Rio’s cheek and whispered something in her ear, Agatha felt an irrational surge of jealousy. She had no right to feel that way—Rio was her student, after all—but the jealousy simmered beneath the surface, impossible to ignore.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, are you listening?” Wanda asked, nudging her playfully.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of course,” Agatha lied, forcing a smile. But her eyes drifted back to Rio just in time to see Amora sliding to Rio’s side of the booth to share her milkshake, Rio caught Agatha’s gaze lingering on them, the tension between them simmering just beneath the surface. Agatha’s smile was tight, her fingers drumming absently on the table.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The tension became unbearable, and finally, Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. She stood abruptly. “Excuse me, Wanda. I’ll be right back.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wanda raised an eyebrow but didn’t question it. “Okay,” she said, turning back to her menu.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha walked quickly to the bathroom, her heart racing as she tried to steady herself. This was ridiculous. She was a grown woman, not a lovesick teenager.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The bathroom was quiet and dimly lit, the fluorescent light above the mirror casting a soft glow over the tiled walls. Agatha stood at the sink, hands gripping the edge of the counter as she took a deep, steadying breath. She tried to focus on the feel of the cool porcelain beneath her fingers, but her mind was racing, the brief interaction with Rio still fresh in her memory.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She glanced up at the mirror, catching her own reflection, but then the bathroom door creaked open behind her, and she saw Rio’s reflection instead. Her heart stuttered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Really?” Agatha asked, turning to face Rio with a sharpness that masked her unease. “You followed me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I just wanted to check on you,” Rio replied, her voice low and teasing, but there was a genuine softness beneath the mischief.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha crossed her arms, her jaw tightening slightly as she tried to keep her composure. “I’m fine,” she said, though her voice lacked its usual conviction. Her eyes flicked over Rio’s face, lingering on her lips for just a second too long before darting away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio noticed, and the corner of her mouth twitched into a grin. She leaned against the wall, tilting her head as she studied Agatha. The loose plaid shirt draped off Rio’s shoulders, exposing the curve of her collarbone and the strip of tanned skin at her waist. Agatha’s eyes couldn’t seem to stay away from it, and Rio knew it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you sure?” Rio pressed, her voice dropping lower. “Because you seemed a little rattled out there.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not rattled,” Agatha replied, but her voice was barely above a whisper now. She tried to sound firm, but there was an edge of vulnerability that she couldn’t quite hide. Her gaze drifted back to Rio’s midriff, the muscles there flexing slightly as Rio shifted her weight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you looking at?” Rio asked, her tone both challenging and amused as she took a step forward.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snapped her eyes back up, and the flush that crept up her neck didn’t go unnoticed. “Nothing,” she said defensively, but even as she spoke, her eyes betrayed her, flickering down once more. She forced herself to look at Rio’s face, but the intensity in Rio’s gaze only made it harder to maintain her composure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh-huh,” Rio said, her grin widening. “You’re a terrible liar, Professor.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not lying,” Agatha insisted, her voice wavering slightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then what are you doing?” Rio murmured, her voice low and rough as she stepped closer, the distance between them shrinking to almost nothing. The air between them felt heavy, charged with something neither of them wanted to name.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know,” Agatha admitted, her voice barely audible. Her gaze dropped again, tracing the line of Rio’s waist where the hem of her crop top met bare skin. It was maddeningly distracting, and she clenched her fists at her sides, trying to keep herself in check.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s eyes couldn’t help but wander, taking in the sight of Agatha with her hair down. It was such a rare look—soft waves framing her face, a stark contrast to the tight bun she usually wore. Rio felt a pang of longing, the urge to reach out and run her fingers through those dark strands almost overwhelming. There was something about seeing Agatha this way, unguarded and effortlessly beautiful, that made Rio’s breath catch in her throat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it wasn’t just her hair. Agatha’s jeans were fitted in a way that left very little to the imagination, hugging her hips and legs with a kind of casual perfection that Rio found both maddening and mesmerizing. Every movement seemed deliberate, every shift emphasizing the elegance in Agatha’s figure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio took another step forward, close enough now that Agatha could feel the heat radiating from her skin. Her eyes were dark, intense, and Agatha felt a thrill run through her at the way Rio was looking at her—as if she were the only thing in the world that mattered.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why don’t you tell me what’s really bothering you?” Rio asked, her voice almost a whisper, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s heart was racing, and she hated how easily Rio got under her skin, how effortlessly she broke through the walls Agatha had spent years building. But she couldn’t bring herself to pull away—not when Rio was so close, not when the temptation to close the gap between them was so overwhelming.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe I’m tired of watching you flirt with everyone else,” Agatha muttered, her voice edged with frustration and something dangerously close to jealousy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio raised an eyebrow, her grin softening into something more sincere. “And here I thought you didn’t care.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t,” Agatha lied, but her voice faltered, and Rio heard it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s expression shifted, her teasing grin replaced by something more intense, more vulnerable. “Then why does it bother you so much?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t answer, but the silence between them spoke louder than any words could. Rio took another step forward, and now their bodies were almost touching, the tension between them almost unbearable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s gaze dropped, tracing the line of Agatha’s jeans again—how they hugged her hips and accentuated her curves. She let out a slow breath, trying to keep her focus, but it was impossible when Agatha was standing so close, looking so effortlessly beautiful.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look different tonight,” Rio said softly, her voice rough with something she didn’t want to admit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Different?” Agatha echoed, her brow furrowing slightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Relaxed,” Rio explained, her fingers twitching at her sides, fighting the urge to reach out and touch. “It suits you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha felt a warmth spread through her at Rio’s words, and she hated how much it affected her. But she couldn’t deny the flutter of excitement in her chest, the way her heart seemed to beat faster in response.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you,” Agatha murmured, her voice low, almost breathless. “You never seem to take anything seriously, and yet… here you are.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled softly, shaking her head. “Maybe I’m just good at hiding it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes softened, and for a moment, the weight of everything unsaid hung heavy between them. Agatha’s fingers twitched at her sides, and before she could stop herself, she reached out, her hand skimming lightly over Rio’s exposed skin the touch light and hesitant, but it sent a shiver down Rio’s spine. Rio’s breath hitched. The connection between them crackled, an electric current that neither of them seemed willing—or able—to break.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha…” Rio began, her voice thick with something unspoken. When Agatha’s fingers brushed Rio’s waist again, lingering just a moment longer than necessary, Rio felt a shiver run through her. The touch was light, almost hesitant, but it sent a wave of heat rolling through her. Rio’s heart was pounding, her thoughts a chaotic mix of desire and frustration.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She let out a breath, trying to steady herself, but the intensity of Agatha’s gaze made it impossible to stay unaffected. Agatha’s blue eyes were dark with something unspoken, and Rio couldn’t resist teasing, even though she was feeling anything but calm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If you keep doing that,” Rio murmured, her voice rough with barely restrained longing, “while looking like that… I might forget to behave.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes widened slightly, the words hanging between them, heavy with implication. Rio’s lips twitched into a lopsided grin, her fingers itching to reach out and trace the curve of Agatha’s waist, to pull her closer and let the tension between them finally snap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she held herself back, the air between them thick with the weight of everything unsaid.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, it was Agatha who was brave. She closed the remaining distance between them, her fingers tightening on Rio’s waist as she leaned in. Rio’s breath hitched, her pulse quickening at the feel of Agatha’s touch—light, deliberate, and almost possessive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe you’re right,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. Her eyes flickered up to meet Rio’s, dark and intense. “Maybe I am jealous.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The confession sent a jolt of heat through Rio, and she couldn’t help the grin that spread across her face. “I knew it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And yet, here you are,” Rio replied, her voice low and rough as she leaned in, close enough that their breaths mingled, the space between them almost nonexistent.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their gazes locked, and for a moment, the rest of the world seemed to fade away. Agatha’s fingers tightened on Rio’s waist, her touch both a challenge and a promise. Rio’s own hands moved, almost of their own accord, brushing lightly over Agatha’s hips, her fingers tracing the curve of her jeans. The heat between them was suffocating, and Rio felt like she was drowning in it, in Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers grazed the exposed skin at her waist, the touch light but searing. She felt a rush of desire, the temptation to close the distance between them, to finally give in to what had been simmering between them for so long.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But just as their lips were about to meet, the sound of voices approaching the bathroom door shattered the moment. Agatha pulled back abruptly, her eyes wide and her breathing unsteady.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio let her hands drop, frustration and longing burning under her skin. She clenched her jaw, trying to steady herself, but the loss of contact felt like a cold shock after the heat of their near-kiss.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hesitated for a moment, as if debating what to say, before leaning in one last time. Her lips brushed against Rio’s ear, her voice barely a whisper. “You drive me crazy,” she murmured, the words laced with both frustration and longing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And with that, she slipped out of the bathroom, leaving Rio standing there, breathless and rattled, her pulse still racing from the intensity of what had just happened.

     <span>
      Rio sat in the library, pretending to read. She wasn’t focused on the book in front of her; she hadn’t been able to concentrate on anything since last night. Agatha’s words, her touch, that almost-kiss in the diner bathroom—it was all playing on a loop in her mind. She sighed, running a hand through her hair, trying to shake off the lingering thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When that didn’t work, she decided to stop pretending.
     </span>
     <b>
      If I can’t focus, maybe I need to confront this head-on.
     </b>
     <span>
      The decision felt reckless, but avoiding Agatha wasn’t going to make the tension disappear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gathered her things, abandoning the library for the administration building. As she walked through the halls, she mentally rehearsed what she might say to Agatha.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Hey, Professor, remember last night? Yeah, about that—”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      She shook her head, chuckling under her breath. There was no way she could be that blunt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s office door was slightly ajar when Rio arrived. She stood outside for a moment, steadying her breath before knocking lightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come in,” Agatha’s voice called from within.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pushed the door open, and there she was, sitting behind her desk with her reading glasses perched delicately on her nose. Agatha’s hair was pulled back today, but a few strands had escaped, framing her face. She looked focused, her fingers poised over a stack of papers, and Rio felt her heart stutter at the sight. There was something about seeing Agatha in this element—composed, intellectual, with that air of authority that was equal parts frustrating and captivating.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Miss Vidal,” Agatha greeted, her tone seemingly neutral but the small smile that broke through when she realized who was at her door probably gave her away. “This is… unexpected.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Figured I’d get some extra feedback on my project,” Rio said, trying to sound casual. She leaned against the doorframe with that signature smirk, but inside, her nerves were buzzing. She watched Agatha remove her glasses slowly, placing them on her desk with careful precision. Even that small movement felt significant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, you’ve piqued my curiosity,” Agatha replied, her eyes narrowing slightly in suspicion. “What exactly do you need help with?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio walked further into the office, pretending to consider the question. She couldn’t help but notice how Agatha’s fitted blouse seemed to hug her figure in all the right places, the way the top button strained just slightly as she leaned forward. Rio felt a flush creep up her neck, and she forced herself to focus.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” Rio began, trying to sound serious, “there’s a section on moral dilemmas that’s been giving me trouble. I was hoping you could clarify a few things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha arched an eyebrow. “You’re asking for clarification?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know, shocking,” Rio deadpanned, grinning. “But even I get stuck sometimes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha leaned back in her chair, studying Rio for a moment. “Alright, take a seat.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio obliged, sliding into the chair opposite Agatha’s desk. She placed her notebook on the table, even though it was mostly an excuse to have something to fidget with. Agatha watched her, eyes sharp and perceptive, and Rio felt that familiar thrill of being under her scrutiny. There was a part of her that craved it, that wanted to see how far she could push Agatha before she pushed back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, what’s the dilemma?” Agatha asked, her voice steady.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” Rio began, her fingers idly tracing the edge of her notebook, “there’s this case study about a political leader who chose to bend the rules to achieve a greater good. It got me thinking—how do you decide when to break the rules? How do you know if it’s worth it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Rio spoke, Agatha’s eyes followed the movement of her fingers—deft, deliberate, and almost absentmindedly tracing the notebook’s edge. It was such a simple thing, yet it sent a flicker of something through Agatha’s mind, stirring memories from the other night night and flashes of the thoughts that had plagued her at home.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had tried to bury those thoughts with glass after glass of wine, telling herself that it was foolish to dwell on something so fleeting, so ambiguous. But seeing Rio now—so close, so casual, her fingers moving in that maddeningly deliberate way—made it all resurface. She remembered the way those same fingers had gripped the edge of the sink in the bathroom, the tension in Rio’s posture mirroring the restraint Agatha had been holding onto so tightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha forced herself to focus on Rio’s words, but her gaze kept slipping back to those fingers. She felt a traitorous warmth spread through her, a rush of something dangerous and thrilling. It was ridiculous how something as mundane as the movement of Rio’s hand could conjure up flashes of last night—their almost-kiss, the way Rio’s breath had hitched when Agatha’s fingers had brushed against her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha clenched her jaw, her fingers tapping lightly against her pen as she fought to maintain her composure. This is not appropriate, she reminded herself, trying to shove those thoughts away. But the more she tried to ignore them, the more they persisted, taunting her with their intensity
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio glanced up, Agatha’s gaze snapped to her face, but she knew Rio had noticed her staring. There was a flicker of something in Rio’s eyes—amusement, curiosity, maybe even triumph. Agatha felt her pulse quicken, her grip on the pen tightening slightly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tried to refocus. She tilted her head slightly, considering the question. “It’s a matter of weighing the consequences against the intentions,” she replied, her tone thoughtful. “It’s not an exact science. There are risks involved, and sometimes those risks are necessary to achieve something greater.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Necessary risks,” Rio echoed, her voice dropping slightly. As Rio continued to speak, Agatha tried to redirect her focus to the case study, to the words coming out of Rio’s mouth instead of the way her lips curved when she spoke or the way her fingers kept tracing those maddening patterns along the notebook’s edge. But it was a losing battle. Every small movement felt loaded with meaning, every gesture a reminder of how easily Rio had slipped past her defenses.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For a brief moment, Agatha considered ending the conversation, finding some excuse to send Rio on her way before she lost the fragile control she was clinging to. Or maybe giving into her desires and taking Rio right now against this desk. Her door had a lock after all. But something stopped her—a quiet, stubborn part of her that refused to back down from this unspoken challenge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      You’re better than this,
     </b>
     <span>
      she told herself.
     </span>
     <b>
      You have control.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But as Rio leaned forward, her fingers finally stilling on the edge of the notebook, Agatha couldn’t help but think that control was a fragile, fickle thing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha refocused just in time to hear Rio quip “Besides, necessary risks sounds a little reckless for someone like you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes flickered with something almost like amusement. “You’d be surprised at what I find necessary, Miss Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a challenge in her voice, and Rio couldn’t help but rise to it. “Oh, really?” she asked, leaning forward slightly. “Like what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Rio leaned in, Agatha’s breath caught for just a second, an almost imperceptible hitch that she immediately fought to control. Her gaze flicked to the way Rio shifted her weight, how the muscles in her arms tensed subtly as she braced her elbows against the desk. There was something deliberate in the movement—calculated, almost predatory. Agatha couldn’t help but notice the curve of Rio’s shoulders, the way her crop top rode up ever so slightly, revealing a sliver of taut, tan skin. It made Agatha’s throat go dry.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t just the proximity that unsettled her, though that was enough to make her heart race. It was the way Rio’s eyes were fixed on her, unwavering and intense, as if she were daring Agatha to drop her guard, to give in to whatever was simmering between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha felt the weight of that gaze, the silent demand for her to respond, to not back down. She knew she should say something sharp, something to reestablish the boundaries that were already far too blurred. But her thoughts kept drifting to the heat radiating from Rio’s skin, to the memory of those hands resting just inches from her waist in that confined diner bathroom.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She cleared her throat, her fingers curling slightly against the pen she still held as if it were a lifeline. “You’re asking me to share my secrets, Miss Vidal?” Agatha said, her voice steady but softer than she intended. There was a note of intrigue, of something she couldn’t quite control, and she hated how easily it slipped into her tone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s lips curved into a grin, one that was both teasing and knowing. Agatha watched the slow movement of that smile, felt an unsteady warmth settle in her chest at the sight of it. She knew that Rio had noticed her hesitation, her moment of vulnerability, and that knowledge only made her more determined not to let it show or at least to make Rio crack first.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it was impossible to hide entirely. Not when Rio was so close, her presence overwhelming in a way that left Agatha feeling unsteady and exposed. There was a pull there—something magnetic, something she wanted to deny but couldn’t quite escape.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tilted her head, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studied Agatha’s face, as if trying to decipher her thoughts. Agatha felt a rush of something—panic, excitement, longing—at the intensity of that gaze. She couldn’t remember the last time someone had looked at her like this, like they saw through every carefully constructed wall she had built around herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      You need to get a grip,
     </b>
     <span>
      she told herself, but the words felt hollow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swallowed, trying to find the words to regain control of the situation, but Rio was faster, her voice dropping to a low murmur that seemed to echo in the quiet room. “I’m not asking for all your secrets,” Rio said, her tone playful but layered with something deeper. “Just a peek behind the curtain.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was such a simple phrase, yet it felt loaded with implication, with the promise of something more if Agatha was willing to let her guard down. Agatha felt her pulse quicken, her fingers tightening around the pen until her knuckles turned white.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was standing on a precipice, and Rio was daring her to take the leap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she reached for her pen again, tapping it lightly against her desk as she regarded Rio with a curious expression. Rio watched the movement, noticing the veins in Agatha’s hand, the delicate way her fingers held the pen. It was absurd that something so mundane could feel so intimate, but Rio couldn’t tear her eyes away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What exactly are you getting at, Rio?” Agatha asked, her voice breaking through Rio’s thoughts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just trying to understand your perspective,” Rio replied, her voice low and teasing. “You always seem so… by-the-book.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that what you think?” Agatha asked, a hint of a smirk playing at her lips. “That I follow the rules without question?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not without question,” Rio admitted, her grin widening. “But you definitely like to act like you’re above bending them.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hummed softly, a noncommittal sound that seemed to acknowledge the point without conceding it. She leaned forward slightly, her fingers still holding that pen with deliberate precision. “There’s a difference between bending the rules and breaking them entirely,” she said, her voice dropping to a more intimate tone. “And I think you know that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The air between them felt heavy, charged with something neither of them wanted to name. Rio felt her pulse quicken, the temptation to push further almost overwhelming. But for once, she hesitated. There was something about the way Agatha was looking at her—calm, confident, and completely in control—that made her want to see what would happen if she didn’t push.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So,” Rio murmured, her voice soft, “what would you do if you were faced with a dilemma like that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tilted her head, her eyes narrowing slightly. “It would depend on what was at stake,” she replied, her voice steady. “And whether the reward was worth the risk.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The words hung between them, heavy with implication. Rio couldn’t help but think of last night, of how close they had come to crossing that line. She felt her heart race, her fingers clenching slightly against the edge of her notebook. Agatha’s eyes flickered down to Rio’s hands, noticing the tension there, and for a moment, neither of them moved.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Finally, Agatha leaned back in her chair, breaking the spell. “You should focus on your project, Miss Vidal,” she said, her tone returning to its usual professionalism. “It’s due soon, after all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The dismissal was clear, but there was something in Agatha’s eyes that suggested she wasn’t unaffected by their conversation. Rio felt a flash of frustration—she had come here looking for clarity, and all she had found was more confusion.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right,” Rio muttered, gathering her things and standing up. She turned to leave, but something stopped her. She hesitated at the door, glancing back over her shoulder. “You know,” she said, her voice quieter, “sometimes the exceptions are more important than the rules.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha didn’t respond immediately. Her fingers tapped lightly against the edge of her desk, a nervous habit that Rio had come to recognize. But then Agatha stood, her movements slow and deliberate, and closed the distance between them. Rio held her breath, unsure of what to expect.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s hand brushed lightly against the small of Rio’s back, the touch brief but deliberate. It was so subtle that it could have been an accident, but Rio knew better. She felt a shiver run down her spine at the warmth of Agatha’s touch, and when she turned to face her, she saw something in Agatha’s eyes that made her heart stutter—a promise, a hope, and a challenge all wrapped into one.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Noted,” Agatha said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio didn’t trust herself to speak, so she just nodded, her throat tight with something she couldn’t name. She left the office, her mind racing, the ghost of Agatha’s touch lingering on her skin like a brand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the door closed behind her, Rio let out a shaky breath, a grin spreading slowly across her face.

     <span>
      The announcement about the weekend retreat came as a surprise. Professor Harkness had barely mentioned it in passing during their last lecture, dismissing it as “an optional experience for those interested in further exploring applied ethical dilemmas.” But Alice and Lillia seemed to have gotten the memo early.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s supposed to be at some fancy old estate up in the hills,” Alice had said, her voice laced with excitement. She leaned over the back of Rio’s chair, her eyes gleaming with anticipation. “Can you imagine? A whole weekend away from campus. Just us, a bunch of professors, and… well, you know who.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pretended not to notice the suggestive look Alice gave her, busying herself with her phone instead. “And why would I want to spend my weekend with a bunch of professors?” she muttered, feigning disinterest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, come on,” Lillia chimed in, taking a seat next to Rio. “You can’t tell me you’re not the least bit curious. I mean, Professor Harkness leading a whole conference on ethical decision-making? It’s like a live-action version of one of her lectures.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Exactly,” Alice added, grinning. “Besides, it’s not just lectures. There are team activities, debates, probably some awkward bonding exercises. It could be fun.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Or a complete nightmare,” Rio quipped, rolling her eyes. But even as she said it, she couldn’t deny the flicker of curiosity that had sparked at the mention of the retreat. Spending an entire weekend at a secluded estate with Agatha Harkness—away from the classroom, away from their usual dynamics—was both an intriguing and nerve-wracking prospect.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lillia wasn’t convinced by Rio’s feigned indifference. “You know, it could be a good chance to, like, actually challenge her,” she said, nudging Rio with her elbow. “Show her you’re more than just the class clown.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio huffed out a laugh, shaking her head. “Who said I’m trying to impress her?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice and Lillia exchanged knowing looks, and Rio felt a flush creep up her neck.
     </span>
     <b>
      Maybe I am,
     </b>
     <span>
      she thought grudgingly. But it wasn’t just about impressing Agatha—it was about proving something to herself, about pushing past the boundaries she’d set for herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice grinned, her voice sing-song as she added, “Besides, what’s the harm in a little extra credit?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That was what finally convinced Rio to sign up. The thought of spending hours stuck in lectures wasn’t appealing, but the promise of extra credit—and maybe a chance to get under Agatha’s skin outside the classroom—was too tempting to resist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The bus ride to the retreat center felt longer than it should have. Rio had been half-listening to Alice and Lillia chatter about their expectations for the conference while she stared out the window, pretending to care. The estate loomed ahead, nestled among rolling hills and clusters of trees just beginning to turn with the season. It had that old-money look—manicured grounds, ivy-covered walls, and wide, arched windows that probably hadn’t been washed in decades.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was all a little too picturesque for Rio’s taste.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She wasn’t here for the view, anyway.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, everyone,” a faculty member called as the students shuffled off the bus, “make sure you grab your luggage and check the room assignments on the board inside.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio glanced up as she stepped off the bus, watching Agatha as she descended from the front steps with her usual grace. She was dressed in dark jeans and a crisp white button-up, the sleeves rolled just enough to show her forearms. The sight of those veins, the delicate tracery against her skin, sent a rush of warmth through Rio, one she quickly tried to dismiss. But it wasn’t just Agatha’s arms that had caught her attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The dark jeans hugged Agatha’s hips and thighs in a way that felt almost criminal, sculpting her in all the right places. Rio’s eyes lingered, tracing the lines with a kind of frustrated longing she couldn’t quite control. She knew she should look away, should refocus her thoughts, but her gaze seemed to have a mind of its own, drifting down to the curve of Agatha’s waist, to the subtle sway of her hips as she moved.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      God, those jeans should be illegal,
     </b>
     <span>
      Rio thought, biting back a groan. There was a part of her—a reckless, impulsive part—that wanted to reach out, to run her hands over Agatha’s hips and feel the way those jeans clung to her. She imagined what it would be like to slip her fingers under the waistband, to tug Agatha closer until there was no space between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio was jostled from her thoughts as another student bumped into her.
     </span>
     <b>
      You’re not here to get distracted.
     </b>
     <span>
      She told herself, but even she didn’t believe it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then Agatha moved again, shifting her weight ever so slightly, and Rio’s gaze followed, betraying her in the most obvious way. She was staring, and she knew it. Her eyes raked down the length of Agatha’s body, lingering a little too long, with no subtlety to save her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That’s when Agatha caught her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She turned her head slightly, her piercing blue eyes meeting Rio’s with a knowing look. A smirk tugged at the corner of her lips as she purposefully let her gaze flicker down—slowly, deliberately—over Rio’s body in return, making it clear she had noticed Rio’s attention. Agatha’s eyes roamed up and down, lingering just enough to make Rio’s heart stutter, before she looked back up and locked eyes with her again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then Agatha winked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t just a casual wink—it was playful, teasing, and packed with an unspoken challenge that sent a thrill rushing through Rio’s veins.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt her pulse quicken, her heart pounding in her chest as that wink set her nerves on fire. Agatha knew exactly what she was doing, and Rio couldn’t help the flush that crept up her neck. There was something exhilarating about the fact that Agatha had caught her—no, that she had wanted to catch her, and had made sure to send the teasing look back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Okay, then.
     </b>
     <span>
      Rio thought, swallowing hard.
     </span>
     <b>
      Game on.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s lips twitched into a grin she couldn’t quite suppress, the thrill of fun, temptation, and danger all mixing together in a way that made her feel alive, electric. Agatha wasn’t just going to let her off easy, and Rio was more than ready for whatever this game would turn into. Suddenly, she was really looking forward to this retreat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The moment they all gathered in the foyer of the estate, Rio couldn’t help but notice how the building seemed to suit Agatha—elegant and a little intimidating. As Rio continued stealing glances at Agatha, who was engrossed in a quiet conversation with another professor, the group gathered near the entrance of the estate. A middle-aged professor with graying hair and an authoritative stance, Professor Davies, cleared his throat to get everyone’s attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, listen up,” Professor Davies began, his voice carrying over the chatter of students settling down. “Before you all rush off to explore the grounds, there are a few rules and guidelines to go over.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolled her eyes but leaned against the wall, pretending to listen. Alice and Lillia were whispering beside her, trying to stifle their giggles. Davies’ lecture wasn’t exactly captivating.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “First off,” Professor Davies continued, raising a hand for silence, “curfew is at 11 PM. No exceptions. Even you professors! It’s an estate rule. All lights get shut off anyway so you wouldn’t want to be on the grounds in the dark. This isn’t a weekend getaway—it’s an academic retreat, and you’re all here to focus on your studies. Secondly, the estate is quite old and has some restricted areas, such as the wine cellar and the west wing library. Those are off-limits for safety reasons.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirked at the mention of “restricted areas,” already filing that away for future mischief. Lillia nudged her with an elbow, muttering, “Guess that means no exploring secret tunnels for us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Professor Davies was still going. “You’ll find your room assignments posted on the board here in the main hall. Dinner is served at 7 PM in the dining room, and breakfast starts promptly at 8 AM. If you have any issues or questions, Professor Harkness and myself will be available to assist.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s attention sharpened at the mention of Agatha’s name, her gaze drifting back to where Agatha stood. Professor Davies concluded his speech with a stern warning. “And lastly, let’s maintain a level of professionalism, shall we? You are all representing the university, so act accordingly. That means respecting the faculty, the staff, and each other. Understood?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a murmur of agreement from the students, some more enthusiastic than others. Davies gave a satisfied nod. “Good. Now, find your rooms, unpack, and familiarize yourself with the schedule posted in the main hall. And remember—curfew is at 11.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the crowd dispersed, Rio couldn’t resist a snarky comment under her breath. “You think they’ll enforce the curfew with a pack of guard dogs, or is it just a polite suggestion?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snickered, while Lillia shushed them both. “You’re going to get us kicked out before we even unpack,” Lillia warned, but there was a grin tugging at the corners of her mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckled, but her eyes were already scanning the room assignments posted on the board. She wasn’t surprised to find her name right next to Agatha’s, their rooms sharing a wall.
     </span>
     <b>
      Fate,
     </b>
     <span>
      she thought dryly, ignoring the flutter of nerves in her stomach.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She found her room, dropped her bag on the bed, and peeked through the narrow gap in her door. She could see Agatha making her way down the hall to her own room. Agatha glanced up, catching Rio watching her. Instead of looking away, Rio raised an eyebrow and smirked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha, to her surprise, didn’t look away either. She held Rio’s gaze, the hint of a challenge in her expression, and Rio’s smirk deepened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      The estate’s foyer was bustling with students, some gossiping, some trying to find the best seats, others admiring the historical architecture. Rio, on the other hand, was taking in the vibe with a critical eye. The place was old, sure, but in that expensive way that meant it had never really gone out of style. There were arched windows that let in soft, golden sunlight and old portraits hanging on the walls—probably of dead rich people who used to own the place.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice, who was studying one of the paintings closely, leaned in toward Rio. “Is it just me, or does that guy look like he’s judging all of us?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio glanced at the portrait—some stern-looking man in an outdated military uniform. “I mean, we’re invading his house,” Rio quipped, shrugging. “Can’t blame him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lillia, who had already secured a room key, was admiring the wide staircase. “It’s like something out of a murder mystery,” she whispered, sounding half-nervous and half-excited. “Just imagine—Professor Harkness, caught up in a scandalous affair, and we’re here to uncover it all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wouldn’t need to imagine it if she’d actually invite me to one of her scandals,” Rio muttered, earning a laugh from Alice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They continued to explore, each room they passed feeling more intimidatingly grand than the last. Rio couldn’t deny the estate had a kind of old-world charm. Alice and Lillia were enthralled by the history and the ambiance, but Rio’s attention kept shifting to her surroundings in a different way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She was trying to gauge how the weekend would play out. What rooms would be the easiest to sneak into later? Which hallways were least likely to be patrolled? She was already mentally cataloging possible places to disappear for a while if she needed a break from the endless lectures.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But just as Rio was about to suggest they explore the gardens next, a familiar voice rang out from the far end of the hall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can I have everyone’s attention, please?” The voice was confident and carried easily over the noise, pulling the students’ focus to the front of the room. Rio turned, surprised by the authoritative tone. And then she saw her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      Wait, isn’t that—
     </b>
     <span>
      Rio’s thoughts stumbled, recognizing the woman instantly. It was the same woman she had seen at the diner, the one who had been all over Agatha. The redhead with the easy confidence, who had called Agatha “babe” with such casual intimacy that it had sent Rio spiraling.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was standing at the edge of the crowd, her eyes already on Wanda, and there was something undeniably warm in her expression.
     </span>
     <b>
      Of course, it’s her,
     </b>
     <span>
      Rio thought dryly, feeling a pang of jealousy she didn’t want to acknowledge.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wanda continued speaking, completely at ease in front of the gathered students. “Welcome, everyone, to our opening panel on ethical dilemmas in real-world scenarios. I’m Professor Wanda Maximoff,” she announced, smiling in a way that seemed to put everyone at ease. “I’m thrilled to be here with you all this weekend. Professor Harkness asked me to lead this discussion, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There were a few chuckles from the students, and Wanda shot Agatha a grin that Agatha returned with a small, amused smile. Rio’s stomach twisted uncomfortably.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Wanda’s voice was smooth and confident, and it was clear she had everyone’s attention, including Agatha’s. Rio couldn’t help but watch the way Agatha seemed more relaxed, more at ease, around Wanda.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Wanda began explaining the schedule for the day, Rio barely heard a word. Her focus was split between watching Wanda command the room and stealing glances at Agatha, who seemed genuinely happy to see her friend. It made Rio feel like an outsider, like she was intruding on something private and meaningful.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She tried to keep her expression neutral, but when Wanda addressed the room again, it took all of Rio’s restraint not to scoff. “So, we’ll start with a discussion on ethical paradoxes, and then we’ll break into smaller groups for some activities and debates,” Wanda continued. “Professor Harkness will be assisting with the discussions, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask either of us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Oh, right. Because asking you anything would be so easy," Rio thought sarcastically, her eyes darting back to Agatha. She was annoyed with herself for feeling jealous, for letting this get under her skin, but she couldn’t help it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha seemed oblivious to Rio’s internal turmoil. She was smiling slightly, her posture relaxed in a way that was infuriatingly rare. It wasn’t the forced, professional smile Rio was used to seeing; it was genuine, a hint of warmth that softened the sharp lines of Agatha’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It made Rio’s chest tighten uncomfortably.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now that we’ve covered the basics,” Wanda said, her voice still carrying that easy confidence, “we can get started on our first panel. Everyone, please take a seat, and let’s dive in.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the students began to settle down, Rio hung back, her mind racing with unwanted thoughts and feelings she couldn’t quite control. Wanda’s presence had thrown her off balance, and she hated how easily the redhead had disrupted the fragile sense of normalcy Rio had been trying to maintain.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just as Rio was trying to push her jealousy aside, Agatha stood from her seat, making her way toward the group of students. Her usual air of professionalism was still intact, but as she approached, Rio’s gaze locked onto her, a subtle flicker of something unspoken passing between them. Agatha stopped just in front of them, eyes scanning the group, but Rio had the distinct impression that she was focusing more on her than anyone else.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, everyone,” Agatha said, her voice smooth and commanding, “I hope you’ll all be attending my panel. It’s important to support your professors, after all.” There was a slight smile on her lips, but Rio swore she saw Agatha’s eyes linger on her a moment too long.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It didn’t help that as Agatha turned to leave, she brushed just a little too close to Rio. The contact was brief, almost accidental, but it sent a jolt of electricity through Rio’s body. Her heart raced as Agatha’s hand lightly grazed her arm—a touch so subtle that no one else seemed to notice, but it left Rio’s skin tingling in its wake.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha continued on her way, completely unfazed, but Rio stood frozen for a second, torn between frustration and a rush of satisfaction.
     </span>
     <b>
      Was that on purpose?
     </b>
     <span>
      The thought circled in her mind as she clenched her jaw, trying to suppress the jealousy that had been bubbling up all afternoon.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice, who had been sitting nearby, didn’t seem to notice Rio’s brief pause. “You good?” she asked, glancing over, but Rio just nodded quickly, shaking off the moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, the jealousy still lingered. Rio, never one to keep her thoughts to herself, spoke up as Agatha moved away, her voice laced with bitterness she barely tried to hide. “Are you sure you need us there? Wouldn’t Wanda be enough support for you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha paused mid-step and glanced over her shoulder, her expression unreadable for a moment. But then she smiled, a small, knowing smile that made Rio’s heart skip a beat. “Wanda’s always been a good friend,” Agatha replied smoothly, “but there are certain kinds of support I can only get from my students.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her gaze lingered on Rio as she spoke, the implication of her words hanging in the air between them. It wasn’t an overt reassurance, but it was enough to make Rio’s jealousy subside, replaced by a flicker of something warmer, something more personal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio swallowed, the tension easing just slightly as Agatha gave her a final, lingering glance before turning back to rejoin the professors. But that brief touch, the closeness, and those carefully chosen words were enough to make Rio feel as though maybe—just maybe—there was something more between them. Something unsaid but mutual.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The group began to shift toward the next panel, but Rio’s thoughts stayed fixed on Agatha. The way those dark jeans clung to her hips, the casual elegance she carried, and the subtle power she held over every space she walked into. As much as Rio tried to shake it off, her jealousy of Wanda faded a little, replaced by the undeniable thrill of knowing that Agatha had come over, if only for a moment, just for her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The first session of the conference
     <span>
      was a formal discussion on ethical paradoxes, led by Agatha herself. Rio slipped into the back of the room, taking a seat by the window where she could watch Agatha without being too obvious. Agatha was in her element, speaking with a calm authority that commanded attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leaned back in her chair, her fingers tapping lightly against the armrest as she listened. The conversation wasn’t boring, not in the slightest—Agatha was too good for that. Even though the subject matter was dense, filled with ethical dilemmas and philosophical theory, Agatha made it sound fascinating, pulling everyone in with her calm, confident delivery.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As Agatha spoke, her voice held the room effortlessly. There was a cadence to her words, each sentence carefully constructed, every pause deliberate. She didn’t just lecture—she commanded attention. The way she broke down complex ideas into digestible points made even the most abstract concepts seem tangible. Rio found herself genuinely impressed. Agatha had a gift for this, for weaving together arguments with precision, all while keeping her audience engaged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But more than the content, it was the sound of Agatha’s voice that drew Rio in. There was a rhythm to it, smooth and controlled, a subtle lilt that made Rio feel like she was the only one in the room. She watched the way Agatha gestured, her fingers moving fluidly as if orchestrating the conversation. Her hands were graceful but deliberate, her movements precise, each one adding weight to her points.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio felt herself getting lost, not in boredom but in the sheer captivation of it all. The way Agatha’s eyes gleamed when she explained a particularly complex point, how her voice softened when she drew the audience in for a reflective moment. Every now and then, Agatha’s gaze would sweep across the room, and Rio swore there were moments—fleeting, but real—when their eyes locked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s intensity, her presence, was magnetic. Rio wasn’t sure if the others were noticing what she was, but it was clear from the attentive silence that Agatha had them in the palm of her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the discussion continued, Rio’s focus shifted slightly. She wasn’t just captivated by the lecture—she was mesmerized by Agatha herself. The subtle narrowing of Agatha’s eyes when someone posed a challenging question, the faint smile playing at her lips when she was particularly pleased with a response. Every detail made Rio feel like she was watching something far more intimate than a lecture.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then, there were Agatha’s hands—those damn hands. The way her fingers would curl slightly as she emphasized a point, the veins visible just beneath the surface of her pale skin, the fluidity of her movements as she gestured with the ease of someone completely in control of the space around her. Rio’s eyes traced the lines of Agatha’s fingers, the memory of how close they had come to touching her, how they had brushed her arm earlier. The sensation still lingered, a faint, tingling reminder of that fleeting connection.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      God, she’s incredible,
     </b>
     <span>
      Rio thought, her frustration shifting into something else, something warmer, something deeper. It wasn’t just attraction—it was admiration, a respect for how Agatha could take something so academic and make it feel alive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And yet, even as she was enthralled by the lecture, Rio found herself lost in the undercurrent of tension between them. Agatha’s voice, her movements, everything about her was pulling Rio in, making it harder and harder to keep her thoughts professional. She wasn’t just any professor—Agatha was… different.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There was a moment when Agatha posed a rhetorical question to the room, her eyes scanning the audience. When they landed on Rio, her heart skipped a beat. For just a second, it felt like the question wasn’t for the room, but for her alone. Rio sat up a little straighter, suddenly more alert, her pulse quickening as she met Agatha’s gaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha felt it too—the way they seemed to gravitate toward one another, even in a room full of people.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before she could answer, Billy, ever eager to prove himself, was the first to jump in. He straightened in his seat, speaking with a practiced confidence that bordered on smugness. Rio couldn’t help but roll her eyes as he launched into his response, his words dripping with the kind of forced certainty that screamed he was trying too hard to seem like he wasn’t trying hard at all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy’s answer was technically correct, but it was so rehearsed, so insincere, that it set Rio’s teeth on edge. Agatha nodded, acknowledging the answer, but Rio noticed the slight tension in her posture. She wasn’t impressed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio glanced at Agatha, who was tilting her head just slightly, her fingers tapping lightly on the podium. It was a small gesture, but Rio caught the faintest hint of a smile tugging at the corner of Agatha’s mouth—a smile only she could recognize. That knowing look they had exchanged just moments earlier still lingered between them, and Rio felt emboldened by it. The memory of the bathroom—those charged words, the almost-kiss—was there in the undercurrent of their interactions, invisible to everyone else in the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio couldn’t help herself. “Or,” she said, her voice cutting through the silence, “you could argue that the ethical dilemma isn’t in the decision itself, but in how one rationalizes it afterward.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes flicked to Rio, and for a moment, the rest of the room seemed to disappear. That small smile deepened ever so slightly, and there was a brief flash in her eyes—one that reminded Rio of the teasing look Agatha had given her in that dim bathroom light, right before things had gotten a little too close. “That’s an interesting perspective, Miss Vidal,” Agatha said, her voice carrying a note of genuine curiosity, but Rio could hear the underlying challenge in it—
     </span>
     <b>
      go on, show me more
     </b>
     <span>
      —the same way Agatha had pushed her just before she’d left her standing breathless against the sink.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy shot Rio an irritated look, clearly displeased with the interruption. “Well, if you’re going to ignore the context—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not ignoring it,” Rio interjected, her tone sharper now, though her lips curved into a small, knowing grin. “I’m saying that context isn’t everything. People justify their actions to fit their narratives all the time. Doesn’t make it ethical.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy opened his mouth to argue, but Agatha raised a hand, stopping him mid-sentence. “That’s enough for now,” she said, her tone firm, though there was a playful glint in her eye that only Rio noticed. “We’re here to explore different viewpoints, not to discredit them.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leaned back in her chair, her heart still racing from the exchange, but she wasn’t done yet. “Plus,” she added, her tone lighter now, with a teasing edge, “context changes, doesn’t it? Especially when certain conditions are… a little too close for comfort.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes flickered, and she gave a small, knowing smile—just for Rio. It was understated, but the callback to their "close" moment in the bathroom was unmistakable, and it made Rio’s pulse quicken. No one else in the room would understand the weight behind her words, but the way Agatha’s gaze lingered for just a moment too long told Rio that she remembered every second of it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy opened his mouth to retort, but Agatha cut in smoothly, effortlessly reclaiming control of the conversation. “Miss Vidal raises an interesting point,” Agatha said, her voice silkier now, and Rio couldn’t help but feel a rush of pride at the quiet praise. “Ethics often hinge on context, yes, but one must always consider how easily that context can be manipulated—sometimes even by the smallest of shifts in perspective.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s grin widened as she caught Agatha’s quick glance in her direction. She knew exactly what Agatha was alluding to—their shifting dynamic, the way one small, seemingly innocent moment could change the entire context of their relationship. It was a silent acknowledgment of everything unspoken between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then, just as Agatha was about to move on, she paused, turning toward Rio again, a gleam of mischief in her eye. “And as we know,” she said, her voice dropping slightly, “things can always get a little more complicated when, let’s say, the boundaries… blur.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio swallowed hard, her mind racing back to the bathroom—their blurred boundaries, their proximity, the way Agatha had almost kissed her. It was all there, hidden in Agatha’s words, and Rio felt a thrill run through her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy looked bewildered, clearly not following the unspoken back-and-forth, but Rio knew. She knew exactly what Agatha was doing—flirting with her in plain sight, masked by the professionalism of the moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With that, Agatha moved on, addressing the rest of the room, leaving Rio with a racing heart and a satisfied smirk tugging at her lips. The tension between them was still there, humming beneath the surface, but now it felt more playful, more charged, like they were playing a game no one else even knew was happening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy, meanwhile, looked ready to argue again, but Agatha’s slight shift in posture—just a lean toward Rio, almost imperceptible—stopped him in his tracks. It was as if Agatha had drawn an invisible line in the sand, one that only Rio could cross.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s lecture continued smoothly, her words captivating the room, but Rio couldn’t focus on anything but the interplay between them. Every gesture Agatha made, every time her fingers brushed against the podium, Rio felt the memory of Agatha’s touch—the way her fingers had trailed along her waist, the way she had whispered something dangerous in her ear. It was all there, veiled in the formal air of academia, but undeniably present.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For the rest of the lecture, Rio sat there, utterly enthralled—not just by Agatha’s words, but by the invisible connection they were sharing, one that left her both satisfied and wanting more.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the session ended, students began filing out of the room, and Rio took her time gathering her things. She glanced up to see Agatha watching her, and for a moment, she saw something in her expression—something like pride. But it was gone before she could be sure.

    <p>
     After Agatha’s lecture, everyone was given a brief break before the next scheduled panel. Rio lingered behind for a moment, watching Agatha speak with a few other professors before reluctantly following her friends into another wing of the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next panel was set in a smaller, dimly lit room with old-fashioned wooden chairs arranged in a semicircle. The heavy curtains muted the light outside, creating a cozy atmosphere that felt almost too relaxing for an academic discussion. Rio, Alice, and Lillia took their seats near the back, where they could exchange side comments without drawing too much attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the moment the speaker started, Rio knew she was in trouble. The tone was monotone, the delivery flat—nothing like the sharp, captivating cadence Agatha had wielded in the previous session. It wasn’t that the subject matter was boring—at least, she didn’t think it was—but without Agatha’s presence, it was like the energy had been sucked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted in her seat, trying to focus, but her attention kept wandering. Her fingers drummed against the wooden armrest, her gaze flicking to the window, then to the speaker, then back to the notes Alice was doodling in the margins of her notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I swear, if Agatha were up there, she’d have the whole room in the palm of her hand by now,” Rio muttered, her voice low enough that only Alice and Lillia could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice stifled a laugh, nodding in agreement. “No kidding. This guy doesn’t exactly have her… presence.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Presence. That was the word for it. Agatha had a way of commanding attention without even trying, pulling you in with a mix of intelligence and intensity that made everything she said sound like it mattered. Rio couldn’t help but compare the two—where Agatha’s voice had been smooth and controlled, this guy’s words were disjointed, tripping over themselves. Where Agatha had held the room in rapt attention, this speaker barely had anyone’s focus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, half-listening, her mind drifting. The only reason she was here was because Agatha wasn’t at this panel. She found herself wishing she had followed Agatha’s lead instead—whatever the professors did when they weren’t guiding panels had to be more interesting than this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes flicked to the clock. How long is this thing again? she wondered, tapping her foot impatiently. She tried to refocus, but the words washed over her without sticking. There was no spark, no thrill, nothing to latch onto.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it had been Agatha up there, Rio knew she’d be hanging onto every word, not because she was obligated to, but because Agatha made it impossible not to. Rio could picture her now, standing confidently at the front of the room, her fingers gesturing lightly as she made some perfectly crafted point about ethics, her eyes flashing with that sharp, intellectual edge that always left Rio both impressed and a little flustered.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn’t Agatha. And without her, this felt like a waste of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking around the room Rio realized her and her friends weren’t alone in this feeling. All around the room people were having side conversations, scrolling through their phones, daydreaming. Jen particularly seemed unusually distracted. She kept glancing around the room, her eyes scanning for someone. When Rio raised an eyebrow, Jen just shrugged, a faint grin tugging at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice chuckled, but before she could press further, the panelists entered the room, signaling the start of the question-and-answer session. The sound of chairs creaking as people adjusted themselves filled the space, and Rio leaned back, her fingers tracing absent patterns on the armrest. She was only half-listening as the discussion began, her mind already drifting away from the panel.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn’t in the mood to hear another debate on the implications of ethical decision-making. Not when her thoughts were still tangled up in what had happened at Agatha’s panel. The way Agatha’s eyes had lingered on her, the way she’d spoken with such confidence, effortlessly dismissing Billy’s smugness. The way her words had seemed aimed directly at Rio, like they were the only two people in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was flirting, Rio thought, chewing on the inside of her cheek. There’s no way she wasn’t. The memory of Agatha’s subtle smiles, the way she’d brushed just a little too close, kept replaying in Rio’s mind. It wasn’t just in Rio’s head—Agatha had felt it too, right? That electric tension, the way their words had danced around each other, flirting with the edge of something more. Something dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     “...and Tommy invited me out later tonight,” Jen’s voice broke through Rio’s thoughts, pulling her halfway back into the conversation at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tommy?” Alice asked, her tone teasing. “Already making friends, huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen grinned, looking a little smug. “Met him at the last panel. He’s cute—tall, dark hair, definitely my type. Anyway, he’s having a party with some of the other guys from his school, and he said we should all come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded absently, not really processing what Jen was saying. Party. Tommy. Sure, whatever. Her mind was elsewhere, spinning through different scenarios. How could she get Agatha alone tonight? They were all staying in the same estate—it wasn’t like it would be difficult to find her. She just needed an excuse, a good one, something that would seem natural but give them the privacy they both clearly wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe I could catch her after dinner, Rio mused, drumming her fingers on her knee. Claim I have questions about the next day’s schedule. Or maybe after her next panel, when the crowd thins out... wait for everyone else to leave and then corner her. She’d know what I was doing, though. But maybe that’s the point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind raced with possibilities. She could linger in the library, knowing Agatha might show up there—books always seemed to be her escape. Or she could hang around outside, near Agatha’s room, and make it seem like a chance encounter. Too obvious, Rio decided, shaking her head slightly. She needed something that felt more natural, more casual, but also gave them enough privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then it hit her. The estate’s grounds. She’d seen a path leading out toward the back gardens, half-hidden by tall hedges. It looked secluded, quiet. Perfect. Rio could suggest a walk after dinner, claim she needed fresh air, and invite Agatha to join her. They could talk, maybe flirt, maybe even—
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, what do you think?” Lillia nudged Rio, bringing her back to the conversation with a jolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh? About what?” Rio asked, blinking as she tried to refocus.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen’s party plans with Tommy,” Lillia said, her eyebrow raised. “You in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated for a moment, the gears still turning in her head. The party sounded like a good distraction, but it wasn’t where her focus was tonight. If she went, she’d be surrounded by people, loud music, and Jen’s new crush—not exactly the environment she needed to make her move. No, she had a better plan now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think so,” Rio said, her voice casual but firm. “I’m not really feeling it tonight. Might have been the food or something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shot her a concerned look. “Seriously? You okay? You’ve been kind of off all day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lillia leaned forward, frowning. “Yeah, you sure you’re feeling alright? Maybe you should rest instead of pushing yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m fine,” Rio said quickly, waving off their concern with a small smile. “Probably just something I ate. I’ll be good after I get some air.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen gave her a sympathetic nod. “No worries, Rio. If you’re not feeling up to it, don’t push yourself. There’s always tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, don’t worry about it,” Alice added, her tone softer now. “Just rest up and take it easy tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, feeling a slight pang of guilt at how easily they accepted her excuse. But she couldn’t back down now—her mind was already set. “Thanks, guys. I’ll be fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As the conversation drifted back to Jen’s plans with Tommy, Rio’s thoughts settled on her plan for the evening. After dinner, she’d head out toward the gardens, wait for Agatha to finish her meal, and then—casually—invite her to join her for a walk. It would be perfect. She could already imagine the way Agatha would react, the way her eyes would soften, that smile she always tried to hide but couldn’t quite manage around Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah, Rio thought, feeling a surge of anticipation. This is going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the discussion continued around her, Rio felt her pulse quicken. She didn’t know exactly what would happen tonight, but she was sure of one thing—she wasn’t done with Agatha Harkness. Not by a long shot.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The panel dragged on, and Rio found herself zoning out more than once, her mind drifting back to her plan for later. She was so lost in thought that she barely registered the closing remarks of the panel. When it finally ended, Jen was the first to jump up from her seat, her eyes already scanning the room with a sense of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There he is,” Jen muttered, spotting Tommy near the doorway. She waved him over eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up, blinking herself back into the present as Tommy made his way toward them. He had the same dark hair and easy grin Rio had noticed before, but now, up close, there was something familiar about him. His eyes—something about his eyes reminded her of someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, Jen! Glad you made it,” Tommy greeted, flashing a bright smile at the group before turning his attention to Rio and the others. “Mind if I join you guys for a second?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure,” Rio said, offering a polite nod, though she was still trying to place where she’d seen that look before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is Tommy,” Jen said, beaming. “Tommy, meet my friends—Rio, Alice, and Lillia.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy shook hands with each of them, his grip firm but friendly. When he reached Rio, he hesitated for a moment, looking her over with a curious grin. “Wait a minute… Rio, right? You wouldn’t happen to be in Professor Harkness’s class, would you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Rio replied, raising an eyebrow. “How’d you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy laughed, the sound easy and infectious. “Because my twin brother Billy won’t shut up about you. Always talking about how you’re the class clown or whatever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened in realization. Of course—Billy’s twin. She smirked, leaning back in her chair as she shook her head. “Billy’s your brother? That makes sense now. I gotta say, though—no offense, but your brother’s kind of a wet towel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy snorted, clearly unbothered by the dig at his sibling. “Trust me, I know. Billy’s... well, Billy.” He leaned in conspiratorially. “Honestly, he takes himself way too seriously.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, shaking her head again. “Yeah, I’ve noticed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen watched the exchange with a satisfied grin before nudging Tommy. “So, are you still heading out later?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Definitely,” Tommy confirmed, his grin widening. “Some of us are getting together tonight. You guys should come! We’ll be hanging out near the bonfire by the lake—drinks, music, good vibes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, a flicker of movement caught her eye. Standing not far from the doorway was Agatha, her posture as poised as ever. She was holding her bag, seemingly on her way out of the room, but her attention was fixed on them—or more specifically, on Tommy and Rio. Agatha’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, her expression guarded, as if she were weighing the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a split second, Rio thought she saw something flash in Agatha’s eyes—something like jealousy—but before she could confirm it, Agatha turned on her heel and swiftly exited the room. The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Rio with the strange feeling that she had just been watched… and misjudged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook off the thought, turning her attention back to Tommy, unaware of the small misunderstanding that had just occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyway, you guys should definitely come,” Tommy repeated, his tone light. “It’ll be fun. We can grab some drinks, maybe even get a little competitive—play some games. What do you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s eyes sparkled with excitement, but Rio hesitated. Her mind was still focused on the plan she’d hatched earlier, and the last thing she needed tonight was a distraction from Agatha. The idea of sitting by a bonfire with a bunch of strangers paled in comparison to the opportunity she might have later.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks, but I think I’ll pass,” Rio said, her tone casual but firm. “I’m still not feeling great—probably something I ate earlier. Maybe next time.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Tommy looked genuinely concerned, glancing at her with a furrowed brow. “You sure? You don’t look sick.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, offering a half-smile. “I’m good. Just need to lay low for a bit. You guys have fun, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, no pressure,” Tommy said with a friendly nod. “But if you change your mind, you know where to find us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen seemed a little disappointed but quickly perked up as she turned her attention back to Tommy. “We’ll definitely be there,” she said, her excitement returning. “Text me the details.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As they continued chatting, Rio’s mind wandered back to Agatha, replaying the brief moment she had seen her watching them. There had been something in her expression—something protective, possessive even. The thought sent a rush of heat through Rio, knowing that Agatha might have thought there was something more between her and Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn’t seen Agatha jealous before. And if what she’d just witnessed was any indication, Rio had just gotten a taste of it.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     As the final panel of the day wrapped up, Agatha gathered her notes and slipped them neatly into her leather-bound folder. The conference hall was gradually emptying as students and professors dispersed to their rooms or headed off for casual evening plans. Agatha stayed behind, collecting her thoughts and taking in the quiet that settled over the room once the hum of conversation had faded.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a long day—full of discussions, evaluations, and balancing her role as a guiding figure with her own desire to explore the ideas being presented. Agatha felt a familiar weariness settle into her bones, the kind that came after hours of intellectual engagement. She glanced around the now-empty hall, exhaling slowly, letting herself breathe for what felt like the first time all day.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Long day?” Wanda’s voice broke the silence, warm and friendly. Agatha turned to find her old friend leaning against the doorway, arms crossed in a relaxed pose, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returned the smile, though it was more subdued. “You could say that,” she replied, her voice softer now that there was no need to project authority. “It’s been a while since I’ve had a schedule this packed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda chuckled, pushing off from the door and making her way toward Agatha. “Well, you handled it beautifully, as always,” she said, her tone genuine. “I almost forgot how intense these conferences can be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a small huff of amusement, shaking her head. “Intense is one word for it,” she muttered, running a hand over her face as if to brush away the lingering fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda took a seat at the edge of the table, studying Agatha’s face with a mixture of curiosity and concern. “You look like you could use a drink,” she observed, her eyes twinkling with that familiar hint of mischief. “A few of us are going to my room tonight to unwind. You should join us—relax, let loose a little.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her folder. She appreciated the offer, but the idea of socializing after such a long day felt more draining than rejuvenating. “Thank you, Wanda, but I think I’ll pass this time,” she said gently. “Traveling always takes it out of me, and I’m not exactly in the mood for company.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda tilted her head, her gaze softening. “You’re not just tired,” she observed quietly. “Something’s on your mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, not bothering to deny it. Wanda had always been able to read her like an open book—a gift that was both comforting and unnerving. “It’s nothing serious,” she replied, forcing a reassuring smile. “Just the usual stress of these events, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm,” Wanda murmured, unconvinced. She let the silence linger for a moment before leaning in slightly. “You know, you’re allowed to not have all the answers, Agatha. You’re allowed to be human.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, Doctor Maximoff,” Agatha said dryly, though there was a hint of gratitude beneath her teasing tone. She appreciated Wanda’s concern, even if she wasn’t ready to discuss the real source of her unease.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, if you change your mind,” Wanda said, her voice brightening again, “you know where to find us. And don’t worry—I promise there will be good wine and absolutely no more talk of ethics.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smiled, resting a hand on Agatha’s shoulder briefly before standing up. “Get some rest,” she urged, her tone affectionate. “But don’t lock yourself away all weekend, alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll try not to,” Agatha promised, her smile lingering as she watched Wanda leave the room, the door swinging shut behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alone again, Agatha took a deep breath, letting the silence wash over her. She had always valued moments like this—quiet spaces where she could retreat into herself, away from the demands of her profession and the expectations of those around her. But tonight, the silence felt heavier than usual, weighted with thoughts she didn’t quite know how to unravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted today, a change in the atmosphere that had left her feeling off balance. It wasn’t just the conference or the constant demands of her role as a mentor—it was something deeper, something more personal.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s just the exhaustion, she told herself firmly, trying to push away the lingering unease. But even as she tried to rationalize her thoughts, there was a small, insistent voice in the back of her mind that refused to be silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last sigh, Agatha gathered her things and left the conference hall, her footsteps echoing softly in the quiet corridor. But instead of heading back to her room as she’d planned, she found herself lingering at the end of the hall, restless energy buzzing under her skin. She told herself she needed to clear her head, but in truth, she was thinking about Rio—the teasing glances, the flirtatious banter that had left Agatha feeling more unsettled than she’d like to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her feet moved on their own accord, carrying her toward the session Rio was supposed to be attending. A small part of her wanted to see if the connection they had shared earlier was still there, as electric and undeniable as it had been in the panel. The thought of seeing Rio again, even just for a brief moment, stirred something in her chest—a mix of anticipation and something more dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she neared the room, Agatha slowed her pace, already imagining what it would feel like to catch Rio’s eye, to see her face light up in that mischievous way. But when she reached the door, the sight that greeted her made her breath hitch. Rio was standing by the door, laughing, leaning a little too close to a boy Agatha didn’t recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
     He wasn’t anyone of consequence, Agatha noted with a flash of irritation, but the way Rio’s smile widened as she talked to him, the way her eyes gleamed, sent an uncomfortable pang through Agatha’s chest. Who was he, and why was Rio giving him so much attention? Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line as she watched the boy say something that made Rio laugh again, her body language far too relaxed for Agatha’s liking.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt a surge of annoyance she couldn’t quite place, a hot flash of disdain for this boy who had clearly captured Rio’s attention. What was so interesting about him? She found herself clenching her jaw, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     But just as Agatha was about to turn away, Rio glanced up, and their eyes locked. The laughter faded from Rio’s face, her expression shifting to one of surprise and something else—recognition. Agatha knew she’d been caught. For a split second, neither of them moved, the air between them thick with the weight of the unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart raced, but she quickly gathered her composure, straightening her posture and forcing a neutral expression. She tore her gaze away from Rio’s, turning abruptly and making her way down the hall with deliberate steps, even though she could feel Rio’s eyes still on her. She knew she’d been caught watching, but there was no way she was staying to explain herself. Not now.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha walked briskly down the hallway, her mind swirled with conflicting emotions. She told herself she shouldn’t care what Rio did outside of class—it was none of her business, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That looked an awful lot like flirting,
     </em>
     Agatha thought, her jaw tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it wasn’t just the boy that was bothering her. It was the way Rio had looked while doing it—the way her cropped shirt clung to her form, the slight sheen of her tanned skin in the soft light of the room. The way Rio’s eyes had sparkled when she laughed. Agatha clenched her fists at her sides as she remembered the curve of Rio’s smile, the playful glint in her eye that seemed to say
     <em>
      I know exactly what I’m doing.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked damn good while doing it, Agatha admitted to herself, biting the inside of her cheek.
     <em>
      Too good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, as Agatha made her way toward her room, the more she thought about it, the more doubt crept into her mind. Had she misjudged the situation? She had left before hearing Rio’s response—before knowing if Rio had accepted the offered invitation. For all Agatha knew, Rio could have turned him down.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      But why would she?
     </em>
     Agatha’s thoughts countered.
     <em>
      He was charming enough, and Rio’s never been shy about attention.
     </em>
     Agatha’s steps slowed, and she let out a frustrated sigh. She had no right to feel this way—to feel possessive over Rio when she was supposed to maintain a clear boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha couldn’t help but replay the moments they had shared earlier. The subtle glances, the way their words had carried unspoken weight, the constant tension simmering between them—it was more than just playful banter. It had felt… different. Real. There had been something undeniably charged between them in the panel, and Agatha hadn’t imagined that.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Had she?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed out a breath, her mind a whirl of conflicting thoughts. Maybe she had overreacted. Maybe Rio had been flirting, but that didn’t mean anything beyond harmless fun. Rio was young, free-spirited, and likely saw the invitation as just another casual offer for a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it gnawed at her. The way Rio had looked at her during the panel, the way she had risen to Agatha’s subtle challenges—it had felt deliberate. Intentional. And Agatha had wanted to believe that she wasn’t the only one caught up in the charged atmosphere between them. Maybe she had been too quick to walk away, assuming the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, the sight of Rio’s easy, teasing grin as she laughed with him… it had been enough to set Agatha’s nerves on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed the door to her room open, stepping inside with a frustrated sigh.
     <em>
      You’re being ridiculous,
     </em>
     she chided herself. But even as she said it, she knew it wasn’t entirely true. There was something between them—she was sure of it. The way Rio had looked at her during the panel, with that confident smirk and knowing glint, had spoken volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed the door softly behind her, leaning against it for a moment as she let her head fall back. Agatha took a deep breath, trying to steady herself, but the memory of Rio’s smirk, her dark eyes glinting with mischief, was still burned into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she had misjudged what she had seen in that room. Maybe, just maybe, Rio hadn’t accepted the offer after all. And if she hadn’t…
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched as she felt a surge of something warm, something dangerously close to relief. Maybe there was still hope—still a chance that what had passed between them during the panel wasn’t one-sided after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even as she closed the door behind her, locking herself away in the solitude she so often craved, one thing was clear: Rio Vidal had gotten under her skin. And there was no denying how hard it was becoming to keep her at arm’s length.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     She tried to focus on the immediate tasks—reviewing notes, planning for tomorrow’s discussions—but her thoughts kept wandering back to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Rio had responded during the panel, challenging Billy with such confidence, had left an impression on Agatha. She wasn’t just antagonizing for the sake of it; there was depth and insight in Rio’s arguments, something thoughtful and deliberate beneath the sarcasm. Agatha couldn’t help but find that… intriguing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s always pushing boundaries, Agatha thought, her fingers tightening slightly around her folder. Always looking for that line to cross. It was infuriating at times, but there was something undeniably compelling about it—about Rio’s relentless drive to provoke a reaction, to see just how far she could go.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then there were the looks Rio kept giving her—the intensity in those dark eyes that seemed to see right through her, as if challenging her to drop the pretense and acknowledge what was really happening between them. Agatha tried to dismiss it, to tell herself it was just a game to Rio, another way to pass the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the truth was, it was starting to feel like more than a game. And that unsettled her in a way she wasn’t prepared to confront.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s parting words echoed in her mind—You’re allowed to be human. It was such a simple statement, yet it hit closer to home than Agatha cared to admit. She had spent so long keeping her emotions tightly controlled, maintaining a professional distance from her students and colleagues alike. But Rio was making it harder and harder to uphold that distance, to keep pretending that she wasn’t affected by those fleeting touches, those teasing smiles, those eyes that seemed to hold secrets Agatha didn’t dare uncover.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed, running a hand through her hair as she tried to clear her head. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Rio was her student, and there were lines that should never be crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as she told herself that, Agatha couldn’t help but wonder if it was already too late.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha set her things down and exhaled deeply. She felt like her mind was running in circles—thoughts of Rio constantly creeping in no matter how much she tried to dismiss them. It had been a long day, and she needed to unwind. She remembered Rio’s animated description of that ridiculous show,
     <em>
      Twisted Fates
     </em>
     , and decided to give it a try.
    </p>
    <p>
     Booting up her laptop, Agatha found the show and clicked play on the first episode. She poured herself a modest glass of wine and settled against the pillows, letting the absurd drama unfold on the screen. The characters were larger than life, the plot twists almost comically overdone, and Agatha found herself smiling despite herself. It wasn’t her usual fare, but she could see why Rio was hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few scenes in, there was a line so outrageous that Agatha couldn’t help but laugh aloud, her chuckles turning into something deeper—a genuine release of tension she hadn’t realized she’d been carrying. She relaxed back, enjoying the rare feeling of letting her guard down, even if it was just for a silly TV show.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the tranquility was broken when she heard a door open and close on the other side of the wall, followed by a long, low groan. Agatha’s smile faded as she listened, the sound sending an unexpected jolt of awareness through her. It was Rio’s voice—there was no mistaking it. Agatha felt her chest tighten, her breath catching in her throat. Of course, she thought wryly. She’s in the room right next to mine. So she hadn’t accepted his invitation after all? Or was she back just to get ready before heading out again?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tried to ignore it, forcing her attention back to
     <em>
      Twisted Fates
     </em>
     , but the noises from the next room persisted—soft rustling, the unmistakable sound of Rio moving around, likely rummaging through her suitcase. The restless energy was palpable, even through the wall, and it made Agatha's own skin prickle with anticipation. She tapped her fingers idly against the keyboard, but her mind kept wandering back to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was she doing? Was she getting ready for the party after all? Agatha felt a pang of something sharp and uncomfortable twist in her chest at the thought. She didn’t want to admit it, but the idea of Rio dressing up for that boy—the one she had seen her laughing with—set her on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind betrayed her, offering up images of Rio in different outfits, each one more tempting than the last. Maybe Rio would wear that cropped black tank she had been so fond of lately, the one that showed just enough of her toned stomach to make Agatha's thoughts stray in all the wrong directions. She pictured Rio pairing it with those fitted jeans, the ones that hugged her hips in a way that made Agatha's breath hitch whenever she saw her walk away in class.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or maybe Rio would wear a dress—something tight, something that would cling to every curve in a way that was downright unfair. Agatha swallowed hard at the mental image, her pulse quickening. She could practically see it—Rio’s dark hair falling messily around her shoulders, her lips slightly parted as she fixed her makeup in the mirror, a confident smirk playing at the corner of her mouth as she admired her reflection. God, she’d look stunning.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the worst part? Agatha knew Rio wouldn’t even be trying. She never had to. There was something infuriatingly effortless about the way she carried herself—like she wasn’t fully aware of the effect she had on everyone around her. Or maybe she was, Agatha mused, her thoughts tinged with jealousy. Maybe she knows exactly what she’s doing, especially when it comes to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifted in her seat, her fingers pausing on the keyboard as the thoughts overwhelmed her. She hated how much she cared, how much this boy—this random boy she knew nothing about—had wormed his way into her thoughts. She hated that Rio might be getting dressed for him, might be planning on meeting him tonight, laughing with him, letting him get close in a way that Agatha couldn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was ridiculous, really. She had no claim on Rio, no reason to feel this gnawing jealousy, but it was there, simmering just beneath the surface. The thought of Rio walking out of her room, dressed to the nines, looking as gorgeous and confident as ever, but all for someone else… It made Agatha's stomach twist painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, there was another part of her—a quieter, more vulnerable part—that was half in love with the idea. She imagined Rio dressed to perfection, not for anyone else, but for her. What if Rio wasn’t dressing up for that boy? What if she was staying in, just like Agatha hoped, and maybe—just maybe—she was thinking about her? Agatha bit her lip, trying to suppress the rush of warmth that came with the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind conjured up another image—Rio catching her eye across the room, dressed in something that was meant to drive Agatha mad. Not for anyone else, not for that boy, but for her. The way Rio would smirk knowingly, as if she were in on a private joke that no one else could understand. The way she might brush her hair back, exposing the curve of her neck, sending a silent message that Agatha couldn’t ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought made Agatha’s heart race, and she forced herself to take a slow, steadying breath.
     <em>
      Get a grip
     </em>
     , she chided herself, but the images wouldn’t stop. Her fingers tapped idly against her laptop, but her focus was entirely on the girl in the next room—the girl who, even now, had Agatha wrapped around her finger without even trying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was just about to refocus on her laptop when she heard a faint clack from the other side of the wall—a distinct sound that cut through the quiet. Her heart skipped a beat as she realized what it was. Heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s wearing heels?
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought sent Agatha’s mind spiraling in a direction she wasn’t prepared for. She could almost picture it now—Rio, sitting on her bed, strapping on a pair of red heels, the kind that made her legs look impossibly long, her posture more confident and commanding. The mental image was intoxicating, and Agatha couldn’t stop herself from following it down a path she knew she shouldn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would Rio look like in those heels? The vision shifted, becoming something more vivid, more dangerous. Agatha imagined Rio in her classroom, leaning casually against the edge of her desk, one leg crossed over the other, those red heels tapping lightly against the floor. She’d be dressed in something tight, something that hugged her curves just right, with her usual smirk teasing at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Professor,” Rio would say, her voice a mix of sarcasm and flirtation. “I need some help with this assignment.” Her eyes would gleam with mischief, knowing exactly what she was doing, exactly how she affected Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s pulse quickened at the thought, her fingers hovering over the keyboard as her mind wandered further. Rio would shift slightly, uncrossing her legs in one smooth motion, the red heels catching the light as she swung her feet down to the floor. She’d lean forward just enough to make it clear that this wasn’t just a casual request for help. No, this was something more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those heels, Agatha thought, her breath catching. She could see it so clearly—Rio sitting on the desk, her legs slightly parted, her gaze locked onto Agatha’s, daring her to come closer, to close the space between them. It was a power play, one that Rio would win effortlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re distracted, Professor,” Rio would tease, her voice low and teasing. “I thought we were talking about ethics.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head, trying to banish the fantasy, but the image lingered. She could see the way Rio’s red heels would dig into the floor as she shifted, her lips curling into that half-smirk that made Agatha’s pulse race. The mental picture was so vivid, so real, that it was almost unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the worst part? Agatha wasn’t sure if she wanted to stop imagining it. The idea of Rio in her classroom, dressed to drive her mad, her body language screaming confidence, made Agatha’s head spin. The heels, the smirk, the playful challenge in Rio’s eyes—it was all too much, and yet, Agatha couldn’t get enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     She clenched her jaw, trying to focus back on the show, but the scene kept replaying in her mind, more vivid with each passing second.
    </p>
    <p>
     What would I do if she actually showed up like that? The question slipped through her mind, unbidden, and the answer wasn’t something Agatha was prepared to confront.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands tightened around the laptop, her breath shallow as she imagined stepping closer to Rio, watching her tilt her head in that infuriatingly confident way, daring her to make the next move. And those red heels... God, Agatha thought, biting her lip, those heels would be the death of me.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed, feeling a faint flush creeping up her neck. She shifted uncomfortably, trying to will the thoughts away, but it was like trying to hold back a rising tide.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is ridiculous, she scolded herself, closing the laptop with a bit more force than necessary. She needed to get a grip. A cold shower—that would help clear her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood up quickly, a little too quickly, and nearly knocked over her glass of wine in the process. “Fuck,” Agatha muttered under her breath, the curse slipping out before she could stop it. She fumbled to catch the glass, her fingers brushing the edge as it wobbled dangerously. Thankfully, it didn’t spill, but she was too flustered to feel relieved.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Rio stood in front of her open suitcase, biting her lip as she sifted through the clothes she’d packed. She wasn’t getting ready for the party, no. The idea of heading out with her friends to some late-night bash had lost its appeal the moment she realized she had something better in mind—someone better in mind. Tonight wasn’t about socializing with classmates; it was about Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew she needed to be strategic. If she was going to ask Agatha to go for a walk, maybe down one of the quiet trails that wound through the estate grounds, she had to look irresistible. Something that would make Agatha’s eyes linger, something that would make her heart race in a way that would betray her usual composure. Rio wasn’t just going for playful teasing this time—this time, she wanted to see real desire in Agatha’s eyes. Maybe something more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands grazed over a fitted black dress she’d packed on a whim. It wasn’t overly revealing, but it hugged her curves in all the right places. The kind of dress that left just enough to the imagination, while still making it impossible for anyone to not notice. She smirked as she held it up, imagining Agatha’s reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could already picture it: they’d be walking side by side, the night air cool and quiet around them. Rio would make some witty comment, maybe something about the ethics of their ongoing tension. Agatha would laugh—really laugh, that low, soft laugh that made Rio’s stomach flip. And then, in a quieter moment, Rio would turn to her, close the distance between them, and ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Professor,” Rio would say, her voice a bit softer, a bit more sincere than usual. “Can we stop pretending?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would hesitate, just for a moment, her usual guard slipping as she looked at Rio, really looked at her, the moonlight catching in her dark hair. There’d be a flicker of want in her eyes, but Rio knew—deep down—there’d be something else there too. Love? Maybe that was too hopeful, too soon, but Rio couldn’t help the thought. She wanted to see Agatha’s desire mixed with something deeper, something that hinted at what might be if they let this game between them unfold completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wouldn’t be able to resist. Not in that dress, not when Rio was standing so close, her fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s arm, sending that familiar spark between them. Rio could see the moment perfectly—Agatha would glance down, her lips parting as if she were about to say something. But instead, she’d step closer, her eyes locking onto Rio’s with that burning intensity that always made her knees feel weak.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then… Rio would lean in, close enough to feel Agatha’s breath on her skin, and she’d—
    </p>
    <p>
     Crash.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of something falling on the other side of the wall jolted Rio out of her fantasy. Her heart raced as she listened closely, frozen in place. What was that? Then, through the muffled walls, she heard Agatha’s voice—low and frustrated—muttering a sharp, “fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes widened. Agatha’s still here?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind raced as she tried to piece together what she’d heard. Something had fallen—maybe a glass, judging by the clink. But what had caught Rio’s attention even more was the fact that Agatha wasn’t gone—she wasn’t at a party, mingling with someone else. She was right there, just on the other side of the wall. And she had cursed. Out loud. Rio felt a thrill of excitement at the idea of catching Agatha in such a raw, unguarded moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood there for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should she let Agatha know she had heard? No, that might embarrass her. But the knowledge that Agatha was still in her room, possibly relaxing, maybe even thinking about her, made Rio’s pulse quicken. She couldn’t shake the mental image of Agatha lounging on her bed, perhaps sipping wine and looking effortlessly beautiful, as always. Is she thinking about me?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio set the dress aside, her hands running through her hair as she considered her next move. Agatha’s voice, her frustration—it had sounded so... human. So unlike the cool, composed professor Rio was used to. And now, knowing that Agatha was just a few feet away, Rio’s imagination began to run wild again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could picture it so clearly: Agatha in that same crisp white button-up, maybe slightly undone now, the top buttons open just enough to show a sliver of skin. Her dark hair falling loose from whatever neat style she’d had it in earlier, her face softened by the evening light. Maybe Agatha was sitting on the edge of her bed, sipping her wine, her eyes distant as she thought about... what?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or who?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip, imagining Agatha’s reaction when she’d finally see her in that dress. The way her eyes would linger, the way her expression would soften just a bit, as if she were fighting a losing battle against the attraction they both felt. Rio knew exactly what she wanted to happen next. She’d suggest the walk, or maybe Agatha would, their usual banter carrying them to that familiar tension until finally, the space between them would disappear completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now, a new image took root in Rio’s mind—Agatha wasn’t just sitting there, she was maybe getting dressed. The sound of something falling suggested movement, maybe she had been looking for shoes... and Rio could almost see her in something daring. Red heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, wearing red heels, seated at her desk, legs crossed, as she asked for help with her “assignment.” Rio couldn’t help the way her lips curled into a smirk at the fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     But reality crashed in again—was Agatha getting dressed to meet someone else? Rio’s jealousy flared up for a moment, the thought making her stomach twist. She needed to know if Agatha was planning to leave her room tonight, and more importantly, why she would leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of Agatha’s restless movements on the other side of the wall pulled Rio back to the present. She heard the faint rustle of papers, the clink of a glass being set down—Agatha was there, but what was she doing?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Please don’t be getting ready for someone else, Rio thought, biting her lip. She needed to act now. If she waited too long, she’d lose the chance to make her move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rummaged through her suitcase again, trying to decide on the perfect outfit, one that would make Agatha’s eyes linger just a little longer, make her realize that whatever tension had been building between them wasn’t just a game. It was something real. Something worth acting on.

      Agatha turned on the shower, letting the water run until steam began to rise, filling the bathroom with a thick, warm mist. She stepped under the spray, tipping her head back and closing her eyes as the water poured over her. The steady rhythm of droplets hitting the tile floor was meant to be soothing, meant to drown out the thoughts that had been spinning in her mind all evening. She braced her hands against the cool tile, trying to let the heat work its way into her tense muscles.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Forget it, Agatha told herself, forcing the words into the silence around her. Rio’s a student. She could be out with anyone, and it shouldn’t matter to you. It doesn’t matter. She repeated the thought like a mantra, as if saying it enough times would make it true. But the moment she thought she had control over her thoughts again, Rio’s face flashed through her mind—those teasing eyes, that confident smirk, the way she seemed to know exactly how to get under Agatha’s skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha let out a frustrated breath, running her fingers through her wet hair. The steam curled around her, heavy and stifling, clinging to her skin like a second layer. But even in the warmth, she couldn’t quite shake the memory of Rio’s laugh, or the way her lips had curled into a smirk when she had caught Agatha looking earlier. And then there were those heels, the way she’d imagined Rio sitting on her desk, those red shoes tapping against the floor, waiting for Agatha to make the next move.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop it,” she muttered to herself, her voice echoing off the tile walls. Agatha pressed her palms flat against the shower wall, trying to focus on the coolness beneath her hands, to ground herself in the physical sensation rather than the thoughts running rampant in her head. But the effort was in vain. Her mind kept drifting back to the vision of Rio in those heels, the way she might lean closer, her voice low and teasing, daring Agatha to let her guard down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha clenched her jaw, turning her face into the spray, as if the water could wash away the unwanted images. She wanted to pretend she didn’t care, that it didn’t matter what Rio did, who she talked to, or where she spent her time tonight. But jealousy was a stubborn thing, creeping into the edges of her thoughts despite her best efforts to ignore it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It wasn’t just that Rio might be spending time with someone else—it was that Agatha couldn’t stop wanting to be the one Rio spent her time with. She hated how vulnerable that made her feel, how exposed. She was supposed to be better than this—detached, professional, in control. And yet here she was, standing under the spray of a shower, trying to scrub away the lingering feelings that Rio had stirred up so effortlessly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The memory of Rio’s laugh, her voice, the way she had stood so close earlier that day, kept playing on a loop in Agatha’s mind. She remembered the way Rio had looked at her during the panel, that glint in her eye as if she were daring Agatha to react, to do something about the tension between them. Agatha let out a shaky breath, her hand moving to rest against her chest, trying to steady the rapid beat of her heart.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What would it have been like, if she’d just leaned in a little closer, if she’d closed that maddening distance between them? Agatha let herself linger on the thought, just for a moment—imagining the way Rio’s breath would feel against her skin, the softness of her lips, the heat that would bloom between them if she finally let herself give in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She bit her lip, her mind drifting again to those heels, to Rio’s legs crossed in that confident way, her voice smooth as she teased Agatha with those double-edged words. There was something intoxicating about the idea of Rio dressed to kill, but not for anyone else—only for her. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, even as she tried to push it away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a frustrated growl, Agatha turned the water temperature colder, hoping the shock would chase away the heat pooling in her stomach. The cool stream splashed against her skin, and for a second, she felt a jolt of clarity—a reminder that this was all in her head, a product of her own desires and insecurities.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But even as the chill seeped into her bones, the thoughts didn’t leave her. They clung to her like the steam in the bathroom, impossible to fully escape.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      On the other side of the wall, Rio was wrestling with her own spiraling thoughts. She leaned back on the bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling, trying to shake the image of Agatha showering just feet away from her. What does she look like right now? The thought slipped in, unbidden, and Rio tried to brush it off, but it kept creeping back, each detail becoming more vivid in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She imagined the way the water would run down Agatha’s back, tracing the curve of her spine, following the lines of those maddeningly fitted jeans she always wore. Rio’s breath hitched slightly at the mental image, a mix of frustration and longing gnawing at her. She could almost hear the water cascading over Agatha’s skin, could almost feel the warmth of the steam curling through the air.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A knock on Rio’s door jolted her back to reality, the sound echoing sharply through the quiet room. She cursed softly, pushing herself off the bed and striding to the door, annoyance prickling at the interruption. Great timing, she thought sarcastically.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she opened the door, a wide-eyed freshman stood there, looking lost and apologetic. “Uh, sorry,” he stammered. “I was looking for Mark’s room? I think I got turned around.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s irritation melted slightly at the sight of the kid’s confused expression. She sighed, nodding toward the opposite end of the hall. “Other side,” she said, her voice flat but not unkind. “Try three doors down.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thanks,” he mumbled, offering a grateful smile before hurrying off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shut the door quickly, her mind already drifting back to Agatha, but she paused, her hand resting on the doorknob. She hoped Agatha hadn’t heard that knock—if she did, she might assume Rio had left. Rio felt a thrill at the idea, wondering what Agatha might do if she thought she was alone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Inside the bathroom, Agatha heard the muffled knock and the sound of the door opening and closing. She frowned, straining to hear more, but the silence that followed seemed to confirm her suspicion. Did she leave? The thought sent a wave of mixed relief and disappointment through her. If Rio was gone, that lingering tension might finally dissolve, but the idea of Rio still being so close had kept Agatha’s pulse racing in a way she hadn’t felt in a long time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She turned off the water for a moment, listening intently for any sign of movement next door. There was only silence. Agatha exhaled slowly, her breath echoing slightly in the quiet bathroom. It felt like a risky moment, teetering between recklessness and control, and she knew she had to be sure before she could let herself relax.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But in that silence, Agatha felt a heady rush of relief—an acceptance that she was, at least for now, alone. She closed her eyes, letting herself lean back against the cool tile, the lingering tension from earlier uncoiling in her chest. It was reckless and indulgent, but the thought of being able to release all of the pent-up emotions from the day without any judgment, without prying eyes, was too tempting to ignore.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s just you, she thought, letting herself breathe in that solitude, the image of Rio still lingering at the back of her mind. Her voice, the casual way she spoke and moved, always getting under Agatha’s skin of those dark eyes watching her with that maddening intensity, that smirk that made Agatha want to wipe it away and pull it closer in the same breath. Rio always carried that confident, almost careless air, but there was something deeper beneath it—a vulnerability that Agatha glimpsed in brief moments when Rio let her guard down. It was intoxicating, the way Rio could shift between sharp and soft, challenging and yielding, all in the span of a heartbeat—now there was no one to interrupt, no walls to put up, and no need to keep that iron control she always maintained in Rio’s presence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Rio stepped back into her room, closing the door behind her with a quiet click. She leaned against it for a moment, her mind racing with conflicting thoughts. Did she hear that? she wondered, thinking back to the knock that had interrupted her. Does she think I left?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She strained to listen through the wall, catching the faint sound of water still running from Agatha’s shower. But then, as she waited, the water abruptly cut off, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. Rio’s breath hitched. Now she definitely thinks I’m gone, she realized, a strange thrill coursing through her at the thought. Agatha might think she had the room to herself now, unobserved, unguarded.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A part of Rio wanted to call out, to say something, to let Agatha know that she was still there. What would I even say? she wondered, chewing on her bottom lip. Hey, just so you know, I’m still here? It sounded ridiculous even in her head, and the thought of Agatha’s possible reaction—amused, maybe even annoyed—made her hesitate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pushed off the door, crossing the room in a few restless strides. She picked up the book she had brought with her, thumbing through the pages without really seeing the words. Her mind was still on the other side of the wall, imagining what Agatha might be doing right now. Maybe she’s relaxing, thinking she’s alone, Rio thought, a pang of jealousy flaring again at the idea of Agatha content without her. Rio quickly shook it off as the sounds of the shower turning back on reached her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sank onto the bed, flipping open the book to a random page, but the words blurred together, her thoughts swirling around the woman just feet away from her. Her thumb traced the edge of the paper, restless energy buzzing under her skin. She kept glancing toward the wall, half-expecting some sign, some sound from Agatha’s room that would break the silence and give her a reason to knock on her door, to bridge the gap between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just say something, she thought, frustrated with her own hesitation. But every time she opened her mouth to speak, the words caught in her throat. She wasn’t used to feeling this uncertain, this unsure of what to do next. Usually, she thrived on spontaneity, on following her instincts. But with Agatha, things felt different—deeper, more dangerous.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She leaned back against the pillows, forcing herself to focus on the book, but every line seemed to morph into thoughts of Agatha—of the way her voice had softened during their last conversation, the way her eyes had held something unspoken between them. She wondered what Agatha would do if she knew Rio was still here—waiting, hoping for a moment alone with her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio wasn’t ready to take that step, not yet. So she stayed silent, trying to calm the racing of her heart, telling herself that she’d figure out what to say—what to do—once she’d worked up the nerve.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That’s when she heard it—a quiet, unmistakable sound, something between a sigh and a whispered name. Her name.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s breath hitched, the book slipping slightly in her grasp. Was that—? She strained to listen, her pulse pounding in her ears, every muscle tensing as she tried to catch the sound again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Another soft murmur, barely audible but undeniably real. There was no mistaking it now—Agatha was… Oh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The realization hit Rio like a bolt of lightning, a mix of shock, fascination, and something much more dangerous flooding through her. She should have felt guilty for listening, for intruding on something so private, but instead, she was frozen, unable to tear herself away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The soft, rhythmic sounds continued, growing more intense, and Rio’s grip tightened on the book, her knuckles turning white. She tried to focus, to block it out, but it was impossible. Her name was there again, whispered like a prayer, and it sent a shiver down her spine, setting her nerves alight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What are you doing to me, Agatha? Rio thought, frustration and longing warring within her as she fought to maintain control. The air in her room felt heavy, stifling, and she couldn’t decide if she wanted to stay rooted in place or get up and leave, to put an end to this silent torment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything but listen, her heart racing, her mind spiraling with thoughts she shouldn’t be having. And even though she knew it was wrong, knew she should stop, Rio couldn’t bring herself to pull away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the quiet sounds filtered through the wall, Rio’s mind was in turmoil. She felt her pulse thrumming, her breath shallow as she tried to reconcile the pull between respecting Agatha’s privacy and acknowledging the deep, magnetic connection that seemed to have rooted itself between them. The right thing to do would be to leave, but her feet remained glued to the floor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a slow, deliberate breath, Rio made a choice. She walked over to her door and opened it briefly, letting it creak as she pulled it shut again, trying to signal her presence. She felt the weight of what she was doing, the line she was crossing, and yet she couldn’t deny the pull that kept drawing her closer to Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      On the other side of the wall, Agatha froze for a moment, her breath catching as she heard Rio’s door open and close. Her heart raced as the reality of the situation sank in—Rio was still there. She knew. And now Agatha knew that Rio knew.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For a fleeting moment, Agatha considered stopping. Her mind raced with all the reasons why this was a terrible idea—Rio was her student, there were boundaries, there were rules. But then another thought crept in, one that she couldn’t ignore: In a few months, Rio wouldn’t be in her class anymore. This wouldn’t be an issue then, and they were both consenting adults. The attraction between them was undeniable, and in this quiet moment, with no one else around, it didn’t feel wrong—it felt inevitable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      More than anything, though, Agatha wanted this—wanted Rio, and the thought of having her so close yet untouchable was almost unbearable. So instead of pulling back, Agatha allowed herself to sink into the moment, the awareness of Rio’s presence only heightening the intensity of her feelings.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio, on the other side, felt the tension snap like a taut string, releasing the restraint she’d been barely holding onto. If Agatha knew and wasn’t stopping, it was like an unspoken permission—a mutual understanding of the choice they were both making. Slowly, almost reverently, Rio laid back on her bed, mirroring Agatha’s actions, her breaths syncing unconsciously with the faint rhythms coming from the other side of the wall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The shared knowledge, the unspoken connection between them, was electric. There were no words, just the quiet breaths, the subtle shifts, the acknowledgment of something deeper passing between them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's eyes fluttered closed as she lay back on her bed, her mind drifting to the other side of the wall. She could hear the sound of the shower, the gentle hum of the water as it cascaded down Agatha's skin. Before she even knew what was happening, Rio's fingers danced across her skin, tracing the curve of her hip, the dip of her waist. She pictured Agatha's hands moving over her body, her fingers tracing the same curves, the same dips. She imagined Agatha's touch, gentle and exploratory, and her own body responded, her nipples hardening, her skin prickling with goosebumps.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she touched herself, Rio's mind wandered to Agatha's body, strong and muscular, her biceps flexing as she lifted her arms to wash her hair. Rio's fingers moved faster, her breathing growing more ragged, as she pictured Agatha's skin, smooth and unblemished, glistening with water droplets. She imagined Agatha's eyes, bright and piercing, looking at her with a hunger that made her skin prickle.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's fingers slipped between her thighs, parting her lips, stroking the sensitive flesh. She pictured Agatha's mouth on hers, her tongue tracing the curve of her lips, and her own body responded, her muscles tensing, releasing. She felt a wave of pleasure wash over her, and she knew she was getting close.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she touched herself, Rio's breathing slowed, her body relaxing into the fantasy. She was lost in the image of Agatha, her fingers moving in time with the sound of Agatha’s moans. She pictured Agatha's lips, full and soft, curled into a gentle smile as she washed her face. Rio's own lips parted, her tongue darting out to wet them, as she imagined Agatha's mouth on hers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha was lost in her own fantasy, her fingers tracing the curve of her own hip, the dip of her waist. She pictured Rio's skin, tan, smooth and unblemished, glowing with a warm, golden light. Agatha's fingers danced across her own skin, tracing the outline of her own breasts, imagining Rio's hands cupping them, her thumbs tracing the nipples. She pinched them hard, remembering the feeling of Rio’s skin beneath her hands in that diner bathroom.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she touched herself, Agatha's mind wandered to Rio's body, small and delicate, her bright brown eyes sparkling with mischief. She imagined Rio's hair dishelved, clinging to her neck as Agatha’s wet hands stroked through it. Agatha's fingers moved faster, her breathing growing more ragged, as she pictured Rio's mouth, her smirk, her tongue darting out to wet her lips. She couldn’t help but pinch harder at the thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But then, Agatha heard it. A soft moan, barely audible, but unmistakable. Rio's moan. Agatha's fingers paused, her heart skipping a beat, as she realized that Rio was doing the same thing, that she was touching herself, picturing Agatha. For a moment, Agatha hesitated, her body frozen in surprise.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But then, she smiled to herself. She could use this, she thought. She could use the knowledge that Rio was touching herself, picturing her, to push herself forward. Agatha's fingers began to move again, faster, more insistent, as she pictured Rio's body, responding to her own touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The sound of the shower grew louder, the water pounding against the tiles, as Agatha's own moans began to rise. Rio's eyes snapped open, her heart pounding, as she realized that Agatha was responding to her, that she could hear her own moans echoing back. The knowledge sent a jolt of electricity through her body, and she felt herself tumbling over the edge, her body responding to the sound of Agatha's voice, calling out her name.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When the intensity reached its peak, the silence that followed felt profound—heavy with what they had both silently confessed, yet still unspoken. Their breaths slowed, hearts still pounding, each of them reeling from the raw intimacy of the moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After a while, as the weight of the silence settled between them, Rio couldn’t just let it end there. She couldn’t leave things unsaid, not after this. She sat up, running a hand through her hair as if steadying herself for what she was about to do. Enough is enough, she thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Taking a deep breath, Rio stood up and crossed the room. She didn’t hesitate this time as she knocked softly on Agatha’s door, her heart pounding, ready to face whatever came next.
     </span>
    </p>

    <p>
     Rio stood outside Agatha’s door, her pulse thrumming in her ears, barely able to keep her breathing steady. She had crossed a line tonight—no,
     <em>
      they
     </em>
     had crossed it—and she couldn’t pretend to ignore the magnetism pulling them together any longer. She raised her fist, hesitated for just a second, and then knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door swung open, and there Agatha stood. Her hair, still slightly damp from the shower, framed her face in loose waves, her dark blouse clinging to her skin in a way that was almost indecently inviting. Her lips were parted, her chest rising and falling with shallow breaths as if she had just run a mile. But it wasn’t exertion; Rio could see it in her eyes—Agatha was caught in the same maelstrom of emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could speak, Rio stepped forward, bridging the space between them in a heartbeat, and pressed her lips to Agatha’s in a hungry, desperate kiss. Agatha gasped against her mouth, momentarily stunned, before her hands found their way to Rio’s shoulders, clutching at her as if she were the only thing keeping her grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed them further into the room, backing Agatha against the wall with a thud that neither of them seemed to notice. Their lips moved feverishly, breaths mingling, teeth grazing. Rio’s fingers tangled in Agatha’s hair, feeling the damp strands slide through her grip as she deepened the kiss, wanting—no, needing—to pull every reaction from Agatha that she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha wasn’t passive in the slightest. She fought back with equal intensity, her hands sliding down Rio’s back, nails raking lightly over the fabric of her shirt, sending shivers down Rio’s spine. Agatha’s lips moved to Rio’s jaw, her breath hot against her skin as she whispered something too breathless to understand, and Rio responded by pulling her closer, pressing their bodies flush together.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they break apart, they're both breathing heavily, gazes locked with an intensity that says everything words might fail to capture. Agatha’s fingers linger on Rio’s shirt, bunching the fabric just enough to keep her close, her smirk a mixture of satisfaction and challenge. She raises an eyebrow, eyes glinting with that unspoken question:
     <em>
      Is that all you’ve got?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn’t step back; instead, she runs her thumb over the corner of Agatha’s lip, her smirk matching Agatha’s but with a hint of something wilder, more reckless. Her voice drops, barely above a whisper, laced with a playful warning.
     <em>
      “Don’t look so sure of yourself.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, they’re both motionless, hearts racing in sync, both hesitating but for entirely different reasons—Agatha, fighting to keep control, and Rio, daring her to let it go. And then Rio’s hand finds the small of Agatha’s back, tugging her just a little closer, her voice more serious this time.
     <em>
      “We’re just getting started.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes meet again, each noticing the slight flush on the other’s skin, the way their breaths mix in the space between them, and for that beat, the world outside the two of them doesn’t exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio’s fingers slip into Agatha’s hair, it’s softer than she imagined—smooth, with just enough texture to catch slightly as her fingers trace through. She feels Agatha’s breath hitch, a barely noticeable tremor that makes Rio’s heart pound. There’s something grounding about the gesture, something that feels deeper, more vulnerable than she’d expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha, the sensation is electric, each stroke sending warmth through her that she can’t suppress. She closes her eyes for a second, leaning subtly into Rio’s touch, as if savoring a connection she hadn’t known she wanted. She allows herself to relax, her own hand moving up to rest gently on Rio’s arm, her fingers tightening slightly as if to hold onto this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha opens her eyes, there’s a softness there—a hint of gratitude mixed with something more, something unguarded. Her voice, when she finally speaks, is low and a little breathless.
     <em>
      “You really don’t hold back, do you?”
     </em>
     she says, her lips curving into a slight, almost disbelieving smile, unable to hide how much the touch means to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rather than answer, Rio decided to prove it. She gently pulled Agatha's head back, exposing the curve of her neck. Agatha's eyes fluttered closed as Rio's fingers brushed against her scalp, sending shivers down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not wanting Rio to gain the upper hand, Agatha swiftly leaned in, her lips brushing along Rio’s neck with a teasing slowness before she nipped lightly at her skin. It was a quick, possessive gesture, one that made Rio’s breath catch and her body arch forward more into Agatha’s, and Agatha couldn’t help the small, satisfied smile that played on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, Rio's legs began to wrap around Agatha's waist, pulling her closer, deeper. She could feel Agatha's heat, her warmth, and her own body responded, her hips pressing forward, seeking more contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha's mouth moved on Rio's throat, Rio felt a moan building in her chest. She let it out, a low, husky sound. Agatha's hands tightened on her shoulders, pulling her closer. When Agatha heard Rio’s quiet, involuntary gasp, a thrill shot through her—a mix of satisfaction and something far more intense. She could feel the shift in control, knowing that even Rio’s usual bravado couldn’t mask that small sound of pleasure. Agatha’s lips curled into a smirk against Rio’s skin, her mind racing. This was real, tangible proof of the effect she had on Rio, and for just a moment, she allowed herself to relish it fully, savoring every second of Rio’s reaction as if it were a secret only they shared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's teeth nipped at Rio's skin again, and Rio's legs tightened around her waist, pulling her closer. She could feel Agatha's body responding, her muscles tensing, and she knew that they were both on the edge, ready to tumble over into something more.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that moment, time seemed to slow down, and all that mattered was the feel of Agatha's mouth on her skin, the pressure of her body against Rio's, and the thrill of the unknown that lay ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were a tangle of limbs, a mess of sweat and skin and hair. They were fighting, wrestling, each trying to gain the upper hand. But it was a fight they both wanted to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands were on Rio's breasts, squeezing, teasing. Rio's fingers were in Agatha's hair, pulling, tugging. They were both moaning, gasping, their bodies straining against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, suddenly, they were on the bed, their bodies crashing down onto the mattress. They were still kissing, still fighting, but now they were horizontal, their bodies tangled together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands were on Agatha's hips, pulling her closer. Agatha's hands were on Rio's shoulders, pushing her back. They were rolling, tumbling, their bodies moving in perfect sync.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were a blur of skin and sweat and hair, their bodies moving together in a frenzy of desire. They were fighting, but they were also surrendering, giving in to the desire that had been building between them for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as they finally came to a stop, their bodies tangled together, their lips still touching, they both knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, suddenly, the sound of loud, drunken laughter echoed from the hallway outside, breaking the spell. They froze, their lips still inches apart, breaths mingling in the small space between them. Rio’s heart pounded against her ribs, her hands still tangled in Agatha’s hair, as they listened to the voices fade down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes darted toward the door, a flicker of anxiety breaking through the haze of desire. But before she could say anything, Rio leaned back in, her lips brushing over Agatha’s in a softer, more pleading kiss, trying to draw her back into that private world they had created.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha turned her head slightly, forcing their mouths apart. “Rio, wait,” she murmured, her voice husky but firm. “We need to talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a frustrated breath, her forehead pressing against Agatha’s as she tried to keep herself from diving back in. “We can talk later,” she said, her voice low, rough. “I just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another burst of laughter echoed outside, closer this time, and Rio felt the tension radiating from Agatha, saw the way her shoulders had stiffened, her grip on Rio’s arms a bit too tight. A flicker of uncertainty crossed Agatha’s face, just enough to reveal the guardedness she’d been holding back. Without thinking, Rio reached up, running a soothing hand along Agatha’s arm, her thumb brushing gently over the fabric of her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not here,” Rio whispered, her voice softer now, understanding the hesitation she saw in Agatha’s eyes. She forced herself to step back, her hands reluctantly slipping from Agatha’s waist. “Change and meet me at the garden—the path behind the dining hall.” She held Agatha’s gaze, letting the reassurance settle between them. “No one will see us there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated for just a moment, but as Rio’s hand gently rubbed her arm, the warmth of the touch radiated through her, grounding her in a way she hadn’t expected. She leaned into it, allowing herself to feel the reassurance, her own fingers squeezing Rio’s arm briefly in gratitude. The intensity in Rio’s eyes made her decision for her. She nodded, swallowing hard, and Rio turned, slipping back into the hallway before she could change her mind. As she closed Agatha’s door behind her, she felt her heart racing with anticipation, her mind already spinning with what might happen next.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Minutes later, Agatha found her way down the narrow, overgrown path that led to the garden. It was a secluded corner of the estate, hidden behind a tangle of ivy-covered hedges and tall trees that blocked out the distant lights of the building. The moon cast a silvery glow over the grounds, turning the leaves into shadowy shapes that rustled softly in the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she reached the garden, Agatha spotted Rio leaning against the trunk of an old oak, her arms crossed. The quiet determination on her face was unmistakable, but as Agatha drew closer, she noticed a flicker of something else—a hint of nervousness in Rio’s eyes, the way she shifted slightly under Agatha's gaze. It was endearing, this brief glimpse of vulnerability, and Agatha felt a warm rush at the thought that she could bring that out in her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had changed into a fitted jacket, the collar turned up slightly against the cool air, but Agatha’s eyes lingered on the gentle flush still coloring her cheeks, the way her lips remained slightly swollen from their kiss. She felt her own pulse quicken as she took in every detail, savoring how undeniably captivating Rio looked beneath the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     They locked eyes, and for a moment, neither of them moved. The night air was thick with the unspoken, with the promise of what could happen if they took just a few more steps toward each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a step closer, her gaze sweeping over Rio with a mix of admiration and restraint. “You look beautiful,” she murmured, the words almost slipping out, her voice softer than she intended. Her eyes lingered on Rio’s flushed cheeks, taking in the way her lips were still slightly swollen from their earlier kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt a blush creep up her neck, and despite her usual confidence, she couldn’t help but look down, a small, genuine smile tugging at her lips. “God, I’ve waited so long to hear you say that.” She chuckled softly, glancing up at Agatha with a spark of mischief in her eyes. “Though, I think I figured it out… you staring at me in class kind of gave it away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, laughing quietly. “You think you were subtle? Like I didn’t see those looks you kept giving me during lectures? You’re the worst at hiding things, Rio.” She raised an eyebrow, a playful glint in her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smirk deepened, and she stepped closer, reaching out to tug Agatha by the hand, pulling her in. “Okay, maybe I was obvious,” she admitted, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles in an almost unconscious gesture. “But you… you always knew how to drive me insane with just a look. That day in your office? You wore that tight blouse, knowing damn well what it was doing to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave an exasperated laugh, though her cheeks warmed. “I didn’t think you’d actually notice that much detail,” she murmured, but her tone hinted at knowing exactly what she had been doing that day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin turned sly. “Oh, I noticed everything. That time in the library, too—you bent down right in front of me, like you hadn’t seen me there at all.” She raised an eyebrow. “I knew you saw me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze flickered with surprise before she laughed, a soft, genuine sound that seemed to melt the tension between them. “I thought you were too busy pretending to study.” Her hand settled at Rio’s shoulder, her fingers curling lightly, as if she wasn’t quite ready to let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned in, her voice dropping to a murmur. “You don’t have to pretend anymore. I’m right here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, they just stood there, caught in each other’s gaze, a shared understanding passing between them. Agatha’s hand slid down to rest at Rio’s waist, her fingers brushing lightly over her hip. “Maybe I’ve wanted this as much as you have,” she confessed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes softened, and she reached up to tuck a stray strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear, her fingers lingering just a little too long. “Then let’s stop pretending,” she whispered, a hint of vulnerability threading through her usually confident tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze softened, her hand tightening slightly on Rio’s waist as if grounding herself. “We can’t keep doing this,” she whispered, but even as she said it, she knew she was already letting her guard down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s wrist in a soothing gesture. “I don’t care about ‘if,’ Agatha,” she replied, her voice steady. “I care about you. About whether you’re taking this seriously. About whether I matter to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s expression softened, a crack appearing in her carefully maintained composure. She stepped closer, her voice lowering. “You think you don’t matter to me? Rio, you’re all I think about—more than I should. More than I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to. But if people find out—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’ll assume I’m just getting special treatment,” Rio finished for her, bitterness creeping into her tone. “They’ll think I’m using you for grades or... or that you’re taking advantage of me. Is that it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flinched, the words cutting deep, but she didn’t deny them. She stepped closer, her fingers twitching at her sides, like she wanted to reach for Rio but couldn’t bring herself to. “It’s not fair, Rio,” she said quietly. “It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to me. But the reality is, people will talk. They’ll think the worst.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let them,” Rio shot back, her voice fierce. She took a step forward, closing the distance between them until she could see every line of tension in Agatha’s face, every shadow in her eyes. “Let them think whatever the hell they want. They don’t know what this is. They don’t know
     <em>
      us.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, her resolve wavering. “And what is this, Rio?” she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What are we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio faltered, the question hanging in the cool night air between them. “I don’t know,” she admitted, the words rough with frustration. “I just know that when I’m with you, everything makes sense. And when I’m not, it’s like I’m missing something—someone. And I think you feel that too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips parted, her gaze searching Rio’s face. For a moment, she seemed on the verge of saying something, but then Rio shifted, leaning back against one of the thick hedges behind her, her shoulder brushing against the leaves. As she moved, a stray twig caught in her hair, pulling free with a quiet rustle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth twitched into a small, reluctant smile as she reached out, plucking the leaf from Rio’s hair with gentle fingers. The touch was light, barely more than a brush, but it sent a shiver down Rio’s spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hand lingered a moment longer than necessary, her fingertips brushing against Rio’s temple, and when Rio turned her head slightly, their faces were just inches apart, their breaths mingling in the cool night air. The world around them seemed to hold its breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, without thinking, without weighing the consequences, Agatha leaned in and pressed her lips to Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was gentler than their earlier kiss, slower, like they were rediscovering each other in a new light. But it didn’t stay that way for long. Rio’s hands slid around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer, and Agatha responded in kind, cupping Rio’s face as she deepened the kiss, tasting the desperation and longing between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stumbled back into the shadows of the garden, half-laughing, half-panting as they moved together, the tension between them unraveling with each heated kiss. Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio’s back, feeling the curve of her spine through the thin fabric, while Rio’s fingers tangled in Agatha’s hair, tugging just enough to draw a quiet gasp from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere in the back of her mind, Agatha knew this wasn’t the place, that they were still teetering on the edge of an uncertain future. But as Rio’s lips brushed over her jaw, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin, she couldn’t bring herself to care.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The intensity of the kiss gradually softened, both of them pulling back just enough to breathe, their foreheads resting together as they smiled in the dim light. Agatha’s hand found Rio’s, her fingers lacing through hers with a gentle squeeze. The quiet of the garden settled around them, the rustling leaves and distant chirping of crickets creating a serene backdrop. Rio chuckled softly, the kind that comes from deep in the chest, and it made Agatha’s heart flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not exactly how I imagined a first date," Rio murmured, her thumb tracing idle patterns over Agatha's knuckles. "But... I kind of love it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, her thumb grazing over Rio’s fingers in return. "A little unconventional,” she admitted, a warmth creeping into her voice. “But we’re not exactly conventional people, are we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head, her eyes glinting with playful curiosity. “So, Professor Harkness...what would young Agatha have thought about sneaking out into a garden for a date?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, she’d be horrified,” Agatha laughed, her gaze drifting up to the stars as if she could see that younger version of herself. “The girl who would stay in the library until closing time. Books first, everything else second.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a low whistle. “So studious, and here I am, a regular rule-breaker.” She grinned, but there was a hint of something genuine in her voice. “Honestly, I would’ve tried to get your attention. Probably would’ve sat right in front of you just to see if I could distract you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I bet,” Agatha replied, shaking her head, though a fond smile played on her lips. “And what about you, Rio? What was young Rio like?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wayward, mischievous,” Rio said, raising her eyebrows with a smirk. “Climbing trees, staying out past curfew, and sneaking into places I wasn’t supposed to be. Guess some things never change.” She looked up at the stars, the playfulness dimming for a moment as she reflected. “But...always looking for something. Someone who understood me, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers tightened around hers slightly. “Do you think you’ve found that now?” Her voice was soft, as though she almost didn’t want to break the spell of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio met her gaze, her eyes warm and sincere. “I think I’m sitting next to her.” Her voice was quieter, the words hanging between them in the stillness. Agatha looked at her, a faint blush rising to her cheeks, but she didn’t look away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the star-strewn sky, they sat in a gentle silence, hands entwined, fingers naturally finding their way to one another as they absorbed the stillness around them. Agatha let her thumb draw idle patterns over Rio’s knuckles, glancing over occasionally to catch the delicate outline of Rio’s face against the silvered shadows of the night. It was like seeing her for the first time, each detail feeling new and vivid, as if Agatha could memorize her simply through touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head back, eyes scanning the constellations above, the familiar patterns shining softly against the deep velvet blue. “There,” she said, pointing to a small cluster near the horizon. “See those stars? That’s Perseus.” She leaned closer, a playful glint in her eyes. “My favorite troublemaker of mythology.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, raising an eyebrow. “Of course, you’d like Perseus. Bold, a little reckless, always diving headfirst into things. Sound familiar?”

    <p>
     Rio chuckled, squeezing Agatha’s hand. “Hey, it worked out for him in the end. Plus, he got to rescue the girl,” she added, casting Agatha a sidelong glance that made her stomach flip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a soft laugh, her eyes tracing the stars Rio had pointed out. “And there’s Andromeda,” she murmured, gesturing to a nearby constellation. “Tied to the rock, waiting for someone to save her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow, a hint of challenge in her gaze. “See, that’s where I think the myth gets it wrong. I bet Andromeda didn’t need saving. She was probably planning her own escape and would’ve pulled it off—if Perseus hadn’t swooped in first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s lips curved into a warm smile, her fingers brushing Rio’s with a sense of admiration. “I like that version,” she whispered, her gaze fixed on Rio. “Andromeda taking control, making her own choices. More empowering, don’t you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Much,” Rio agreed, and they both fell into another comfortable silence, their eyes returning to the sky. After a moment, Rio pointed to another constellation. “And there’s Orion. The hunter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s gaze followed Rio’s finger, spotting the familiar line of Orion’s belt. “Strong, determined, always searching for something just out of reach,” she murmured, feeling the weight of the words as they lingered in the cool night air.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sounds a lot like someone I know,” Rio replied, her voice soft, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. The words hung between them, full of unspoken truths and shared understanding, and Agatha felt a warmth rise within her, a quiet thrill at the thought that perhaps, in her own way, she had been seeking this moment all along.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that, their fingers still laced together, pointing out constellations and weaving their own meanings into the stars, allowing the night to deepen as they shared stories, laughter, and secrets under the wide, endless sky.

    <hr/>
    <p>
     “So, tell me,” Rio began, her voice a gentle murmur, “what exactly caught your eye? I mean, I have a feeling it wasn’t my stellar classroom behavior.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, the sound soft and warm. “Oh, absolutely not. It was the way you challenged everything,” she said, smiling as she thought back. “You didn’t just accept what I said, you made me prove it. That spark... it’s rare. And the way you’d look at me, like you knew you were driving me absolutely insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned, a hint of mischief returning to her expression. “Glad I left an impression,” she replied, her voice teasing. “I couldn’t help it, though. You were always so composed, so put-together. I kind of wanted to unravel you a little.” She paused, brushing a thumb over Agatha’s hand. “Still do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught for a moment, and she looked away, focusing on the stars to calm the thrill that Rio’s words sent through her. “I guess that’s fair,” she said, smiling. “Though I’d say you’re the more unpredictable one.” She tilted her head, eyes sparkling. “What’s the most spontaneous thing you’ve ever done?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered the question, her gaze softening as she thought. “One summer, I packed up and traveled cross-country with a few friends,” she said with a small, nostalgic smile. “No plan, just... wherever the road took us. It was messy and ridiculous, but it was freedom.” She paused, glancing over at Agatha. “Kind of reminds me of tonight, actually. Just letting things happen. Letting go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head. “That sounds... terrifying, honestly. I’m not sure I could do that—leave everything up to chance.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her, amusement flickering in her eyes. “You don’t have to plan every step, you know. Sometimes, letting things unfold is the best part.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled, a little self-consciously, but nodded. “Maybe you’re right,” she said, her gaze lingering on Rio. “Maybe I could use a little more... spontaneity.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They shared a warm, knowing glance, and after a few heartbeats of silence, Rio leaned her head back against the tree trunk, her eyes searching the sky. “You know what’s funny?” she said quietly. “I don’t think I’d change anything about all those random, reckless moments that brought me here. Because... I think it’s how I ended up finding you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers tightened around Rio’s, and for a moment, all she could do was stare at her, words caught somewhere in her throat. “You know,” she said softly, “I think I’m glad you found me too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze drifted back to her, and she leaned closer, their faces only inches apart. “Tell me one more thing, then,” she whispered, her eyes alight with curiosity. “When did you first know? That you liked me, I mean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes softened, and she glanced down, a hint of shyness breaking through her usual poise. “Probably... the day you challenged Billy during that debate.” She laughed lightly. “The way you stood up, that fire in your eyes—I think that’s when I knew I was in trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face split into a wide grin. “Good to know I’m just a troublemaker to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squeezed her hand, her voice a soft murmur. “More than that, Rio. Much more.” She leaned forward, her forehead brushing Rio’s, and they stayed like that, close and quiet, sharing a moment that felt timeless.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed in the garden for a while longer, talking and laughing about small memories and shared moments, letting the weight of the world fade in the quiet of the night.
