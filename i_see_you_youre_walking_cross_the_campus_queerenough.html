<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was Salem University's best professor, her designation be damned. Sure, she technically was an omega, but with the help of modern science (scent blockers and suppressants), she’d successfully managed never to have a heat after her initial presentation, and now, at forty-three, she took great pleasure in knowing that the threat of a heat popping up would soon be something she’d never even have to worry about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been easy—once or twice, she’d meet an alpha and could almost understand why omegas would choose to bind themselves to someone else. Hell, she’d nearly fallen into the trap herself, but if Agatha’s fucking disaster of a childhood had taught her anything, it’s that freedom is the only thing that matters. You can’t possibly ever be happy with someone else in charge of you, and this is why Agatha chose not to date alphas and tried her damn best to avoid them under any circumstances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>So, when Agatha’s new TA for the semester walks in, reeking of an admittedly delightful petrichor and warm vanilla scent, Agatha immediately shoots her face into the crook of her arm and uses her other arm to point dramatically to the exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA doesn’t move. Instead, she just blinks, staring at Agatha with her big dumb round eyes and her stupid beautiful alpha face. “Dr. Harkness, are you alright?” She asks, and god fucking damnit, her voice is sexy too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come back when you have scent blockers and suppressants, you fucking maniac.” Agatha spits. There is frankly no way that Agatha could be so in tune with the TA’s scent of it was being suppressed. This ansshole alpha was just raw dogging life with their scent out for all to smell.  <em>Inconsiderate privileged hippie alpha. </em>An omega could never just ‘choose’ not to take suppressants in a professional environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The alpha blanches. “I’m so sorry. I always wear my patch, and I take the annual suppressant shot. I just got it done last week.” The alpha’s eyes grow wide, and Agatha sees blood rushing to her cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think, maybe…” The alpha pauses and shifts her weight from one leg to the other, “Did you forget to take yours? It smells like you forgot yours.” The alpha blushes and starts to slowly back out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost laughs out loud. She pulls down her turtleneck and shows the TA her scent patch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“This is fucking great,” Agatha mutters. “Okay. I’m assuming you know what this means.” Agatha scowls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA visibly swallows. “We’re overriding suppressants. Um, we should probably get to know one another, and eventually y’know…mate?” She stutters out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>Christ, how did they let such an imbecile into this fucking institution?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts. “No, dumbass. You have to find a new class to TA.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA shakes her head no, and Agatha gets another whiff of her scent, this time stronger. She feels something pulse in her lower belly, and an excitement starts between her thighs. Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You have to leave.” Agatha growls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA looks like she’s in physical pain at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“We can’t be in the same room. How can I teach a class if you’re there?” Agatha<span class="Apple-converted-space"> demands. </span></p><p> </p><p>“I chose Salem State because of you. I was hoping you’d be my thesis advisor. I’m not dropping your class. You’re brilliant, and your research reads like a crime novel. I came here for you, Dr. Harkness. Please, I’m sure we can figure something out.” The alphas' pleading almost makes Agatha want to wrap them in a warm, comforting hug.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Why should Agatha let the alpha be sad when she can help? Her wolf uselessly supplies. She could give the alpha everything anyone could ever want. An intellectual partnership, companionship, a nest, a home, pups.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“SHUT UP,” Agatha grinds out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sorry?” The TA asks weakly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Not you.” Agatha sighs. “What’s your name, TA?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA scrunches her nose. “Didn’t you fill out my hiring paperwork?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You think I do that myself?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m Rio Vidal. I just finished up at UT Austin. I had a full ride and I finished top of my class. I’m researching early American witchcraft, just like you.” She says proudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thanks for the CV, but please leave.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The TA ignores her. “Your work has really inspired me. Please, don’t let something as silly as a designation prevent me from pursuing my scholastic dreams. Surely you understand that.” The alpha begs softly, and Agatha sees that she practically has the girl's heart resting in the palm of her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha may be a bitch, but she’s not a monster. She reaches out for the alpha’s-Rio’s-hand and feels her body thrum with warmth at the contact. Her breath hitches and she can feel her nipples hardening, she pulls her hand away and looks up at Rio, who seems equally effected, pupils blown out wide, and mouth slightly agape. The adorable gap in her teeth just noticable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Just because” Agatha waved her hand indiscriminately between them, “our biology has decided that we should do something does not mean that we should actually do it.” Agatha can practically hear her wolf starting to cry. “You’ll find someone more suited to you, Rio.” She says gently. “I’m too old to be your mate. You’re a smart, beautiful young alpha, someone else will come, I promise.” Agatha says, and stupidly feels tears pooling at the edge of her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s bright red and is also crying a bit, “I wasn’t expecting to be broken up with today.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “For it to be a breakup up you’d have to know me for longer than five minutes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio gives a watery laugh. ‘I’m actually a long-time admirer of your work, Dr. Harkness.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, knowing that she is about to do something profoundly stupid. “You can livestream into my classes and TA for me, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Will you be my advisor?” Rio rushes out. “After today, you’ll never have to see me in person again.” She offers, but Agatha can tell it’s the last thing the alpha actually wants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites down on her lip, considering. The smart thing would be to say no. Quit her job, run away, and move to California to start a new life far, far away from this alpha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fine. But just your advisor, nothing more, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin lights up the whole room. “Can I hug you?” She asks, happiness practically vibrating off of her skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“No! Out!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The TA will not leave Agatha alone. Agatha gave Rio her personal phone number for emergencies. To Agatha, an emergency would be something like being hit by a bus or losing all your possessions in a house fire. Really, anything that would prevent Rio from grading student papers or leading review sessions. To Rio, an emergency apparently can be anything from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘The cafe gave me an extra latte, do you want it?' to 'Professor. Kale looked at me strangely, Is she having a bad day?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Rio her number as a practicality, and having it is a privilege that the alpha is constantly abusing. But when Agatha’s phone rings just as she gets home and the caller ID flashes <em>TA, </em>Agatha sighs and answers. Just because there hasn’t been a real emergency in the past doesn’t mean there isn’t one now. That’s why Agatha picks up. Not because she likes the slight vocal fry in the alpha's voice or anything equally moronic.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha snaps as she swipes accept on the call and makes her way over to her cat, Scratchy, who is meowing indignantly in her demand for wet food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hello to you too,” Agatha hears the smug smile in the alpha's voice and pictures it. Her lips curl up in response, thinking about how Rio’s eyes always twinkle at her during their weekly advising sessions over Zoom. <em>Get a grip, </em>Agatha tells herself as she empties Scratchy’s overpriced medicated cat food into the bowl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I just heard about the Humanities fund-raising gala,” Rio continues. “I think we’re both expected to go, and I wanted to ask what you thought we should do about it.” She continues sheepishly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Fuck, Agatha had forgotten entirely about the stupid gala. She needed to go rub elbows with the dean to make sure the history departments budget didn’t get slashed, and Rio would have to schmooze with people who could help her secure research grants. They would definitely need to be in the same room. And this would be the first time since The Incident, which is what Agatha has deemed the day they met.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha breathes out. As Rio’s advisor, she cannot in good faith encourage the alpha not to go. It’s important to her career and future. Rio, regardless of how annoying she may be and her blatant disregard for boundaries, is a very talented scholar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I could catch the flu that weekend?” Rio suggests with half a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs deeply and collapses into her kitchen chair, and watches as Scratch licks her bowl clean. “Your chances of securing grant money will be stronger if you go in person.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I know.” Rio sighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The line is silent for a minute, neither of them wanting to surrender.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Then you could catch the flu?” Rio suggests breaking the silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>Jesus Christ, why couldn’t Agatha ever get one single TA whose frontal lobe had closed? </em>Agatha huffs out a breath, “I’ll make an appointment to grab lunch with Dean Calderu and get her drunk enough to sign off on my departmental budget proposal. Then, I’ll skip the gala for personal reasons.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Being in the same room at the same time isn’t an option,” Agatha says tartly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replies, and Agatha ignores the sadness in the alpha’s tone and the consequential ache it causes in her own stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Was that all?” Agatha asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yup.” Rio answers, still morose.</p><p> </p><p>A pang of pity goes through Agatha. She gets up to make a cup of tea and, because she’s feeling magnanimous, doesn’t hang up on Rio. She tries to think of something that might cheer the alpha up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ve requested that the diaries of Mercy Lewis be sent over for you to look at. I thought it might be helpful to get your hands on a primary source.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What?!” Rio practically shouts through the phone, “Oh my god, Agatha!! I put in a request for those to be sent to my undergrad years ago, and I’m still waiting for them to come through. How the hell did you get them?” Rio asks gleefully, and a burst of pride blossoms in Agatha. So, she likes it when Rio is happy. What’s the harm in that? Agatha tries not to dwell on the fact that she’s never cared much about any student's happiness in the past.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums into the phone with a smile. “I have my ways.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re incredible. The best of the best, thank you!” Rio gushes, and Agatha feels herself getting warm at Rio’s praise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She imagines Rio saying the same words in a lower voice, whispered into her ear as she cups Agatha’s breast, running the pad of her finger over her nipple. Agatha whimpers slightly involuntarily, and she hears Rio’s breath hitch over the phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks, and her voice is gravelly and raw. “Is everything alright?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That was just my cat.” Agatha lies. “Why are you calling me on a Friday night, Rio? This could have been an email.” Agatha snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Sorry.” Rio says, dejectedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Go get drunk or do whatever young people do.” Agatha snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Is that how you spent your Friday nights in your grad program?” Rio laughs. “I can’t picture it. The great Agatha Harkness trolling bars.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I certainly didn't spend them harassing my advisor.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs louder. “I’m not the one moaning on the phone, and pretending it’s just my cat. But, okay, Agatha.” She says smugly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha hangs up and screams into her hands. It’s loud enough that she startles Scratch, who bolts out of the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>…</p><p>“Is it okay if I eat during our meeting? I forgot to eat all day and feel like I might pass out.” Rio admits sheepishly. “I know some people don’t like the sound of chewing, so if you want, I can just scarf this down and call you back in five.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. Of all the people for her to have a scent connection with, this is who her body chose? This poster child for adult ADHD who has brought an entire rotisserie chicken to today’s Zoom call?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuts her eyes and pretends she’s in a parallel universe where she was born a beta and has a nice, normal life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks, “Did the connection go out? I think you froze. It’s probably me, I’m in the stacks in the library’s basement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re on campus?” Agatha asks, brow crinkling with concern. “It’s 9 pm on a Sunday.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I tutor undergrads on the weekends for extra cash. Salem rent prices, ya know?” Rio laughs feebly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t know. She bought her house right after she got tenure, before the housing boom. Her bitch mother dying and leaving Agatha a modest sum of money covered most of the down payment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You like your apartment, though? Is it comfortable and safe?” Agatha asks before she can stop herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio preens from the attention. A coy smile graces her lips. “It’s not so bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhales with relief. Rio is looking at her all too tenderly, and Agatha feels a rush of blood swell to her clit. Christ, she can feel her mating gland start to get irritated. She checks her own image at the bottom of the screen and sees it's an embarrassing magenta color.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She immediately covers it with her hair.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to-“<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Eat,” Agatha orders, interrupting Rio before she can say anything that could make the entire situation worse. “We’ll meet another time. Email me with your availability, and I’ll get back to you.” Agatha hangs up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She spends a few minutes trying to catch up on emails, but the throbbing between her legs just intensifies. Agatha whinces as she powers down her monitor, giving up on the task completely. She can smell her own slick seeping through her panties and shuts her eyes with frustration. Thoughtlessly, her hand sneaks underneath her jeans, slipping under her underwear, and she finds her clit and rubs at it harshly with her index and middle fingers. Her mind uselessly conjures Rio’s scent, and she imagines it’s the alpha's long lith fingers teasing her instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fuck” She grunts as she comes, quickly and cruelly. The orgasm isn’t nearly enough. Her body is now deeply unsatisfied, having had an idea of what it could be getting. She notices Scratchy giving her a judgmental look from his cat hammock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She narrows her eyes at him, “You didn’t have to stay and watch, pervert.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows that getting Lilia to agree to her budget will take a little bit of finessing. If she invites Lilia for lunch out of the blue somehwere nice enough to get her drunk, the older woman will know she has an ulterior motive. First, she has to remind Lilia that they do have a friendly working relationship. This is why on a Friday afternoon, Agatha opens Lilia’s door without knocking and pops her head in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m buying you an overpriced latte at the dumb cafe in the business school,” Agatha announces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks at her skeptically. “I have a full afternoon, Agatha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, lets herself into Lilia’s office, and gathers the dean’s coat, offering it to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I had Sharon cancel your meeting. Told her it was an emergency.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks mildly annoyed but also impressed. She lets Agatha help her into her coat and lead her away from her desk. On their way out of the staff offices, Sharon shoots them a sympathetic look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I hope your rash clears up, Dean Calderu. You’re lucky you have a friend like Agatha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What exactly did you tell her to get me out of my meeting?” Lilia asks under her breath. She gives Agatha a worried look, “You know what, I don’t want to know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia clears her throat. “Thank you, Sharon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>…</p><p>The line for the cafe isn’t too long, and Agatha gets herself an Americano and a latte with a chocolate chip cookie for Lilia. She makes her way back to the corner booth, where Lilia greets her with a smile, extending her hand out for the goodies.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s really absurd how nice it is in here.” Lilia shakes her head. “The business school always gets everything new and shiny.” Lilia sighs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits down, ‘The best thing about this place is that it’s all the way across campus. No humanities students.” Agatha grins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“As your Dean, I have to encourage you to at least try and foster supportive relationships with your students.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“They love me.” Agatha waves a hand dismissively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“How are your students this semester? You’re advising Rio, right? She’s in my seminar on modality. She stands out.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine straightens at the mention of Rio. She frowns. <em>Why would Rio be taking a philosophy seminar?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t had a student argue so much in class since I taught you.” Lilia teases fondly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Don’t bring up ancient history.” Agatha rolls her eyes. “Rio is fine. A perfectly adequate advisee. She’s TAing for me as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just fine? Are you letting her lecture for you? I think she’d love it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a low, impressed breath. “You really think she’s that good?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s brow furrows. “I’m confused. Is she not participating in class?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I don’t make her come. She watches on Zoom and does my grading. She also holds office hours to help the kids.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stares at Agatha for a beat too long without saying anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“What?!” Agatha snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s her job to go to class.” Lilia raises an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha sets her jaw and looks at Lilia sternly. “This is for the best.” She says in a clipped tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s eyes widen. “Is it something to do with her designation? She doesn’t seem the type, but you never know with alphas. Do we need to find her a new advisor? Should you file a report? Are you okay?” Lilia asks her and reaches out to hold her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatches it out of the older beta's grasp. “Nothing happened. Rio is fine, I’m fine. Everything is fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks at Agatha with a level of sadness that makes her stomach hurt. Agatha sighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Look, I’m only telling you this because you look like you’re about to try and get her expelled,” Agtaha warns. “When we met in person, her scent overpowered my blockers.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s mouth falls open. “You’re scent bound?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha frowns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Lilia looks at her with a mix of skepticism and pity. “I can take her on as my advisee if you don’t want to deal with it. Then you two can… proceed however you need. It’s not technically against school code as long as she doesn’t take any of your classes. Normally, I’d discourage it, but this is an exceptional circumstance.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts. “Just my luck, huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Finding your scent bound is a good thing, Agatha. Many people never do.” Lilia says whimsically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha screws her eyes shut. “You can offer to advise her, but don’t tell he you know, okay? I don’t want her to think I’m open to anything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re not?” Lilia frowns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“She’s fifteen years younger than me. I can’t trap her.” Agatha says softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think most people would consider this a trap.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m leaving.” Agatha declares, gets up from the table, and storms out of the cafe. Lilia lets her go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Later that evening, she gets a text from Lilia: <em>I think you should continue advising Rio if you can, but I can accommodate any changes you may need.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws her phone across the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha logs onto her Zoom call with Rio and tries to ignore the incessant beating of her heart. There’s no reason for her to feel so jittery. Rio is miles and miles away, and Agatha can’t do anything she’ll regret over Zoom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio logs on, and her hair is gently curled. She’s wearing mascara and a light lip gloss. Agatha’s mouth feels dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You look nice.” The words leave Agatha’s mouth before she can filter herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, and the little fucking gap in her teeth is as adorable as ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, Agatha. You look gorgeous, as always.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignores the compliment and the pleased feeling it gives her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“My roommate is in cosmetology school, and I promised him he could practice on me before his test tomorrow.” Rio’s grin becomes teasing, “I’ll let him know the reviews are off the charts.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far,” Agatha says drily. “Talk to me about this new idea for your thesis you mentioned in your email.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha listens as Rio explains what she wants to focus on. Rio’s idea is so good that Agatha is a little pissed she didn’t think of it herself.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be able to get grants for this pretty easily.” Agatha tells her</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, I don't want to get too excited.” Rio bites her lip nervously, and Agatha spends too much time looking at how plump and full it is. She imagines what it might feel like under her own lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks, and Agatha belatedly realizes that Rio has been talking while she was daydreaming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, was thinking about what I’m going to make for dinner.” Agatha lies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow skeptically. “You seem like more of a takeout person to me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles. “You didn’t go through public high school in the early aughts as an omega without lots of home economics classes. I’m extremely accomplished in the kitchen.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns. “Oh, god. I’m so sorry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I actually loved it. I always thought if I didn’t end up in academia, I’d open a restaurant.” She admits. “If you repeat that to anyone, I will fail you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio mimes sealing and locking her lips. “Maybe I can try your cooking someday.”</p><p> </p><p>“I usually bring cookies on the last day of class. I’ll have someone get some to you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio grins like she just won the lottery, and Agatha tries not to think about how badly she wants to cook for Rio, and what that means.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>On Saturday afternoon, after bravely and silently suffering through a scratchy throat all morning and realizing that she can no longer breathe through her nose, Agatha is forced to admit she’s caught a cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She debates preemptively canceling her Monday classes, but then remembers what Lilia had said about letting Rio lecture. It would be a good chance for the TA get her feet wet with presenting, and keep her survey History course on schedule. So, Agatha shoots Rio a text asking her if she’d be willing to take over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, when Rio facetimes her without even asking if she’s free, Agatha knits her brows in annoyance.“Yes?” Agatha answers, glaring.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rio is actively walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her phone camera is shaking with each step, and it makes Agatha feel nauseous. The alpha is wearing a Carhartt beanie, and the way her hair curls underneath it is adorable.</p><p> </p><p>“You sound horrible.” Rio pouts prettily and takes a seat on a bench. Agatha sees the white tents of the Westview Farmers' market behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Why are you calling me, Rio?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“A girl can’t call her favorite adviser to try and cheer her spirits while she’s on what's clearly her deathbed?” Rio chaffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks heat up. She<em> is</em> in bed. Her hair is a bird's nest, and she’s wearing a ratty old Red Sox sweatshirt that has stains old enough to vote. She doesn’t even like baseball.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Seriously though, are you alright? Do you need anything?” Rio asks gently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sniffles indignantly. “I’m fine.” Her head is pounding again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her skeptically.</p><p> </p><p>“I could be resting. Tell me why I’m on the phone with you instead.” Agatha says, narrowing her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face breaks into a grin. “You really want me to lecture? You think I’m ready?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs nonchalantly and fights a smile. “Only one way to find out.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I have your lecture notes from the Google Doc. Is there anything you want me to add?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip and tries to recall what topic she was supposed to cover in class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Not that your notes aren’t enough. They’re very thorough, you're the expert.” Rio rushes out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’m too congested to remember what's in the notes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You poor thing.” Rio frowns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’ll watch on Zoom. Think of it as practice for your thesis presentation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, startled. “Will you give me feedback?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You want me to give you a big gold star?” Agatha mocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face turns a delightful shade of red. “Shut up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins like the Cheshire Cat. “I’ll call you after class, and we’ll discuss how it went. I’m sure you’ll do fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio squirms uncomfortably, and Agatha realizes a beat too late that the alpha isn’t just embarrassed, she’s aroused. Agatha files this information away for later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Feel better. I’ve gotta go.” Rio mumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After they hang up, Agatha pictures Rio trying to hide that she has a raging hard-on at the farmers' market and cackles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                     </span>…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio lectures like she’s talking to a group of friends. It’s entirely too casual. She lets the students interrupt her, has gotten sidetracked to at least three topics that she wasn’t meant to cover, and is goddamn riveting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha thinks that watching her is probably similar to watching Picasso paint. She’s half mesmerized by the genius of the work, and half horrified at how untraditional it is.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is contentedly watching from the comfort of her living room. Her laptop is sitting on a pile of books on her coffee table—her camera is off, obviously, and she is lying down on the couch. She changed out of her pajamas into a comfortable cashmere lounge set and took her favorite blanket from her nest downstairs with her this morning. She’s been sipping on a cup of steaming ginger tea as she watches Rio, and her eyelids feel heavy. Her entire body aches, and she’s somehow even more congested than before. Scratchy is fast asleep in her lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That wraps up our lecture. Does anyone have any questions?” Rio asks the class. Agatha can’t actually see them, but she has a pretty good idea of whose hands will be eagerly raised and who will be half asleep in the back of the lecture hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Because of the placement of Rio’s laptop, Agatha can’t actually hear the student's questions. She makes a mental note to ask Rio later if this has been an issue when their roles were reversed. Not that the student questions are ever particularly intelligent, but Agatha supposes that if Rio is dealing with them for review sessions, she should maybe know what they’re struggling with in the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio moves closer to the students to answer. Agatha can’t hear a thing she’s saying. Now Rio’s turned completely away from the camera, and Agatha gives up on trying to follow what’s happening. Agatha lets herself ogle at the way her TA’s pants cling to her ass; she’s only staring because she has a fever. And Rio <em>does</em> have an incredible ass. Agatha closes her eyes, just for a minute. If she falls asleep, it’s okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’ll just wake up when Rio comes back into frame.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wakes up to Scratchy yowling indignantly at her. Her head is pounding, and both her cheek and the pillow she was sleeping on are sticky with drool. It’s pitch black, which means it's already past six, and Scratchy is wondering where the hell his dinner is.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Stop screaming at me,” Agatha whines, and she gets up and makes her way to the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Scratchy meows louder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Some cats live on the streets and have to find their own dinner, you know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha opens the can of wet food and puts it in Scratchy’s bowl. She notices her phone on the kitchen counter and picks it up, remembering she hasn’t played the NYT spelling bee yet today. Before she unlocks her phone, she sees that she has a long list of notifications. An email from Lilia, a picture of Jen’s cat, three missed calls from Rio, and a barrage of texts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>2 pm Rio: Was it gold star worthy? Are we still on for my performance review/advising meeting in 10?</p><p> </p><p>2:30 pm Rio: Have class at three. Let me know when you want to touch base.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>5 pm Rio: Checking in to make sure you’re okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>5:15 pm Rio: Do you need anything? Groceries, medicine?</p><p> </p><p>6 pm Rio: Sorry, I’m texting so much. Just worried lol. Lmk you’re okay, and I’ll fuck off</p><p> </p><p>Guilt sweeps swiftly over Agatha. She slept through Rio’s advising meeting, and Rio seems to be spinning out because of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a seat at the kitchen counter and presses call.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio answers. She sounds breathless and panicked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You did great in class. I fell asleep when you opened the floor for questions, and I just woke up. But you’re really good in front of an audience.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, are you okay?” Rio asks, apparently unconcerned about the lecture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Peachy,” Agatha replies sarcastically. “It’s just a stupid cold. I’m fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs nervously. “If I still hadn’t heard from you by seven, I was going to try and send over a wellness check.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Take a breath, Alpha, I’m fine,” Agatha says. The title slips off her lips before she can notice what she’s said. Agatha hears Rio’s breath catch on the other end of the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, that was inappropriate.” Agatha takes a steadying breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m fine, Rio. You don’t have to worry about me.”</p><p>“Its hard not to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhales. “Not being able to reach me got you pretty bent out of shape, huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't respond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to talk about the lecture?” Agatha asks, grasping at straws for a safe topic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I need to see you.” Rio blurts. “Just to make sure you’re okay, fuck. I’m sorry.” Rio sounds absolutely wrecked. “My wolf is freaking out, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says softly, feeling terrible that she’s the reason Rio is so out of sorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wait, really?” Rio asks, gobsmacked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I’m not letting you in the house, but you can come and see that I’m fine if you stay on the porch.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asks breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“If you’re coming over your bringing me dinner. I’ll order online and pay, and you can pick it up. Do you like Vietnamese food? Are you hungry?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Are you really sure?” Rio asks again. “I can just go and try to get a pheremone infusion at an urgent care to calm me down.”</p><p>“Your school-sponsored health insurance plan definitely isn’t going to cover that. Just come over. I’ll text you the name of the restaurant and my address, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha puts on a bra, a surgical mask, covers her mating gland up with a scarf, and puts on a flannel robe before going out to the porch to meet Rio. The fresh air feels good against her clammy skin, but it is definitely chillier than she’d like, so she turns on her gas fire pit table. It was an impulse buy, but it’s not like she has to be saving up for Scratchy’s college fund.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A beat-up Toyota Corolla parks in front of her house, and Rio comes out holding the brown bag of takeout.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s wearing a UT sweatshirt and gray sweatpants. It’s the most dressed down Agatha’s ever seen the alpha, and seeing Rio look so casual and relaxed makes her feel inexplicably happy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha waves hello, and Rio smiles widely. “Where should I leave the food?” Rio asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Depends on how afraid you are of my germs.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs. “I never get sick, so I’m not worried.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip as she considers her options. It wouldn’t be smart to invite the alpha to sit with her on the porch, but being outside should diffuse their scents. And, Rio’s had a hellish afternoon, no thanks to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Come sit with me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio scrambles up the porch so quickly that Agatha briefly worries she’ll trip on the stairs. She puts the food down before plopping into the Adirondack chair next to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“I ordered food for you, too. You never actually answered when I asked if you were hungry.” Agatha scolds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I haven’t eaten since this morning,” Rio admits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know what you’d like, so I got a vegetarian pho and a chicken pho. I’ll eat whichever you don’t. My favorite thing about this place is that they package everything in bowls and always give silverware, so you don’t have to do dishes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow, “That’s not very environmentally friendly.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Just for that, you’re getting the vegetarian pho.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs and passes Agatha the food. She takes out the bowls and silverware and hands Rio her meal, careful not to actually touch the alpha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Your house is really nice.” Rio says, “It’s homier than I expected.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “You haven’t even been inside.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You have a luxury fire pit, big comfy chairs, and a screened-in porch. The inside could be a dump, and I’d still consider it luxurious.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs. “Is it okay if I take off my mask?” She asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I think you’d have a hard time eating with it on,” Rio says with a shit-eating grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes off her mask, and even though she’s congested, Rio’s scent is clear and divine. Thunder and warm vanilla. She hums happily at the scent and leans her head against the back of her chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at the ground, sitting on her hands, and seems a bit withdrawn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You feeling any better?” Agatha asks, frowning as she opens her soup. It’s too hot to eat, so she sets it down on the fire Pit table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” Rio hums, still not meeting her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her skeptically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t think you wanted to talk about it,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>“ My fever brain is giving you a free pass today.” Agatha offers. “I’m not liable to remember anything or have any intelligent responses.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just pretend everything is okay and we’re just a regular advisor and student having a dinner meeting.” Rio suggests softly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuts her eyes. She hates how resigned Rio sounds.</p><p>“I know it’s not ideal.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not ideal?” Rio laughs bitterly. “I dream about you.” Rio continues. “I feel like you should know. I have this recurring dream where you’re working at a typewriter, and it catches on fire, but you don’t notice, and you keep typing. I try to warn you, but you can’t hear me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts. “That’s a little on the nose.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio glares at her. “You can be kind of a bitch, you know that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lightly and reaches out to Rio without thinking. She places her hand on Rio’s knee, and Rio practically melts at the touch. It feels so right that Agatha can’t even bring herself to pull her hand away. Rio takes a bite of her pho, and Agatha reluctantly takes her hand away from the alpha’s knee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh fuck, this is good,” Rio moans after slurping her noodles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins. “Worth the single-use plastic?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs. “Honestly, yeah.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The rest of the meal is quiet, but it’s a peaceful silence. Rio yawns loudly after she finishes her meal, and Agatha has to stifle a laugh at how cartoonish it sounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You should probably get some sleep.” Agatha points out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes, “Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets up and rolls her shoulders back. “I know I slept all day, but honestly I’m pretty exhausted, too.” She admits.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll get out of your hair,” Rio says as she stands and quickly gathers all of the trash from their meal, putting it back into the take-away bag. “Thanks for letting me come over and for dinner.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“This was nice,” Agatha admits, uncharacteristically candid. It must be from the fever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Lilia is being too nice. The realization hits Agatha like a freight train as she sits down for the faculty meeting. She is twenty minutes late, and Lilia didn’t make a single scathing remark about it or give her any dirty looks. Instead, the older woman smiles gently and gestures to an empty seat for Agatha to take. It feels like a trap. </p><p> </p><p>The meeting continues after Agatha’s unceremonious arrival and is uneventful–Jen wants the department to pay for her Roman civ class to see the new exhibit of Imperial era ceramics at the MFA, and Sharon wants a mini-fridge for her office. Agatha feels confident that she’s done a halfway decent job at pretending she’s listening as everyone airs their respective grievances. The meeting comes to a close, and Agatha stands to leave. Between not wanting to get stuck in a conversation with Jen and the lack of snacks, there’s really no reason for her to stick around. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Harkness, a word?” Lilia calls just as Agatha is about to slip out of the doorway. </p><p> </p><p>“Ooh, someone’s in trouble.” Jen smirks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at her, and Jen snickers in response. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing of the sort.” Lilia waves Jen off. “Agatha, come to my office. I have an extra slice of that cake you like.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen looks at Agatha, frowning. “Are you sick? Is that why Lilia’s being nice? You do look haggard. You’d tell me if you were dying, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus.” Agatha groans. “Can’t a dean give her favorite professor a slice of cake?” she asks saccharinely. </p><p> </p><p>Jen’s eyes narrow. “Somethings going on here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dr. Kale, enough,” Lilia warns. </p><p> </p><p>“You never have cake for me, is all I’m saying.” Jen shrugs and walks away. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re gluten-free and vegan!” Lilia calls after her, but Jen is already halfway down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>In Lilia’s office, Agatha is devastated to learn that there is no cake. </p><p> </p><p>“You lured me here under false pretenses,” Agatha says as she sinks into Lilia’s worn leather couch. She shoves her hand into the candy dish Lilia has on her coffee table and takes a fistful of the stupid little individually wrapped candies and shoves them in her pocket.</p><p>“Do you want the name of the website I ordered them from?” Lilia points to the candy as she sits across from Agatha in an old leather chair. </p><p> </p><p>“What did you want to discuss?” Agatha crosses her arms over her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Your budget request this year was more outlandish than usual.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sinks back into the couch; it smells like old books and leather cream. “I’m not anticipating funds from the donor gala this year.” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia furrows her brow. “Did you hear something I should know about? Will it affect other donations, or is it more of a…personal issue?” Lilia closes her eyes briefly and frowns. “You’re usually smart about these things, Agtaha. I’m surprised and disappointed. Who did you offend?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bristles. “Excuse me?! Why are you assuming it’s my fault?” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia rubs at her temples. “Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t do anything!” Agatha insists, suddenly feeling twelve years old. She takes a breath to steady herself. “I can’t go because Ms. Vidal needs to be in attendance to secure research grants.” </p><p> </p><p>The look of pity that crosses Lilia’s face makes Agatha feel nauseous. </p><p> </p><p>“Have you given any thought to having me advise Rio? I looked into school policy, and you’d be free to mate, so long as she doesn’t take any of your classes. It would be unorthodox but not unprecedented…” Lilia trails off. </p><p> </p><p>“Who said anything about mating?” Agatha seethes. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not getting any younger.” Lilia shrugs. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Agatha spits out. </p><p> </p><p>“I always regretted never having children,” Lilia admits. “I love being a professor, but I wish that I had more than just my career.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god.’ Agatha groans, putting her head in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“And I’m a beta, I don’t even have a biological imperative like you do.” Lilia continues, ignoring Agatha’s discomfort. </p><p>“Please tell me this is some bizarre hallucination.” </p><p> </p><p>“I care about you, Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p>“You care about me so much that you want me to go fuck a student and have her knock me up?” Agatha hisses. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be crass.” Lilia admonishes. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god.” </p><p> </p><p>“Calm down. I’ll make tea. I have some biscotti.” Lilia pats Agatha’s knee. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at her. “If you don’t approve my budget, I’m telling HR you told me to sleep with my advisee.” </p><p> </p><p>Lilia rolls her eyes. “I was going to approve it anyway.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Good.” </p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is on her way home from the grocery store when Rio calls. The alpha has somehow been getting even more relaxed about contacting Agatha. Agatha is loath to admit it, but she was eagerly waiting to hear from Rio. The alpha usually would have concocted some scheme to get in touch earlier in the day.</p><p> </p><p>A warm feeling bubbles up in Agatha’s stomach as she accepts the call, and she tries to push it down. “You have three minutes, five if you’ve got any gossip I can use later for blackmail”. She tells Rio as she answers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs lowly, and Agatha hates how charming it sounds. The muscles of Agatha’s neck loosen, her entire body set at ease just from hearing Rio’s voice.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be quick then. Anything exciting planned for your big night off?” Rio asks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes but still smiles to herself. “You’re not even going to pretend this call is work-related tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me for having manners.” Rio huffs. Agatha can picture the pout on the alpha's face, and in a moment of weakness, decides to humour her. “I’m going to stay in, smoke a joint, and make Ina Garten’s roast chicken.” </p><p> </p><p>“A wild night!” Rio teases. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ve clearly never tried Ina’s chicken.” Agatha deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d like to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts a laugh. “I’ll bet.  Given the amount of  protein shakes and ramen I see you eat during our Zoom meetings.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’ve seen me eat real food, too.”  Rio defends. </p><p> </p><p>“Only that I’ve bought you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Come over for dinner. I’ll show you what I can eat.” Rio says smugly, and Agatha’s breath catches.</p><p> </p><p>“Shouldn’t you be getting ready for the gala tonight?” Agatha tries to guide the conversation back to manageable territory. </p><p> </p><p>“Thats tonight?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly chokes on her spit and speeds through a stop sign. “If you don’t go to that gala tonight, I will kill you myself. Rio, you could miss out on tens of thousands of dollars for your research.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs. “8 pm at the president’s residence, I know, Agatha. I was messing with you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t fuck with me on the phone. I’m driving a car. I could’ve killed a pedestrian, and it would have been all your fault”. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d take care of the bodies for you,” Rio says with a giggle. God, what a little freak. </p><p> </p><p>“Thats what I’m calling about, actually,”  Rio says after a brief pause. </p><p> </p><p>“Helping me get away with murder?” Agatha snorts.</p><p> </p><p>“Har har,” Rio replies, sarcastically. “The gala. Are there any people who usually donate to research like mine that I should seek out? Any people I should avoid?” </p><p> </p><p>“I try to stay away from any white male alpha as a general rule at these sorts of things, but they might not be as big of an issue for you.” </p><p> </p><p>“I live my life trying to avoid that category of person,” Rio admits. “They don’t tend to like extremely good-looking female omegas of color.” She jokes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hates that she just assumed Rio would be safe given her designation. “Sorry.” She admits. </p><p>“Anyone you do like? In seminar today, Dr. Kale said the only person who hates the gala more than her is you.” </p><p> </p><p>“I hate it when she’s right.” Agatha sighs. “Just make sure you find Dottie Proctor. I emailed her about your research and she’s interested in helping you.” </p><p> </p><p>“You reached out to people on my behalf?” Rio asks. </p><p> </p><p>“My job is to guide you through your degree, no?” </p><p> </p><p>“We both know this is above and beyond what’s expected of you. Thank you.” Rio breathes. </p><p> </p><p>A warm feeling tingles up Agatha’s spine. She was hoping Rio would be pleased. “Don’t mention it. Have fun tonight, and don’t abuse the open bar.” Agatha warns. </p><p> </p><p>“Open bar?” Rio asks. </p><p> </p><p>“If you’re lucky, Sharon will try to sing the national anthem at last call.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs. “I’m hoping to be in bed long before then.” </p><p> </p><p>“Good girl.” Agatha hums. Then, a clanking noise followed by static. She hears Rio say, ‘oh fuck’ in the distance. </p><p> </p><p>“Did you really just drop your phone because I called you a good girl?” Agatha chuckles. </p><p> </p><p>“I tripped.” Rio says, unconvincingly. One of the first things Agatha noticed about Rio the day she came into her office was how graceful the alpha was. There’s no way she tripped. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t drink too much and stay away from the shrimp cocktail, trust me. I’ll hear from you on Monday.” Agatha smiles and hangs up. </p><p> </p><p>Later that evening, with a belly full of Ina’s chicken and Scratchy at her heels, Agatha heads out to the screened-in porch and rolls herself a joint. She’s come a long way from hiding weed in her sock drawer and sneaking out onto the roof to smoke it. Agatha didn’t hide her smoking habit from her mother because she thought the bitch would disapprove, she hid it so Evanora wouldn’t steal her stash. </p><p> </p><p>She lights up and inhales, the familiar burn scraping at her throat. She holds it and exhales smoothly. She repeats the process until her head feels fuzzy and her shoulders loosen. Scratchy hops into her lap and she ashes out her joint, looks up at the sky, and gets lost in the stars. </p><p> </p><p>She’s brought back to earth when her phone buzzes. She opens it, scowling. It’s 7pm on a Friday night. There is literally no one in the world who could possibly need anything from her.</p><p> </p><p> She has three unopened texts from Rio. Of course. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clicks on the notification and is face to face with a picture of Rio in a well-tailored black suit. Her suit jacket is closed, but it’s clear that underneath instead of a shirt, the alpha is wearing a bandeau bra. Agatha’s mouth goes dry, and heat coils low in her belly. Underneath the image Rio has written three texts:</p><p> </p><p><em>Is this too slutty for a faculty party. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>oh shit. Wrong number. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha I’m so sorry.  Please please pretend this never happened. I am so sorry. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha, considerably stoned, profoundly horny and invariably impulsive, calls Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Where are you?” Agatha asks. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry.” Rio rushes out. </p><p> </p><p>“I asked you a question.” She growls.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m at home. I’m about to leave for the gala. Agatha, I really didn’t mean to send that to you, I swear. I thought I was sending it to my friend Alice and both of your names start with A and I must’ve pressed send before reading to who. I am so sorry.” Rio babbles a little breathlessly. God she’s pathetic. It’s making Agatha wet. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop apologizing.” Agatha orders. “Are you by yourself?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes”</p><p> </p><p>“Undo your pants.” She husks into the phone. Rios breath catches. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“Stroke yourself. Imagine it’s my hand instead.” Agatha pants as she slips her hand below her underpants and her fingers meet damp curls. She sucks in a breath and begins to rock into her hand. Agatha’s middle finger finds her clit and runs across the nub and back again. She’s already close.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh fuck.” Rio whimpers. </p><p> </p><p>“How does it feel?” Agatha asks. </p><p> </p><p>“ ‘s really good.” Rio chokes out. Rio’s breathing speeds up and Agatha  touches herself to the sound. Agatha is too high to tell how much time has passed but she hears Rio’s breath hitch. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you gonna come for me, baby?” Agatha asks, picturing Rio’s cheeks flushing. She can practically smell the fresh air scent of her. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t make a mess.” Rio whispers, she sounds wrecked. </p><p> </p><p>“Too bad I’m not there to swallow, hm?” Agatha coos. “Such a waste of cum.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god.” Rio croaks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her own orgasm building. “Get something to spill into, Rio.” She gasps. The collar of Agatha’s shirt digs into her mating gland and the sensation makes her come hard and fast. She hears Rio moan obscenely over the phone. As the fog of her orgasm clears, so does the fog of the weed and Agatha realizes the magnitude of what just happened. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks, and she sounds dreamy and far away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels herself begin to cry. </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio repeats. “Sweetheart, are you okay?” She asks gently. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, this was a big mistake. Good luck at the gala”  Agatha whispers weakly and hangs up.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p><span>There is no denying it, Agatha fucked up. She let Rio get in too close. Rio’s magnetism was impossible to resist. And even if Agatha hadn’t had the self-restraint of a two-year-old failing The Stanford marshmallow experiment, Rio was methodically breaking down all of Agatha’s walls. The unsolicited communication and flirting had blurred the lines of what was happening between them, and Agatha did a bad thing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha lies awake in bed, alone. Scratchy, who normally sleeps tucked against her side, is avoiding her. He only does this when her pheremones are well and truly fucked. Agatha tries to calm herself as she stares up at the ceiling. A good night of sleep is definitely not in the cards tonight. It’s already past four am. She’s spent the past ten hours spiraling and thinking of every possible outcome for her and Rio, and all of them are awful. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The best-case scenario is that nobody ever finds out about the phone call. That’s the only way that Agatha won’t be fired and Rio won’t be put on probation or kicked out of school. Agatha spent her entire adult life fighting tooth and nail to be taken seriously as an omega in academia, and she managed to destroy her career in the span of a fifteen-minute phone call. Agatha figured it was a fifty-fifty chance of Rio’s career recovering from an incident like this. The worst-case scenario is that Agatha is arrested for unconsensual sexual activity. The phone call felt consensual, but she never explicitly asked, and Rio could have felt like she was being coerced and that she couldn’t say no without repercussions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gets up, vomits from stress, brushes her teeth, gets a glass of water, strips her regular sheets off the bed, and immediately starts building a nest. The first step in figuring out how to move forward is to get her central nervous system somewhat functioning again. She hasn’t built a nest for emotional comfort since she was in her twenties and still under her mother’s thumb.</span></p><p> </p><p><span> Agatha puts a clean set of silk sheets on the bed and spreads out a fluffy down comforter. She meticulously arranges all the pillows on her bed and lays down a soft lilac sherpa blanket. She even takes out the body pillow that she only uses for particularly intense heats. Anything that might make her feel better. She gets under the covers again, wrapping herself in the blanket, and hugs the pillow. She doesn’t even realize she’s crying until she sees the wet patch on her sheets. In the comfort of her nest, she finally falls into a numb sleep. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha wakes up to her phone blaring. She buries her head under a pillow and waits for it to stop, but whoever is trying to reach her is persistent. A chill runs down her spine when she realizes it’s probably Rio. Agatha prays that the alpha will just leave a voicemail, but when her phone stops ringing and immediately starts again for the third time, she realizes that she’s shit out of luck. She gets out of bed and accepts the call. Her palms are sweaty, and she feels a lump in her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can hear you breathing, so I know you’re there,” Rio speaks softly. “I think we need to talk about what happened last night.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay.” Agatha breathes out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t want you to be upset. I wish it could have happened under different circumstances, but I don’t regret anything that happened.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha tastes bile in her throat. “I’m sorry.” She whispers hoarsely. “I should never have called.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio giggles nervously. “Yeah, probably not. But I’m a grown-up. I could have shut it down if I wanted to. And, given the…complicated nature of our situation, I think it’s understandable that this could have happened.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hums weakly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can I see you in person?” Rio asks, and Agatha hears that hopeful optimism and a youthful confidence that everything is going to work out in Rio’s voice. She’s so young. Agatha feels panic swirling in her gut. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sighs. “I know you’re upset, but I don’t think what happened is a bad thing, Agatha. I don’t regret it, and you shouldn’t either.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha steels her nerves. What she is about to do is for Rio’s own good. Even if every cell in her body is screaming at her not to do this, Agatha knows it is her only option. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I need to take some space. From here on out, I will only contact you through my university email, and I expect you to do the same. Please only reach out to me about professional matters.” Agatha’s voice sounds detached and far away to her own ears. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio is silent.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha breathes deeply. “Ms. Vidal?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hears Rio take in a shaky breath. “I’ll see you for my advising meeting,” Rio says thickly. Agatha is nearly certain the alpha is crying. She feels sick. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very well,” Agatha says stiffly and hangs up. She crawls back into bed, types out an email to Lilia saying she won’t be coming in this week, and cries herself to sleep. </span></p><p><span>                                   </span> <span>   …</span></p><p><span>The next month passes in a numb blur. Agatha is sleeping too much and not making any effort to see people outside of work. Every time Lilia tries to check in or invites her to lunch, Agatha finds an excuse to get out of it. She feels hollow and lonelier than she’s ever felt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio has cancelled every advising meeting that Agatha tried to set up, and the only contact Agatha’s had with the alpha has been regarding Rio’s TA responsibilities. It all feels sterile and cold and leaves Agatha with a bitter taste in her mouth. Agatha tells herself it’s all for the best and almost believes it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Although Agatha feels like a disaster, her pheromones have finally settled enough that Scratchy’s stopped ignoring her. He’s mostly back to his snuggly self, but she knows that even he is tired of her bullshit. He’s given up on meowing when he doesn’t get fed on time, and this morning just stares at her with disappointment as she gets out of bed two hours past when he used to get wet food for breakfast. He’s not starving— Agatha heard his automatic feeder go off for dry food. He’s just spoiled and wants her to give him the good stuff. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I know.” She tells him as she wraps her linen robe around her body. He slow blinks at her, clearly happy she’s up and moving. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Taking care of you is the only thing I do that really matters, and I can’t even get that right.” She sighs and follows him to the kitchen. He jumps up on the counter and headbutts her as she prepares his wet food with a topper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s own appetite has been shit. Her clothes have gotten baggier, and she’s been having dizzy spells because of it. She spreads some butter onto a piece of sourdough and forces it down before she makes herself a cup of coffee. She opens her computer to grade student essays. Normally, this is a task she’d be all too happy to pawn off on a TA, but apparently, Agatha is now avoiding Rio so intensely that she’d rather do the TA’s job for her to avoid contacting her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She’s skimming through half-baked paragraphs about the industrial revolution when an incoming FaceTime from Lilia pops up. She immediately declines the call and feels a little thrill from inconveniencing her boss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia switches to text, and Agatha’s Mac dings with a new notification. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Pick up!!! Urgent!!!</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia calls again, and AGatha answers, scowling. Lilia is in her sunroom, sipping a cup of tea, wrapped in something too big to be a scarf and too small to be a blanket. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you wearing?” Agatha asks, trying to make out what the item of clothing is. “If this is what you’re calling about, the answer is no, you can’t wear that. people will think you’re going batty.” Agatha glares at her for a moment, “Also, this doesn’t seem urgent.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You look like hell warmed over.” Lilia frowns. “Excuse my theatrics. I resorted to drastic measures as this was the tenth time I’ve tried to call you over the past few weeks with no response.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve been showing up for work.” Agatha scowls. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m worried about you.” Lilia frowns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I’m a big girl. I can take care of myself.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t have to.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If that's all, Lilia, then I’m going to get back to grading student essays. I’m expanding young minds, and you know how seriously I take that.” Agatha is bullshitting, but she thinks the old coot might actually be buying it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s something else I want to discuss.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groans before she can stop herself and tries to play it off as a cough. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio’s grades are slipping in my class. She hasn’t been submitting her work.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s heart skips a beat. Logically, she knows that Rio’s probably not feeling great, but she wasn’t expecting this to affect her school work. A headache starts to throb behind her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I met with her, and she discussed that it's because she’s having some financial difficulties and needed to get a second job. A roommate situation fell through, and she’s now paying twice as much rent as she used to. Her stipend can’t cover it, so she’s putting in twenty hours a week at Trader Joe’s on top of all her classes, and tutoring.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is relieved that Rio’s trouble in school isn’t directly related to her, but that relief is quickly taken over by concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I want to submit her for an emergency relief grant with financial aid, and was wondering if you’d be willing to sign off on my application for her? I need another faculty member's approval. You know how bureaucratic this all can get.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course.” Agatha breathes out. Send it over now, and I’ll sign digitally. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Great.” Lilia smiles. “Take care, Agatha. I’m here when you’re ready to stop isolating.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha grumbles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia sends the document, and Agatha signs and sends it back. But worry is still swirling in her gut. Poor Rio. She wishes she could help out somehow. Then, she realizes she can.</span></p><p> </p><p><span> Agatha feels a little like a stalker, but she uses the school database and gets Rio’s address. She puts on a pair of jeans, an oversized sweater, and some big sunglasses, and drives to the bank. The maximum amount her bank will let her take out in cash is $5,000, but that should at least help for the next couple of months. Agatha puts the cash in a sealed envelope, writes Rio’s name on it, and drives to Rio’s address. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Panic-donating to a student with whom you are on bad terms is not the behavior of an emotionally regulated person, but Agatha has to do something to help. Rio’s place is a dilapidated-looking multifamily in the shitty part of town. Luckily, Rio’s car isn’t in the driveway. Agatha sighs in relief. The alpha won’t see she’s here and know that’s where the money came from.  Agatha walks up to the mailbox and sees R. Vidal printed on one of the slots. She slips the money in, quickly walks back to the car, and speeds home. She smiles for the first time in so long that her cheeks ache from the unfamiliar stretch. </span></p>
