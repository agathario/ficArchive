<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When Agatha gets a private message from someone in a Dungeons and Dragons server claiming to be a lesbian, she plays into the game, stringing along what she assumes to be some awkward incel and getting them way too seriously into the Discord daddy/kitten dynamic.</p><p>Agatha is very, very incorrect about who is on the other end of her screen. The problem she inevitably faces is how deep the teeth marks are going to be when this bites her in the ass.<br/>_____<br/>OR, yes, the agathario discord kitten au.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>April 29th, 2025</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<b>BeckTheRanger would like to be your friend.</b>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger:</b> Can I ask you a question about your character?</p>
<p>As in, what playing a lawful evil character entails.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at the direct message. It was sent about ten minutes ago. The thing is, Agatha— knowledge known under many a lock and key, three plus joints, or intense waterboarding, player’s choice— is a fan of tabletop games. She played Magic in undergrad. She started a Catan bracket in her current place at Emerson’s department of History until Dr. Calderu put a stop to it because Agatha had made enough money winning that she’d had to file a 1099 tax form. Rude, if you ask her. Grad school made you broke, and donating plasma was much more exhaustive.</p><p> </p><p>But the <em> thing </em> about being a dork who likes tabletop games means that Agatha has to deal with men. And there’s truly nothing in the world Agatha hates more. Her thesis being on the female pirate Mary Read means she luckily doesn’t have to come across them in her academic life very often, but it’s like fate stacked the cards against her and made her experience dealing with dudebros in her hobbies.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had started off doing things in person, like going to the local card store and participating in game nights. She knew she would experience misogyny, and trust, she got off on humbling people. But the smell— and after too many times of going to sit down and seeing literal shit stains on the chairs, Agatha wiped her hands (many, many times) of that particular nonsense and switched to playing things online.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, and she still made it obvious she was a woman, because she enjoyed knocking men down a peg while threatening to fuck their imaginary hentai wives better than they would ever be able to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha imagines this is what’s happening again with Beck The Ranger. So she decides to respond.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes:</b> yeah whats up</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>In that one-shot campaign we did, you had your barbarian choose to save the tiefling, but I find it hard to believe a lawful evil character would choose that over delivering the final blow.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>are you seriously questioning my character choices?</p>
<p>the tiefling was a child and in my character log one of my character’s moral boundaries is protecting children. we only did that one themed campaign so it didn’t come up</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger:</b> Oh, that makes sense. Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.</p>
<p>Also, your username. You’re a lesbian? Cool, I am too. Not a lot of us around here. </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha snorts and rolls her eyes. As if. There were some women in this server, sure, but few and far between. And none of them ever started off asking her about her character choices. Talk about mansplaining. Loser. But she plays along.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes:</b> yeah, thought the name would be funny. not a lot of us huh</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>My friend suggested this server to me because I can’t seem to find many people in real life to play with. Or our schedules conflict. But I forgot men are into this game, too.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes:</b> that’s why i don’t like doing more than oneshots. people start annoying me at some point</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Did you find me in the one-shot campaign annoying?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes:</b> hmmm not really, haven’t had to prove yourself yet</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Haha, well, I appreciate you letting me know the motivations behind your character decisions. Hopefully we’ll get to campaign together again!</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs and closes her computer. Fucking weirdo.</p><p> </p><p>/ᐠ &gt; ˕ &lt;マ</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>May 4, 2025</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I’m doing a three-session campaign where a dude keeps making his character fuck everything up because his character is chaotic evil and he argues it’s what his character would do. But I think he’s refusing to suspend his disbelief and ruining the game for everyone. We just finished the first one and I don’t think anyone wants the next two to go like this. What would you do?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>why are you asking me?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I feel like you’d know something that would be smart, funny, and also show this guy he’s being a fucking turd. Also, you’ve been able to play evil characters without being one.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>give me the deets</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>He snuck out of the camp at night and took out the mini boss without us because he’s a rogue and it’s “what his character would have done” because he wanted to make out with the loot.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>what do you play</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Oh, I still play a ranger. Neutral good. Druid.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>next time you come across an animal, use animal friendship and convince it to attack the dude.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Is that not a little too blatant?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>who cares? the rest of the party will probably appreciate it anyway. and the DM too</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>You make a good point. Do you think it’d fall in line with my character being good?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs. This is getting boring. </p><p> </p><p>Like how some people would describe an earworm, Agatha has a trouble worm. She likes chaos. This is why the internet is woman’s greatest invention; it allows her to troll people without facing too many consequences, and barely any offline. She had been using Reddit up until a few months ago to do her work, but she keeps getting banned from the subreddits worth stirring any sort of pot in and it does get exhausting having to make new accounts and gain the karma allowed to enter them. Catfishing incels is fun, but so much work only to bait one or two before her account is inevitably found out means a lot of effort and little reward.</p><p> </p><p>Also, one of the halves of the couple she rooms with, Alice, had said that she didn’t want Agatha to get doxxed and inevitably doxx them. So she had to tone it down. (Jen had told her to just do it at the Starbucks a few blocks down, but they live in fucking <em> Boston </em>, so why the fuck would she go to a Starbucks? Idiot Jen; she’s from Georgia and doesn’t get it.)</p><p> </p><p>So, Agatha thinks about it: why not move to Discord? It’s in the name, after all.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i mean, you’re the one who knows your character the best. you’re probably fine if your character thinks it’s good for the party</p>
<p>anyway, whatcha doin?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I’m messaging you, but I guess I’m also doing some paperwork for the job.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>ewww work stuff? it’s like 7pm, you deserve to do something way more relaxing</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I work on my own schedule. This was just the best time to do it, unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>did you also work all day today?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>For the most part.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>ugh if i were you i’d be naked in a tub with some lavender bath salts right now</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>That does sound nice. Hmm, maybe I’ll do that later.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>tell me how it goes? ;)</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>If you really want me to, sure. Anyway, May the 4th be with you!</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>and also with you</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Okay, lapsed Catholic. Good night.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>/ᐠ &gt; ˕ &lt;マ</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>May 10th, 2025</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>What’s your name? So I know who I’m speaking with.</p>
<p>Which, if that’s too personal, you don’t have to share. Didn’t realize until I hit send. I can go first. I’m Rio.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha has learned telling the truth as much as possible is the best bet here. She’d rarely give out her actual name, but she’s fairly certain she put her real name on the introduction post in the server they both share, so she has to be careful. Name, age, favorite color are things that are super common anyway. With the more racey details, she can feign prioritizing internet safety.</p><p> </p><p>She’s going to have to be careful with this one in general, though. Agatha does actually like the server she wormed her way in; it’s got a lot of free resources for Dungeons and Dragons and she definitely doesn’t want to have to find them again if she gets banned for being too much of an obvious hooligan.</p><p> </p><p>The truth for this question it is, then.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>it’s agatha. kind of an old lady name but whatever</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Oh, that’s cool, your name means ‘good’ in Greek. From <em>agathos</em>. Mine means river.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>do you like name meanings?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>If I have to name things, or know people, I like things to have meaning, sure. Beck is also a name that means river. It’s why I chose it. I do that for all of my characters. You’d be surprised how many names mean river.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>well sometimes things are just a coincidence. my name definitely doesn’t reflect anything about me</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Did someone tell you that? Do you think you’re bad?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>wouldn’t you like to know ;)</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I would, yeah.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i’ve been known to be naughty, yes</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Damn, something came up at work. I’ll talk later.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>what do you do at work, anyway? since it kept you from our very important conversation.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Sorry for being MIA for a few hours, that was so much more annoying than I thought it would be. </p>
<p>I work at a nursery.</p>
<p>For plants. Not children.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>sooo what was the emergency, then? one of them started growing legs and running away?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Ha ha, very funny. No, a customer had a question. And she wouldn’t stop talking; just when she started to get off topic and I’d think she was done, she’d have another question. After the plants, it was the conditions they needed to be kept in. And then pot sizes. We have informational cards about this kind of stuff, but it’s like she was illiterate. Ugh. And then I helped her load the stuff she got into her car. Which I don’t mind doing, but she’d been so grating.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>couldn’t make one of the underlings do it for you? unless you’re the underling, which would be kind of sad. i’m actually only attracted to alpha personalities</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>No underlings. It’s just me in here today, though sometimes I schedule one of my part-timers to help out. But Wednesdays are usually very empty unless it’s a holiday. I try to save them for the weekends, especially since they tend to be in school.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>wait, one of YOUR part-timers?</p>
<p>rio, are you a business owner</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>If you’re asking if the nursery is mine, the answer is yes.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>that is literally so different than ‘i work at a nursery’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>But I do work here.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes:</b> my job right now is school</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Wait, how old are you?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i’m 26</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Shit, you’re a baby.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>rude, no i’m not</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Well, compared to me, I guess. I’m 40.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. She’s sure that’s the first truth this dude has told the entire time.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Anyway, I asked because you said you were in school so you could’ve been younger.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i’m in grad school</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>And our age difference doesn’t matter to you?</p>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>nah, it doesn’t matter to me ;)</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>You know, I’ve never understood why people don’t put noses in their emoticons. You’re depriving them of their sense of smell.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>?</p>
<p>what</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Well like this. :-) Now he has a nose.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>whatever you say ;)</p>
<p>oh sorry. ;-) how does that look</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Much better. Also, now that we know each other’s names and age, we should also get other info. Favorite color, regular coffee shop order, favorite book…</p>
<p>I can go first! My favorite color is hunter green. I like matcha, which I guess is also green, haha. My favorite book is Macbeth. Well, it’s a play, but I’d say it’s in the canonical sphere.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>wow, first date questions, gotcha</p>
<p>i like purple. i don’t like coffee very much so i tend to get a london fog. and my favorite book is frankenstein.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I had to read Frankenstein and I could never get past the point of reanimating the corpse. First off, that implies souls are chemical. But also, I just don’t think we should mess with death or trying to create life.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>well victor dies at the end so he has his little moral punishment, don’t you worry, miss reap what you sow</p>
<p>also if you like sci-fi mary shelley essentially invented the genre</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>That’s true. I do respect her for that.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>do you think that rumor about her losing her virginity on her mother’s grave is true</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>OMG what?! I've never heard of that. That’s crazy if she really did that.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>how did you lose your virginity</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Um, I don’t know why that’s relevant, but in college, which I imagine is fairly common.</p>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>aww that’s cute. i lost mine in high school. so i guess i win because i lost mine before you did</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Well, if we’re getting into semantics, when I was in college, you were a child. So I lost mine first.</p>
<p>By the way, I do like science fiction. My favorite author is probably Le Guin. Star Trek is my favorite show of all time.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>of course it is. bet you’re a real bro about it</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I don’t know what that means, but something I like about the series is that I still get new material. I like the new show a lot.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i like to watch survivor and think about how i’d win against everyone on the show</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>You seem like the type.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>have you ever watched naked and afraid, rio? what do you think we’d do if we were on that show together?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Be naked and also afraid, I imagine.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Man, this guy was clueless. Agatha shuts off her laptop and goes to bed.</p><p> </p><p>/ᐠ &gt; ˕ &lt;マ</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is doing reading for her class tomorrow and eating a very healthy dinner of honey mustard pretzels and her signature strawberry apricot Redbull when she hears her notifications go off on her desktop. She’s already sitting at her desk… Might as well look.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>May 18th, 2025</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I wanted to let you know the campaign went off without a hitch. Everyone was laughing when I got a raccoon to attack the asshole rogue. And then I decided to go all in for it since we only have one session left and I asked the DM if I could roll for the raccoon having rabies. I rolled a nat 20 and the guy’s character died. He was super mad.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>good. the more dead men the better</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>LOL</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i’m not kidding</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, good thing that doesn’t apply to me.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>of course it doesn’t, handsome</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>How do you know I’m handsome? You don’t know what I look like.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>well it’s just for fun. you haven’t been picking up any of my hints</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Your hints?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i’ve been flirting with you</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Really? Just because I’m a lesbian?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>why not? it’s fun and doesn’t have to mean anything. have you ever sexted before</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I haven’t ever really seen the point in it.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>see that’s how i know you haven’t because anyone who has would never say that</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>You think you can convince me there’s something worthwhile about sexting?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>i know i can baby</p>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>But I don’t even know what you look like.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>that’s the fun of it. i have really nice tits. is that enough for you?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Maybe</p>
<p>Mine are kinda small</p>
<p>Not that I mean that in a self-deprecating way. I’m a bit butch so I actually like that I can hide them easily. I’m sure you like the size of yours, by the way you sound.</p>
<p>Sorry, that’s not sexy at all. We’re sexting, right?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>we’re trying to. what are you wearing?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>Just a shirt and some boxer briefs.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>dungeonsanddykes: </b>that is a bit butch of you</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>BeckTheRanger: </b>I don’t really know how to do this.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>

<p>
<strong>May 29th, 2025</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>I know we don’t usually send pictures, but I had to send you this photo of this cat in the window of a cafe I walk by on the way back from the gym. Isn’t she so cute???</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Rio has sent an attachment.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>The service on the train is horrible as per usual, so Agatha doesn’t get to see the photo until she’s walking to her apartment. She takes a look at the photo: there’s a calico cat splayed across a mounted cat shelf that looks like a large cactus, tiny legs and toe beans and extended claws in stretch mode. The picture is timed incredibly well. </p><p> </p><p>But that’s not what makes her almost drop her phone onto the grimy Boston sidewalk. Because after about five seconds of looking, Agatha doesn’t give a flying fuck about the cute cat.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t get to see a full face because it’s clipped out of the photo, but she <em> does </em> get to see a body. One that’s in a muscle tank, bike shorts, and definitely a bonafide <em> dyke</em>. With biceps that are defined without any flexing to get them there. With nice hands and long fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Ah, fuck. Agatha’s brain scrambles like a diner egg as she tries to think of a response.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>umm, nice shirt?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>Oh, shit, I didn’t even realize. Don’t feel like you have to send something back, or whatever. It was a total accident. I seriously only meant to send the cat.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>no, i definitely will. let me get home first.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha’s walk home is full of many, many thoughts. So many that one could fit them in a jar and build a raffle around guessing how many were in said jar. There’s no way Rio is some fucking incel who perused the internet for a candid photo to pass off as her own, because first off, incels are not that smart. They’d send some generative AI shitfest with seven fingers and too-polished tits. </p><p> </p><p>And that’s the thing. Men, especially porn-rotted sexless men, don’t even have a rudimentary understanding of lesbianism. Their understanding is more akin to a snake eating its own tail. Rio was hot be lesbian standards, and that’s really hard to fake if your lesbianism is built on Reddit.</p><p> </p><p>Also, Rio once asked her what “sailing the seas” meant when Agatha was explaining that she doesn’t pay for any streaming services. No way is Rio that tech savvy. Fuckity fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets home and stares at the full length mirror she hung up in her bedroom. Yes, she waited a few weeks after moving into this apartment to decide where to put it so she could capture the best lighting. Jen had called her egotistical; Agatha considered it practical. Now she was patting past her on the back and maybe groping a tit with the way Agatha needs to look her best right now.</p><p> </p><p>Why, one might ask? None of their fucking business. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a look at herself. She’s in a ribbed tank and flannel with jean shorts. Her headphones hang around her neck. Even after she fluffs her hair, it still looks like a sweaty bird’s nest, but her brain only thinks about the possibility of washing it before Agatha realizes that is way, way too much obvious effort.</p><p> </p><p>She snaps a pic, making sure to position her phone a certain way in front of her face that it’s entirely hidden. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>don’t judge, just got home</p>

</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>i’ve talked about sucking your dick. you can tell me i look nice</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Which, to be fair, Agatha had been doing that thinking Rio was a creepy fucking man and was trying to be phallocentric with her imagery to get on Rio’s nerves. Now it’s become a double-edged sword that she has been, no pun intended, impaled by. Because she wants to know what color Rio’s cock is. Knowing Rio’s idiosyncrasies are all true, probably a dark green. Her stomach hurts.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>I don’t even think nice fully encapsulates it, if I’m being honest.</p>

<p><b>Rio: </b>Wow. Jesus. You’re okay though, right?</p>

<p>also, i’m a self-identified brat, i’m not going to do it just because you tell me to</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha barely knows what’s gotten into her. This was more fun when there was no stakes in any of this. But now… now there is a hot lesbian on the other side of her phone. Well, there apparently always was, but now Agatha is just now realizing this. She was aiming cannon balls onto Rio’s ship not realizing she was on the same damn boat, and now they’re both sinking. But Agatha has never been a quitter: go big or go home.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>a bulge pic might convince me though</p>

It’s only been ten minutes, and she doesn’t know exactly which strategy Rio uses, but whatever plastic cock is under there happens to be tucked expertly. It looks like a natural bulge. </p><p> </p><p>The angle of the photo is admittedly horrible. Rio should never be a photographer. But Agatha does get to see a little tummy— some sort of women's boxer briefs peeking out of Rio’s sweatpants. The elastic that Agatha sees is a light purple. She feels ill. Her mouth is watering. Is that a coincidence? Did Rio choose that color on purpose? </p><p> </p><p>Also, Agatha can see Rio’s evident happy trail, which should be renamed horny trail with the kinds of thoughts running through Agatha’s mind. The last thing she needs to be thinking of is how Rio’s fingers would feel pressed around her throat. </p><p> </p><blockquote>

Did you kill him? Is he going to send us a bomb?”</p><p> </p><p>“Worse,” Agatha rasps. “She wasn’t lying about being a 40-year-old lesbian and she’s fucking hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen cackles as she stirs an obscene amount of sugar in her coffee.

</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<b>Rio has sent an attachment.</b>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p><b> </b>It’s a video. Agatha, who was spending her free day sitting on the couch and watching Hunger Games video essays, presses play, and of course Rio doesn’t know how to trim videos, so Agatha gets to see about ten seconds of her setting it up. Agatha tries to turn it up, but it just blares loud, public gym noises, so she turns it back down to a reasonable level. </p><p> </p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip to get it balanced just right, and Agatha notices an endearing gap-toothed smile. And then Rio walks over to her routine: a low riding weight station with a barbell. Rio sits in front of the seat she’s secured and rolls the barbell up to her waist before… yeah. She’s doing fucking hip thrusts. And Agatha doesn’t know anything about proper form or whatever the fuck, but she’s sure Rio’s posture is textbook accurate.</p><p> </p><p>Is Agatha sweating? She should kill herself just in case she does anything disgustingly humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>Rio works on her set for about a minute before grunting (not that Agatha gets the privilege of <em> hearing </em> it, she can just tell by the veins on Rio’s neck) and setting the barbell down, pushing it away from her legs and over her feet. She uses the bottom of her shirt to wipe at her forehead, which means Agatha gets too little and too much of a glimpse at her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>The last few seconds of the video are of Rio picking up the phone and sending a little thumbs up before it abruptly stops.</p><p> </p><p>This is the first time Agatha gets to see Rio’s face. Rio had sent a couple of photos of outfits before, sure, but she’d always purposefully kept them to the neck and below. Not that Agatha had been complaining.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s eyes are such a warm brown they’ve got Agatha’s organs competing for Olympic gymnastics. Agatha discreetly saves the video and goes to her camera roll to pause on Rio’s face— her lips, and how Agatha deserves to map their shape and texture with her own. Her stupid fucking smile. Fast forward a bit… Biceps. Triceps. Hamstrings. Actually, Agatha is just naming muscles at this point, but Rio certainly has them. She’s wearing biker shorts, which means that there’s a short second where she’s bending to grab her water and Agatha gets to see her ass.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>do you think the lady behind you on the treadmill has endurance tips? i’ve been thinking about starting up running</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio: </strong>Nothing on what I just showed you?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>oh, that? yeah, i’d ride you like a mechanical bull. but that woman ran fast as fuck your entire video, so i just want to know what she’d think</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>Agatha, I just watched back, and there’s no one on the treadmill in the video.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>damn that;s crazy</p>
<p>also if you ever got braces to get rid of that tooth gap i’d get into the mafia to take your oral surgeon out. there are bluer skies and greener pastures of people who know oral better. ask me how i know</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>I can’t tell if you’re making another dick sucking joke or not.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>first off, they’re never a “joke”</p>
<p>secondly, i’d suck off your stupid little clitoris too, i’m not picky</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>Does this mean I’d get to see you on your knees?</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>That is when Agatha gets a very, very devilish though. She gets up to drinks some water and impulsively grabs her jade roller for her cheekbones and jaw for about ten minutes in hopes that her face doesn’t look any sort of red. Then she stumbles into her room and sets her phone on the shelf of her bookcase that’s eye level. She tests the angle. Yeah, it’ll work.</p><p> </p><p>Unlike Rio, Agatha knows how to use the inner workings of a phone camera, so she sets a few timers and poses sitting on her knees on her bedroom carpet, glancing up at the camera and smirking. Her hands are clasped behind her back. Her chest may or may not be puffing out a bit, and her shoulders are straightened. It takes a few tries, but when she’s satisfied with both the face and body staring back at her, she hits send before she can change her mind.</p><p> </p><blockquote>

<p><b>Rio: </b>I don’t know what “millennial gray” is, so my guess is no. I’m not a criminal; I don’t even have a speeding ticket in my name. And taxidermy sounds like a horrible way to honor an animal’s death. I’d use them as fertilizer like Mother Nature intended.</p>
<p>I’m autistic, if that counts.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>not having a speeding ticket does subtract hot points i’m afraid</p>

</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>Weren’t you just telling me you wanted to climb me like a tree?</p>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>teasing is the best kind of flirting</p>

<p><b>Rio: </b>You seem like the type to really like plastic in her mouth, so I’d help you with that. I don’t really get off on strap ons, so I’d press your mouth down to fit it all just because I can. And knowing you, you’re enough of a slut that you’ve trained yourself out of having most of a gag reflex, so I don’t think you’d really choke, but you’d make choking noises in hopes I’d reward you with a good dicking down after.

<p>Go back to class. Take notes and pay attention. I will be waiting for that panty shot, though.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbles and exits out of Discord; she’s lucky she answered two discussion questions at the beginning of class, because the unspoken rule of seminars means she doesn’t really have to answer anything for the rest of class. She hasn’t been paying enough attention and if someone tried to answer anything, she’d definitely be put on the spot.</p><p> </p><p>She can’t get home fast enough. She marches into her bedroom and she’d slam the door if it didn’t alert Alice or Jen of something amiss going on. And nothing amiss is going on, not really, except the audacity of Rio thinking she’d won.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only bothers taking her pants off before climbing into her bed in just a tee shirt and her underwear. A wicked and amazing idea accumulates in her mind, and she slips her hand into her panties, still finding herself uncomfortably sticky in there. Her arousal has spread and smeared across her bush; as much as she’d love to freak Rio the fuck out and have <em> that </em> be the picture she sends, that’d be giving away her cards too early.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she rubs her clitoris, already slippery with want, and imagines Rio’s strong hand pushing down on the small of her back as she slips herself in. <em> Good girl </em> , she imagines Rio saying. <em> You take Daddy so well. </em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s cheeks warm up in shame <em> and </em> want at that. Because one time she’d kicked some wannabe hey mamas out of her dorm a few years back for insisting on being called Zaddy in bed. It’s fucking humiliating, the way Rio referring to herself Daddy has Agatha’s legs involuntarily twitching in bed. Why the hell did she start that off as a joke, again? Oh, yeah, because she’s fucking stupid.</p><p> </p><p>Reaping what she sowed, or whatever the fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pictures Rio holding her by the hips and thrusting hard, even as Agatha cries out. Hell, she imagines Rio thrusting even harder <em> because </em> Agatha cries out. She knows Rio has the strength to, the muscle build. The pace of her fingers gets faster, and she makes sure not to dip down into herself, letting her desire build and stick to her underwear. That with the combination of having to wait so long for a release has Agatha coming in no time.</p><p> </p><p>And that’s okay, because Agatha is incredibly sexy.</p><p> </p><p>She feels a bit overstimulated, but she forces herself to flick her clit harder until she’s trembling and peaking again, her mind filled with the thoughts of Rio seeing the picture she’s going to send and whimpering pathetically as her hands shoot into whatever dorky boxers she must be wearing at the moment. Rio would come in ninety seconds flat.</p><p> </p><p>And that’s embarrassing, because Agatha loves getting off to the idea of sexually humiliating Rio.</p><p> </p><p>When she’s sated, Agatha wriggles out of her underwear and sees the gusset shiny and soaked. There’s even two broken lines of slick that drip off of the hipster panties and onto the sheets where Agatha has positioned them to lie flat. Perfect. She reaches over to her nightstand to grab her phone, gets up on her knees, and snaps a photo.</p><p> </p><blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>agatha 😈💜: </b>would you want to try a voice call?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><b>Rio: </b>Like a phone call? If you want. God, yeah.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Agatha slips in her AirPods and then double checks that it’s not a video call before pressing the phone icon. She only has to hear about one and a half dial tones before Rio picks up.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” a breathless voice greets. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks to herself. “Hey, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck. Um, your voice is lower than I expected.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth pinches into a thin line. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean—” Agatha can practically hear the mental smacking and subsequent rewording. “It’s sultry. I like it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm.” Agatha lays her head against the pillow, setting the phone tenderly down beside it. “You’re not so bad, yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>A raspy chuckle carries through Agatha’s phone, and lord, she wants to dive right into it. “What are you— uh, what are you doing right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Thinking about getting my vibrator,” Agatha answers honestly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s next words tumble out shamelessly instantaneously. “You should.” She’s almost growling. “Go get it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaves her phone on the bed and rifles through the reclaimed makeup bag she puts her sex toys in (and keeps handily right under her bed) to snatch the large wand vibrator she has tucked in there.</p><p> </p><p>She’s bouncing back onto the bed soon enough, spreading her legs instinctively. She says, “Okay, I’m back. Where are you, handsome?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in my bed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha can hear the smirk in her own voice. “What’re you thinking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice is still gruff. “You still in that baby tee and panties?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods before realizing Rio can’t see her. “Mhmm.” </p><p> </p><p>“Keep them on,” Rio orders. “Turn the vibrator on and rub it on yourself through your underwear.”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha had brought up the idea of a voice call, she hadn’t expected to be the one taking orders, but the idea of dragging along the foreplay to finish off with a nice orgasm or two certainly doesn’t have her complaining. “Of course, <em> daddy</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Her tone is laced with a good amount of teasing, but it has Rio sputtering out a choked breath, anyway. Agatha clicks on the second lowest setting on her vibrator and presses the thick tip to her covered mons, just above her clit, and she hums contentedly. She lets out a theatrical sigh, wanting to make sure Rio can hear it on the other end. “This feels nice. Wanna know what color underwear I’m wearing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Rio sounds greedy.</p><p> </p><p>“Pink, with little hearts on them.” So she’s a bit of a cliche. Fucking sue her. “Oh, and they’re low riders, so my hair peeks out a little.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans at that. Agatha feels it in her chest, the way the sound travels through the earphones. “Fuck, I wish I could stuff my face in it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you do.” Agatha’s voice sounds rough, and she slowly inches her wrist in the correct direction so that the wand travels to her clitoris. Even with a layer between everything, Agatha’s hips jump at the contact and she mewls.</p><p> </p><p>“You sound so pretty, sweetheart.” Rio is saying this through grunts.</p><p> </p><p>“What’re you doing now?” Agatha asks. </p><p> </p><p>“Rubbing myself off,” Rio moans, and Agatha can hear shuffling in the background.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slip closed at that. She’s seen enough photos of Rio that she can picture it in her mind’s eye: Rio would probably be too impatient to even take her clothes off, shoving her hand into her briefs and flat-fingering her clit.</p><p> </p><p>She chews on her bottom lip, worrying it between her teeth. “Can you do something for me?” She tacks on a, “Daddy?” at the end, relishing in the broken gasp that shudders out of Rio’s mouth and into her ears. It gives her goosebumps.</p><p> </p><p>“What would you like?” is Rio’s shaky response.</p><p> </p><p>“Could you take your finger and thumb…” Agatha presses her finger into the side of her wand and turns on the next setting of vibrations, keening. “Take that for me and jerk off your clit like a cock for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, god.” Agatha can imagine the way Rio tentatively must be getting her fingers in just the right position to follow Agatha’s directions, her chest heaving, her hips jerking as that first touch sends shockwaves through her nervous system. “Jesus fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice then turns into a whine. “I want to take my underwear off.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do it,” Rio chokes out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes the vibrator off of her clit and rips her underwear off her legs and kicks it to wherever in record timing. When she sets the vibrator, still buzzing, onto the bare meat of her cunt, she yelps. Her initial shocked reaction turns into a series of moans and whines as she starts to gyrate her hips to spread the vibrations around her clitoris and entrance, as well as her arousal on the wand tip itself.</p><p> </p><p>“Does that feel good, princess?”</p><p> </p><p>And usually, eugh, but Rio is so genuine and turned on in her tone Agatha starts to feel a second heartbeat throbbing below her waistline. Her wrist moves in tight circles, instinctively going faster with each turn. “Feels so good,” she pants out, and it’s barely a whisper, but she knows the microphone of her earphones picks it up by the way Rio whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna put some fingers in?”</p><p> </p><p>“I would just wish they were yours,” Agatha answers truthfully. Her core clenches at the thought of Rio’s long, lithe fingers rubbing the spongy parts inside of her until her thighs trembled uncontrollably. “What about you?”</p><p> </p><p>A moment of silence, and then a soft, “I don’t really like penetration.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha slips out instantly, not wanting any sort of guilt to eat at Rio. “More for me, then.” She gasps as the wand touches her clit in a particularly earth-shattering way, and a thought spills out of her like bleeding pen ink. “You’ve got to have a cock stashed somewhere, yeah? How do you think it’d look inside me?”</p><p> </p><p>A cry that calls its home somewhere between frustrated and very, very turned on. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want you here,” Agatha complains haughtily.  “I want you inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whimpers, “I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha’s thighs spread a little wider as she starts climbing higher towards her peak. “You gonna bust to me moaning in your ear, <em> daddy</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>An unrestrained moan. “I want to come to hearing you first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel something bubbling her in her gut. “I’m getting there.”</p><p> </p><p>“You got it.” Rio’s sigh is deep and delivered shakily. “Let me hear you, sweetheart. I want you to come for daddy.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s embarrassing how the volcano in Agatha’s core erupts at that, how her vocal chords strain with the pitch of her sob as she comes undone. Her hips jolt hard enough that the toy scrapes against her engorged and throbbing clit in a way that makes Agatha restrain from an actual screech as she feels herself soak the sheets below her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck, I—” Agatha’s words are almost incoherent babblings stuffed between heaving gasps. “I didn’t— I— my fucking <em> god </em>—”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio’s voice is filled with an odd combo of lust and worry as she hears Agatha orgasm over the phone.</p><p> </p><p>“I squirted,” Agatha cries. “I wet my bed, I didn’t think I’d—” She’s white-knuckling the wand vibrator when she feels another tsunami threaten to crash over her sweating body. “I’m… gonna… again—”</p><p> </p><p>And she barely gets the last word out before her next orgasm hits her just as hard as the first one, just as fast, just as devastating. Her back arches almost painfully off the bed as she hears more than she senses liquid gush out of her. It sounds like she pissed herself. Agatha squeezes her eyes shut so hard she thinks her eyes are going to pop backwards and bounce off of her brain as she throws the still-on vibrator off of any part of her. She’s still riding her orgasm and she’s sensitive. She turns to her side, cupping her cunt, her thighs clenched and suffocating her wrist as she trembles through the last parts of it.</p><p> </p><p>And although it sounds muffled as if she’s underwater, she hears Rio exclaim a, “Oh, fuck, did I <em> hear </em> that?” as her moans of ecstasy intermingle with Agatha’s. Agatha learns that where she goes high on her peak, Rio’s orgasmic cries go low, and she grunts her way through it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes manage to peel themselves open as she stares, shocked and slightly disoriented, at her bedroom wall. </p><p> </p><p>She’s thinking about how she’s really only ever squirted with penetration before now when Rio is the one to break the silence. “You sounded so beautiful, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s still getting her breath under control, and she’s sure Rio can hear her panting. But she also has a feeling the perverted little creature nestled in Rio’s chest is enjoying it. “You’re so sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you’ve got one more left in you,” Rio whispers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha practically feels her heart stop. Her clit is still throbbing. “I…”</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, you deserve the pleasure, don’t you, kitten?” Rio’s voice is smooth like honey, but her words stick to Agatha like the sting of a bee. “You don’t have to use the vibrator if that’s too overpowering. Just your fingers.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand is already traveling down to her body, though she stays curled up. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rub your fingers right above your clitoris for me,” Rio instructs softly. “Tell me how it feels.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers barely graze her clitoral hood before creating lazy circles. “Already feels so strong,” she chokes out. </p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises, and, remembering her thoughts from a few weeks ago, Agatha shudders; a whimper even slips out of her, her inhibitions having essentially disappeared. She feels the taste of humble pie being pushed past her lips and into her mouth. She feels horrified. She feels incredibly turned on. “Take your fingers and drag them through your pussy. How wet are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her cunt up, her two middle fingers spreading her lips apart with their width as she strokes herself up and down. Her thighs are still clamped together, limiting the movement of her wrist, but what little her wrist is able to rotate is strong enough. “Your voice made me come so much, I’m still fucking soaked. I’m literally trembling.” </p><p> </p><p>“My poor baby,” Rio croons, and Agatha swears it hits directly from her eardrums into her bloodstream to help quicken the intense pumping of her heart. “Do you think you could fit two fingers in?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans. “Rio…”</p><p> </p><p>“You sound so sexy saying my name,” Rio murmurs. “Come on, I believe in you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha angles her wrist downward to press her fingers right at her entrances. There’s no resistance, and as Agatha pushes them in further, she coughs out a wet sob. She gets her fingers down to the third knuckle and rolls over on her stomach, cheek pressed into her mattress, so she can get even a millimeter deeper. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t move your fingers yet,” Rio orders, and thank god, because Agatha needs a second to get used to the fullness. “Tell me what being inside feels like. Tell me as much as you can.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s so hot,” Agatha weeps. “Like an inferno. I’m— I’m so sensitive. I feel like I’m gonna burst. I’m clamping down on my fingers so hard, and I’m not even doing it on purpose.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.” Rio’s voice lowers an octave. “Your pussy sounds greedy. Do you wish those fingers were mine?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, yes,” Agatha says. “S’not fair. Your hands are bigger than mine. They’d reach deeper.”</p><p> </p><p>“All in due time, sweetheart,” Rio comforts. “Can you pump your fingers in and out for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha starts curling her fingers. Most of her arm is pinned under her stomach, but her wrist is just free enough to move her fingers in and out. Her hips involuntarily buck as she starts to gently ride her fingers, and they scrape the exact spongy part of her insides that she needs.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” she seethes, and she grinds her teeth to hold back a moan. She can feel her neck tensing up with the effort. Her nipples are hard and her movement has them slightly brushing against the mattress, and even with her shirt on, it’s sending spikes of electricity down to the basis of her body and bones.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me hear you,” Rio murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha protests. “I… I have roommates. Trust me, they’d hear.” And then, just to be a little shit, she tacks on, “I wish it was your fingers I was riding instead of mine. Or, fuck…” She feels herself clench on her fingers. “Your cock.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pants in a smirk as she hears Rio’s tinny whine resound in her ears. “You can’t just say that. I’m gonna get worked up again.”</p><p> </p><p>The thought of Rio squirming just from her words has Agatha gasping out, “I’m close.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t come yet,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snaps. “Don’t tell me what to do.” It’s like a mental dam breaks. “You don’t get to be in charge. You should be begging to hear me come for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warns.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not bluffing,” Agatha clarifies. She feels her stomach tense up and she knows her orgasm is close. She’s on the precipice. “I’ll hang up right fucking now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t do that,” Rio pleads. “I want to hear you. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t take that much convincing, huh?” Agatha gyrates her hips, forces her fingers to get even deeper until they’re bumping up against her cervix. She mewls. “So good for me, daddy. Beg some more.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna hear you come,” Rio rasps out. “Please, baby, if I can’t feel it myself, let me hear you come undone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shudders into her orgasm. It’s not as powerful as the first two were, but it spends the rest of her energy. It’s the kind that makes her whimper; she can feel her fingers getting choked by her vaginal walls as she rides herself into pure exhaustion. When she’s done, she slips her fingers out but doesn’t move to resituate her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so tired,” she mumbles. “Can’t even clean myself up.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is breathing heavily. “You’re so cute,” she says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, and it comes from low in her chest. “I bet you’d be good at cleaning me up with your tongue.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I can taste you,” Rio sighs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs breathily. “You don’t even know what I taste like.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m imagining normal pussy but, like, one hundred times better at least.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums. She’d make a joke about Rio talking about another woman’s pussy, but she feels her eyes slipping shut— and honestly, she can practically hear Rio drooling over the phone at the thought of getting to taste her, and that coaxes her beast of an ego into a purring ball of fur.</p><p> </p><p>“Go to bed, darling.” Rio’s voice is soft. “I’ll still be here when you wake up.”</p><p> </p><p>/ᐠ &gt; ˕ &lt;マ</p><p> </p><p>The next day, Agatha’s brain is still haywire, like a computer that had been autopsied and picked for parts. Her inner ears had ached when she’d woken up bright and early, her AirPods still nestled in them. (They were dead and she’d had to hang up the Discord call that was still going on for the ninth hour; Agatha could hear Rio snoring softly on the other end and ignored the fluttering it caused in her chest.)</p><p> </p><p>She spent the day in her Women’s Role in Colonialism lecture dissociating and her notes were practically in chicken scratch; the only hypothetical more embarrassing is at least she hadn’t been doodling hearts and <em> Agatha… the Ranger? </em> in the columns of her notebook. Which, damn, she doesn’t even know Rio’s last name. And when she’d gone to her carrel in the library to study after, it’d been as if she’d skipped her Vyvanse prescription that day, and she certainly hadn’t. She marches off an hour early, her clit betraying her every thought by thumping to the beat of her racing heart like a kitten wailing for its wet food.</p><p> </p><p>Give me cock, her annoying, attention-starved pussy cries.</p><p> </p><p>We have cock at home, you stupid fucking idiot, Agatha unreasonably reasons.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of it all, on her commute home she misses that parts of the city are under construction and she has to get off a stop early until the tracks are stopping and her internal, public transportation body clock is telling her something is off.</p><p> </p><p>She glances up and reads the marquee. It tells her to ride the bus. Agatha groans; at this point, she might as well walk the extra twenty minutes home. It’ll be thirty on the bus, and it’ll be crowded, and she’ll have to deal with annoying ass people. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows where she is when she gets off, but she plugs in her address into her phone anyway, subtly following the directions the map is giving her.</p><p> </p><p>She’s about halfway home when her phone tells her to turn a corner and, instead, Agatha stops right in her tracks. Someone bumps into her and they say something like, “Watch where you’re going!” but Agatha isn’t paying attention.</p><p> </p><p>Because right in front of her is a cat cafe with a calico cat slow-blinking at her through the window.</p><p><br/>

To go on a <em> date </em> with Rio in. She settles on an olive green baby tee and dark wash jean shorts that, if they were any shorter, would not classify as shorts. Look, she’s trying to keep it at least a little appropriate. </p><p> </p><p>She puts on a minimal amount of makeup and lip gloss. The day before, she’d filed her nails to a short almond length and painted them a similar shade to her shirt. It’ll be warm, but she keeps her hair down because it’s one of her best features. If God hates dykes, why did he give her such thick, tuggable waves?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks in the mirror to see the entire look. She can see her belly button piercing, and the soft curve of her tummy in her mid rise shorts. Okay, so maybe not as appropriate as originally planned, but it’s not like Rio asked her out because of her habit of couth behavior. She then slips on her Mary Jane docs and is ready to go.</p><p> </p><p>She nervously taps her fingers against her lap as she rides the train to the park Rio had suggested they meet at. There’s an empanada stand Rio said was really good; that’s all Agatha gets to know about their shared afternoon (Rio had wanted to know if she’d liked empanadas, as if Agatha would hate anything to do with fried bread, cheese, and meat).</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha gets to the park, she follows the directions and landmarks Rio gave her and soon finds a figure that looks like Rio manspreading on a bench and wearing all black even though July is on the horizon.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, sounds like Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello?” Agatha tries to ignore the sweat gathering in her palms and instead focuses on the smaller details that come to her vision as she gets closer to Rio. Rio’s black shirt has a Paramore album cover on it, her jean shorts reach her knees but are thankfully not flared enough to be considered <em> jorts</em>, and she’s got on a pair of clean high-top Chucks. She’s got on silver jewelry and a grommet belt. A carabiner is rightfully clipped to her belt loop. Her hair is tied up in a ponytail in a way that Agatha can see the undercut under it. Even with the nape of Rio’s neck shaved like that, she still has quite a bit tied up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face appears flushed, and Agatha not-so-secretly hopes it’s not from the heat. “Hey, Agatha.” She shoots up from her spot on the bench and then it’s as if she’s forgotten what to do with her body. “Um, I don’t know if I should give you a handshake or what.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can hug,” Agatha says cheekily, and Rio grins enthusiastically as she comes up to enclose Agatha in her arms. Rio’s shoulders are broad, and Agatha smirks in the crook of Rio’s neck for a split second as one of Rio’s hands naturally lands on the small of her back. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio backs up, she asks, “You hungry?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you told me we were gonna eat.”</p><p> </p><p>“The empanadas here are amazing,” Rio starts, leading Agatha to the stand. “Not as good as my Ma’s pastelillos, but,” she gives an exaggerated shrug at this, “what can you do.” She pauses, and then looks at Agatha, a little worried furrow in her brow. “Not that these aren’t good. They’re really good. I’m not giving you shoddy food.”</p><p> </p><p>“I trust you,” Agatha says, her mind buzzing pleasantly at the way Rio’s nerves are showing. It’s obvious Rio is trying to impress her.</p><p> </p><p>“They have agua frescas, too.” Rio stands far enough from the booth to not be in the line— which is thankfully not very long— but close enough that Agatha can ponder at the menu. “Let me know when you know what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio starts to take her wallet out of her pocket to have it prepared, Agatha brightens. “Food is always better when it’s free,” she supplies.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fights an admittedly endearing smile. “I just know you’re on a budget for school…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha laces her voice with fake disappointment. “I thought you were paying for my food to be chivalrous.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her in shock. “I— well, that too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we’re on a date, correct?” When Rio nods dumbly, she says, “Let’s get in line.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gets one of the beef empanadas with a lemon fresca, and Agatha gets a chicken and cheese empanada with a pineapple fresca. Their food and drink are handed to them. Rio nods her head to the bench she’d been sitting at before and Agatha agrees, following her to eat.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio then says very seriously. “Pineapple is the worst one.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha raises an eyebrow. “No it isn’t. That would be grape. Grape doesn’t even taste like grape. It’s a scam.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pineapples have an enzyme that digest protein,” Rio explains, unwrapping her food. “They make your mouth numb because they’re eating you back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but I’m essentially having pineapple juice,” Agatha bites back. “This amount doesn’t make my mouth numb.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows knit together in confusion. “Yes it does.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses mid bite. She finishes it and then says, “Rio, if this agua fresca makes your mouth go numb, you could just be allergic to pineapple.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio thinks for a second, says, “No,” and takes a bite of her food.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “You can’t just say ‘no’ to having an allergy.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have any allergies,” Rio protests.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m allergic to mushrooms,” Agatha offers up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her with real pity in her eyes. “That’s so sad.” But then she nods and tacks on, “But good to know, since I plan on cooking for you some time.”</p><p> </p><p>The thought of them hanging out again has the butterflies in Agatha’s stomach bumping into each other and twitching nervously. “Oh. Cool.”</p><p> </p><p>When they’re done with their food, Rio outstretches her hand and Agatha dutifully puts her wrapper in Rio’s hand. On the way to the trash, Rio notices and picks up a few pieces by the time they’re at their destination. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t want any turtles to choke,” Agatha lightly teases, though Rio nods seriously. Agatha feels her heart beat fast and she shoves her empty fresca bottle behind the garbage Rio had collected.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Agatha asks after a moment, “what’s planned next?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins. “I can’t wait to show you.”</p><p> </p><p>As they walk to the next destination, Rio slips her hand in Agatha’s. Sure, Agatha knows part of it makes it easier to not get separated, but she’s really enjoying the way Rio’s thumb seems to instinctively rub the pack of her hand. She can feel the textures of the rings Rio is wearing.</p><p> </p><p>“Your hand is soft,” Rio says after a while, and Agatha feels heat in her body unrelated to the sun beating down on them. “Also, we’re here.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s the cat cafe. When Agatha looks at Rio in surprise, Rio continues. “I thought it’d be cute to come here. I’ve never actually been in myself… I just walk by it a lot.” She pauses and her face drops. “Wait, oh my god, I never asked you if you like cats. Or if you’re allergic—”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not allergic,” Agatha comforts, “and I do like cats.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s shoulders drop a bit in relief and her eyes match the smile on her lips. “Great. I assume you’ve never been here, either?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>“A first for both of us, then,” Rio notes, and she holds the door open for Agatha to enter the cafe first. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a gated-off, critter-proof front area that Agatha and Rio have to sign waivers in, but then they’re in.</p><p> </p><p>“All of the cats are adoptable,” the front desk employee explains, and Rio makes a delighted face at that.</p><p> </p><p>“That makes sense,” she muses.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you going to adopt a cat on our first date?” Agatha asks, but only at a volume so Rio can hear. It’s no one else’s business what they’re doing here or why, frankly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes. “I don’t know. I was just saying it makes sense because it’s a nice business model and makes sure the cats are sociable…”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, dork. Agatha, finger to her chin, ponders, “Where should we go?”</p><p> </p><p>“We could get drinks,” Rio suggests.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh!” Agatha points at the three-panel board menu above the register. “They have boba.” At Rio’s sour expression, she teases, “Don’t tell me you don’t like boba.”</p><p> </p><p>“Drinks are not meant to be chewed,” Rio says seriously.</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody Mary.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like those either.” Rio fishes her wallet out. “But I’m not having your drink, so you can order what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“You like mango, right?” Agatha asks. When Rio nods, she clarifies— “Good. I wanted to make sure in case you end up tasting it later.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walks up to the counter and orders her drink, feeling Rio’s flustered and practically trembling body standing behind her like a failed attack dog. She barely hears Rio give her own order, too busy thinking about what Rio would look like if Agatha demeaned her in bed. Her mind’s eye is giving her a really good image about it when Rio taps her shoulder and Agatha jumps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s got two drinks in hand, giving one of them to Agatha. “Your drink, m’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>“What did you get?” Agatha spears her straw through the sheer plastic lid, arguably the best part about boba tea.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s got cookies and cream and ube and maple sugar,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s nose wrinkles. “You judge me for pineapple and tapioca pearls but you’re drinking straight sugar. Your dentist must love you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have a great smile!” Rio protests, and to prove it she grins hard and awkward, even taking a finger from her free hand and pulling back so Agatha can see her perfectly fine molars. And, of course, her stupid fucking gap-toothed smile.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of entertaining Rio, Agatha says, “Let’s sit on that red couch over there.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a tabby cat who gets spooked and leaps off the couch even when Agatha and Rio both sit on it soft and slowly. Agatha crosses her legs and when Rio puts her free hand on Agatha’s knee, Agatha wiggles deeper into the couch, feeling a smirk grow on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Rio starts. “You never actually told me what you do in school.”</p><p> </p><p>“History,” Agatha says. “Female pirates specifically.”</p><p> </p><p>“Would’ve pegged you for a witch girl,” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re pegging me?” Agatha cocks her head innocently, feeling an adrenaline rush at the way Rio flushes at being beat at what she’d tried to start. Agatha feels a chill in the room as the air conditioner automatically kicks in, and they’re sitting right under a vent; she knowingly rotates her body a bit and subtly pushes her chest out so that when her tits inevitably feel the cold air, Rio’s eyes can’t help but snap like an elastic band to Agatha’s presumably hardening nipples. She chews on her bottom lip in pure glee and asks, “You still with me, sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks very embarrassed when her eyes meet Agatha’s. “Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so cute.” Agatha switches which of her legs is crossed over the other and can now lock her heel around Rio’s knee which is closer to her. Rio is definitely dykespreading on the couch, and it’s hot especially considering by Rio’s look, it’s entirely unintentional. “I do actually like periods like the Salem witch trials, but I find that a lot of people are into that right now. I wanted to find something a little more unorthodox.”</p><p> </p><p>At that moment, a small tuxedo cat starts sniffing at Rio’s feet. Agatha looks and tells her, “Looks like you’ve got a friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio coos cutely and bends over to scratch the little cat’s head. It’s a bit tricky with the positioning of Agatha’s legs, but it’s an unspoken understanding that if Agatha moves herself out of the way, the cat could get too frightened and scamper away. Rio must feel a surge of confidence, because she gets her hands under the cat's legs to hold its torso and scoop it up into her arms.</p><p> </p><p>The cat exhales a little “mrrp!” in surprise but doesn’t squirm. When Rio is finally cradling it properly, it immediately closes its amber eyes and begins to purr.</p><p> </p><p>“He likes you,” Agatha comments.</p><p> </p><p>“She,” Rio corrects.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “You can tell?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can feel the scar tissue on her stomach from her spaying surgery,” Rio explains. The cat is small enough that she can comfortably snuggle into one of Rio’s arms, so Rio uses a hand to scratch two fingers between the cat’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>It’s embarrassing how charming Rio looks with a cat. The cat she’s holding soaks up the attention like a sponge, ears folded back in airplane mode in a safe kind of joy. She was a cutie.</p><p> </p><p>The cat, that is. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows Rio is going to do something about the critter in her lap when another cat comes hopping up on the arm of the couch closest to Rio and sniffing around. The bitty she-cat looks at the gray tabby right in the face and hisses at him. The tabby darts away, immediately startled, and then the tuxedo goes right back to purring against Rio’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s bottom lip juts out and starts to wobble inadvertently. She glances at Agatha, her brown eyes wet with a cutesy sort of want. “She likes me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can I pet?” Agatha asks. Rio nods and doesn’t move the cat in her arms, but she does lean back a bit so Agatha can more easily take two of her fingers and lightly scratch the cat’s head. “You know, it’s kinda like she chose you.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Rio actually starts to shudder, and it takes a moment for Agatha to realize Rio looks like she could cry.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, baby, it’s okay.” Agatha doesn’t even realize how naturally the term of endearment slips out until it’s already away from her and hanging in the air.</p><p> </p><p>“My cat died about a year ago,” Rio explains. “I walk by here so often but I was nervous to come in here just because I didn’t want to feel like I was replacing her.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you chose to take me here?” Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, trying to act nonchalant. “I figured it was time. I promise I didn’t expect this, though.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha notices the cat is relaxed enough that she’s starting to fall asleep, even with the raw emotion radiating from Rio’s body. Agatha can tell because her purring is quieter and more intermittent than it had been before. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing in the rule book of first dates that says you can’t get her,” Agatha says.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Rio huffs, and Agatha can see her cheeks turning pink. Rio grumbles. “I can’t believe I got so emotional.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re human,” Agatha says, like she’s not the most emotionally constipated person in the world. And then she quips, “You could always go for gold and cry. I’m a dacryphiliac.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio barks out a laugh at that, startling the tuxedo awake. She lets out a confused little<em> mew</em>?</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll go see what her name is, if you’d like. I need to throw my drink away, anyway.” Agatha motions to the list of cats that’s at the front of the room. Rio gives her a shy nod, and so Agatha slowly gets up and makes her way up there. At this distance, she takes advantage and looks at Rio fully— she looks like an off-the-clock Hot Topic employee holding a kitten. Something flutters in Agatha, and she chalks it up to her pussy even though the fluttering is definitively taking place higher than that.</p><p> </p><p>The cat’s shelter name is Rainbow Dash. <em> Horrible</em>, Agatha thinks. <em> Rio better change that. </em>She won’t let a 40-something year old brony fuck her. The kitty was about a year old, and described as a cuddle monster. Checks out. Agatha turns to go back and tell Rio the information she’s learned when she stumbles upon an image she is very much not a fan of.</p><p> </p><p>There was an employee, a woman with strawberry blonde hair past her shoulders, animatedly talking to Rio. Rio was nodding along and giving curt answers, but it was clear Rio would prefer not to be in a conversation. Agatha felt something bubble up in her gut: not quite anger, but just as nasty.</p><p> </p><p>She makes her way over, and lets her voice carry when she says, “Hey, baby, that cat is available to adopt! But you’ve got to change the name, it’s terrible.” Agatha then shoots an obviously fake smile at the girl. “And who are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I work here,” the girl answers lamely. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s great!” Agatha’s tone is so sickly sweet even Rio’s social ineptitude catches it; her eyebrows raise. “You can get us the forms to fill out, then?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl mumbles something, and Agatha doesn’t care enough to try and comprehend it, just stares daggers at her until she walks away towards the direction of the office. She plops down right next to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You and Sashimi have several things in common,” Rio starts.</p><p> </p><p>“Sashimi?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what I’m naming her.” Rio gives a little gap-toothed grin.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” Agatha says. “The cafe had named her Rainbow Dash.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s bananas.” Rio scratches the little cat’s head. “Especially considering the best pony is Fluttershy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just saying!” Rio throws a single hand up in defense; luckily for her, the cat is tiny enough for her to comfortably cradle with one arm. “I watched a little bit of it… there’s no harm in that.” Her face sours before her next comment. “But then the audience ended up being weird incels… kinda ruined it for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha motioned to the cat still snoozing in the crook of Rio’s arm. “You think you’re gonna get her?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio almost looked at Agatha conspiratorially. “I mean, I have to, don’t I?” She then shoots Agatha a crooked grin. “You two are a bit alike, y’know.”</p><p> </p><p>“What does that even mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“It means…” Rio’s smile turns megawatt. “Both of you marked your territory. She hissed at another cat, and <em> you</em>…”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, do not compare me to an animal.”</p><p> </p><p>“But it’s a cute animal,” Rio protests. She moves the cat so that she’s holding her up to Agatha. Amber eyes blink back at her sleepily. “See?”</p><p> </p><p>The cat looks at her like she’s asking <em> Why am I being held up? I was napping. </em> so Agatha replies, “I don’t know why she woke you up, either, kid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she’s fine,” Rio says, placing the cat on her knee and bouncing it as if the cat were a toddler.</p><p> </p><p>The cat— Sashimi— is perfectly receptive to Rio manipulating her like putty.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to ignore the pounding in her heart at the image before her of Rio playing with a kitten. “Wanna go sign the papers, then?”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a different employee giving them the proper paperwork, of which Agatha is grateful. Though she still smiles at this one with a little too much teeth. Rio asks the teen male employee a plethora of questions about Sashimi’s medical records and temperament to a point where the kid starts sweating. Agatha notices that when Rio speaks to him, she’s very factual, and the young employee must take it for some sort of interrogation. </p><p> </p><p>When everything is finalized the teen nervously says, “Thanks! Don’t come back— as in, um, I hope you’re her forever home! You’re welcome to visit whenever you want, of course, haha, yeah,” before ducking behind the ‘Employees Only’ curtain.</p><p> </p><p>Rio holds Sashimi in her cardboard crate as they stand under the awning of the entrance. Agatha is reminded of Build-a-Bear, except there’s a living creature in there. She’s meowing. “I think this date is going to last a little longer,” Rio admits. “Well, if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can go to the pet store with you,” Agatha agrees, and Rio lights up at that.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll have to take my car,” Rio comments. “We can go to the pet store by my house.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha chirps, and she follows behind Rio. She relatively knows where she is, but it’s nice to be able to just trust in the direction someone is going. Too many times <em> she’s </em> the one with that mantle on her shoulders. And Rio’s shoulders are very broad— Agatha should know, she’s getting a wonderful eyeful of them— and she’s sure Rio knows where she’s going.</p><p> </p><p>When they get to the second story of a parking garage and Rio’s keys unlock a Subaru hatchback, Agatha just cackles. It bounces off the walls of the parking garage, and Rio can only stare at Agatha cluelessly.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a dyke.” Agatha laughs so hard she snorts, and that makes her stop cold, her brows furrowing. She looks to see Rio grinning wistfully at the noise she’d made. Agatha squares her shoulders. “Well, the car door isn’t going to open itself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio fully unlocks the car and opens the passenger side door for Agatha. “M’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets in, buckles because she has a feeling Rio will bitch if she doesn’t, and then holds her arms out for the cardboard box Rio has in her other hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asks. “I don’t mind putting her in the back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha beckons her fingers in a ‘gimme’ motion. “Do I seem like the type of girl to do something she doesn’t want to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles at that. “You certainly do not.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio sets up the car and starts to slowly drive out of the parking garage, Agatha scratches the box comfortingly as a scared little <em> eep! </em>sounds from the box when the engine roars to life. She can see a pink nose snuffling from one of the tiny air holes. Agatha can’t help but press her finger to it; the little nose instantly goes back in the box the second her finger graces it, but Agatha is able to know it’s cold and wet.</p><p> </p><p>It takes a second for them to get out of the city proper, but as the drive goes on, Agatha can feel Sashimi curl up and lay down in the box, certain parts of her lap feeling the correct kinds of pressure. She stares at Rio as the older woman drives: the long fingers tapping on the steering wheel as soft rock billows from the speakers, the curve of her nose in a side profile view, the way her shirt clings to her bicep, the way she fidgets. Agatha starts to think she’s a squirmy driver when Rio glances at her during a stop light and asks, “Is there something on my face?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the tips of her ears warm and purposefully ignores it, cooling her expression. “I’m just enjoying the view.”</p><p> </p><p>Bingo. Rio blinks and then blushes. “We’re on the road.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, and I’m the passenger princess.” Agatha shrugs as if to say, duh. “Why do I care what’s on the road?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wets her lips nervously and shifts the gear into park. “We’re here.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a chain pet store. Rio takes one of the shopping carts outside of the sliding doors and sets the boxed up Sashimi in the place where a parent would put a toddler. An apt millennial equivalent. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ll need litter and the box,” Rio starts to list off. “Cat food, dry and wet. Some toys and at least one scratching post. Some flea and tick preventatives. Food dishes. Maybe some treats…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts grabbing items off the shelf and slotting them into her cart.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure know what you want,” Agatha says playfully.</p><p> </p><p>“I know the trustworthy brands from when—” Rio pauses at that, and her brow furrows together. She says, “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels a little bad for her quip. She’d tried to make it a double entendre before it got too serious. So she murmurs, “Well, you’re a natural with them.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile is so shy it makes Agatha want to drag her thumb across Rio’s bottom lip. Rio looks over to Agatha and whispers, almost conspiratorially, “I can tell you a secret.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks around as if to double check there aren’t wires placed somewhere in the stuffed dog toys shaped like dinosaurs and flamingos and then she admits, “I actually really dislike pet stores. I try to avoid them when possible.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is admittedly surprised. “Really? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“At best, the animals here are barely having their needs met,” Rio explains. “Almost every animal here is in a tank too small. They don’t have enrichment. Their diets could be better. I can’t blame the workers. Most of them either don’t know or do and burn out quick.” Agatha follows Rio’s gaze to where the fish and reptiles are kept. “I don’t even want to look. I barely got a glance but it already made me too sad. I want to save them all even though I can’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can tell Rio is starting to get truly upset, so she places a hand on Rio’s waist and points out, “Well, you saved one creature today, and that’s more than most people have done today.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nibbles on the inside of her cheek. “Yeah, I guess.” She takes one last glance at the cart. “I’ve gotten everything I need for now.”</p><p> </p><p>When they get to the register, the cashier is a woman around Rio’s age.</p><p> </p><p>“Find everything you need?” she asks. The usual retail schtick.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. “However, I’m worried that the size of your tanks compared to the amount of fish per tank is too much. You also have multiple turtles in the same tank. They’re happier as solitary creatures.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” the woman states, “but I’m not really in charge of that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right.” Rio’s voice grows strained. “But I think if you brought it up to your manager, or the owner, you could at least make it a little more comfortable for them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Um.” The woman looks uncomfortable as she starts to ring up Rio’s products. “I can try?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s all I’m asking,” Rio says. “I’m not saying it’s your fault.” </p><p> </p><p>As they walk out of the pet store, bags covering the entire cart, Rio grumbles, almost to herself, “I hate pet stores.”</p><p> </p><p>“You seem to intimidate people,” Agatha points out as they get into the parking lot.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just shrugs. “That’s not really my problem.” But then something strikes her and she nervously glances at Agatha. “Unless you don’t like it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I find it hot,” Agatha states.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes slightly at that, but she says nothing as she finishes putting the supplies in her car. Then, of course, Rio opens the car door for Agatha again, helping her set the cardboard box in her lap. Rio fills the drive home with random bits of conversation— the weather from the last week, cat’s ability to contort their bodies if their head can fit, the etymology of the word dinosaur. Agatha contributes questions and comments where she deems necessary, and so Rio knows she’s listening, but Agatha surprises herself in how she’s genuinely interested because the factoids are in the sound of Rio’s voice. </p><p> </p><p>It shocks Agatha, how quickly she enjoys being in Rio’s physical company. Maybe it’s because they’ve already been talking for close to a month— she already knows quite a bit about Rio. Agatha’s been out of her mother’s house since the day she turned 18, even though she still had three months of high school to finish, but she can still feel that iron grip around her throat sometimes. She still finds it hard to like people. But she likes how honest Rio is. Rio doesn’t seem like the type to say what she doesn’t mean, even if her truth were to receive odd looks from people, and compared to her mother, that’s about as rebellious of a partner Agatha can find— someone who didn’t give a shit about what others thought. It also helps that Rio is really nice to look at.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lives in a fairly quiet neighborhood. They pull up to what looks like a small and comfortable house.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice digs,” Agatha comments.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, I own,” Rio says proudly. She probably got those really good 2021 interest rates. Fucker.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stares at Rio’s lips unabashedly as the older woman puts her car in park. When Rio glances back at Agatha, she realizes where Agatha’s focus is, and her face turns red, Her own eyes gravitate towards Agatha’s lips. Agatha wets them, knowing her tongue poking out will drive Rio crazy. She sees Rio start to inch her body over the console to lean in. Agatha wonders what Rio’s tongue tastes like, or how her moans would burn sliding down her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Meow,” the box in Agatha’s lap says, and both women jump.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs and sounds breathless when she asks, “I… would you like to come in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Guess that’s our cue,” Agatha agrees. Rio gets out of the car first to help Agatha with the adoption box. </p><p> </p><p>“I can get all the cat supplies,” she states. “You just carry Sashimi in.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha asks. “I could get a bag or two in one arm. It’d save you a trip.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio says frankly, and she looks almost comical with all the things in her arms. There’s still two bags in the car, though, and Rio is looking around her as if to wish a third arm appeared on her body. Before she can topple over, Agatha snatches the two bags. They’re extremely light, filled with mostly toys and the dry food.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pouts adorably. “I could’ve gotten that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh huh.” Agatha is not convinced. “Need me to close the trunk?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope! I can do that on my…” Rio looks down to where her keys are attached to her carabiner and very much out of her reach. Her smile instantly drops. “Hmm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me.” Agatha transfers the bags in her hand to hang on her wrist as she clicks the correct button on Rio’s car to automatically close the trunk. She then locks it for good measure. She looks at Rio through hooded eyes and impishly grins. “I can unlock your door too, if you’d like.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think I have a choice,” Rio says in defeat, and Agatha follows her up the driveway and the lawn.</p><p> </p><p>“Your grass is long,” Agatha notices. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a native species,” Rio tells her. “Yard culture is a hegemonic farce. And horrible for the environment.”</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you’re a big fan of golf,” Agatha jokes, and Rio grumbles in a way that shows she is very much <em> not</em>. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha reaches for the retractable house key Rio points out on her carabiner she heavy-handedly drags the side of her hand across the crotch of Rio’s jeans, which causes her to sputter, “Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oops.” Agatha successfully unlocks the door and Rio pushes in first before Agatha can stop her. She then grins triumphantly when she’s able to hold the door open for Agatha with her foot. Rio instantly sets down the bags on the floor next to the entrance, and that’s when Agatha gingerly hands Rio the box with Sashimi in it before setting the bags she’d picked up alongside Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s best advised to give cats some time in one room for a few nights before introducing them to the whole house,” Rio explains, “so I’m going to set Sashimi up in the guest bedroom. You can come with me, but you’re welcome to look around.” She takes her sneakers off with her heels and kicks them by the door, so Agatha unbuckles her own shoes and sets them beside Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can hear the baby talk going on in the direction of whatever bedroom isn’t Rio’s, the opening of a wet can and the responding dramatic feline screams. And then she starts to snoop, because Rio said she was welcome to “look around”— and everyone knows that’s code for snoop. Even if Rio hadn’t explicitly said that, Agatha would probably snoop anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s got a lot of knick knacks. It’s as if she’s bought something at every souvenir shop in the country and then some. Fossils, little pieces of pottery, glass figurines of animals, succulents. Agatha bends down a little to be eye level with the tallest shelf of Rio’s book collection. <em> Hamlet. The Hunger Games. The Color Purple. Priory of the Orange Tree. </em></p><p> </p><p>Hmm… gay ass.</p><p> </p><p>This is how Rio catches her. Agatha startles when Rio calls her name. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio apologizes. “You’re not in trouble or anything. I said you could.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re like a shadow,” Agatha says, straightening up and pressing her hand to her chest. “Do you always startle people on accident?” When Rio just shrugs, Agatha changes gears. “How’s Sashimi doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio does smile at this. “She’s doing fine, I think. Sniffing around a lot. Decided to go into the closet and doesn’t want to come out, so I put a blanket in there and put her wet food out on the floor in front of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aww, she’s almost like fourteen year old me, in a way,” Agatha jokes, and Rio waves a hand dismissively.</p><p> </p><p>Rio jokes, “So, gonna psychoanalyze me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I diagnose you with lesbianism,” Agatha deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>An awkward moment of silence. Agatha can tell Rio wants to say something, so she gives her a little time. </p><p> </p><p>“Um.” Agatha watches Rio’s throat physically bob. “Do you want me to take you home?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says softly. She wraps a finger around the belt loop Rio had kept her carabiner on and pulls her in close enough that their hips are flush together. “You aren’t even going to kiss me?”</p><p> </p><p>That must be all the permission Rio needs, because she quickly rectifies her mistake by slotting her lips against Agatha’s. Agatha wraps her hand around Rio’s shoulders as she feels warm hands hold her hips. Rio’s kisses are close-mouthed and polite until Agatha takes her nails and scrapes them against the shaved part of Rio’s undercut. When Rio sighs into Agatha’s touch, Agatha takes advantage of the opening and shoves her tongue into Rio’s mouth, practically dying to taste her. One of Rio’s hands reaches up to cup Agatha’s jaw as their kiss deepens. Agatha licks into Rio’s mouth, hungry for the older woman’s spit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the kiss to brush her thumb across Agatha’s wet and flushed bottom lip, her brown eyes blown in poorly concealed awe. “You really wanna do this on the first date?”</p><p> </p><p>A breathy chuckle escapes Agatha. She glances at Rio’s eyes, and then her lips, and then back up to her eyes again. Rio notices the movement because her olive-toned cheeks start to color warm. Agatha rasps out, “Don’t you want to know how I sound when I orgasm in real life?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio growls and pushes Agatha against the bookshelf Agatha had previously been inspecting. A couple of the picture frames topple and fall flat on the shelf, and Agatha hisses in surprise as the wood hits her back. “Sorry, fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“S’okay, baby, just touch me.” Agatha jolts her hips a little so Rio can feel the pressure. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands travel Agatha’s body like it’d be a crime to leave a stone unturned. When Rio starts kissing Agatha’s jawline, Agatha tilts her head back and groans. It’s like Rio naturally knows where the most sensitive spots on Agatha’s body are; her lips graze that spot below Agatha’s ear that has her embarrassingly whimpering and feeling the hair on her arms stand up as she gets gooseflesh. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s hands graze past Agatha’s navel piercing, Rio husks, “You’re so… something. I can’t even describe it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks and bites her lip, knowing Rio can’t see her reaction to her funny description. Her ego is inflated by the way Rio seems to be metaphorically cracking her egg brain into a heated pan and scrambling it right in front of her. “I’ll be honest, I don’t think anyone has ever told me that before.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbles something incoherent, embarrassment creeping into her little sounds. She pops her head back up to meet Agatha again, and the jig is up; Agatha’s eyes hold too much mirth to stuff back quickly enough. Rio’s hands skirt up to Agatha’s breasts, each thumb claiming a nipple to rub softly. They get hard fast; there is, of course, only one layer between them and Rio’s calloused fingers. “You were very evil for this, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like when you look at me,” Agatha confesses, and Rio responds by taking the bottom of Agatha’s baby tee and lifting it up to unabashedly bare Agatha’s tits to her eyes. Rio doesn’t even wait for Agatha to try and lift the rest of the shirt off before kissing her sternum wetly. She takes no time at all to slip a nipple in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels herself grow tight between the thighs, like her shorts have suddenly become a size too small. She gasps as Rio starts to roll her nipple between her tongue and soft back of her teeth, her hands shakily untucking Rio’s shirt from her pants. When Agatha is finally successful, she dips her hands under Rio’s shirt to touch bare skin. Rio is warm like a fireplace, and she hears Rio groan and feels the muscles of Rio’s strong stomach tense. Agatha’s hands must be freezing for her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pops Agatha’s nipple from her mouth and doesn’t say anything, just turns her head to give Agatha’s other breast some well-deserved attention, sucking bruises on the underside of it. Agatha blindly tries to undo the front of Rio’s belt, but not being able to see it very well or pay close enough attention for the action’s needed dexterity due to Rio’s detailed nibbling and suckling. Agatha can only buck her hips and whine in frustration, said frustration stemming from multiple sources. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio looks up at Agatha, tit still in her mouth, Agatha feels like her breath has been stolen from her. Rio’s hands move from Agatha’s waist to her own as she’s able to successfully take off her own belt while creating a pretty nasty mark on Agatha’s sensitive flesh. It’s very hot. Agatha needs Rio’s fingers inside of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Take me to bed,” she orders, hoping the waver she hears in her voice is only something she mentally created. Rio crashes their lips together again as she tugs Agatha from against the bookcase and pushes her presumably in the direction of the bedroom: though not without grabbing Agatha’s ass as she does so. </p><p> </p><p>“Let’s see what those gym workouts do for you,” Agatha says, smirking, and she wraps her arms around Rio’s shoulders yet again before jumping and wrapping her legs around Rio’s waist. Rio’s eyes widen in great shock, but she’s able to use quick reflexes and catches Agatha expertly, getting the privilege of cupping her ass. She doesn’t hold Agatha up like it’s nothing, but something more akin to a bag of groceries. Still minimal effort. Agatha takes one of her hands and cups it on Rio’s flexing bicep. Agatha tosses her hair from curtaining her face so her lips can touch the shell of Rio’s ear when she whispers, “So good for me, daddy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s responding grunt shoots straight to Agatha’s cunt as Rio starts to march to her bedroom. Agatha barely has any time to look at the content of Rio’s bedroom walls and shelves before Rio is tossing her onto the king size bed like a sack of potatoes. When Rio crawls on top of her and works to presumably pin Agatha’s wrists above her head, Agatha slackens her body. When Rio relaxes, taking her easy victory too gullibily, Agatha takes her chance and uses her thighs to wrap around Rio and messily flip them over.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just blinks at Agatha owlishly when Agatha says, “It’s cute you think you’re in charge.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can be in control if you want to be,” Rio states. As if she has a choice in the matter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straddles Rio’s hips and takes off her shirt, leaving her top half bare. Even though the best bits were already at Rio’s disposal and wet with her spit, Rio’s eyelids grow heavy as she blatantly stares at any inch of skin Agatha exposes. Agatha fluffs out her hair, stretching her neck out. While she can’t see it from this angle, she feels the heat of Rio’s gaze on her. </p><p> </p><p>That’s when Agatha grins maniacally and lifts Rio’s shirt up, exposing her bright, highlighter green sports bra.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course this is the color you wear if it’s not black,” Agatha teases.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not like anyone but you is seeing it,” Rio protests. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can already see the indents of Rio’s hardening nipples through the material of her bra. She wastes zero time in hiking the material up so she can take a well-deserved look at Rio’s breasts— they’re smaller than her own, but perky, dark nipples big and so stiff-looking it must hurt. Agatha brushes a thumb across one of Rio’s hardened peaks, and the older woman under her whimpers at the touch. Agatha rakes her nails down Rio’s torso and stomach, feeling muscle tense under her fingertips. Little red lines follow Agatha’s physical warpath.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so reactive.” Agatha giggles maniacally as she takes both nipples between her fingers and pulls, relishing in the delicious squeal that tumbles from Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“They're sensitive,” Rio manages to squeak out.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha leans forward so her lips are inches from Rio’s, and then she takes one nipple and starts to slowly twist it. Rio’s responding yelp quickly turns to a hiss as Agatha starts mouthing at her throat. Agatha then orders, “Take it all off.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio palms off her shirt and bra until she’s also topless. She’s got tattoos on her torso and underboob and shoulders that Agatha is way too fucking horny to study, but she certainly plans to soon enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Pants too,” Agatha continues, but she decides to be difficult and stay straddling Rio’s lap and offer no help, so Rio has to dig into where Agatha’s weight is on her and pull at the waistband of her jeans, thrusting her hips up while pulling them down. Agatha stays unhelpful, instead using Rio’s movements to gyrate her hips to bring a little pressure to where she needs it the most. She pants theatrically in pleasure, and she knows Rio can tell exactly what she’s doing, because a dark look crosses Rio’s face. A couple of thrusts later and Rio is able to move her pants down far enough that she can simply kick them off her body and shove them with her feet from the bed to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“You are so difficult,” Rio grumbles once her pants are fully off. She’s left in only her boxers.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t that why you like me?” Agatha gives herself another little grind on Rio’s lap, and then pouts. “You know, it’s super unfair how you’re basically naked and I’m still in my pants.”</p><p> </p><p>A very poor excuse for a pair of pants, as in this position, Agatha’s ass is somewhat hanging out, but still. It’s the principle of the matter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands shoot to Agatha’s hips and start toying with the button of Agatha’s jeans, but Agatha smacks them away and tuts. “I didn’t say you could touch me, sweetheart.” Agatha takes Rio’s wrists and positions them over Rio’s head, pinning them down. “Keep those there for me.” When Agatha starts to slide her hands down Rio’s body and Rio obediently keeps her arms and hands where Agatha set them, Agatha whispers, “Thank you, daddy. Stay there for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slides off of Rio and stands facing her at the foot of the bed. She doesn’t rush unsnapping the button fly of her jeans, undoing each and every one even though she’d only needed to undo the first few to actually get them off. She puts a little hip into the way she shimmies them off, feeling Rio’s gaze on her body.</p><p> </p><p>She’s wearing sheer white panties with little lace flowers on them, and the part that covers her mons pubis is practically mesh. She feels her stomach somersault as Rio’s eyes zero in on the bush peeking out of the top of them. </p><p> </p><p>“I wore these for you,” she clarifies. “I thought you’d like them.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do.” Rio’s throat sounds raw.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretends to ponder for a moment and then says, “Should I keep them on, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hell no.” Rio’s answer rings out before Agatha can even finish the last word of her very rhetorical question. Rio’s hands twitch, but they stay above her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slips her thumbs under the tiny band of her underwear and slides them down, angling herself so that Rio is able to see both her front and back. Rio groans, her hips instinctively thrusting up. When Agatha is fully nude, she crawls back on the bed to hover over Rio until her thighs are bracketing Rio’s waist. She murmurs, “Now what am I supposed to do with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha expects Rio to beg along the lines of something like <em> Touch me </em> or <em> Put your mouth on me </em> but what blurts out of Rio’s mouth is, “Ride my face.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up and back, a little surprised, and stares at Rio. Her brown eyes look practically black, and Agatha is sure hers look similar. She paints on a smirk. “You want me to grind on your mouth until I’m squirting in it? Even though I’ve been sweating for the past five hours?””</p><p> </p><p>“S’flavor,” Rio croaks. She motions to move her hands and Agatha nods, so Rio frees herself from her metaphorical cage, her hands instantly around the backs of Agatha’s thighs and ass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans her ass back and grinds over Rio’s crotch like the older woman has a bulge for Agatha to press her ass against. She moans straight into Rio’s ear and can feel the short hairs on the nape of Rio’s neck prick up at the sound, as if every fiber of Rio’s being is reaching to touch her. “You need my cunt in your face, daddy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, yes,” Rio groans, and she palms Agatha’s ass cheeks, inadvertently spreading them and causing Agatha to feel a rush of cool air hit her insanely warm cunt. Agatha hisses in surprise at the sensation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up and starts to move herself up Rio’s body, Rio’s hands pushing her along. When she’s inches from sitting on her throne, Rio spills out a quick, “Wait.”</p><p> </p><p>Bemused, Agatha looks down to see what Rio stopped her for, and her gut feels tight when she realizes Rio is unabashedly staring at her drenched pussy. Agatha impulsively takes two fingers and sticks them in Rio’s slack-jawed mouth, forking between her tongue and swiping at Rio’s overexcited salivary glands. When Agatha takes her fingers out, a long line of spit follows each finger. Even when gravity causes them to break, a great amount of saliva still pools and thickens on Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Drooling for me, baby?” Agatha teases, but it definitely comes out breathier and in more obvious awe than she intended. She sticks her offending fingers in her mouth as Rio’s dark eyes flit up to watch.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got the prettiest pussy I’ve ever seen,” Rio waxes unironically. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs and turns her head to the side, flipping her hair in hopes Rio’s eyes track that particular movement instead of the rising flush she can feel creeping up her cheeks. “And how many other pretty pussies have you laid your eyes on, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“None,” Rio corrects. “Ever.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums dramatically. “That mouth of yours is going to get you into trouble, darling.” And with no warning, Agatha finally and fully lowers herself onto Rio’s beggar of a mouth. </p><p> </p><p>She moans open-mouthed when Rio’s tongue instantly sticks out and flattens itself, giving Agatha something sturdy to grind on. One of her hands fists its fingers into the crown of Rio’s thick, straight hair. Rio slurps her up like she’s been chained up for weeks and Agatha is her first meal served since her sentence. When Rio’s hands slide back to cup Agatha’s ass and spread her open so she can dig her tongue deeper, Agatha mewls, steadying herself on Rio’s arm and squeezing when Rio flexes her bicep in response. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, daddy.” Agatha shamelessly grins her cunt into Rio’s face, barely caring where her arousal hits Rio and if Rio is able to properly breathe. She’s sure Rio would say something or wrench her off if there was <em> really </em> a problem. “Fuck, make me come.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts suckling Agatha’s pulsing clit and Agatha sees stars the color of Rio’s gooey-colored eyes. Her orgasm certainly phases Rio, but it makes Rio’s pace quicken, like having Agatha gush her climax all over her nose and tongue awakes some sort of sleeper agent in her. She starts notably bobbing her head up and down and meeting Agatha’s hip movements eagerly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches her peak again soon enough and she has to push herself back and set a hand on Rio’s thick, muscular thigh to balance herself. She must touch dangerously close to the apex of Rio’s thighs, definitively feeling the soft cloth of her boxers, because Rio whimpers at the gripping touch. As Agatha starts to feel herself lower from her high of her orgasm, she suggestively brushes up Rio’s thigh again. Rio moans into Agatha’s trembling cunt at that one— and while it feels good, Agatha doesn’t mind taking the backseat if it means teasing the poor thing practically shaking underneath her.</p><p> </p><p>“You like when I touch you, baby?” Agatha lifts herself off of Rio’s face, setting herself down on Rio’s sternum. She can feel the warmth of Rio’s skin and the way she’s essentially dripping close to, if not on, Rio’s tits. Her hand skirts up higher Rio’s leg, and Rio just hisses in a breath like Agatha has doused her in ice water. Agatha tuts. “Answer me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio wheezes out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wipes her thumb across Rio’s wet chin, and Rio is able to understand Agatha’s unspoken action before she even has to complete it, taking Agatha’s wrist in her grip and sucking on Agatha’s thumb. Agatha moans appreciatively and brushes her fingertips over the small hill of Rio’s mound, feeling the texture of hair under cloth until she gets to the part she’s been looking for. She doesn’t dip her fingers in, but she does relish in the unabashed whine that claws out of Rio’s throat as Agatha brushes her fingers through Rio’s clothed folds. She pops her thumb out of Rio’s mouth, the woman under her staring at her slack-jawed and probably awaiting some sort of instruction like a high strung herding dog. Agatha takes the wet digit and starts drawing circles around one of Rio’s nipples.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, baby.” Agatha croons with the lilt of a siren tempting a sailor to his doom. “I think you did such a good job with your shift as my chair, I want to return the favor.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hips buck into Agatha’s hand. “O-Okay… Whatever you’d like, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha separates her legs from Rio’s torso, scooting down. Noticing the sheen of her own arousal coating Rio’s chest, Agatha takes her tongue to it and laps herself up, using her teeth to nibble (and maybe or maybe not bite) here and there. Rio takes it all in the stride of someone who has no issue looking like a pathetic mutt begging for scraps under the dinner table; she whimpers and digs her fingers into Agatha’s shoulder as Agatha traces the sculpted skin of Rio’s body, replacing the slick of her cunt with the slick of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>And if she spends a few minutes sucking on Rio’s nipples and toothily grinning as Rio trembles underneath her, she is simply enjoying the moment. Rio tastes like sweat and earth, and Agatha is addicted to feeling Rio’s nipples going from soft to painfully hard as she scrapes them across her teeth and the roof of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Rio curses, and Agatha decides in that second that she is going to actively work to get Rio to do that more often. She unmouths herself from Rio and lifts herself up by her arms just a smidgen so that she can stare Rio in the eye. Her browns are fully blown like a nighttime desert storm. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuffles down until she can get a good look at Rio’s choice of boxers. They’re a plain sage green. Agatha can see the fuzzy line of Rio’s happy trail dip into it, leading to the source of the heady smell that curls around Agatha’s nostrils and makes her mouth water. She almost giggles when she sees a wet spot on the crotch of Rio’s underwear; it’s very apparent due to the underwear’s lighter color. “You got this wet just from me stuffing my pussy in your face?” As Rio’s affirmative combination of a whine and nod, Agatha continues. “So pathetic for me, daddy. You’re like putty in my hands. I could spit on you and slap you around and you’d probably be so fucking into it.”</p><p> </p><p>In that moment, Agatha notices something peculiar, so she tests her theory. “Say it, Rio. Say you’re pathetic for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m pathetic for you.” Rio’s chest is heaving like her lungs are unable to filter oxygen.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re <em> so </em> fucking pathetic for me,” Agatha sneers, stirring some degradation into her tone. “I could train you like a prized show dog. Give you a collar. Keep you on your knees for me. Doesn’t that sound nice, <em> daddy</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t whine as much as she gurgles, her body jumping like it’s been electrocuted. And Agatha is proven right; with her teasing, the wet patch on Rio’s underwear grows larger. Agatha does actually cackle at that. “Oh, you poor thing. So macho and strong in public, but I guess in bed you’re willing to bend to a femme that knows how to bite.” With that, Agatha starts to stroke Rio through her boxers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shudders under Agatha’s touch. She softly asks, “Can you put your mouth on me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at Rio and raises and eyebrow, pushing her fingers into Rio’s covered but sticky mess. “I don’t know, <em> can </em> I? It’s a question. I could say no.”</p><p> </p><p>“Put your mouth on me!” It still comes out as a sort of beg, but Agatha can hear the way Rio grits her teeth to push the words out.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve decided to be nice today.” Agatha grips the waistband of Rio’s boxers and pulls. Rio excitedly lifts herself so that Agatha can take them fully off; Agatha practically licks her chops at the way there are several strings of Rio’s arousal stuck between her heated cunt and her underwear, broken by the time Agatha has the underwear past Rio’s knees. In just a few more seconds, Rio is fully nude, and her boxers litter the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lays on her stomach between Rio’s thighs and props herself up by her elbows to get a better look. When she pulls back the slick, wiry hair of Rio’s bush with her thumb she can see Rio’s pulsing and protruding clit, standing at and aching for attention. Agatha then takes her middle and forefinger and spreads Rio’s outer lips to see a bright pink center. “You’re so handsome.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio keens and her hand automatically shoots to pull at Agatha’s hair, but when Agatha tuts, “Uh-uh, I don’t think so,” her wrist snaps back and slams onto the mattress as if plucked away by marionette strings.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets her face close enough to Rio’s cunt that she can tell Rio can feel her breath by her twitching; it’s as if it’s taking all of Rio’s physical power to hold herself back. Agatha says, “What, no manners? I’m at the dinner table, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please. Please please please.” The words spill out of Rio like a broken dam. “Please, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t even have the last letter of Agatha’s name out before Agatha’s licking up slick. Now, Agatha is a certified and licensed muff diver, but she can’t help but moan when she gets her tongue and teeth all wrapped up in the sizzling flesh of Rio’s pussy. She thinks Rio is the best pair of legs she’s stuffed her face between, and Rio is so physically <em> responsive</em>, lapping up the friction of Agatha’s mouth like one of those little pets that craves attention more than air. Agatha uses her thumbs to spread Rio open wider so she can get as deep as possible, starting out with broad strokes of her tongue before delivering kitten licks to Rio’s hard clit. Rio yelps at that, and Agatha can feel Rio grab something— a pillow, or the sheets, maybe— as her hips undulate against Agatha’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes two fingers and bookends them against Rio’s clit, jacking her off accordingly. Rio practically howls as Agatha licks up the juice spilling from her center. When Rio’s body seizes and her breath staccatos, Agatha knows she’s coming. Agatha takes her fingers off of Rio’s clit and replaces it with her lips, bobbing her head up and down as if she’s sucking a dick. </p><p> </p><p>Both of Rio’s hands shoot to Agatha’s hair and tug harshly at the root. Agatha moans at the feeling, and while she doesn’t swat Rio away like last time, she does add a little teeth to her suckling as punishment. Agatha can feel Rio clamp her thighs around Agatha’s head. They’re trembling, maybe from overstimulation. Agatha tests that and just starts messily eating Rio’s pussy: tongue flat and her head nodding as she tries to cover as much area as possible. She puts her nose into it, makes sure it bumps up against Rio’s clit. She feels Rio heave in a breath more than hears it as Rio flattens both her palms on Agatha’s forehead and pushes her back.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck… I can’t.” Rio shudders as the cold air hits where Agatha’s face has ceased blocking her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chin is wet but drying fast. She starts to take her fingers to wipe and taste, but Rio beats her to it, swiping three fingers across Agatha’s bottom lip and dimpled chin to take Agatha’s reward.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Agatha whines petulantly. “That’s mine.” She snatches Rio’s wrist. Then, still nestled between Rio’s legs, she angles Rio’s wrist so that the back of Rio’s hand is facing her and Rio’s fingers are slightly curled in. Agatha makes a big show of pinning down Rio’s pinky and thumb so that three fingers are left standing up. There’s a slim ring on Rio’s pointer finger, and Agatha slides it off.</p><p> </p><p>“Take that,” she orders, and Rio blindly fumbles until it’s presumably— hopefully— on the nightstand. Agatha gets off of her stomach, sitting up to straddle Rio and balance on her knees, bracketing Rio’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then looks Rio in the eye as she bends down and envelopes Rio’s outstretched fingers in her mouth and starts sucking. She internally smirks as Rio’s eyes get impossibly bigger and the endless black of her pupils swallows even more brown. Agatha puts work into it— she bobs her head and curls her tongue around Rio’s digits, savoring the last remnants of Rio’s arousal. The calluses of Rio’s fingers scrape the roof of Agatha’s mouth and it shoots straight to her core. She sucks off Rio’s fingers until all she can taste is her own spit and Rio’s skin, and then she sucks a little more, because the sweat of Rio’s skin tastes wonderful on Agatha’s tongue. </p><p> </p><p>When she’s done, Agatha lets go of Rio’s fingers with a <em> pop! </em> and bites her lip at Rio expectantly.</p><p> </p><p>“You are so hot,” Rio whispers, like it’s a secret. Like she almost can’t believe how wonderful it all is.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up fully and feels electricity-like tingles prick across her bare body as she watches Rio eye her curves now that she’s able to see them again. She lines herself up accordingly and presses Rio’s fingers against her lower stomach as if measuring how deep they’ll be in her, lightly rubbing two fingers and her thumb up and down their length. </p><p> </p><p>“Keep them still for now,” Agatha orders Rio, and she lifts herself up to lower herself onto Rio’s fingers. Three can be a lot to take at once, but Agatha’s already had several orgasms, and she’s gotten filthily wet from eating Rio out. She squeezes her eyes shut and moans as she starts to sink down, the width of Rio’s fingers giving her a pleasurable burn as her pussy stretches to take it. When she’s back to fully straddling Rio, her ass feeling the hair of Rio’s crotch, she sighs in content, letting her body and mind get used to the fullness. She opens her eyes and looks at Rio when she says, “I’ve thought about your fingers being inside of me for so fucking long.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio is red down to her sternum. “Christ, Agatha. I can feel you clenching on me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles as she bites her bottom lip mischievously, and she begins to rock her hips. “You’ve got such dykey hands.”</p><p> </p><p>Something deep in Rio’s florid chest rumbles as she sticks out her thumb for Agatha to grind her clit against, and the breath leaves Agatha’s lungs as the tip pushes against such a sensitive part of her. She feels her cunt grow even wetter and she feels her heart constrict as if it can directly feel the blood vessels Rio is putting pressure on. Her core works to gyrate her hips faster and her hand instinctively makes its way to flatten against Rio’s torso before sliding up and settling her fingers around Rio’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio wheezes, and her fingers curl. Agatha feels a jolt race up her spine until it smashes into her brain like one of those hammer strength testing games at an amusement park. “C’mere,” Rio pleads, and Agatha rests on an elbow to position her body closer to Rio’s, their bodies practically molded into each other in seconds as Agatha pants into Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes her free hand to hold Agatha up by the ribs and, even with Agatha’s grip on her throat, is able to stretch her neck and capture a nipple in her mouth. Agatha’s back arches into Rio’s wet touch, which in turn makes her grinding on Rio’s fingers feel that much better. She feels Rio’s wrist start to work under her as the older woman starts to twist her fingers in a way that has stars forming behind Agatha’s eyes; she rolls them back in pleasure so raw it’s bleeding.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me hear you,” Rio murmurs against her breasts, her voice strained from being choked. “Wanna hear you come for me. S’my favorite sound.”</p><p> </p><p>The stars in Agatha’s sight explode into radioactive supernovas as she feels herself clench hard around Rio’s fingers. By the way Rio is moaning, she might as well be cutting off their circulation. Her orgasm slams into her and she collapses onto Rio. Rio pushes Agatha’s head against the crook of her neck as Agatha slowly bounces on Rio’s fingers, riding herself out long and blissful. </p><p> </p><p>In that moment Agatha thinks of the dream she’d had a few nights before this one: where she was on her knees, hand gripped and pumping Rio. She moans into Rio’s ear, “I wanna suck your cock.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking Christ!” Rio’s body seizes up in shock and her fingers shoot up deeper into Agatha, who mewls at the sensation.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha breathlessly laughs as she rides the last remnants of her climax. “If that’s how you react when I tell you, I can’t wait to see how you are when your dick’s actually in my mouth.” She steadies herself by putting a flat hand on Rio’s torso. “Let me get off of you. Suck my come off your fingers.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio eagerly nods; from what Agatha has learned about her, that was probably the older woman’s original plan, anyway. Agatha stays straddling Rio as Rio inserts her own fingers into her mouth and obediently clean them; Agatha takes that time to run her nails over Rio’s stomach and the soft skin of her mons and upper thighs. Rio shudders at the touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t wait to see that hard cock standing between your legs,” Agatha whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me put it on,” Rio says.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches with big, hooded eyes as Rio gets out of the bed and stretches like a cat who’d just woken up from a nap, clasping her hands behind her back and tugging. It must feel good in her muscles, because she grunts, and Agatha shamelessly leers at the shape of Rio’s breasts and toned stomach. When Rio catches her eye and smirks, Agatha can’t help but get up and wrap herself around Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is trying to put the straps of the harness around her thighs. When she’s done, the straps dig into the fleshy muscle, making it look like her thighs are threatening to spill out. Agatha hums, very content at the image, and moves her hand up from Rio’s stomach to cup one of her breasts and roll a nipple between her fingers. Her other hand cups Rio’s sex and starts to play with the hair down there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio jumps, her head tipping back and her hips bucking into Agatha’s touch. She gasps out a, “Baby!”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha asks innocently. She takes the nipple out from between her fingers, but she still flicks it up and down: light a light switch. “Get your dick for me, daddy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands are shaking as she turns to grab the cock from the chest of drawers, and Agatha is hanging on her even as she moves around as if she’s a monkey hanging off a branch. Which, with the way Rio’s biceps bulge to intrinsically keep Agatha balanced as she puts her weight on Rio, she might as well be.</p><p> </p><p>Mmm. Agatha buys into her impulsive behavior and bites Rio hard on the neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah!” Rio drops her cock. “Fuck, now I have to bend down.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me make it easier for you.” Agatha hops up and catches a hold on Rio’s waist with her legs so that she’s officially piggyback. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how this makes it easier for me,” Rio deadpans.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, and then realizing Rio can’t exactly see it, gives her a light kiss on where she’d just bitten her throat. Yeah, that’s gonna bruise. “I centralized my weight for you. Duh.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna have to squat instead of bend over,” Rio explains.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chirps, “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>There are two things Agatha is thinking about as Rio slowly bends her knees down to pick up the dildo. One, she is very strong, and Agatha is very attracted to her. Two…</p><p> </p><p>“It’s purple,” Agatha notes.</p><p> </p><p>She can see Rio’s side profile biting her lip as Rio replies with, “I, uh, got it for you, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Now remembering the messages, Agatha’s hold on Rio goes slack. She slides down, Rio regaining her couple of inches on Agatha as she stands back up fully. Agatha says, “Really?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice sounds like she hasn’t had water in weeks when she answers. “Yeah. It’s… seven and a half. Figured you’d like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth feels like cotton when she rips the dildo from Rio’s hand and orders, “Get on the bed. Sit. On the edge.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grinning as she stumbles back onto her bed. Agatha kneels so that she’s sitting between Rio’s spread legs. She turns the dildo in her hand and sees the bottom part of the suction empty. Playfully pouting, she looks up at Rio through her lashes and says, “You said my name would be on it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can make that happen,” Rio answers breathily. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles as she bends the silicone to slip it snugly through the O-ring. “You would do anything I asked you to, hmm? Oh, you like it when a pretty girl tells you what to do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio can barely answer vocally, so she just moans and nods. When her head turns away, Agatha snaps, “Don’t look away from me,” so that Rio’s warm and sun-cooked brown eyes can stare at her and make Agatha the center of Rio’s thoughts again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha starts stroking the cock and grins as she notices Rio white-knuckling the sheets. She lines the cock so that the base of it is at her chin, the tip brushing the bridge of her nose. “How far down my throat do you think this would go?” When Rio’s hips have a mind of their own and jolt up at Agatha’s words, she just grins. She tenderly grips Rio’s wrist and drags it towards her; of course, Rio’s body is pliant and willing to do what Agatha molds it to. Agatha then helps Rio’s fingers until they’re cradling her throat, Rio’s thumb hovering over her larynx. She’s probably able to feel the movement as Agatha says, “Here. You can help me measure.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hears the stutter in Rio’s lungs as she gathers saliva in her mouth and licks from the base of the cock to the tip before slowly swallowing it inch by inch. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio croaks. “I can feel it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm.” Agatha lets out an unnecessary gag as she fits another inch of the dick in her mouth. Rio whimpers, and her hand skirts around to a more comfortable position to grip the hair at the crown of Agatha’s head. Agatha dramatically bobs her head up and down, moaning as Rio instinctively pushes to get Agatha to go deeper. It takes a few tries, but soon Agatha is sputtering with Rio’s entire dick in her throat and her nose brushing the curls on Rio’s pubic mound.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so fucking good with my cock in your mouth,” Rio babbles.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Agatha traces her fingers around the dimples of Rio’s muscular thigh before soft flicking her thumb over Rio’s swollen, slippery clit.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cries out at the touch. “I… I’m not gonna last long.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly brings her head up, a trail of thick spit and mucus following her as she empties her mouth. She replaces her lips with her other hand, jacking Rio off. Her voice is gravel-like when she teases, “What, I just have to pump your dick a few times and you bust all over? Poor Daddy, so sensitive…” A lightbulb. “Do me a favor, handsome?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, barely enough to be noticeable, but Agatha catches it.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold your cock, baby.” Per Agatha’s instructions, Rio grasps her cock as Agatha continues to rub slow, loose circles on her clit. “Point it here.” Agatha directs Rio’s wrist until the tip of the dildo is pointed right at her sternum. When she uses her other hand to cradle her breasts and push them up. “C’mon.” Agatha’s voice is ravenous. “Come on my tits.”</p><p> </p><p>“Holy fuck.” Rio starts pumping her dick, Agatha’s spit working enough to give her some mobility.  Agatha puffs out her chest and gathers the copious amount of wetness seeping from Rio’s cunt to deliver faster, tighter circles to her clit. She notices the muscles in Rio’s jaw tense when she does so. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on me, Daddy.” Agatha puts a little whine in her words. “Make a mess on me.”</p><p> </p><p>A wet and broken moan spills from Rio’s throat as her eyes squeeze shut.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Agatha snaps, “Don’t stop looking at me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets to see the tears well up in Rio’s eyes as she orgasms. Rio’s hips stutter over Agatha’s exposed tits and Agatha continues to frantically rub Rio off until Rio is shoving her hand away. Agatha takes that as a sign to pop her fingers in her mouth and straddle Rio on the edge of the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re like a fucking succubus,” Rio sighs, cupping Agatha’s face and kissing her. Both of them have bodily fluids sticking to their fingers and dripping down their chins. Before Agatha realizes what she's doing, she’s grinding just next to Rio’s cock, which has bent due to Agatha’s closeness with the tip between both of their stomachs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel Rio smile into their kiss as she says, “Sucking me off got you all hot and bothered?” Agatha moans as Rio brings her hands down to cup Agatha’s ass, but then her moan is quickly swallowed up by Rio’s. “Jesus, you’ve got an amazing ass.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus isn’t in the room right now,” Agatha murmurs against Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Smart ass,” Rio mutters.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Hot </em> ass, yes? You were just saying so?” Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s shoulders, arching her back out just a little so Rio gets a better grip on her ass cheeks. She’s gripping so hard she’s inadvertently spreading them. “You know, you never cleaned your mess up.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows knit together, and then she realizes Agatha is talking about the “mess” Rio made on her chest. “Let me get that squared away then,” she husks, and licks a path down Agatha’s sternum until she’s able to close a nipple into her mouth. Agatha’s hand combs upward in Rio’s head as her thighs instinctively try to squeeze: though in their position, it just makes it look like she’s squirming. </p><p> </p><p>One of Rio’s hands cradles her ribcage as she laps up the sweat around Agatha’s breast and nibbles at Agatha’s pebbled nipple with the tips of her teeth. She keeps going back and forth between the left and right, as if they’re so both enticing that she's unable to stick to her choice. Her hand rests on the same side as Agatha’s heart. Agatha prays her heart isn’t beating so hard and fast that Rio can feel it under her fingertips. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t tell if you’re an ass or tits kinda guy,” Agatha jokes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rips her mouth from Agatha’s skin just long enough to pant out, “‘M an Agatha kinda guy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls at Rio’s hair until the older woman obliges and looks up at her. “I am <em> so </em> fucking empty,” she growls.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes shine and she grins. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you thinking, handsome?” Agatha undulates her hips. “Reverse cowgirl?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hell no,” Rio says, which momentarily surprises Agatha. “You’re getting on your back so I can look you in the eye as I split your pretty pussy open.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her face warm, but she huffs, “And how do you expect me to get on my back, hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>“Quite easily, actually.” Rio stands up as if there’s not a fully grown woman making home on her lap— Agatha embarrassingly squeals as Rio grabs her by the waist and turns around to toss her on the bed, immediately climbing on top of her so she’s unable to get up without a fight.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a reminder to Agatha that when Rio is putty in her hands, it’s all mental. It’s Rio willingly submitting to what Agatha has in mind for her. That thought has her cunt clenching in desperation.</p><p> </p><p>“I should have you bench press me with a cock on so you can fuck me while doing so,” Agatha ponders dazedly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes grow wide as saucers as she blushes. “O-One thing at a time, babe.” She then swipes a pillow from the head of the bed and gets Agatha to lift herself enough to rest her hips on it. Her entire body is under the watchful eye of Rio in a way that it hadn’t been before; Rio is staring at her like she’s got an eidetic memory and wants to mentally file away every inch of her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Rio whispers, her hand settling on either side of Agatha’s torso.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply scoffs, glancing over at Rio’s cherry wood dresser because it’s easier than staring into Rio’s genuine eyes for any longer. “I know.”</p><p> </p><p>“But do you?” Agatha feels Rio’s hands skirt up her ribcage until her thumbs simultaneously brush each of her nipples. Agatha shudders out a sigh and lets her body lean into the caring touch. “I think you’re the most stunning woman I’ve laid eyes on.”</p><p> </p><p>“You think?” Agatha can’t help but tease, and that’s when one of Rio’s hands cups her jaw, squishing Agatha’s cheeks as her neck is forced to turn her head and stare at Rio again. </p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t been able to get you out of my mind since I saw that picture of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Notching another arrow from her arsenal, Agatha says, “The one with my tits?” Even with Rio’s fingers encasing her mouth, Agatha is able to form the words and make them mostly coherent.</p><p> </p><p>“The one with your eyes,” is Rio’s response, and it's like Agatha’s chest is so heavy it’s an anchor pulling her into unknown ocean depths. It’s like Rio is actually reaching into her chest and squeezing her bloody heart, wringing her for every emotion she’s worth. Maybe she’s just having a heart attack.</p><p> </p><p>“You have such a way with wo-<em>ords</em>!” Agatha’s last syllable raises in pitch and volume as Rio’s hand starts innocently exploring the folds of her sensitive cunt. Her eyes snap shut as her hips shamelessly chase the sensation. </p><p> </p><p>“My pretty girl,” Rio murmurs. Her fingers aren’t going in any particular pattern or at any particular speed. She’s just exploring Agatha for curiosity’s sake, for the love of knowledge and her body. Which is frustrating. When Agatha’s lips emit a little whimper and her hips buck up in an attempt to get Rio to use a little more force, she can hear the smirk in Rio’s tone as the older woman says, “Oh, sweetheart, I’ve got you.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s not fair. It’s not as fun when Rio doesn’t just do what she <em> knows </em> Agatha wants. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s fingers tease at her entrance, Agatha’s eyes open and she gasps needily. Rio hums. “I have to prepare you for Daddy’s big cock, don’t I?”</p><p> </p><p>And when Rio inserts her pointer and middle inside, Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head. But the rhythm is the pace of a snail at the post office. It’s that one fucking sloth from Zootopia. It’s driving Agatha mad. </p><p> </p><p>“Go faster,” she barks, but Rio doesn’t take the bait. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just prepping you, princess.” Rio’s fingers slowly drag across Agatha’s g-spot with every pump; her fingertips don’t even hit her cervix hard enough for it to be considered a bump— it’s a kiss, practically, when Agatha needs to be pummeled.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio pushes another finger into Agatha, she grits her teeth and her hand flies out and pulls Rio by the hair that creates her hairline and spits out, “Rio Vidal, if you do not take your teasing fingers out of my pussy and replace them with your throbbing cock, I am going to find something to tie you down with and ride you until you pass out. Do not fucking test me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw slackens at Agatha’s harsh words. Agatha blushes, only wondering for a split second if she’s gone too far when she looks into Rio’s blown eyes that might as well have cartoon hearts nailed into them. Agatha’s breath hitches as Rio takes her fingers out, sucking them into her mouth for just a few seconds— as if she knew what Agatha needed and how she needed it now, but she couldn’t help herself at another taste. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoots up so that Agatha can feel Rio’s knees hitting the back of her thighs. Rio took her hands and groped the underside of Agatha’s thighs before pushing her knees back until they essentially hugged her chest. Agatha feels the cool air hit her cunt as it becomes more exposed; she whines loudly when she tries to thrust her hips up into where she knows the dildo is resting between Rio’s legs… and finds herself unable to. It’s what Agatha considers the catch-22 of this position. Rio has to do all the work, which is very nice, but Agatha has to hand control to Rio and let her choose the pace, the depth, and the contortions of Agatha’s body.</p><p> </p><p>Even when Rio takes one hand off to line her cock up, she slides her other hand perpendicular to Agatha’s thighs so that she can still cover her territory. Agatha finds it infuriating but also insanely attractive that even with a true effort of squirming, Rio can still hold her off one-handedly.</p><p> </p><p>But her kegel muscles are contracting, begging to be stretched and filled, and Agatha complains, “Hurry up.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes simply bore into her like they’re carving into her soul. “You want this dick or not?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels unshed tears starting to prick at her eyes, and she grits her teeth. Her mind is too clouded and horny to properly think of a comeback, so she says what she thinks will captivate Rio’s sympathies the most. She sprinkles a hefty mix of whine in her words. “Please, Daddy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels like her grin could split open her face when Rio’s eyes soften at the plea. Her lips transform into an ‘O’ shape when she feels the head of Rio’s cock swiping through her folds. “Oh, baby doll, I’ve got you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha the keens as she feels the tip enter her. She’s hungry, her hands scrambling and finding some sort of sheets to white-knuckle as Rio keeps her torturous speed, inserting herself inch by inch. Atom by atom, it felt like. She practically gurgles out her moan when Rio fucking finally bottoms out, her entire length nestled inside Agatha’s twitching pussy. </p><p> </p><p>“So warm and wet for me.” Rio is astonished, the kind of feeling one gets when looking at a clear night sky. “Fuck, I swear I can feel you milking me.”</p><p> </p><p>Impatience finally claws its way out of Agatha’s throat when she screams, “Fucking <em> hell</em>, Rio, <em> fuck me</em>!” She doesn’t even care how desperate she must sound. </p><p> </p><p>That’s when Rio takes both of her hands and slides them up until they’re practically cradling the back of Agatha’s knees. She pushes them impossibly more into Agatha’s torso, folding her like a pretzel when she leans forward and almost completely exits her cock out of Agatha. Agatha has no time to comprehend it and voice her complaint before Rio is slamming her hips back into Agatha, and Agatha feels her body burning as it has to suddenly stretch to the large girth and length again. Agatha screeches, her voice curdling with a sort of pleasurable pain. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her body shake in ecstasy but also with the force Rio is fucking her at. She can barely hear the headboard knocking against the bedroom wall, only the squelch of her wet cunt and her broken cries as Rio harshly pummels into her.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this what you wanted?” Rio growls out. “Daddy’s cock slamming into you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, fuck, <em> fuck</em>.” Agatha can’t move her body much to follow along with Rio’s, but Rio is probably giving it her all as her hips snap to satisfy Agatha. The sensational rollercoaster of being repeatedly filled and almost empty has Agatha overwhelmed in the best way possible; her head is clouded with lust and the impending orgasm she knows is going to shake her. She moans, “You really bought this cock just for me, Daddy? It’s all mine?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunts. “Yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to gulp in air to keep her lungs from practically shrivelling up like two little raisins and falling off. She notices a bead of sweat trickling down Rio’s forehead from exertion and concentration. That’s nice. “You want me to say my pussy is yours?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha dazedly, the look in her eye so hungry it looks almost feral. It’s admittedly intimate for dirty talk for their first fuck. But Rio says, “Yes,” anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just grins and remarks, “You keep fucking me like this and maybe I’ll think about it next time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can see Rio bare and gnash her teeth as her pace changes strategy; short, quick fucks that hit Agatha deep. She whimpers, her head tilting to the size and her eyes snapping shut as the tip of Rio’s cock starts to deliciously punch her cervix with every thrust. Agatha’s hand naturally goes to start rubbing her aching clit, looking for a multi-layered release, when Rio’s eagle eyes notice and grab her wrist about two rotations in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a long, drawn-out whine when her hand is replaced with Rio’s, and she hears Rio say, “Let me do it for you. You just lay there and look pretty, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her bottom lip until it hurts, and she preens under what she knows is Rio’s watchful gaze. Finally, someone who gets it. “Can’t believe you bought this cock all for me, Daddy,” she babbles. “Feels so fucking good. S’like my pussy was molded to fit the shape of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio growls, “You should have no problem squirting on it for me, then,” and practically peels back the hood of Agatha’s clit to start flicking it harshly. A guttural scream rips out of Agatha’s throat and it makes her mouth taste like iron. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries calling out <em> Daddy, daddy, daddy </em> as her thighs start burning and trembling, wanting to sound sexy, but instead she sobs, “Rio, fuck, Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t slow down. She says, “Didn’t squirt yet. I’m fucking you until I need to change the bedsheets.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha feels like her cunt is stuffed to the brim. It aches in the best way. Every snap of Rio’s hips has her reach another hill on the ride of her climax, and she’s too preoccupied diving headfirst into the sensation to control the whimpers and heady gasps she’s making. By the way Rio starts grunting into her thrusts, Agatha can tell she must like it. Her mouth is somehow dry but a thin line of drool escapes from the corner of her mouth. She takes her nails and rakes them down Rio’s back; she can’t tell how hard she did it because she’s overwhelmed by just about everything else, but by Rio’s wanton moan, the little pain slut must like it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t tell if a minute or ten minutes pass when she cries, “I’m gonna come again.” Her orgasm has barely petered out with the way Rio has guided her through it. Agatha feels pressure build up just under her stomach and she knows what’s coming, has had it happen enough to her. She grits her teeth and growls as she gushes onto Rio’s cock for her next climax, but her mouth opens up and lets out a sharp scream when Rio takes Agatha’s clit between her fingers and starts pinching.</p><p> </p><p>“There you go, good girl,” Rio coos, gasping. “So pretty coming for me, princess.”</p><p> </p><p>It takes at least a couple of minutes for Agatha to come down from her high. When she does, she notices Rio is also trembling as she slides out of Agatha. Agatha whimpers at the emptiness, but she realizes that Rio is gingerly moving her thighs like she’s sensitive. It’s when she remembers Rio had explicitly told her in their messages that she can’t exactly get fully off with the harness grinding up against her clit.</p><p> </p><p>“Aww,” Agatha says in a soothing tone, though her words are anything but, “did Daddy edge herself?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flick up to meet Agatha’s. They’re watery-soft like the brown of a newborn calf. </p><p> </p><p>“Take the strap off,” Agatha orders. “Come here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio loosens the straps of the harness just enough to shimmy it off while still poised on top of Agatha. When Agatha’s fingers loosely tangle themselves in the thickness of Rio’s happy trail and pubic hair, Rio hisses in a gasp. When Agatha’s middle finger extends and dips a little, grazing Rio’s clit, the older woman lets out a sob.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, baby,” Agatha croons. “Come here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio straddles Agatha in a similar position she had been in before, though this time her legs bracket Agatha’s so Agatha has enough room to slide her fingers around Rio’s dripping cunt. Rio places her hands right above Agatha’s shoulders on either side of her neck. Her hair frames her face and it tickles Agatha’s cheeks. Agatha adds her ring finger and starts making small, vertical motions, and Rio practically gurgles, her eyes rolling before she squeezes them shut.</p><p> </p><p>“So handsome for me, Daddy.” Agatha’s free hand moves to cup Rio’s face, her thumb tracing Rio’s bottom lip. “Gonna hump into my hand until you come?” She laughs. “Knowing you, I bet it’ll take just a few seconds.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio says her name in a brokenly and wantonly manner. Agatha wants to trap it and keep it as a pet. Rio’s hips begin to gyrate as if Agatha had given her permission to move them. Agatha’s prediction is correct and Rio gnashes her teeth in an almost-snarl as her orgasm rips through her like a fierce tidal wave.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” she croaks out, and it sounds like she wants to be done. However, Agatha isn’t done.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you give me one more, Daddy?” she asks, putting on her best saccharine tone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open and she looks at Agatha desperately. “<em>Agatha</em>, I—”</p><p> </p><p>“Please?” Agatha juts out her bottom lip. “For me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio caves, her shoulders trembling as she nods.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decides to be nice. She collects some of Rio’s wetness from between her lips— and fuck, she is <em> soaking </em>— and then she rubs fast and tight circles. Rio yelps as Agatha soothes her. “I knew you could do it. So strong for me. You look so good like this, Daddy, wet and shaking in my hands.”</p><p> </p><p>A tear slips out of Rio’s eye. As Agatha continues to curl her fingers and meanly dig into Rio’s abused clitoris, Rio becomes overwhelmed as she lets some of the weight off of her hands and roughly grips Agatha’s hair, digging her nose into the crook of Agatha’s neck. Doing so means some of Rio’s weight has been placed on Agatha, but it’s nothing she can’t handle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nibbles on the earlobe Rio has so kindly offered her and whispers, “You’ve got it. That’s it. What a good boy.”</p><p> </p><p>That does it— Rio crumples and grunts like she’s straining, her body wringing out the last drop of energy it has to give her this climax. It’s music to Agatha’s ears. She can feel Rio’s hot, whimpering breath on her neck. She doesn’t quite squirt, but Agatha does feel a small gush of wetness leave Rio’s cunt and spill onto her fingers. She gathers it, curling her fingers one last time and trying to be mindful not to touch Rio in her most sensitive places.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s knees buckle as she flips over onto her back beside Agatha. “I think I’m gonna pass out,” she says breathlessly. Agatha just chuckles, humming as she takes the wetness she’d collected just moments earlier and sucks it off her fingers, tongue curling around the digits to relish in the salty tang. Rio’s eyes flick to the movement, and Agatha watches her pupils dilate as she realizes what Agatha’s doing.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re insatiable,” Rio jokes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pops her fingers out of her mouth. “Is there something wrong with that?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio wraps an arm around Agatha and places a kiss to her temple, and then takes a whiff. “Mmm. You smell good.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes good-naturedly. “I smell like sweat and sex.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that’s what I said.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha notices the ceiling fan is on, cooling her skin. Rio is nice and warm, so she snuggles deeper into the other woman. She scratches at Rio’s head; Rio adorably responds by sighing contently. Agatha learns that Rio especially likes her nails on the shorter parts of her undercut.</p><p> </p><p>She barely notices she closes her eyes until she’s startled awake from her dreamless nap and realizes she’s alone. A spike of fear pokes her gut until logic curls around her brain: <em> You’re in her fucking house, stupid, she’s not gonna be gone. </em>Agatha sits up, cracking her neck. Her legs are deliciously sore. </p><p> </p><p>The door to the bedroom swings open and Rio walks in. She’s wearing nothing but a pair of boxers with dinosaurs on them. “Oh, hey, you’re awake. I checked on Sashimi. She’s doing fine.” Rio holds up a water bottle: reusable, of course. “I also got you this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs it and takes a few sips. “How long was I out?” She tries not to sound too embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>“About an hour,” Rio says. “Also, when you get up, you should go pee.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha makes a slight noise of complaint. </p><p> </p><p>“That wasn’t a suggestion.” Rio’s voice gets stern; well, as stern as a teddy bear could get. “Go to the bathroom. I’ll drag you out of bed if I have to.”</p><p> </p><p>Wrong choice of words. Agatha sets the water bottle on the nightstand before starfishing on her back. “I’m good where I am, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio growls playfully as she grabs Agatha’s ankles and pulls her to the edge. Shocked, Agatha shrieks, trying to grab hold of the bed sheets to slow her momentum, but Rio is too quick. The older woman leans over slightly, and Agatha, only human, looks down at Rio’s breasts.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warns, like she knows exactly what Agatha is thinking. “I take sexual health very seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do I get out of it?” Agatha pouts.</p><p> </p><p>“Not having a UTI.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, not satisfied with that answer. “I want a cigarette.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs. “I have those.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quirks an eyebrow. “Really? You seem kinda too hippie for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! I’m allowed my vices.” Rio offers her hand to Agatha. Agatha has to be careful standing, making sure her legs are fine enough to hold; thankfully, they are. Rio points. “Bathroom is just outside to the left.” </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha gets up and takes her time stretching, even allowing a little squeak to escape her chest as her body relaxes its muscles. She lets it happen simply because when she opens her eyes she sees Rio staring at her like her body has answers that have had questions for centuries: alchemists looking to turn lead into gold type shit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pads up to Rio and swipes at the older woman’s bottom lip with her thumb. “You’re gonna catch flies.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Rio looks back up at Agatha’s eyes like she genuinely hadn’t heard what Agatha had just said. Agatha just chuckles and walks past Rio. When she feels a pinch on her ass, she yelps and whips her head around to glare at Rio, who just blinks at her innocently as if to say <em> Who, me? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha rushes because she can feel the pull of nicotine getting closer and closer. Rio’s soap smells like pomegranates. </p><p> </p><p>When she’s done, Agatha finds Rio in the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“Ciggy time,” she announces.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks Agatha up and down. “I mean, I have a screened in porch, but do you want to go out like that?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dramatically huffs. “You don’t want to see me naked?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes. “I didn’t say that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns her head to look right into Rio’s genuine brown eyes. Her rabbit heart picks up pace to the detriment of her brain— she can’t help it if the shade of Rio’s irises spark a wire in Agatha’s brain as if she was looking into the pouting expression of a puppy.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what kind?” is what Agatha asks instead of leaning into her soft thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Reds.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wets her lips in relief. “Thank fucking god. You have taste.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulls Agatha in just enough that her lips can press the hairline just behind her ear. Agatha feels a chill creep up her spine at the feather-light touch. Rio whispers, “Of course I have taste. I’m into you, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles at that, but she wipes her memory of the sound it makes as soon as it leaves her mouth, too afraid that it sounds more like a schoolgirl giggle. “Well, I want it now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gimme a sec.” Rio straightens up, and something in her back cracks and she groans. “Ugh. I’m old.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t call it that.” When Rio’s eyebrow quirks, Agatha just grins. “I’d say vintage.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just shakes her head and exhales in a laugh. “C’mon, sweetheart, just follow me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows Rio past the living room into the kitchen, which has a lot of knick knacks. If Agatha looks closely, she realizes the vast majority of them are some sort of amphibian or reptile: frog, salamanders, turtles, snakes. Eugh on that last one.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around to look at Agatha. She’d made a horrible Orpheus, Agatha notes. She’s looking into Agatha’s eyes like she’s searching for something. And then she blurts out, “I just have to be really honest or I’ll be thinking about it the whole time. I already kind of have. This isn’t just a sex thing to you, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s posture softens as her hand turns to cup Rio’s jaw. “No.” The only reason she’s even admitting it is because she knows how Rio feels. Agatha may have been voted the most emotionally constipated by her college dorm hall (Rude! Agatha knows what her feelings mean, she just actively chooses to ignore them.) but even a blindfolded badger digging holes in Saskatchewan would be able to see Rio was emotionally invested in what they had. So Agatha lays her cards bare in return. Rio better know what the fuck that meant, that’s for sure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lights up like a Rockefeller Christmas tree. “Oh, thank god.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply responds by placing an uncharacteristically chaste kiss on the corner of Rio’s mouth. “Cigaratte, pretty please.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anything my lady wishes.” Rio starts to head towards the sliding door, and then she pauses. “Well, except something like grand larceny. Or murder. You’re too pretty to be a prison girlfriend, sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Ooh, use of the ‘G’ word. Agatha hates to admit that she enjoys the world rolling off of Rio’s tongue, especially in reference to her. Well, if it <em> hadn’t </em> been in reference to her, Agatha wouldn’t be the prison girlfriend in the dynamic.</p><p> </p><p>The cicadas outside are screaming like a cacophonic orchestra, which is a load of bullshit considering they live in Massachusetts and not cousinfuck South Carolina, but whatever. What step of global warming finally wipes these fuckers out?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decides that she will simply be glad that there’s wire mesh between her and those red-eyed little monsters.</p><p> </p><p>Other than that, one of the first things Agatha notices is this is the one part of Rio’s house that doesn’t have plants. Probably because, if her presumptions are correct, Rio fancies an occasional smoke out here and would consider that a harmful enough environment for her little green babies.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must have swiped her pack and lighter on the way— Agatha was certainly paying too much attention to her ass in boxers to see when exactly it happened. Watching Rio pick a cigarette from the pack and offer it to Agatha, nestled between two of the fingers that had been inside her not too many shared breaths ago, is admittedly a hot look.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha muses, “You smoke in your underwear often?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs good-naturedly at that. “No, not really. But I figured if you were going to come out here in even less, I might as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is a first for me, too.” Agatha snatches the cigarette from Rio’s hands and preens when Rio knows her job is to light it next. She smirks. “So… you gonna ask me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio has the clueless look of a kitten looking in the mirror for the first time. “Ask you what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we both agreed it’s not just a sex thing,” Agatha points out. She offers her cigarette to Rio, who obediently cups her hand around it to light it. Agatha takes her first bittersweet drag. “You gonna ask me or not?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have to be the one to do it?” Rio teases as she lights her own cigarette. “You’re the one who brought it up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Duh. You’re the boy lesbian and I’m the girl lesbian.” Agatha sucks on her teeth. “Lemme hear it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly looks nervous. “Even though… I’m older than you? And a bit of a recluse?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips turn downward. “Sweetheart, do you think I’d be asking you to ask me out if I cared about those things?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio states, and then she rushes out, “Be my girlfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her bottom lip, badly hiding her grin as she nods. She lazily moves her cigarette behind her back so she can crook her finger and Rio can get the message and kiss her. Rio’s hands naturally gravitate towards her bare ass— which answers the question Agatha had brought up earlier, if she’s thinking about it— and Agatha lets Rio lick into her mouth greedily until she realizes if she’s not careful she’s gonna drop her cigarette.</p><p> </p><p>“Figured you don’t want me to litter,” Agatha comments breezily, and by the look in Rio’s eye, she might as well have said she just ordered three hundred dollars of lingerie in Rio’s favorite shade of green. “Ashtray?” Rio holds one up that had been sitting on a side table next to an outdoor couch and Agatha taps her cigarette against it, getting rid of the burnt bits before taking another drag.</p><p> </p><p>“So you’re my girlfriend, and I’m your…” Rio’s face turns pensive.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll call you whatever you want,” Agatha softly fills in for her. “Girlfriend. Partner. Even boyfriend, if that’s your style.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blushes and coughs in her hand at that. “I’ll, uh, think about it. For sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decides to sit down on the couch Rio has. It’s pretty nice; it’s wicker, but it’s got linen cushions. She takes up as much space as she’s allowed— which is as much as she wants, of course— and brings one of her knees up so that her heel digs into the cushion. Her other leg stays on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>She’s very kindly tapping her cigarette in the ashtray on the side table when she notices Rio staring at her. Her own cigarette is idling dangerously: a fat piece of ash is precariously smoldering on its tip. </p><p> </p><p>“Do I have something in my teeth?” Agatha asks cheekily. She can see Rio’s jaw muscles tense. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha spreads her legs just a little further, her body heating up gleefully at the way Rio’s gaze snaps to the movement. She feels something simmering in her belly as she hits another drag on the cigarette in her fingers before taking her other hand and letting it rest on her collarbone for a second before dipping deeper and flicking her thumb over her nipple. She inhales, a sort of lazy gasp, as she starts to fondle her breast.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio groans, as if she’s signing her death certificate.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha’s hand then moves down to her stomach before her fingertips brush over her pubic hair. She allows Rio to watch raptly as she takes to fingers and spreads her lower lips, letting Rio see everything unobstructed.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” This time, her name is a warning, but Agatha has always been known for viewing red flags as the target to aim for.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha takes the tip of her finger and brushes it over her clit, she mewls as her hips jump up to meet her touch. That must be the last straw, because Rio growls and storms over to her, smashing her cigarette out (on the ashtray, still following protocol, of course) and emptying her hands before she grabs Agatha by the hips and pulls her forward so her ass is practically hanging out of the couch. Then, Rio kneels.</p><p> </p><p>“You are so fucking irresistible,” Rio grunts out, replacing Agatha’s hand on her cunt with her own, shamelessly staring at the big of wetness that’s started seeping from Agatha’s hole. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes the foot she’d nestled on the cushion and wraps it around Rio’s shoulder so that her heel is lazily skimming Rio’s back. She takes another drag of nicotine before pointing out, “I’ve got a fag between my lips and another one between my thighs. I’m a lucky girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t bother answering her cleverly crafted quip. Instead, she backs away a little so she can get lower to the ground. Agatha’s hoping her mouth immediately melds to Agatha’s pussy, but Rio decides to take her sweet time, sucking little bruises on the lower pouch of Agatha’s stomach. The nips just ignite Agatha’s molten core further, which then upsets her because Rio isn’t doing anything to satisfy it. No, she somehow needs to plant wet kisses on the fuzz of Agatha’s happy trail like a pirate tracking their route for treasure. X marks the spot, or whatever.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the impatience in her gut bubbling up like curdled milk. She starts to push on the crown of Rio’s head. “Eat me out already!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up, her eyes so wantonly dark they look like they could swallow suns. “Who said I was doing this for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Me,” Agatha says petulantly. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s where you’re wrong, sweetheart.” Rio’s fingers start gingerly brushing the side of Agatha’s labia, and Agatha lets out a shuddering breath she hadn’t even realized she’d been holding. “You might also be getting some pleasure out of this, but I’m doing this because it’s what <em> I </em> want.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a munch,” Agatha bites at her, and Rio just shoots her a wolfish grin before finally dipping her head and nestling her tongue into Agatha’s cunt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curl into Rio’s hair as the older woman’s mouth gets to work. Agatha can barely pay attention to the actual motions Rio is making with her tongue and lips; all she knows is that it feels fucking amazing. Rio takes her thumbs and spreads Agatha out wider so that her tongue can delve in deeper, and it makes Agatha squeal.</p><p> </p><p>Then she realizes she has a problem; when she goes to get a nicotine rush, she realizes her cigarette has burned down to the filter and is pretty much useless. Her vision is clouded with pleasure, but Agatha manages to paw at the side table and snatch the pack of cigarettes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slows down and looks up at the movement above her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha playfully tuts as she slides out another cigarette from the pack. “Don’t worry your pretty little head, Daddy. You keep moving that mouth of yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts giving Agatha’s cunt slow, flat licks. Agatha hums as she grabs the lighter. It’s green with little leaves on it. As she starts to swipe her thumb over the ignition switch and light her cigarette, Rio inserts two fingers inside of her, which causes Agatha to yelp and accidentally bend her wrist in a way that the flame licks close to the knuckle of her thumb.</p><p> </p><p>“You dickhead.” Agatha glares at Rio. She can <em> feel </em> the smirk in Rio’s jaw as she starts flicking out little snake-like licks to Agatha’s clit as well as pumping her fingers slowly. Agatha shudders and, tucking the still unlit cigarette behind her ear, rips Rio from her cunt. There’s a clueless glint in Rio’s eye, but she’s panting in an open smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“You are not in charge,” Agatha snaps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, her stupid tooth gap showing. “Okay.” Like it’s that easy.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha says. “I’ll tie you to the bed and come on my own fingers. Not you, not your toys, just me.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Rio’s smile disappears. Her eyes start to dart around. “Umm, I don’t think—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes her hand out of Rio’s hair, just to cup her jaw harshly enough that her cheeks squeeze together. “Don’t you look away from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes bounce back to Agatha as she whimpers, “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to eat me out until I say so,” Agatha explains. She takes her thumb and swipes Rio’s shimmering bottom lip. She releases her grip from Rio to pop it in her mouth, humming appreciatively at her own taste. “Right, Daddy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Rio bends her head to start again and Agatha presses a finger to her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“Not yet,” she states, and Rio glances at her through hooded lids. “Three fingers.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio overlaps her fingers, tucking the middle one under her pointer and ring finger and her thumb holding her pinky back. She slides into Agatha’s hungry cunt. Agatha leans back and moans, still making sure to keep her eye on Rio; her kegel muscles instinctively push out to allow Rio’s fingers to stretch her. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha swears, “three of your fingers fill me up so much more than three of <em> mine</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes in a shaky whine, restrained as if any loud noise would get her in more trouble. She curls her fingers, rubbing her fingertips against the soft parts of Agatha’s vaginal walls, and Agatha’s mouth drops into an ‘O’ shape.</p><p> </p><p>“You wanna taste me some more?” Agatha asks. At Rio’s eager nod, she continues. “Mouth to my clit, sweetheart.” When Rio follows her instructions, that’s when Agatha allows herself to close her eyes and tilt her head back. “Yes, fuck, just like that.” Rio laps up Agatha’s wetness, even the parts leaking onto her fingers, trying to get every drop Agatha has to offer. Agatha’s hips twitch. “We ate so many things today but I bet this is the best thing you’ve tasted all night.” At Rio’s affirming groan, Agatha continues. “I’ve got such a handsome dyke as a daddy, so good at eating me out. Shit, Rio—” Rio had started sucking on her clit. “Right there, baby, goddamn.”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha comes, she can hear two things: her ears ringing, and Rio noisily slurping her orgasm up like a drop wasted would be a personal offense to her. The woman even slides her fingers out to get her mouth deeper into Agatha’s cunt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thighs are shaking when she says, “God, my legs feel like jelly.” She pushes Rio’s head from her pussy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whines, “No, wait, I wasn’t done. Just one more, princess.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her heart quicken. “You’ll have to carry me to bed,” she admits, her chest heaving.</p><p> </p><p>“You can spend the night.” Rio’s chin is practically dripping. Her nails dig into Agatha’s thighs like she’s afraid Agatha is going to run away from her. Honestly, Agatha isn’t sure that’s fully physically possible right now. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is lucky Agatha considers backing down losing— and also that she’s always been a little into being overstimulated. “Fine,” she agrees, and Rio dives in like Agatha had said the magic word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue flattens and laps up a thick stripe on her cunt and they both moan at the sensation. Agatha figures out that this time, Rio is eating her to savor; she’s suckling on Agatha’s labia, dipping her tongue into Agatha’s entrance, and purposefully avoiding her clit. And she’s very much not sticking her fingers inside Agatha and curling them in a way that makes Agatha wanna walk towards the metaphorical light. Soon, the nonproductive attitude of Rio’s movements has Agatha’s composure wearing thin, and her hips try to grind into Rio’s face, chasing any amount of pressure.</p><p> </p><p>“Hurry up,” Agatha whines. </p><p> </p><p>Rio languidly detaches her mouth, looking up at Agatha through hooded eyes. “But you said this is the last one. I want to take my time.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re edging me,” Agatha snaps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs under her breath, and she slides her thumbs up to rub circles in the dimples of Agatha’s thighs. “Poor baby, so impatient.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkle. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>It’s as if she’s waiting for something. Agatha huffs. “You’re not gonna get me to beg.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart, you don’t have to.” Rio’s thumbs move to Agatha’s outer labia and spread her open, a book begging to be read. “I can see you clenching. Your pussy does the begging for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you don’t put your mouth back on me on about five seconds, I swear I’m gonna—”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to threaten, baby,” Rio murmurs before returning to Agatha’s weeping cunt, and Agatha’s shoulders slump in relief. She hasn’t forgiven Rio for her misbehaving, though. Rio is still keeping the pace of molasses when it comes to tonguing her, so Agatha is able to fairly nimbly light another cigarette in the meantime.</p><p> </p><p>“Daddy. I’m close.” It’s not that she has to insert any fake whining, per se— it’s more so she allows herself to pepper a little bit of real desperation in to get Rio’s attention. When Rio finally fucking gets the message and her lips wrap around Agatha’s neglected clit, Agatha hisses out, “Yesss.”</p><p> </p><p>She has to time it correctly. She can feel her orgasm building, and Agatha doesn’t like admitting it, but Rio bringing her up slowly and steadily means it’s going to be a nice and big one. Agatha keeps in tune with her body, and right when she knows she’s about to come, she grins wickedly and stabs the lit cigarette into Rio’s bare shoulder, effectively snuffing it out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wails and her teeth come out as she actually <em> bites </em> Agatha’s cunt at the shock. When her teeth scrape Agatha’s clit, Agatha feels an enormous amount of pressure burst from her body. She can hear herself gush into Rio’s waiting and whimpering mouth, and she drops the now-crushed cigarette as she cradles Rio’s head. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio removes herself from Agatha’s cunt this time, there’s a wet suctioning sound. Rio pants against Agatha’s thighs, taking a moment to catch her breath before giving kitten licks to her inner thighs to clean them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shudders. “Baby.” It’s as if every nerve in her body has been fried. She feels loopy, and a bit of post-nut clarity has her feeling a bit guilty for the ‘using Rio as a human ashtray’ bit. “Umm, was that too—”</p><p> </p><p>“It was really fucking hot.” Rio’s voice is rough. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles. “You really like being toyed around with like that, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks her in the eye. “If a woman is pretty enough, yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha haughtily crows, “<em>A woman?</em>” but Rio simply rolls her eyes as she licks more stickiness off around Agatha’s pussy, though one particular moment close to her inner labia has Agatha whimpering, her body still sensitive. Rio just murmurs, “I’m sorry, baby, I’m done.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses up Agatha’s body— her tummy, her breasts, and then up to Agatha’s sweaty neck, though Agatha is still able to watch Rio discreetly put Agatha’s last cigarette in the ashtray.</p><p> </p><p>“I noticed that,” Agatha teases. Rio just hums and backs up a little so that she can look into Agatha’s eyes for a few seconds. It’s in that moment that Agatha notices Rio has little gold flecks swimming in brown. When Rio leans down, Agatha cranes her neck up just a smidge so they can meet in a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not chaste, but it’s nothing crazy. Agatha can taste herself on Rio’s lips. Rio swiftly gives Agatha a few kisses on the cheek before she stands up, hooking one arm under Agatha’s ass and the other slung around her back before lifting her up to carry her bridal style.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrieks in surprise and then covers her mouth. Her “Jesus fuck” is muffled.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you I would,” Rio says smugly. She’s able to open and close the sliding door with her foot, and soon Agatha sighs in relief at the air conditioning and the circulating fan whirring in the bedroom as Rio sets her down. Rio quickly lays down beside her so that they’re facing each other. Agatha notices the red mark on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you feel okay?” Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s all good,” Rio assures her. “Maybe don’t press your finger into it or anything, but I barely feel it. Promise.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Agatha chews on her lip before playfully questioning, “You still okay with me staying the night?” She hopes Rio can’t hear any sort of vulnerability in her words. Curse the way she opens up after really good sex. And it’s been a <em> long </em> time since she’s had sex this mesmerizing, so it’s like trying to hold back the floodgates.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Rio answers plainly. She curls into Agatha, effectively cocooning her as she slings her arm around Agatha’s torso. </p><p> </p><p>“What time is it?” Agatha can feel the sleep creep up in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“A little after one-thirty.” Damn. Agatha distinctly remembers putting her phone on Rio’s front table as she snooped around and it’d been almost nine then. “Why, do you have anything tomorrow? Or, technically later today.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” Agatha says. “Got some reading and papers to grade, but that can all wait a few days.”</p><p> </p><p>“Papers?” Rio repeats. “You teach?”</p><p> </p><p>“For a stipend, yeah.” Agatha sighs dramatically. “My students are so fucking dumb.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm. Smarty pants.” Rio presses her lips to Agatha’s temple. Not to kiss her, but just to enjoy the physical contact.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you…” Agatha takes a second to gather her words. “Do you want anything else?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Do you mean—” Rio laughs. “God, no, Agatha, you wore me out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha preens under Rio’s touch and words. “Good.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, my TikTok algorithm tells me sometimes lesbians can have first dates that last <em> days </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles breathlessly. “Is that what you want?”</p><p> </p><p>“Only if you want it.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, yes.” Agatha pauses for dramatic effect, and then says, “I’d like that, too.” When she feels Rio detach from her and sit up, she pouts. “Hey!”</p><p> </p><p>“Just turning off the lamp, baby.” Click. They’re in darkness. Agatha feels Rio’s nose bury into her neck and shamelessly breath in her scent. </p><p> </p><p>It’s about thirty seconds of silence before Rio breaks it with, “Goodnight, Agatha,” but Agatha is already half-asleep and too dream-brained to give a worded response, so she just hums in agreement and succumbs to her slumber, already curious about what the upcoming morning with Rio will bring her. </p><p>
