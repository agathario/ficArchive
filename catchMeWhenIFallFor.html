<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In the aftermath of an embarrassing and highly questionable incident at a university basketball game, Agatha Harkness finds herself drawn, through ridiculous happenstance, into the orbit of point guard and Westview University heartthrob Rio Vidal. At the same time, Rio, a player of the highest order both on and off the court, finds herself falling suddenly head-over-heels for a girl she has only just met.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha gets dragged along to a basketball game by her friends Alice and Wanda, only to find herself quite embarrassed over the results of a "time-honored" (for the last three years) Westview U tradition: the Rio-Vidal-is-Leaving-the-Court Panty Raid.</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">
<em>"And it looks like... OOOH, VIDAL IS DOWN! Vidal is down. Might just be the 15th concussion of the season..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"15 concussions?" Agatha wondered.<br/>
"Isn't that, like, a concussion per player for every player on the roster?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, they mean 15 concussions for <u>Vidal</u>," Alice nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For Vi... How does she have a brain left?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Some say she doesn't," Wanda said, "and that she's actually a super-secret robot cooked up by the government to win at women's college basketball."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha snorted.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please. Your boyfriend's a robot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's just reserved! And British!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shut up!" Alice barked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Looks like they've got Vidal on her feet. Might not be a concussion after... Aaaand that's probably a concussion, sports fans!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The medics had managed to haul the downed point guard back to her feet, only for her to turn and projectile vomit all over one of the other players. Now Vidal was being loaded onto a stretcher, although she was apparently displeased with the idea. Once she was strapped down, the medics began to take her off-court and the announcer roared.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Looks like it's PANTY RAID TIME!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha frowned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Panty raid?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Aw, c'mon, it's a tradition," Wanda said, reaching into her purse.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't recall seeing anything about this in any brochures," Agatha said as a shower of panties rained down from the bleachers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll get you into the spirit yet," Alice said, producing a few pairs of loosely balled-up underpants from her shoulder bag and beginning to lob them onto the court.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">One of the pairs looked very familiar indeed, and Agatha felt dread streak through her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alice!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha watched in horror as her favorite panties—shimmery purple, soft, quite good for lounging around the dorm room in—sailed down, unfurling, and landed right on the face of Rio Vidal, currently indisposed point guard.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">It only took five minutes—after castigating Alice for about fifteen once they were back to the dorm—for Agatha to find out that Rio Vidal had been taken to the university medical center. It took her about two minutes after arriving to bribe Sharon Davis, RN, into letting her in to "visit" Rio—Sharon's nephew Ralph would not have made it through freshman year without Agatha's informal study group.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Knock knock, Rio," Sharon chirped, "you have a visitor!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Slipping into the room, Agatha smiled at Sharon and sidled over to the bed, waiting for the nurse to leave the room before she turned and looked at the patient.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hi, you might have my panties," Agatha said by way of introduction.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm... Sorry?" Rio rasped.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My panties landed on your face. At the game. You were probably unconscious by then, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh! Right, yeah, those are probably with my stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio gestured vaguely toward a small locker at one side of the room. As Agatha turned to hopefully go and retrieve the undergarment, Rio reached out and lightly grabbed her wrist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait. Do I know you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, uh, definitely not. I'm..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I swear I know you, though. Can you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Three fingers of Rio's free hand hand flickered in a "come closer" gesture. Agatha leaned in. Had they bumped into each other around campus at some point, perhaps? Rio reached up to press two fingers to the underside of Agatha's jaw, gently guiding her head to tilt a little left, then a little right.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Yeah, I know where I know you from now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh? Where?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio leaned close, raising an eyebrow and whispered confidentially.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My dreams."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately Agatha felt the heat of shame bloom in her face, and she turned away sharply.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're an asshole," she muttered, pulling away and going back to the effort to collect her underwear.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she crouched down and opened the locker, she heard the distinct sound of sheets rustling, and the soft beeping of the heart rate monitor, which she had only vaguely noticed, suddenly accelerated.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, I didn't mean..." she heard Rio say.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She looked back in time to see that Rio had gotten out of bed and was now wobbling unsteadily, no doubt about to fall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, you shouldn't..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio fell to her knees beside Agatha, who instinctively reached out an arm to steady her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I didn't... I didn't wanna upset you," Rio managed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, you need to get back into the bed, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I was tr-trying to say... To say I think you're really pretty, is all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha struggled to help Rio back up, then guided her back onto the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just stay here, okay? Don't want you getting a 16th concussion."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"15th of the season, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I don't... I didn't get 15 actual concussions. This is, like, number three or four. They just concussion protocol me every time. Actually, the ol' bean's in top shape."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sure it is."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I really am sorry if I made you upset."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, it was..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I'm sorry if you're straight. I didn't... It's mostly not straight girls who throw their panties, so I figured..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My roommate threw my panties, without my knowledge or consent."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, that blows."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am, however, not straight."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio perked up slightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That distinctly does not blow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why don't you lie back down, okay? Really don't want you hurting yourself."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm okay. Just kinda off in a vestibular sense at the moment. And look, I'm really, really sorry, okay? Honestly."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled in spite of herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's fine. Hey, listen, I really shouldn't even be here. Tell you what, I'll leave you a note with my name and my number. You call me when you're free, and we'll arrange for you to drop my panties."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The heart rate monitor accelerated again, and Agatha blushed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean drop my panties <u>off</u>," she amended.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right," Rio nodded vaguely.<br/>
"I knew that."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio checked the note again. The handwriting was neat and a little spiky. Kind of cute, like the girl the note was from.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Holy shit did I just think of her handwriting as cute?'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That must be a lingering effect of the (very minor) concussion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Still, the girl was cute. Or more than cute. Pretty. Hot, even. All that long, wavy dark hair, those blue eyes...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I fuckin' gotta get laid," Rio muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh-oh, someone going through a dry spell?" Jen cackled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed her phone and glared at her roommate.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can it, Kale."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Stepping out into the living room, Rio dialed the number from the note. She kept staring at the note while the phone rang, somehow entranced by the handwriting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Hello?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was so shocked she nearly dropped the phone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, uh, Agatha? Agatha Harkness?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Speaking."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This is Rio Vidal. You know, I was concussed, your panties were on my face..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, right. Hi. I hope you're calling to return my underwear?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, yeah. Of course. So, like, should I... Like do you wanna meet up and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"I'm in Sherwood. Room 310."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Great. Uhm, so I guess I can..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"I'm in right now, if you want to bring them, but I'll be in all evening if you need to drop by later."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be there in, like... Gimme like 30 minutes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Great. See you then."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The call ended abruptly, and Rio looked at her phone, surprised. Damn. This girl was all business. All adorably cute business.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Turning, Rio went back to the room she shared with Jen. She knew, if she was going to get a chance with Agatha Harkness, she would need to dress to impress, and no one on the team was more stylish than Jen.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">She felt like a weirdo, wearing her best impressing-the-alumni outfit to go return some girl's panties, but Jen had gotten that "Holy fuck you're in the shit now" expression when told who the girl was and had steered Rio toward the nice clothes.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you know who Agatha Harkness <u>is</u>?" Jen had hissed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A pretty girl I'd like to, at minimum, make out with?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio did not state that her image of <u>maximum</u> with Agatha somehow already included a neat little house in the suburbs, possibly with a white picket fence and a good-sized yard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was blaming that on the concussion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha's family essentially owns most of the eastern seaboard, <u>and</u> they're almost exclusively Westview alums for, like, a billion generations."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, cool."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Jen's information did not change any of Rio's intentions. It just solidified that the house-in-the-suburbs plan could be a go with a little less effort than she had imagined, at least financially. God, they could probably actually get sort of a place in the country, with plenty of room for Rio to play around with landscaping and for the kids to run absolutely wild.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The kids who Rio was imagining entirely because of the concussion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So now Rio stood outside of 310 Sherwood Hall, wearing her second-best black slacks, white button down, dark green blazer, and the only concession to Rio's personal taste, motorcycle boots.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll leave some of your bad boy rep intact," Jen had said, "in case she goes for that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shifting her shoulders nervously, Rio knocked at the door. She had been in Sherwood a few times, of course, having dated—well, laid—her fair share of girls here, but in the moment, she felt weirdly shivery and nervous. It was like she did not know this place at all. Like she was wholly out of her depth. Stepping back, she scuffed the sole of her left boot lightly against the worn gray carpet.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was still staring down at her boots when a hand reached out and touched her arm. Jerking back to awareness, she realized that the door had opened and Agatha was standing there, watching her with—was that a concerned look?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"H-hi," Rio stammered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hi. How's your head?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, I... I... It..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, so you should probably come inside and sit down a moment."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Agatha was tugging lightly at the sleeve of Rio's blazer, guiding her into the room and leading her to the simple bed against the eastern wall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio wondered what a girl from such a big deal family was doing in a dumpy double like this. Was it choice? Was the Harkness clan perhaps not doing so well as Jen thought?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sit," Agatha said, and pushed Rio down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm good. I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked gorgeous. She was in some old vintage concert t-shirt and what looked to be dark purple velvet track pants and she looked <u>gorgeous</u>. As she leaned down, the shirt, which was hugely oversized, bagged in such a way that Rio could almost see down the neck, could almost see...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you feel sick at all?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh... Wha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nausea? Dizziness? Anything like that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are... Are you pre-med?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh-uh, just had a few concussions as a kid. Now tell me..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't feel sick. I can... I brought your..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio blushed, which had not happened since she was 18 and a friend of her foster mom hugged had really close and told her how big she was getting and all she could remember for ages after was the slight smell of whisky and the press of soft tits against her and...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"...and you seem a little spaced out, frankly. You high or something?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... No. I don't... I mean, like, sometimes I get high but it... But, uhm... I brought..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reaching into her blazer, Rio pulled the panties, neatly folded, out of the inner pocket and held them up, an offering to a goddess.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, thank you!" Agatha rushed, grabbing them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I washed them," Rio said, "just so... So you... I washed them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's so sweet of you," Agatha said, walking down toward the foot of the bed and...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And did she have the word "Naughty" bedazzled on the ass of her pants? If so, Rio hoped that was a promise.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then suddenly, the Naughty disappeared and Rio realized that Agatha had dropped trou and was...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Was changing underwear in front of her, trading a pair of plain white panties, which looked somehow violently sexy, for the purple pair Rio had returned to her. Agatha's ass—oh, and it was a nice one that looked like it would have a good squeeze factor—was briefly on full display. Without thinking, Rio licked her lips and dried her suddenly sweaty palms on the sides of her slacks.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you wanna go somewhere and get a bite to eat?" she rushed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She spoke mainly to hold back a groan as that beautiful ass was hidden behind shimmery purple fabric. Of course, then she had to fight another groan when Agatha, in just the t-shirt and panties, turned to face her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I... I don't eat out a lot. Expensive, ya know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For a while Rio stared at her, half-comprehending, and then things slotted into place.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I could pay. Anywhere you want. I... I wanna make stuff up to you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled at her, and it was such a soft, pretty smile, and Rio wanted to see it every day, wanted to learn how to provoke it, wanted to...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There's nothing to make up for, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Standing, Rio tried to be as serious as possible.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Hurt your feelings in the hospital the other day. You thought... I dunno, I guess you thought I was being shitty when I used that dumb line to tell you how pretty you are and I... I'm really sorry. I want to do something nice for you, just to make it up. Please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Really, there's..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please?" Rio begged, actually falling to her knees.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She usually only did that <u>after</u> a date, and then only occasionally, but this was an exceptional case.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I mean if you really want to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do. I really, really do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Well, I'll... I guess I'll get dressed. But you have to pick the place, and you have to help me decide what to wear."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's mouth went dry.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'd be honored."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the time since their first meeting, Agatha had caught up on <u>all</u> the gossip about Rio Vidal: how she was the best point guard Westview women's basketball had landed in years, how she was a frequent flyer on the injury list but still managed to pull the team through all the time.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was, by all accounts, quite the womanizer, able to get in the pants of nearly any girl with a soft glance and a few words. She was not the love-'em-and-leave-'em type, however, because she had never been heard to mention anything like the word love, even to girls she had bedded multiple times. Also, a date, a <u>proper</u> date, was a rarity. Most girls were lucky if they got taken to the pizza place on campus, hustled at a few games of air hockey, and then taken back for a quick fuck at the apartment Vidal shared with several teammates.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Also, she was studying botany, which no one seemed to think seemed like the field for a meathead jock, but which she allegedly showed great promise in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now, here was Rio, sitting neatly on the edge of Agatha's bed, looking very pulled together in spite of what appeared to be motorcycle boots, helping Agatha pick out something to wear for their...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Date, maybe?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha had the distinct sense they would be going somewhere besides the pizza place. Rio was so dressed up—again, despite the (actually sort of sexy) motorcycle boots—and did not seem dismissive when Agatha started pulling out equally nice outfits.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I think the purple dress is really nice," Rio nodded, "with the tiny little darker flower print? You'd... You'd look really good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You think so?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded slowly, a funny little smile tracing over her lips.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha had to admit, if nothing else, Rio was very, very good-looking. Those big, dark eyes, shiny dark hair, and a soft, well-angled face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Tossing the dress over the end of the bed, Agatha whipped off her shirt and went digging through the little dresser for a bra. When she turned back around, she saw Rio staring, jaw slightly agape.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Never had a girl change clothes in front of you? I find that hard to believe, given the nature of locker rooms."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Uhm... I wasn't... S-sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio turned her face away, and Agatha almost laughed. She had decided to pull her little maneuver on the spur of the moment because...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, because she wanted to show she was not impressed or intimidated by Rio's reputation. Also because she knew that someone like Rio would never be attracted to someone like her anyway. That line at the hospital about seeing her in dreams had clearly been a bit of cruelty on Rio's part, mocking Agatha's appearance. Surely the "In dreams" had been meant to be followed up with "specifically nightmares."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She knew she was ugly. She had heard it every day growing up, and she was smart enough to understand after relatively few repetitions that it was true.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So, she had decided to simply show Rio what was what, just to reinforce that there was nothing good here. Full coyote date material.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Not that Agatha had ever been on a date.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But hey, maybe she had found a soft spot in the player: Rio did seem sorry for the cruel behavior.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Zip me?" she asks, once she's dressed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She felt Rio step behind her, one hand going to her waist while the other slowly slid the zipper up. The whole time, the thumb of the hand at her waist was rubbing slightly, a little up-and-down motion that made her shiver.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All done," Rio said, but her hand was still on Agatha's waist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>De nada, hermosa</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You speak Spanish?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled, and the sound made Agatha shiver again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I guess the name Vidal wasn't a hint?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There it was again, the little flare of cruelty, that need to mock her. Agatha spun on her heel, coming more closely face to face with Rio than she expected.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not stupid," she hissed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I never said you are," Rio said, eyes flicking down for a moment, then back to meet Agatha's gaze.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry. Really. I... Will you still come and have a meal with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, since I'm already dressed..."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">Rio's car was not quite what Agatha expected. It was a solid, older four-door sedan that had clearly seen extensive use, but been well cared for. Somehow, Agatha had thought she would be squired off campus in some flashy sports car with just enough back seat for fucking.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The restaurant they pulled up to was small, but looked nice enough.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hope you like Romanian food," Rio said, followed quickly by, "wait a sec, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha watched Rio rush out of the car, then positively <u>scurry</u> to open her door for her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"M'lady," Rio said, offering her arm.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please don't..." Agatha whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't what?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't make fun of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio frowned, leaning down closer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm not making fun. I promise I'm not."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes you are. All this being courtly, being so nice. What, you have some dumbass bet with your buddies?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, I don't..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know what kind of person you are, Rio Vidal. You're a player and a half, and someone like you would never take a girl out like this unless..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Unless what?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Unless you were mocking her. Making fun of her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How... Why would I make fun of you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha rolled her eyes and turned away, arms crossed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, I... I got close enough to falling for your little gag, okay? Haha, very funny. Would you just take me back to my dorm, please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<u>Please</u> take me back to my dorm, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay. Careful when I close the door, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha pulled a little further into her seat as Rio shut the door and went back to slide behind the wheel.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For what it's worth," Rio muttered, "this isn't some joke or whatever. I really just wanted to do something nice for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"'Cause you visited me. No one usually visits me when I'm in for observation."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I only wanted to get my underwear."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, but you... You were nice. You made sure I didn't hurt myself or something. And you... I dunno. I just wanted to be nice to you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio reached over and gently touched Agatha's shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, will you let me buy you dinner? I... I can go in and order stuff to go and we can eat at your dorm, if you want. Or we can go inside and have a nice meal here. Either way, I'd really like to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You don't have to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to. Please? Just have dinner with me, so maybe I understand how I keep hurting your feelings. Think of it as a lesson you can teach me or something."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">They took the food back to the dorm, and while Rio set it all out on the steamer trunk that Agatha and Alice frequently used as a dining table, Agatha changed into her pajamas. Frankly, after all of this, she was going straight to bed.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Here we go," Rio said, "we got <em>c</em><em>iorbă de praz</em> and <em>frigărui</em> and <em>șarmale</em> and now please explain to me why you think I'm being mean or trying to hurt you or whatever."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I'm not exactly your type, am I?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My type?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, other than being female."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, well, I mean I... I've gone out with a lot of girls. All types. But this... I mean, I don't only hang out with girls if I think they'll let me fuck 'em. I honestly just felt bad about the whole panties thing and trying that dumb line on you at the hospital."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh really? Seriously, someone like you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What do you think you know about me? That I play basketball? That I get laid a lot? That I'm fighting as hard as I can not to fuck everything up because I goddamn don't wanna end up like my family?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio did not raise her voice, but her tone was enough to convey that she was royally pissed off. She shrugged off her blazer and slumped down on the floor beside Agatha's bed, picking at the food.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I don't..." Agatha started</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You know nothing about me," Rio nodded, "except you're, I dunno, above me or somethin'. Just 'cause I'm some dumbass jock doesn't mean I'm a fuckin' asshole. When I tell a girl she's pretty, even if I do it with a stupid pick-up line, I mean it. I'm not... Not trying to be..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You really think I'm pretty?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, yeah. I mean, you got those beautiful blue eyes, all that gorgeous hair, this wonderful face..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My nose is gross."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is it? I don't think it is. No, I genuinely think you're a beautiful girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"'Cause you are," Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I... I'm..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think you're beautiful, even if you don't. Kinda hard, sometimes, to judge your own looks. What, no one ever told you you're good-looking?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No," Agatha said, fighting down tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked at her, frowning slightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I guess you got a wide acquaintance among those who keep stuff like that to themselves."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was really quiet as they ate, and Rio could tell that she was still badly upset. As they finished the food, Rio looked at Agatha and sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I try something?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?" Agatha hummed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I... Can I talk to you about a thing?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now Agatha looked at her, and <u>God</u> those blue eyes were so pretty, even when they looked so sad.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I kinda... Okay, so, like, is it true what you said? No one's ever told you you're beautiful?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No one," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, like, not even your parents? I thought all parents talk all the time about their kids being cute and stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My mother believes in being brutally realistic."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, if I may say, your mother's reality is fuckin' stupid. 'Cause really, Agatha, you're so, so beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I won't hop into bed with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not tryin' for that. I just... I can't believe a girl so pretty as you... What about people you dated?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Never dated."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, hook-ups then."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Never had a hook-up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not even an <u>offer</u>?" Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. Who in their right mind would want this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha gestured broadly toward herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Lots of people. You... Look, I'm sorry. I keep screwing up and I... I mess up stuff all the time and I guess I should go but you... I don't like that you'll be here all upset."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm fine. I'm pretty much always upset."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Still, I... You got a roommate, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. She's away for the next few days though."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The moment the words left Agatha's mouth, Rio saw her wince.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, I just don't wanna leave you here alone, especially 'cause I made you more upset, okay? I... I'd like to stay and make sure you're all right. I'll sleep on the floor or whatever, I just..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be fine, why would you need to stay, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please," Rio said, and without thinking she grabbed at Agatha's wrists loosely.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I can't let... I can't leave you... If you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio could not choke out the words, might never be able to. She never could talk about these thoughts, these memories, to anyone, even the therapist Coach ordered her to see. Not even her sister when she visits her twice a month in that shit hole up in New York.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm not tryin' to make a move on you, or hurt you. I wanna look out and make sure... I just... I don't want you to be all alone and hurting."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked at her, not looking scared, but looking confused. Rio tried not to let the feelings get too much, but all she could remember was being that little kid who walked in on...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">On all of that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please?" she said, and then the tears fell.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She released Agatha's wrists, brought her own hands to her eyes to scrub at them, and immediately felt herself pulled into an awkward hug.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey. Hey, I... Shhh. Shhh. It's okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was holding her, rocking her, comforting her, and she was the one who was supposed to comfort other people, especially this girl she had messed up with so bad. But she let the moment happen, because it felt nice. It felt nice to pretend someone cared for a little while.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mere, can you sit up with me on the bed?" Agatha coaxed, and Rio followed, still sobbing and shaking.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Agatha was holding her again, sitting by her side with an arm around her, this beautiful girl that she had hurt was holding her and it felt so good to just let everything out.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You can stay here, okay?" Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I really... I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Here, you can use Alice's bed..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, I... I don't... Floor. I slept on a lot of floors."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't be silly."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Agatha pulled away for a moment, and Rio felt her shirt being unbuttoned, and she panicked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm not... This isn't so I can..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know. I'm just making it so you can be comfortable, okay? Just let me help."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And so she just sat there on the bed, except for a moment where Agatha pulled her to her feet so she could step out of her slacks, and let this pretty girl undress her down to her tank top and boxers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Here now. Lie down on your side, okay? There we go, scoot back to the wall."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Agatha went and turned the light off and crawled into bed with Rio and moved really close, face to face, and stroked Rio's hair and kissed her forehead.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if I made assumptions about you, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, I... I'm a bad guy. I'm bad."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio's forehead again, and as her eyes adjusted in the dark, Rio could see that Agatha was crying too, so Rio leaned in and kissed her forehead in return.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The sun coming in around the window shade shook Rio awake, and so she snuggled closer up against the girl she was spooning, burying her face against waves of dark, sweet-smelling hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then, for a moment, she jerked back in panic, remembering the night before.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was here with Agatha. They had spent time together, eaten a meal through the silence of Agatha's certainty that Rio was somehow trying to hurt her, and then...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Rio had gone through a total meltdown breakdown <u>thing</u> and almost let Agatha be the first person in her young adult life to know about all the shit that started to fuck her up when she was a kid.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had almost gone fully off the rails, had gotten as close as ever she did, and Agatha had just held her and let her cry. Then they had lain down together and gone to sleep.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shit, what was she going to do?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had already been feeling an unreasonable amount of attraction to this beautiful girl, this girl with the soft blue eyes and creamy skin and such amazing hair. She had been so attracted to the outer beauty of Agatha. Now she was feeling some other sort if attraction, some deeper pull.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was even more beautiful on the inside, it seemed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck, Rio was really considering trying to see if this could be a thing. Like, a permanent thing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Relaxing a little, she let her arms tighten around Agatha, just a little. Not a bad tightening. Not a squeeze that might disturb or hurt. Just a stronger hold.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," she whispered, "hey, pretty girl, wanna get up yet?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha let out a little sound, an almost whiny little moan, and she turned over to face Rio, then snuggled closer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sleepy," she murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio eased back a little from the embrace, but Agatha groaned and clung tighter.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're warm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Am I? And you like that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I get my phone, Agatha? Please? I'll come right back to you, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha released her with a little whimper, and Rio sat up. Her phone was on the edge of the trunk they had used as a dinner table the night before, and if she stretched over with care, she could just reach it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were a couple of messages, mostly Jen asking if she was okay. Rio sent a quick message back, mentioning she had spent the night in a girl's dorm room. That of course got a surprised response from Jen, since Rio always brought girls back to the apartment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Maybe I'm changing my ways,'</em> Rio thought.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She fired back a longer message to Jen, asking for a little favor. It took a few minutes, but she finally got a huffy reply agreeing to run a quick errand for her. Satisfied, she tossed her phone back onto the trunk and lay back down, pulling Agatha close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sleepy blue eyes blinked open, gazing at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We didn't... You didn't... We didn't have sex, did we?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, Agatha. We just slept, <em>mi </em><em>bellaquita</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Because I sort of want to remember when I hand in my v-card, ya know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Holy, holy shit.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">Agatha had drifted back to sleep after the little revelation about her virginity, and Rio had lain there, feeling like a monster for even touching her, for even having considered, briefly, that sex <u>might</u> happen the night before.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When there was a loud, familiar knock at the door, Rio once again eased out of Agatha's embrace and went to answer it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There stood Jen, immaculate in both outfit and apparent rage.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am not your little errand boy, Vidal, and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry. Look, it was... I just needed a favor this once, okay? Just this once."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well... Did you get in?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... What? No! Jen, this... This isn't that. This is just a nice girl, okay? And I don't want you saying shit, okay? Spreading lies about her or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not that kinda friend, Vidal. Anyhow, here's your shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Jen shoved a gym bag and a small stack of takeout containers into Rio's arms and spun on her heel, storming off through the early Saturday morning stillness of Sherwood Hall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Closing the door quickly, Rio turned and set the bag by the door. The takeout containers she set on the trunk, stacking the empty ones of the night before aside. She was just going to crawl back into bed when Agatha sat up, yawning.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What... What time is it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Seven in the morning. You hungry?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. I got breakfast delivered."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They sat down together and ate crêpes—Agatha had struck Rio as a girl who might enjoy a crêpe—and then Rio went and dug the phone charger out of her gym bag.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mind if I plug in my phone?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nope," Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Got any plans for the day?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nope."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, no friend hangouts or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I have two friends. Alice is away and Wanda's spending all weekend with her boyfriend, desperately struggling toward her MRS. degree."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled and flopped back down on the bed next to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think you might be a little off on your friend count."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There's me. I wanna be your friend. I wanna hang out with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't you have, like, jock stuff to do?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not this weekend. This weekend, I am free and utterly at your disposal."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You wouldn't mind being seen with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smirked and reached over to stroke Agatha's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Bellaquita</em>, I tried to take you out to dinner last night, and I'm pretty sure plenty of people saw us leaving <u>and</u> returning. Real question is, you wanna be seen with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why wouldn't I?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I mean, I got a rep. If we're goin' around together, people might... Well, they could assume we..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They'll assume you fucked me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. They might."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha lay back against the pillows, staring at the ceiling, then shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't care. If people think you're fucking me, maybe Alice'll lay off trying to set me up on awkward dates with chicks she works with at Kwikkee Burger."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, you don't mind if people think..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Eh, so I'll be seen as Rio Vidal's new fuckdoll. Might even earn me some street cred."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The casual way Agatha slung that phrase made a strange ache shoot through Rio's chest.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," she said, and casually took Agatha's hand, "even if we were pretending, you'd never just be a notch on my bedpost, okay? You... You're... I dunno. I'd want you to be more."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you suggesting we... Fake date?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Or at least we not deny it when people think we might be."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha let out a bright little laugh and shook Rio's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You know what? I like the sound of that."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio let Agatha set the agenda for the weekend. On Saturday they saw three films at the art house cinema near campus, had lunch at this little Greek restaurant that Agatha had heard about but not felt brave enough to go to on her own, attended an exhibition of paintings by Victoria Montesi, and wandered around the mall for two hours just browsing. Only then did Rio make a suggestion of activity for them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna come back to my place for dinner?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Instantly, Agatha was nervous. She knew that there was a chance going back to Rio's place meant there really would be an expectation of sex. Her chest felt tight and her hands fumbled nervously with each other in her lap.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, Agatha," Rio murmured, "don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You take girls back to your place when..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not every girl who's ever come to the apartment has been one I'm gonna fuck. I have just some friends."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, we don't have to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio reached out and cupped Agatha's chin in her hand, softly drawing their gazes into alignment. Under the golden glow of the lights in the mall carpark, her eyes looked golden too.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nothing you don't want, <em>bellaquita</em>. We'll never do anything you don't want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha felt herself blush, and heat pooled in her belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You wanna go out somewhere for dinner?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Anywhere you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let's go to your place," Agatha shrugged, trying to sound nonchalant.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, reaching up to take Rio's hand that was still holding her chin.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sure."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At the complex, Rio was very protective of Agatha as they went inside and headed upstairs walking close and keeping a casual arm on her shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mostly it's athletes in the place, and most are pretty nice," Rio said, "but some assholes around here think a pretty girl like you is free game unless she's with a resident. I want you never to walk around here without me, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was a shock every time Rio said something to even imply that Agatha was pretty, and when she outright <u>stated</u> that Agatha was pretty, a warmth seemed to flow through Agatha's heart.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">All of Rio's roommates were out for the night, and so they had the apartment to themselves. Rio dug through the fridge and triumphantly produced a container.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Habichuelas</em> <em>guisadas</em>. You like beans?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The beans were quickly warmed up, with a little rice as accompaniment, and they ate together on the old, plush sofa in the living room, laughing at reruns of some goofy sitcom from the '60s.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuckin' Agnes," Rio roared, "always gettin' into shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At some point, Rio started to sort of slump, and Agatha worried for a moment something was wrong.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just a little sleepy," Rio said, "but I can take you home, if you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could... Could I stay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure you want to?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. C'mere."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio led the way to one of the bedrooms.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This is mine and Jen's," she said, "so you can sleep in my bed over there. Clean sheets and everything. We got new packs of toothbrushes too, if you need; some fuckin' dentist alum hands 'em out like, if I may be ironic, candy. And..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trudged to her closet and dragged out some garments.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She handed Agatha a sleeveless, oversized Westview Athletic Department t-shirt and a pair of running shorts.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Pajamas, if you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>De nada</em>. Anything else, you come and get me and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Won't we be sleeping together? I mean, won't you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm gonna sleep on the sofa. So you don't feel scared or anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Okay. I just... I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay. Get some rest, all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio hugged her gently, pressed a kiss to her temple, and for a moment nuzzled against her hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha went and brushed her teeth and put on the proffered clothing and snuggled down into Rio's bed. It was nice, the mattress a bit firm, the sheets soft and warm, and with a big wooly blanket that made her feel safe, somehow. Yet she lay there for an hour and a half, unsleeping. Lonely. At last she rose and, the wooly blanket pulled around her shoulders, went to the living room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was there on the sofa, asleep but shivering a little. She had not even bothered to get a blanket for herself. Agatha knelt down and looked at Rio's face, then smiled and stroked her hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Would you like your blanket back?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Does it come with you?" Rio muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It very much can."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So Agatha watched Rio sit up, blinking slowly and yawning. They stood together, and Rio turned off the television, then padded after Agatha to the bedroom, finally snuggling down with her in the bed.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">Agatha woke, still in the dark of night, to a sense that something was wrong. Beside her, Rio was making strange, fearful sounds and twitching in her sleep.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? C'mere, sweetheart, don't be afraid. It's okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She hugged the lithe frame closer, and Rio turned in toward her, sighing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>No te </em><em>levantes</em><em> todavía, cariño. No es un día de escuela.</em>"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha chuckled at the grumpy little tone of Rio's voice, though she did not catch the full meaning of the words. Something about a school day. It was cute, really. Agatha started to wish she had learned more Spanish as a child. Maybe she could still learn it now. For Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Rio curled down smaller, acting even more grumbly, and pulled close in to hug Agatha. This left her lower face pressed distinctly against Agatha's chest, which was not necessarily expected, but which Agatha did not deem unwelcome.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Te amo</em>," Rio murmured, and Agatha knew it must be sleep talk, but the words made her heart skip a beat or six.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She stroked Rio's hair and smiled when that seemed to make some tension leave Rio's body.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Eres la mejor esposa de todas</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now Agatha had to wonder if Rio was actually awake, playing with her somehow, but when she pulled away, Rio let out a fearful cry.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Muéstrame</em><em> dónde te hice daño para poder </em><em>ayudarte</em><em> a </em><em>mejorarlo</em><em>.</em>"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Rio rolled away, swearing and making little sobbing sounds.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Rio, it's okay. You're safe in bed. C'mon. It's okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio jerked away from her touch, rolling out of the bed and onto the floor. Panicked, Agatha peered down and saw Rio, groggily coming around, blinking up at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Ágata</em><em>, ¿qué </em><em>sucede</em><em>?</em>"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You fell out of bed, sweetheart. You were talking in your sleep and I guess something bad happened in your dream."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh... Oh. I... Was I bad? Was I mean?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I didn't understand all of what you said. Something about school, and about... Well, other things."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Scrambling to her feet, Rio got back into bed, crawling so close to Agatha that she was nearly on top of her. It felt good to let her be that close, to let her cling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"As long as I didn't hurt you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm all right."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure? Shit, I... You're the last person I'd wanna hurt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her forehead, her cheek, then was stroking her hair, nuzzling their noses together. It all felt so good, so warm, and when Rio's lips touched her own, Agatha sighed and slipped her arms over Rio's shoulders. She had not had many kisses of any sort in her life, and Rio's kiss was so soft, so gentle.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It felt natural to let Rio settle on top of her, and to spread her legs so that Rio's rested between hers. It felt natural too when Rio's hips were rolling down against her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio seemed to need this, and Agatha wanted her to take whatever she needed. Besides, the pressure of the contact was making Agatha's mind drift as sweet sensations built in her body, heat pooling again in her belly as it had the evening before. This was far better than any time she had touched herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then, quite suddenly, Rio pushed off of her, looking panicked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit! Are you... Does anything hurt? Are you okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, it's fine. You clearly need to get off, and I'm right here, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No! No, that's not even... I don't..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Twisting away, Rio sat on the edge of the bed, head in her hands.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>"</em><em>¿Qué voy a hacer? Es como si me </em><em>estuviera</em> <em>forzando</em><em> contigo."</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha sat up and reached out to rub Rio's back gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, what happened there was... It wasn't a bad thing. Who says we can't be, ya know, friends with benefits? If you're desperate, if there're no other girls around,  you could fuck me when you need to get off."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's not about me getting off. I mean, I get off by getting girls off. I cum if I know I made a girl feel good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Scooting closer, Agatha sat back on her heels and whispered over Rio's shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So make me feel good, sweetheart."</p>
</div>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio turned her head just enough to see Agatha, face flushed, eyes seeming darker than before, lips just barely swollen from kisses which, before Rio stopped herself, had begun to get more serious.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You want me to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you want to. I was frankly very much into it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It... I can't do that to you, Agatha. I promised, I said I wouldn't treat you like just another lay, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I expect you to follow through on that promise. Later on, I expect to be taken out to breakfast and treated like a queen. Your queen."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's eyes went wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, ma'am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So then," Agatha murmured, lying back against the pillows, "hop to, loverboy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She threw her arms over her head, and there was a space between the bottom of her shirt and the top of her shorts that showed a nice sliver of creamy white skin and made Rio's brain go into overdrive.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Wife. Material. Major wife material. Thinkin' ranch house, five bedrooms minimum; one for us, one for guests, and three for the babies I am gonna pump into that sweet belly. Fuck!'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">God, the after effects of this latest concussion were weird and specific.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio leaned down and kissed Agatha, slow and soft.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait here for me, okay? Gotta take a piss first."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hurry back," Agatha whispered, and <u>FUCK</u> Rio wanted this to be permanent somehow, this pretty, soft girl in her bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Not just a regular thing. A <u>permanent</u> thing. Hearts and flowers and all that mushy stuff.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She grabbed a couple of things on the way out of the bedroom, then rushed to the bathroom, noting that one of her roommates had, at some point in the small hours, returned home and crashed out on the sofa, accompanied, of course, by one of the many, many sapphic basketball groupies on campus.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">(You could tell the groupies because you recognized them from showing up to every possible game and other thing wearing customized Westview Women's Basketball merch—customized meaning cut up and tailored to show the players what was on offer.)</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could at least take her to your room," Rio muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As point guard, Rio had always felt she had a duty to set a good example for her teammates, on and off the court. This was why she always laid girls in the bedroom, so as to offer a modicum of privacy—even when Jen was bedding down a girl just on the other side of the room divider.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course, after tonight, Rio was going to be the best example. She was gonna be a one-woman guy after this, as long as she could resist the temptation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She took her time in the bathroom, realizing that a part of her was hoping Agatha would fall back asleep. Not that she did not <u>want</u> to do things with Agatha. She very, very much did. But she wondered if Agatha was feeling rushed or pressured. That would blow.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Right. She was going to do this. But she was going to be so careful and make sure there was lots of, like, consent and whatever. She always double checked that shit, but with Agatha, she was going to triple check at least.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Changing into the other boxers she had grabbed, she fussed with the pocket, making sure she had everything aligned in a way that looked nice. No excuse to go into a good grinding session looking less than your best. Stomping back through the living room, she noted that Ororo and the groupie were awake, making out on the sofa, but they took no real notice of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the bedroom, Agatha was very much still awake, and in fact she sat up as Rio entered. Her gaze went straight to the front of Rio's boxers and she visibly shivered, raising an eyebrow.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is that for me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It, uh... I thought it could... You know, it might feel good for you to rub against. I... I can take it off if you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha beckoned her to the bedside, and Rio went, hands behind her back. When Agatha reached out and cupped the pack, every muscle in Rio's ass and lower back tensed. Then, when Agatha lay back against the pillows, legs spread, Rio groaned softly and practically fell on top of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You are so, so gorgeous, <em>bellaquita</em>," Rio murmured, and kissed Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Instinctively, Rio thrust her hips down slightly, then froze.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You want this, Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes. Fuck, yes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She could feel Agatha trying to grind against her, hips canting up desperately.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You need me?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm, please. Please? Please, Rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Thrusting down, Rio ground hard against Agatha. In return, Agatha whimpered, arms going around Rio's neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Ay, que linda eres, cariño,</em>" Rio whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They managed to established a rhythm pretty quickly, and Rio smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You feel so nice, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was shivering, panting, and her legs were now locked around Rio's hips. It felt close and good and sweet and Rio felt little pings of fresh arousal fuzzing along her spine with every moan or whimper the girl beneath her released.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you... Rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? What do you need, <em>bellaquita</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just let go. Cum for me, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha threw her head back, eyes squeezed shut, a tiny, high mewl escaping her mouth as she shivered through her orgasm. She looked so pretty, so soft, and Rio actually felt tears spring to her eyes at the sight. Her back went tense, and she felt herself curl in tighter for a moment as it seemed like every square inch of her groin throbbed and a strangled groan tumbled from her throat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They lay there, both struggling to catch their breath, until Rio raised her head and rested her forehead on Agatha's.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hi," she breathed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry," Agatha whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Why sorry?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I think... I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked ashamed, like she was on the verge of tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, did I hurt you? Oh, God, if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Think I wet your bed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pushed up slightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wh... What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Sometimes when I... When I've touched myself, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shifting to the side, Rio clicked on her lamp and sat up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is it like... Like you get wetter after you cum?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, tears in her eyes. Throwing back the sheets, Rio moved to kneel beside Agatha's legs. The crotch of the shorts Agatha was wearing was soaked, and it looked like maybe a tiny bit had leaked onto the sheet. Leaning down, Rio dared a sniff.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That was no piss.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Cariño</em>, you ever heard of squirting?"</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">They had fallen asleep again after Rio had gotten Agatha a new pair of shorts and assured her she had not pissed the bed. When Rio woke again, it was to sounds indicating that more of her roommates were back and were up to shit around the apartment. Sitting up and stretching, she went out into the living room.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You guys wanna keep it down‽ I got a lady tryin' to sleep in my bed, okay‽"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Too late," she heard just behind her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Turning, she saw that Agatha had stumbled after her. She smiled and pulled the girl into a one-armed hug.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey. Feel okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Like a million bucks. Now, I believe you're supposed to take me out for breakfast."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. Where would m'lady like to dine?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You pick," Agatha smirked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All right, but I'm not sure the IHoP out on the interstate is quite up to regal standards, my queen."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Blushing, Agatha threw her arms around Rio's shoulders and hugged her tight. Jen blundered along from the kitchen, a bowl of cereal in her hand and a spoon in her mouth. When she saw Rio, or more precisely saw the girl in Rio's arms, the spoon plopped out into the bowl.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy <u>shit</u>," Jen hissed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, hey Jennifer," Rio said, turning Agatha to face toward Jen.<br/>"Meet my new lady."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hi," Agatha said, extending a hand, "I'm Aga..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know who you are," Jen nodded, "but do you know who the hell just used you to notch her bedpost?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, Agatha's no notch, Jen," Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She is, as I said, my lady. My woman. In vulgar parlance, my girlfriend."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your... You have a..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A girlfriend."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Jen turned quickly and disappeared back off to the kitchen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Did... Did I do something wrong?" Agatha murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not a thing. Hey, you go get dressed in what you wore yesterday. We'll drop back over to your dorm for a change of clothes, and then we're gettin' pancakes."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">"Your roommates are..." Agatha trailed off.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, they're just shocked I'd claim to have a girlfriend. We've all got reputations as womanizing horndogs, but somehow I've got the biggest."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thus the panty raids?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. God, I hate those."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, think of it this way. Without them, we might never have met."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio reached over and squeezed Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's good thinking, <em>bellaquita</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They had their pancake breakfast, and then they returned for the second time that morning to Agatha's dorm. Rio wanted to grab the gym bag Jen had brought her the morning before, and Agatha needed to charge her phone for a while.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As they waited, they lay on Agatha's bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmmn?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What we did... What you did for me. It was... Thank you for that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For the... You know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Yeah, I... Are you sure it was okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It was more than okay. Did you cum?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you really... Get off by doing things to girls?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. I mean, not that I don't like being touched or whatever, but I don't have to be."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's very interesting."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sound like a scientist."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I've always been a little professor," Agatha said, turning to cuddle up against Rio's side.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna go do anything after this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can we go see another movie?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure. I dig movies."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, <em>cariño</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks for explaining that I didn't pee the bed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>De nada</em>. Seems like maybe you do it pretty easy sometimes; sorta cool."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I always figured it was bad."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, it's very much not bad at all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you still be fucking other girls?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, you took me to your place, we sort of had sex. Will you be fucking other girls now that you're done with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not done with you, Agatha. I don't intend to be. You wanna be done with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No! No, I... I don't know what we are, but I want to keep being whatever that is."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think we can swing that, <em>bellaquita</em>. I think we can just about swing that."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They spent whatever time they could together in the next two weeks, mostly out on semi-dates or back in Agatha's dorm room when she had it to herself. Today, they were sitting in Rio's car in the lot of a Kwikkee Burger, eating an egregious amount of greasy food.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What are you doing for the summer?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Uh, I go and stay in New York. I have some kind of relatives by marriage I stay with, and I work to save up some extra cash."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm," Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What you got planned?" Rio mumbled around a mouthful of fries.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Boston and vicinity. I have paternal relatives there that I like to visit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, them ol' Harknesses, eh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha frowned slightly. There was a part of her which presumed everyone knew the middlingly messy story of her lineage.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My father was a Lebowski."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A Lebow... So how are you a Harkness?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mother's side. It was all a part of the prenup. My father agreed that the first child of the marriage would use my mother's surname. Of course, then I turned out to be the <u>only</u> child of the marriage, so goodbye any chance of little Lebowski siblings for me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah. So, like... Did your folks split up, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Father died when Mother was six months pregnant with me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh, jeez, <em>bellaquita</em>, I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged and slurped down the last of her soda.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm fairly certain Mother's family had him killed, if not Mother herself."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha said this, as she occasionally had and always would, with total conviction. When Rio barked out a laugh, Agatha cocked a brow at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh, you're serious?" Rio sputtered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The Harkness clan is not unfamiliar with murder, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit. Agatha, that... Wow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And now you see why I'm glad I'm basically disinherited."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're... You're disinherited?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, not totally, but near to it. Sometimes she tops up the ol' bank account, but that generally means there's some dinner she wants me to come to  where she'll shove another six or seven 'promising young men' at me. Thank goodness for my stunning intellect, because full-ride scholarship bay-bee."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shook the last three fries from the little paper packet into her mouth.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But why would your mom disinherit..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am the disappointing Harkness. Well, one of several. But to hear Mother tell it I am <u>THE</u> Disappointment. It's the looking like Father's family thing. And the gay thing. And the not wanting to go for a law degree thing. It's a lot of things."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy... I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not your fault. Anyway, you have it worse than I do, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I... I'm not sure it's a competition. You... You okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm fine. So long as Mother stays on her side of the Great Divide between us and never tries to come in and make a mess of my life, or that of my children..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Children?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If I have any one day," Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was looking at her in a funny way, head cocked to one side, eyes looking very dark.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, you... You wanna go back to my place? For... To hang out?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm game. Can we have sex?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you wanna?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then I'm sure we can figure something out."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">"Hi, Jen!" Agatha chirped as Rio led the way into the bedroom.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy motherfuckin' shit," Jen said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You got a problem with my woman?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nah, nah. Just... Surprised to see her again."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? She's my woman. We're spending time together."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Jen fled the room in a huff, and Rio laughed, then closed the door. Agatha lounged on Rio's bed, kicking off her shoes.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna goof off?" Rio said, whipping off her shirt and crossing to sit on the edge of the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Elaborate," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smiled and reached over to undo the button and zipper of Agatha's shorts.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I was thinking you could use a little mouth to pussy resuscitation."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha felt her head immediately go all swimmy. When Rio's fingers teased at her waist, she raised her hips and felt her shorts and panties being pulled down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"People actually do that in real life?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They sure as shit do. I'm actually quite the pussy eating connoisseur."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And it... It doesn't taste bad?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Everyone tastes a little different. I've never run into a bad one."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if <u>I</u> taste bad?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Laughing, Rio stretched out on top of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't. I've already tasted you from my fingers. Remember last week?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She did indeed have a distinct memory of the week before, when Rio had been in her room with her, lying on her bed and kissing her, gently pressing and stroking her clit until she came. It had been very good, soft and a little overwhelming, and she had fallen asleep very quickly after.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you get really wet, and I wanted a little taste. You taste good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her quickly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We won't do anything you don't want. If you don't feel comfortable..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do, I... I mean, it... What if I squirt? Won't that be...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Cariño</em>, if you squirt while I'm down there, I will immediately be filing a formal application to live in your pants full-time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed and pulled Rio down for another kiss.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do what you have to, my brave soldier," she teased.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Really? Sure you're okay with it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is there even the slightest chance I'll have an orgasm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded eagerly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Orgasm guaranteed or you can fire me. Out of a cannon. Into the sun."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Something about that phrase made Agatha feel a bit frightened and she hugged Rio tight.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't want to not have you around."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It... It was a joke, <em>bellaquita</em>. A joke."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just... Please don't go."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, look, I'm right here. Literally on top of you. Only place I hope to go in the very near future is maybe between your legs."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You really want to?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweets, I very much want to. But only if <u>you</u> want me to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Loosening her hold on Rio, Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want it. I just don't want to disappoint you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I won't be disappointed. I mean, a chance to eat out a beautiful woman? Who'd be disappointed?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That was one to think about.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Probably people who aren't sexually attracted to women," Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio frowned, blinked hard a few times, and cocked her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You got a point there. Now shall I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, please demonstrate your talents. I'm very..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her, hard, with just the smallest push of tongue, and Agatha heard bells. When Rio's lips left hers, she allowed a small disappointed sound to escape, but it was halted when she felt those same lips on her neck, right near the pulse point. There was a delicious tingle, a little nip of teeth and sensation of suction.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was being marked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She very much liked being marked. Rio marking her was Rio claiming her, wanting to keep her, and she was thrilled at the idea someone might want her so much.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sit up for a minute," Rio whispered as she pulled away, "because I want to see all of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Obediently, Agatha sat up and allowed Rio to remove her shirt and bra. Once she was bare, Rio eased her back down, palming one of her breasts at the same time.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"These are so good," Rio murmured, her tone reverent.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When her lips closed around the nipple of Agatha's left breast, teeth teasingly grazing the delicate skin, Agatha gasped, a hand moving to the back of Rio's head. It felt like a zing of pleasant fire went straight to her groin, especially when Rio pinched and twisted her other nipple a bit roughly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio... R-rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Releasing her nipple, Rio nuzzled the side of her breast.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I hurt you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. No, it... You're wonderful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio let out a happy little hum and went to work on Agatha's other breast a while, kissing and licking and sucking and nipping before carrying on down along Agatha's body. Now and then she paused, whispering to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Still okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm," Agatha would moan, dreamily.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">This felt like being worshipped. Agatha could, she thought, get used to the sensation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then, she felt herself being parted, being opened for inspection, and she gasped at the warmth of Rip's breath against the most secret place.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So pretty," Rio murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's hips jumped slightly, and a primal part of her brain want to press down, to push herself against Rio's mouth.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shifted so Agatha's thighs were over her shoulders, planting a few smoldering kisses to either side, then nosed forward into Agatha's cleft.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You smell so good, Agatha. You smell perfect."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She kissed Agatha's clit, and Agatha nearly cried out, one hand grabbing at Rio's hair. Rio chuckled against her, and Agatha did cry out, though softly, and her hips bucked once more as she felt feather-light flickers of Rio's tongue against her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was kissing her, tasting her, from the eager sounds and motions was absolutely <u>reli</u><u>shing</u> her, and all Agatha could do was desperately hold on to Rio's hair and try to hump against the soft lips and skillful tongue that were giving her such pleasure.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She felt Rio's thumbs spread her a bit more, felt herself open more to the attentions she was being given...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Rio's tongue lapped at her entrance and shallowly entered her, teasing with slow, twisting in-and-out motions while two of Rio's fingers firmly circled her clit. Toes curling, Agatha whimpered, feeling her thighs and abs go very, very tight for a moment, then release as a wave of heat and relaxation washed over her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio! Ah..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As Agatha's heart raced and her mind tumbled, Rio kept up those same amazing ministrations, and the climax abated only briefly before rolling into a second which left Agatha stunned for an instant, then...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then she was not sure what happened until Rio was holding her, kissing her cheeks and forehead, whispering to her in a rushed, panicky way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, <em>cariño</em>. Come back to me. Jesus, Agatha, wake..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Rio, that..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck! Fuck, I actually thought you died for a sec."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Only... Only a little... Death I suspect."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had passed out. She had actually passed out. Rio was gazing down at her, brown eyes misty with tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Guess I did my job right, huh <em>bellaquita</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, mind still half in a fog. Rio leaned in and kissed her. She tasted herself on the soft lips and the warm tongue, a pleasant salty tang.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Was I good?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're always good, Agatha. Always good."</p>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio huffed across the apartment and flopped on the sofa. Ororo, with her godlike poker face, had just wiped the floor with Rio, Jen, and Anna Marie in their regular occasional monthly semi-annual biennial apartment poker throwdown.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">(Scheduling was a bitch sometimes.)</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now Ororo was off to see her currently-doing-that, Jean, and Anna Marie, the token straight girl, had skipped off to a date with her boyfriend Remy (nice guy, bit of a card sharp; Rio would give anything to see him and Ororo facing off at the poker table.)</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Grumbling, Rio slouched lower on the sofa. She and Agatha had both been busy all week, finishing up exams, and so there had been no chance to meet up. Rio really wanted to try eating Agatha out again, though hoped if it did happen, maybe there would be less passing out.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Unless the passing out was a measure of how truly skilled Rio was. Then Agatha could pass out any time. Not too much, though. Rio had been genuinely worried for a bit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her phone buzzed and she pulled it out, smiling when she saw the contact the text was from.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">👑💜<em>Mi</em> <em>Reina</em>💜👑</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The message, however, left her momentarily confused.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>&gt;&gt;Well safe 4<br/>
    </em>
<em>another month</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">What was that supposed to mean?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</em>
<em>¿Qué?</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>&gt;&gt;A little joke Rio<br/>
    Got my </em>🔴</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ooo. U OK?</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>&gt;&gt;Could use some<br/>
    cuddles and maybe<br/>
    a heating pad</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On it cariño</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio wondered if Agatha's periods were particularly bad. She hoped not too bad; thinking of Agatha in pain made her feel shaky.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Speed walking into the kitchen, she grabbed a couple of bottles of water from the fridge, then rushed to the bedroom she and Jen shared.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Jen was on the floor, doing crunches, and Rio stepped over her, grabbing a gym bag and shoving the water bottles in, then hurrying to grab both the plug-im heating pad and some quick-heat patches from the shared cabinet at the end of the room divider.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You finally strain yourself carrying around that enormous ego?" Jen asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha needs these."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Jesus, Vidal, you really are getting pussy whipped."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What can I say? I'm a sucker for those blue eyes."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">She had sat in her car for a moment, phone in hand, placing an order that she would wait for once she reached Agatha's dorm. Then she started up and headed over.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The delivery guy pulled up just as Rio did, and she met him at the entrance to Sherwood Hall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Order for Vidal?" Rio said, and confirmed things with the driver.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">He handed over the box, nice and cold, and then Rio nodded her thanks as she rushed up the steps and into Sherwood, pausing just inside to go into the app and add some extra tip on top of what she had previously left.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Up she rushed to 310, and she knocked before entering.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The girl in question was face down on her bed, groaning. Her roommate, Alice, was actually present for once, sitting on the other bed. When Rio entered, Alice leapt to attention as always.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, Rio!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Heya, Alice. My girl's not feeling great, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, Agatha gets overdramatic about her cramps every month."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do not," Agatha muttered.<br/>
"And if I had the strength, I would come over there and slug you for saying that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Alice laughed and sat back down in her own bed, going back to packing a suitcase. Rio, meanwhile, went and knelt by Agatha's bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, <em>bellaq</em><em>uita</em>. Brought you some stuff. I got water, heating pads, and I got you a present."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Present?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Turn over and let me get you set up with heat and then you can have your present, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha rolled onto her back slowly, and she really did look unwell, face paler than usual, eyes a little red as if she had been crying. Rio sat up on the edge of the bed and smiled, stroking Agatha's cheek.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Poor sweets. Here, show me just where it hurts, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha rested her hand low on her abdomen, letting out a tiny groan. Rio reached into her gym bag to pull out one of the patches, squeezing it to start the reaction. She took Agatha's hand and kissed it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Push your shirt up a little?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha did as she was told, and Rio laid the patch carefully over the painful area, using the waistband of Agatha's low slung pajama pants to hold it in place.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There. That should help for now. I got the big electric pad for later too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I have my present now?" Agatha whimpered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gimme a sec, okay? Here, hand me your second pillow. Raise up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio slipped the second pillow under Agatha's head to elevate her a bit more. Then she reached down and grabbed the box the delivery guy had handed off downstairs, slitting the little tape seal with the edge of a key.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What would my queen say to some chocolate-covered strawberries and cherries?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's eyes went wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... You got me special food?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure. Figured you might feel a little better with a treat."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll take 'em if she doesn't want 'em," Alice teased.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Touch 'em and you're dead, Gulliver!" Agatha growled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Be nice, Agatha," Rio said, but she smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the end, after she had allowed Rio to hand-feed her a number of the fruits, Agatha graciously allowed Alice half a strawberry and two cherries as a peace offering.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do turn into a grumbly bitch on my period," Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure do," Alice nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well," Rio said, "you've got me here to see you through any and all grumbly bitchness now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, Rio," Agatha said, "thank you!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Alice sighed and rolled her eyes.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For two people who met so recently, you guys sure act married as shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All part of the master plan," Rio said.<br/>
"See, if we act married enough, then maybe I'll knock Agatha up and she can skip the whole grumbly bitch period for a while."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'd really prefer to finish my degree before becoming your broodmare," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Aw, but babe, if we start now, we have time for you to maybe pop out a full basketball roster!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Aaaand I'm out," Alice groaned, standing and heading for the door.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You just can't handle seeing true love!" Agatha called after her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as the door closed, Rio and Agatha both burst out laughing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you hold me a while?" Agatha asked once they had calmed down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure," Rio grinned.<br/>
"Of course."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Slipping off her shoes, Rio shifted and lay down on Agatha's bed. When Agatha rolled onto her side, Rio spooned against her back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think the patch is starting to lose heat," Agatha murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Want another?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm okay for now. Would you just sorta rub my tummy?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed the failing patch and set it on the little nightstand, then slipped her hand down where it had been and rubbed the soft skin there.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sleepy," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Take a nap. I'm with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha hummed softly to herself for a moment before speaking again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmmn?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No way am I giving birth to more than maybe four kids, tops."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Obviously, <em>bellaquita</em>. I was only joking."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt herself drifting off as well, and she started to let sleep take her, but then something lurched in her gut pleasantly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Had Agatha just implied she might be willing to have kids with Rio, or had Rio misunderstood? She wanted to say something, to ask, but she could hear that Agatha's breathing had evened out as it did in sleep.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, they could leave that question for another day.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha spent several weeks in Boston as intended, but as the end of her time there drew to a close, she got anxious. Her only other option for the rest of the summer was to go stay with her mother in Salem, and she did not want that. She never wanted that again, if she could avoid it. One the first day of her last week, she brought up her predicament to Rio on the phone one night.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>"So come stay with me in New York,"</em> Rio suggested.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, but I... I don't want to be a bother."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You won't be. Hell, my Aunt May and her partner Liv have been begging me to bring you to meet them sometime, since I haven't shut up about you all summer."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You talk about me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Course I do. Who else am I supposed to talk about but my woman, huh?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha felt herself blush at the idea of Rio still claiming her, even when they were apart.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Just think about it, okay sweets? Lemme know and I'll come get you at the weekend."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course, Agatha talked the matter over with her relatives, who seemed delighted that she had somewhere to go to that was not back to the less-than-tender mercies of Evanora Harkness after she left Boston.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'd keep you here longer," her Cousin Lily said, "but Jordan and I always get swamped with work by mid-summer, and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I get it, Lily. I really do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So, at the end of the last week, Rio turned up, ready to take Agatha to New York. She stayed the night, which meant that Lily gave her the third degree over dinner.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, Agatha tells us you're a kind of a big shot athlete around campus. You play basketball."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes ma'am, I do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And are you like most other college athletes? Like to party?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I, uh, I have been known to party a little. Now and then."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm. You drink alcohol at these parties?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lily's wife Jordan rolled her eyes.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lilita, leave the kid alone."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm just making sure Agatha's dating a nice, responsible girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I, uh, have drunk at parties and stuff before, yes," Rio admitted, "but not much. Don't like losing control, you know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, so you like to be in control?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed, but it almost turns into a laugh when she saw Rio blush.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I suppose you like to be in control in relationships too?" Lily went on.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I mean, if... If Agatha wants to be in control... She can be."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I decide how we spend most of our dates," Agatha pointed out.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's right."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I'm almost always the one to initiate sex."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio suddenly began to nearly choke on a bite of pot roast, and Jordan had to slap her on the back a few times.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just try to keep breathing kid," Jordan muttered, "and you'll survive, I swear."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they were in the car the next morning, Agatha tried to apologize.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lily means well. That whole side of the family are just really protective of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I get it, <em>bellaquita</em>. I do. It's nothing to worry about. You deserve to have people around who want you safe. I mean, I want you safe. I want to protect you."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">Rio's Aunt May (her brother had been married to Rio's mother's sister) was terribly sweet to Agatha during her visit.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Any friend of Rio's is family, dear. We want you to feel at home here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">May's partner, Liv, was nice enough too, if a bit distracted and very busy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Atomic science," Rio explained.<br/>"She's usually got a lot going on, but she's real cool. She got me my summer job the last two years, working with Dr. Pam Isley. We're doing some amazing stuff with plant extracts at the lab."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is it exciting?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For me, yeah. I mean, there's so much we can do with plants, and we haven't even really fully... Wait, did you really wanna know, or are you making fun?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, I honestly wanna know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I can't talk about everything we're doing, 'cause some government funding shit, but seriously, plants might just save the world. Or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">While Rio and Liv were off at work all day, Agatha fell into an easy rhythm in the Parker household. May was funny and kind, and she seemed to like Agatha very much.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm just glad Rio has someone like you, dear. She hasn't had an easy time in life, and she won't admit it, but she needs someone to look after her when she's busy trying to tough things out."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I like looking after her," Agatha said, "and she's one of the sweetest people I've ever met."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's little cousin Peter (who was the nephew of May's deceased husband; it turned out the family was very complex) was a cool kid, for someone in junior high. He was deep into the sciences, and he could spend all day chattering about his current interests. Agatha found this highly relatable, even though she had long since learned to keep her interests to herself; as her mother had told her repeatedly in her childhood, "No one cares." But it was interesting to see that May and Liv seemed to care about what Peter wanted to talk about, and even encouraged him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They really love him, don't they?" Agatha asked Rio as they headed to the guest room one night.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They had just walked past the open doorway of Peter's room and seen him there with Liv, who was helping him set up a telescope at his window while Peter excitedly talked about outer space.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Course they love him," Rio said."He's basically their kid. Parents love their kids."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do they?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They're supposed to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha wished her mother loved her. Her father's family always told her that he would have loved her, that he <u>did</u>, even though he died before her birth. Agatha knew that if and when she had children of her own, she would do everything to protect them and to let them know how loved they were.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">The one less than perfect part of their New York idyll was the fact that, on most weekend afternoons when she was not working at Dr. Isley's lab, Rio disappeared somewhere, but would not tell Agatha where she was going.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, she has visits to make," May explained, but also did not elaborate.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Finally, one Friday night just after they had gone to bed in the guest room, Agatha brought the matter up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... Gotta be somewhere," Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Where? Is it... Do you see another girl? Are you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Agatha, why would I see another girl?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you... You've gone with a lot of different girls in the past, and I figured..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pulled her close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, <em>bellaquit</em><em>a</em>, there's no one but you. No one at all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then where is it you go? Is it top secret lab stuff and you can't tell me? Is it..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I go visit my sister."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sis... You have a sister."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. A twin sister."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Identical?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All but the schizophrenia."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Rio, what... Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because I figured it'd scare you off. Because I figured you wouldn't care."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's eyes filled with tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because I live... I live every day in fear that I'll get sick, and maybe I'll end up hurting someone. Hurting you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... Well, you... Statistically, people with mental illnesses are far more vulnerable to being hurt than..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I know that shit. But Lenny... She's had bad spells before and hurt people. She doesn't mean to, I know, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, I trust you. You won't hurt me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if I do?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's tears burst forth, and she was wracked with sobs. Agatha could only hold her, stroke her hair, and try to make her feel safe.</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure you wanna come along?" Rio asked for the 33rd time.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha reached over from the passenger's seat and squeezed her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do, but I won't if you don't want me to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... It's just... I mean, it's a psychiatric facility. Sometimes stuff there..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I grew up in a home where every day there was a 60/40 chance I would get the shit beaten out of me. I can handle this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">All during the drive from Queens to Brooklyn, Rio finally told Agatha about her childhood and about Lenny.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"...and then when we were seven, Mama died. Papa actually got killed later that day too. Shot by cops for... I dunno, I guess walking while being a Latino Pittsburghian."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yinzer."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The demonym for people from Pittsburgh is Yinzer."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right. Anyway. Lenny and I bounced around in foster care for years, sometimes with relatives. She was with relatives a lot more than I was; a lot of 'em could only take one of us, and I guess Lenny was better than me or something.<br/>"When we were 13, her foster parents at the time managed to adopt her. They still let us see each other, but then she got sick when we were 17, and now... Well, she's been in and out of places ever since."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's done is done. I've learned to deal with it, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you don't have to deal with it alone. Not anymore."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They got to the place, to Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, and Rio kept an arm around Agatha's shoulders as they went in and got their visitor passes. There was a guard who kept looking Agatha up and down in a way that Rio very much did not like, but she managed to suppress an urge to growl at the guy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As they walked to the visitation area, someone hailed Rio from along a hallway.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yoo-hoo! Rio!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey! Dr. Quinzel. How's it hangin'?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, it's hangin'. Who's your little friend?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, right. Uh, Agatha, this is Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Doc, this is Agatha Harkness."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Quinzel's eyes went wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of the Salem Harknesses?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Guilty, " Agatha nodded, and shook the doctor's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, what an illustrious visitor."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Me an' Agatha... Well, we're dating," Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, how... Ah! Young love. Rio, you oughta bring her over for dinner with Pammy an' I some night."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That'd be great. We'll let ya know, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sounds good, kitten. Buh-bye!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As Dr. Quinzel walked away, Agatha stifled a laugh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She seems... Nice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She is. She's actually Dr. Isley's wife. Liv got me the job, but I got a sense Dr. Quinzel might've put in some good words for me too. We know each other okay, since Lenny's been in an' outta here a few times."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They made it to the visitation area at last, and Lenny was slumped in a chair, flipping a small chess piece over and over in her hand. When she saw them, she stood and shuffled over, giving Rio a loose hug, then giving Agatha the once over with a look much like the guard at the front.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This her?" Lenny asked.<br/>"This the one?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lenny, this is Agatha. Agatha, my sister Lenny."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Charmed," Lenny said, gently taking Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's really nice to meet you," Agatha smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lenny grinned, releasing Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, baby sister, her titties feel as nice as they look?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Len!" Rio barked, looking over and seeing Agatha blush.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, hey. Not tryin' to muscle in on your lady. It was purely a question of intellectual curiosity."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well lay off, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Jeez, chill. I'll lay off."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They all sat, and mostly Rio and Lenny talked while Agatha sat close, holding Rio's hand. It was nice, having someone hold her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At one point, Agatha leaned in and whispered in Rio's ear.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Restroom?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, yeah, <em>bellaq</em><em>uita</em>, it's right through that door we passed, just on the right there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha stood, hurrying off to the restroom. Once she disappeared through the door, Lenny let loose a stream of weird, high-pitched giggles.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's so fuckin' funny?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wh-wh-what did you j-just call her?'</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Bellaquita</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lenny was laughing so hard she almost fell out of her chair, and a guard came over to check on her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I got this, man," Lenny said."My kid sister here just told a funny joke."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The guard stalked away again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's so funny about me calling my girl beautiful?" Rio snarled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... It... Baby sister..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Len, I'm two minutes younger than you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you even know what <em>bellaquita</em> means?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, yeah. Beautiful girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, literally."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And figuratively?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lenny finally managed to shut down the last of her laughter, staring at Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ri-ri, you're basically calling her easy. A slut."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... What? That's not... Dad used to call Mom that all the time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. 'Cause Mom was a hooker and Dad was pissed about it. And then he killed her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A cold dread washed over Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mom... Mom killed herself. Dad and her had a fight, a big one, and he left the house, and she killed herself."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lenny's eyes went soft suddenly, and she leaned forward and touched Rio's wrist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Baby sister, Mom didn't kill herself. Dad killed Mom. She... She was out hooking because Dad couldn't work, and it tore Dad up. Sweetie, Dad killed Mom. And then he left the house and he got the cops to kill him."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I... Mom..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ri-ri, what do you remember about that day?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Mom and Dad were arguing. They argued a lot then. And then I remember Dad slammed out and... And I don't know where you were..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I was in their bedroom closet. I used to like to hide in there. It was nice. Smelled good. Ri-ri, Dad cut Mom's throat. I saw it. I was there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I... I walked in and... And I thought..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetie, you thought wrong. You did. I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Dad..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Dad wasn't a well guy. He had anger issues. After he left the house, he... Well, look, <em>Tio</em> Vic was the first one to get to us, right? Even before the ambulance and cops."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because Dad went and called <em>Tio</em> Vic and told him what happened."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I thought..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ri-ri, it... It was different than you thought."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio sat there, staring at Lenny, feeling like every breath was a battle, every heartbeat a war. Lenny kept talking to her, but she could not hear what was being said. Eventually, she felt a hand on her back. Looking up, she saw Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? C'mon, sweetheart. We'll get you home, okay? I'll drive."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then they were leaving the room, leaving Clockworks, and Agatha was helping Rio into the car.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can you give me your keys?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio handed them over, scrunching down in the passenger's seat. She remembered being seven, scrunched down in the backseat of <em>Tio </em>Vic's car, wondering why Mom had stopped loving them. Why Mom had died. She remembered thinking no one loved them, loved <u>her</u>, anymore, and no one ever would.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The next thing she knew, they were back in Queens, back at Aunt May's, and Agatha was leading her to the guest room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, love. C'mon. Do you feel sick, sweetheart? Headache?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Agatha was helping her out of her shoes, out of her clothes, and tucking her into bed, crawling in beside her. Rio started to weep.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shh, sweetheart. Okay. I'm here. I've got you."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why are you still here with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked into Rio's eyes. They had seemed blank for the last two days, ever since the visit to her sister, but now they were looking on her with deep warmth again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because I care. Because I want to help you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But you... You don't have to be in the same bed with me. There's another guest room."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to be with you, Rio. I want to take care of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm bad. I'm a monster."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, you're neither of those things. You're good, and kind, and you're so wonderful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I called you a bad name. I called you it a lot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You didn't know. You didn't mean it to be bad. You thought you were being nice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But... But..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hush. Just rest now. I'm here with you. You're safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you safe with me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am. I know I am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A little while later, once Rio was sleeping, Agatha went to use the bathroom. She sat there on the toilet, wanting to cry but finding she could not.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had managed, the afternoon of the day that they visited Clockworks, to tell her most of what Lenny said. May had confirmed what little of the incident she knew about through her connection to Rio's mother's family. There had been a call that evening to Rio's phone, from a contact labeled <em>Sis</em>. Rio had been sleeping then too, so Agatha had answered it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"</em>
<em>Ri</em>
<em>-ri?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This is Agatha. Rio's asleep."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh. This... This is me. Lenny. I... Sometimes we're allowed a call, and I wanted... Can you tell Rio I'm sorry? I... I </em>
<em>didn</em>
<em>'t mean to... I </em>
<em>didn</em>
<em>'t know how little she knew about... Everything."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll tell her. Don't worry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You staying with her?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Good. She... Well, I always been stronger than her emotionally. I'm crazy, but I'm tough. I </em>
<em>didn't wanna hurt her."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sure she knows."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>"Thank you.</em>"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sighing, Agatha finished up in the bathroom and hurried back to bed. When she got there, she found Rio sitting up on the edge of the bed, head in hands. As she approached, Rio reached out and hugged her around the hips.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I won't ever hurt you," Rio whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know. I know you won't," Agatha said, stroking Rio's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And if we... You an' me, if we make it, if... If we're a thing for a long time, and we... If you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio cut off for a moment, forehead resting against Agatha's lower abdomen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay, sweetheart," Agatha managed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I wanna protect you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, but Rio, can you be brave and let me protect you sometimes?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded, looking up at Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... We can help each other, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can," Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">With Agatha's encouragement, Rio called her therapist back in New Jersey and got a temporary referral to one in NYC. Agatha drove her to and from the appointments when possible, wanting to be there for her. Wanting to help her.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The rest of the summer passed in a blur of busy activity. Rio kept up her work in Dr. Isley's lab, though after she got word about Rio's emotional crisis, she insisted on offering Rio a week off with pay.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha actually briefly got a job, working at a tiny bookstore that needed temporary help. The pay was surprisingly good, and the two men who owned the shop were ineffably kind, even if one of them tended to lurk in the shadows and growl at the occasional noisy patron.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">On their last weekend in NYC, they went and followed up on Dr. Quinzel's dinner invitation. It was a splendid time, really; good food and good company.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">On the day they were headed back to New Jersey, Liv of all people pulled Agatha aside. They had not spoken much, what with Liv being off at work most of the time and being a bit reserved when she was present, but to Agatha's surprise, Liv gave her a brief but very tight hug.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to thank you for being there for Rio. She's important to us, to May and Peter and myself, and it's good to know that there's someone else who cares for her so deeply."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Thank you. I wish I could do more for her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not always the most perceptive with emotional matters," Liv said, "but I sense that your just holding her hand, staying by her side, is more than enough."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">All the way back to New Jersey, Rio seemed in better spirits than she had since Lenny's revelation. She cracked goofy jokes, sang along to the radio, and never missed a chance, when the car was at a stop, to reach across and squeeze Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We good?" she asked once as they got closer to campus.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We're good. All good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Thanks. Thanks for always being there. For helping me, and letting me be there for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio helped Agatha carry her things into Sherwood Hall, helped her make the bed, then sat with her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to know," Rio said, "that I'll always be with you. I... I'll always look out for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Something in her tone, her expression, sent a bolt of fear through Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll always look out for you too," she said, and grabbed Rio's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For a while, there was no sound in the room but that of their breathing. Feeling suddenly cold and panicky, Agatha kissed Rio fervently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Make love to me?" she whispered just after, when their lips were barely a breath apart.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was slow and easy, just grinding at first. Then Rio was pushing up Agatha's skirt, teasing her cleft through her panties, then pushing the fabric to the side and pressing a finger into Agatha's core and starting to fuck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You like it?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hhuuu... Mm-hmm," Agatha panted.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"God, you're so wet. So tight. Fuck, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off and kissed Agatha hard, starting to thrust finger in and out faster. Agatha moaned. She never wanted this to end.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's my good girl," Rio smirked, curling her finger.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's hips jolted, stuttered, and she came hard around Rio's finger.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"R-rio... Fuck."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The soft motions continued, and Agatha clung to Rio's neck, whimpering and panting as the next waves hit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I gotcha," Rio said.<br/>
"I always gotcha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha lost track of how many times she came, and how many little semi-orgasms budded out between the main ones. When she felt Rio's finger slide from her, she moaned. Rio held her close and rubbed her back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Easy. Easy now, Agatha. Rest, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I need to... You..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You've done enough. Rest for now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha let Rio's embrace, the steady flow of Rio's breath, lull her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She loved Rio. Loved her so much it felt like she would die without her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Jen texted me two days ago," Rio whispered, "and said we're throwing a party on Friday. Do you want to go?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Will you be there?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be there. Want me to come pick you up for it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed her, smoothing her hair back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So Friday, at 7, I'll come get you. We'll have fun, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">Alice came along with them to the party, and it was nice to have her there. She and Agatha had caught up about their summers pretty perfunctorily over the week, but at the party, they were hanging out like real friends again. Rio was up and about a lot, socializing, but she kept an eye on them, coming to check if they needed anything.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Eventually, she came back over again and snaked her arms around Agatha's waist from behind.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Borrow you a little while?" Rio asked, and Agatha nodded, gladly following her to the bedroom.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Need something?" Agatha asked when they were alone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stretched out on her bed, arms behind her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What are we? To each other, I mean."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What... What do you mean?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Patting the bed, Rio nodded for Agatha to join her. Slowly, Agatha went and sat, feeling a touch nervous.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, we've been saying we're dating and whatever, but what is this whole relationship to you?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... It's very... W-what do you want me to say?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Whatever you want. Whatever you feel."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Staring down at her hands on her lap, Agatha felt something turn over in her soul. Was this a good or a bad moment? Did Rio want to know the truth, or was there an answer she expected, true or not?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, don't be afraid," Rio whispered, and her fingers were lightly pressing against the small of Agatha's back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I don't know... I don't understand what you want me to say."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mere. C'mere and let me hold you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lying down, Agatha sighed as Rio embraced her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You ask me what you should say," Rio said, "but let me ask you: what do you want?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I want you. Just you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because," Agatha said, "I love you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked at her, expression unreadable, then released her and sat up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Get up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We need to go. C'mon."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha got out of the bed, trembling, and felt like she would cry.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, what..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Go on. We need to go now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Stumbling from the bedroom, Agatha looked around and saw Alice on the sofa, quite busily making out with Jen. She wondered if she should interrupt, should tell Alice they were apparently leaving, but then Rio followed after and put a hand on her back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon. Heading out."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Where are we going?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your room."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So they left the apartment and headed downstairs. Rio at least opened the doors ahead of Agatha, even the car door when it came to that, but was very quiet.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, what..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio slid in behind the wheel, then looked at Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm... Please, don't be scared. I'm just glad you said it first, because I wasn't sure how to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How to tell you I love you. That I'm in love with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So then what... Why are we going back to the dorm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I can't make love to you in my bed anymore. I've been doing wrong by you this whole time, using a tainted space for that. You deserve to be cared for in a place that's not... That's just for us."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I don't care where we make love."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do, okay? It... It matters to me that you know you're the only woman in my life. That you get the respect you deserve."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As they parked near Sherwood Hall, Rio leaned across and kissed Agatha hard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let's go do this right."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as they closed the door of the dorm room, Rio pulled off her shirt and reached for the buttons of Agatha's blouse, frantic to undo them. A part of her was tempted to simply pull, to let the buttons pop off and go scattering around the room, but she did not want to be so careless tonight. As her fingers fumbled, she kissed Agatha hard again, and Agatha's hands instinctively slid around, thumbs hooking in the back belt loops of Rio's jeans.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm gonna treat you right," Rio whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know you will," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once Agatha's blouse was on the floor, Rio walked her backward toward the bed, pushing her down gently to sit. Agatha reached out to unfasten Rio's jeans, but her hands wandered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This doesn't feel like the pack boxers," she murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, sweets," Rio said, "because it's a cock. We won't use it unless..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha hissed, "I want you inside of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's hips twitched forward, and she reached out to stroke Agatha's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Want my cock?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, lying back on the bed and lifting her hips so Rio could peel off her jeans. She was wearing <u>the</u> panties. The ones that had started them down this messy road that led to love. Rio stared, overawed for a moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit," Rio said at last, and slid her own jeans down, kicking them off hard and pouncing on the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For a long time they were lost to very usual pleasures, kissing and grinding and generally getting each other worked up. Rio stuck a hand between Agatha's legs and felt that her panties were already soaked through. Agatha, for her part, squeezed her legs together, trapping the hand and rolling her hips to try to find pleasure.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Slow down, <em>cariño</em>," Rio laughed.<br/>"We have all night."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you now. Please, Rio, I need..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You gonna be a good girl for me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I will. Please, I can be good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know you can. Mmm, you're sopping. You're gonna take me so good, aren't you? Already dripping for my cock."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Freeing her hand from between Agatha's thighs, Rio slid the cock out through the fly of her boxers. Agatha whimpered and spread her legs again, wanting the contact back, wanting Rio's hand, but when Rio pressed the cock against her instead, she let out a long moan.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, Rio, fuck me. Need you to fuck me and... And..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Whatcha need?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Need you. Just need you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Kneeling, Rio pulled Agatha's panties off and slid two fingers through her slit, up and down, testing the slickness there. When her fingers grazed Agatha's clit, that was the cue for another long moan and a small trickle of fluid. Rio smirked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her girl was sensitive.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My good girl. Oh, what I'm gonna do for you tonight."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha sighed as Rio slipped the probing fingers into her, thrusting and spreading them to get things opened up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stretched down and took one of Agatha's nipples between her lips, sucking in time to her thrusts. That made Agatha's hips hump faster and she cried out as her walls clenched tight-tight around Rio's fingers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pulling back, Rio let the waves crash and subside, sliding the fingers slowly out and rubbing the slick from them all over the head of the cock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna go in slow, okay? Tell me if you need to stop."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was trembling, hands clutching at the sheets, a look of frustration crossing her face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just put it in me! Fuck, please, I need to feel you, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With a sigh that was half laugh, Rio angled the cock properly. She pushed it teasingly forward, only enough to begin to spread things a little. She swore she could almost see, almost <u>feel</u>, the muscles of Agatha's entrance fluttering and clenching, trying to draw the cock in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Finally, she let the head pop inside. Agatha's eyes squeezed shut for a moment, breath going shuddery, but when she looked back at Rio again, it was with an expression of wonder and the ghost of a smile.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Y-yes. Oh my God, yes!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio slid a thumb over Agatha's clit, letting the rest of the hand stretch over the mons, fingers against Agatha's lower belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I say something fuckin' stupid?" she whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"G-go for it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I really wish I was about to put a baby in you. Like, right now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's hips jerked, her eyes going wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do it," she nodded, and now it was Rio's turn to be surprised.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had expected dismissive laughter at a minimum.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You'd really want..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy fuckin' shit," Rio murmured, unconsciously thrusting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Half the cock drove into Agatha in one go, and it was not large, but it was new and different, and she hissed in a sharp breath at the intrusion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit," Rio said, "I'm so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She started to pull back, but Agatha grabbed her wrist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I swear if you pull out right now, I'll start a rumor that you have the stamina of a... Something with really low stamina."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You wanna think that one through, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Brain partially offline. No talk. Only fuck. Now!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, ma'am."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">By the time Agatha was shaking and gasping her way through her sixth orgasm of the night, Rio was simply shaking. She had held back through everything, had wanted to get Agatha off as much as possible before letting herself tip over the edge. Now she felt edgy, overstimulated, and in need of help to get through. She collapsed onto Agatha briefly, catching her breath, feeling Agatha's fingers comb through her hair.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Such a good boy," Agatha whispered, and Rio twitched hard at the praise.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You're fuckin' beautiful," Rio groaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Did you cum, sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not y-yet."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Oh, my God, I thought we were keeping pace! What did you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Saving it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For what? The end of days?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This," Rio said, pushing up and drawing her hips back slightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She started thrusting again, easily, lazily, and Agatha's eyelids fluttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can... Can I cum inside?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes! Fucking yes, cum inside me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure? I mean, I can pull out..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No," Agatha growled, legs locking loosely around Rio to keep her close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You want it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want it. I want it... Fuck..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Speeding up, Rio felt her heart racing, her clit throbbing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna... Gonna... Fuck, I'm gonna... Put a baby in you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please," Agatha sobbed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio leaned down and kissed her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We're gonna make beautiful babies together, <em>cariño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then her climax finally hit, shooting through her in a flood of heat and releasing tension.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, <u>FUCK</u>!" she growled, thrusting in deep as her vision momentarily faded to gray.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio came to—not that she had passed out, but she very nearly had—having collapsed onto Agatha again. Agatha was rubbing her back, soothing her quietly, kissing the top of her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That," Rio croaked, "is the hardest I've ever cum in my life."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once the basketball season got underway, Agatha was very worried. It had already been weird, in the run-up, to suddenly be a focus of attention on campus since Rio and she had really made it clear in broader terms that they were an item. But with the start of the season, there was even more attention on her, positive and negative.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Especially when Rio made it clear she wanted the Panty Raids to stop, the powers that be <u>finally</u> made throwing underwear an ejectable offense at games, and people got pissy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Alice started acting the part, in some ways, of Agatha's bodyguard, at least when Rio was not present. They had already been pretty good friends anyway, but now that they were both dating members of the team (it turned out Jen was easily won over too) there was a new aura of kinship. Wanda closed ranks with them as well, and used segments of her late-night show on the university radio station to call out the behavior of people; not by name, of course, but only because there were too many shitty folks. The only times Agatha could be pretty certain everyone would leave her mostly alone on campus was when Rio was physically with her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, whatever happens," Rio said one night, having escorted Agatha back to Sherwood Hall after a game, "I'm gonna protect you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Really?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smirked, leaning in closer for a kiss and to rest a hand against Agatha's abdomen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You and anyone else who comes along eventually, <em>cariño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had made it clear that she did not expect Agatha to attend every game; she did not really expect her to attend <u>any</u> games. Still, Agatha did go to many, usually alongside Alice, Wanda, and a small contingent of drama department kids who had suddenly decided they like Agatha because she had somehow singlehandedly tamed a jock and that was, to them, the height of drama indeed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio would always laugh softly when they met up after a game, either that night or the next day, at the way Agatha would stammer and yawn through an assessment of what she had understood.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you get bored at the games, <em>cariño</em>, you don't have to be there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I want to support you! And see how many people are still getting ejected for throwing panties at you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As busy as Rio was during the season, as well as with her academic concerns outside of that, she always found time to be there for Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you, Agatha. Loving you and helping you is part of my life. Of course I'm gonna do what I can to take care of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were more major problems, of course. Rio got press coverage outside of just the campus media department, and eventually word of her relationship with Agatha reached the worst possible person: Evanora Harkness.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">One Saturday afternoon in early December, Rio had taken Agatha out for lunch. They enjoyed themselves immensely, but when they returned to campus, Agatha spotted a familiar vehicle near Sherwood Hall and groaned, slumping in her seat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweets?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Just drop me off here, okay? I can walk the rest..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, what's wrong? I'm not just gonna abandon you if something's wrong."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you love me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You know I do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then you'll just drop me off and go, Rio. Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Babe..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Blinking hard, Rio nodded and stopped the car.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," she said, and pulled Agatha over for a kiss, "I'm calling you as soon as I get back to the apartment. Tell me if anything happened."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I will."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio still sat there in her car, watching as Agatha walked up the steps and into the building, but then Agatha saw her pull away slowly. With a feeling like doom in her chest and stomach, Agatha turned and trudged up to her room. Sure enough, her mother was there. Alice was trying to run interference apparently, having arrived with an RA in tow just before Agatha stepped into the room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ma'am," the RA was saying to Evanora, who was tossing most of Agatha's things into a suitcase, "we have received no word about your daughter moving out of the hall <u>or</u> leaving the university altogether..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And why should that concern me?" Evanora asked."It's within my right to make these decisions for Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mother, I'm an adult," Agatha said, "and you can't do this. You can't force me to leave."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I can and I will, young lady. I've heard what you've been doing, going around with some little dyke who..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ma'am," the RA—Scott, Agatha thought his name was—said, "if Agatha is over 18, she can make her own decisions about this matter. Just because you may not agree..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Young man, I can buy and sell this place! My family have made extensive donations to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't care, ma'am, if you're God. It's my place to help out the student residents in this hall, and I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Evanora slapped Scott. His head jerked hard to the side and he grimaced. Pulling a small walkie-talkie from his pocket, he clicked the button.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ben, we got a situation over here in Sherwood 310. Can you contact campus security?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A voice came back, so garbled as to be unintelligible.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, we got a mom here unhappy with her daughter's choice of relationship. I have tried to de-escalate, and I have just been assaulted."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Another garbled reply, and Scott stepped closer to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, you and your roommate go and wait out in the hallway, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please? We'll handle this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Alice put a hand on Agatha's shoulder and steered her toward the hall, but Agatha broke away and turned back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mother, you never even loved me. Why do you care what I do now that you're no longer in charge of my life?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Parenting is not a matter of love, you stupid little whore! And as your mother, I will always have final say in matters of your life."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mother..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha moved to try and start taking her things out of her suitcase, only for her mother to grab her arm and, as she had so many times, twist hard, pulling the limb up behind Agatha's back. There was pain, of course, but that was nothing now beside the incandescent rage Agatha felt.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You can't make me do things! I am my own goddamn person!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She managed to pull out of her mother's grasp, only to fail at dodging a hard blow to the side of her head.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">When she woke up, her head was pounding and she was in what seemed like a hospital room.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," a voice said, and it was Alice, sitting near the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What..." Agatha groaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just relax. I'm gonna get a nurse in here, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then there <u>was</u> a nurse, and a doctor, and they were examining Agatha, asking her questions briefly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You have a mild concussion," the doctor said, "so you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know what's up with that," Agatha said.<br/>"Had a few concussions as a kid from the same sort of incident."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once they were alone, Alice took Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your mom got hauled away by campus security. Don't worry, I made sure all your stuff was put back pretty much as you left it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Th-thanks. Don't suppose you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I got in touch with Rio. Well, she called your phone just after things went down and I talked to her. She should be on her way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There was a knock at the door, and Scott peeped into the room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey there, how's the patient?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's awake," Alice said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">He entered and stood at the foot of the bed, smiling kindly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your mother's going to be banned from campus. I take it that won't be a problem for you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not at all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. And hey, your roomie here handled your stuff, so that should be okay. If you guys need anything, you just reach out to me or Ben, the hall director, and we'll take care of it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks. Really, thanks a lot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Scott shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's what I do. You take it easy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">He turned and started to leave the room, only to nearly collide with a blur of motion as Rio tore into the room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Mi luz</em>, wh... What happened?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stalked over to the bedside and took Alice's place holding Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, my mother happened. With the ferocity of a cyclone, as is her wont. She slapped poor Scott there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha pointed to the RA.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit, man," Rio said, and nodded to Scott, "sorry to hear that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, at least she didn't punch me in the head hard enough to cause a concussion," Scott said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit!" Rio barked, looking back to Agatha.<br/>"I fuckin'... All Alice said on the phone is you got hurt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not the first time Mother's done this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Christ! What kind of mother..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio paused, took a deep breath, and nodded to Alice and Scott.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please could you guys give us a moment?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As the others shuffled from the room, Rio lifted Agatha's hand and kissed it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Mi amor</em>, you... Is this what you meant that night when I was first at your room and you said you'd had concussions before?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. A couple when I was younger."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But she... How... Why would she do that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just how Mother is. She's got fuck-you money and rage issues. Not the most pleasant combination."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I <u>kn</u><u>ew</u> I should have walked you to your room. I knew it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But then she might have hit you too, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I don't fuckin' care. If that woman ever comes near you again, and if I ever have the misfortune to meet her in person, I'm probably gonna do something regrettable. Only I won't regret it, because I'll have protected you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, don't... Don't think that way. Don't go out of your way for me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you, Agatha. When you love someone, sometimes you go out of your way for them. You do what you have to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I don't... I don't want to risk you being hurt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I don't want you hurt. You're... You matter so much, Agatha. To me and to others, I know. You don't deserve to be treated like shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was shaking slightly, so Agatha sat up as best she could and tried to hug her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm fine, my love. I'll be fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... Shit, Agatha, what if she'd done more than give you a concussion?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Honestly, I'm surprised she didn't. She's always said there'd come a day when I'd shame her so much she'd have to put me down."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pulled back a bit and looked horrified.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please tell me that's a dark humor thing."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. At least, I don't mean it that way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... She... Your mom has threatened to kill you before?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, more like promised."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. You just said all of that way too calmly, sweets. Like... Like your mom..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She used to show me her Colt .38 when I was being particularly defiant."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded slowly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. That... Well, that's just..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Rio was the one to lean back in and hug Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You never deserved any of that, okay? And I'm never gonna let her or anyone else hurt you again."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Jesus, Vidal, what's up with you lately?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked over and saw Jen and Ororo staring at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You've been stuck in a leg hold for three minutes," Ororo said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm doing raises, not holds."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, by now, it's a hold."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shaking her head slightly, Rio lowered her legs and carefully eased down from the captain's chair. She felt wobbly, and she had to pause and close here eyes to center herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Trouble in paradise, by any chance?" Jen asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Only if you consider it trouble to have learned that your future mother-in-law is a possibly murderous child abuser who should long since have been consigned to Hell."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What the fuck?" Jen asked</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Future mother-in-law?" Ororo beamed.<br/>"So, I take it congratulations are in order? Have you started planning your bachelor weekend yet?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... No. No, I just... Shit, guys, I'm really scared for my girl, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We heard about the incident with her mother," Ororo nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The whole campus did, and I just... I worry now that me being with Agatha is bad for her or something. Like, there's all this weird pressure on her now. You know she's gotten death threats over the decision to stop the damn panty raid thing?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Jen said, shaking her head, "that's fucked up. Like, I don't know Agatha so well, but damn. If you need the squad to go out and beat someone up..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She wouldn't want that. Agatha doesn't want anyone hurt, even if... Even if maybe they deserve it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Grabbing the towel she had left draped over the captain's chair, Rio wiped down the arm pads.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm gonna go catch a shower and head out, if that's okay with you guys."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She shuffled miserably off toward the showers, hearing her teammates chattering away behind her. She wanted to go and see Agatha, but was not certain she should. What if she was doing damage, subjecting Agatha to scrutiny because they were together? Not to mention the whole mom thing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She just wanted to be with the girl she loved. She just wanted them to have a chance to be happy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rushing through the shower, she dried off and threw on her street clothes, then sighed. She <u>would</u> go see Agatha, since this was a rare afternoon they both had free at the moment. There was no way she was going to avoid her girl right now, even as worried as she was.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio made her way across campus, waving to a few acquaintances as she passed. She spotted a few of the groupies as well, and some of them blew her kisses. She ignored them, pulling up her hood and carrying on through the January chill.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she neared Sherwood Hall, she smiled and drew her phone from her pocket, tapping Agatha's contact.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Hey, my love!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, you at home?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Yeah. Alice and Wanda and I just got done with a study session. You coming over?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Just about to rock up and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A guy jogging past shoulder checked her pretty hard, and Rio almost dropped her phone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Rio? Is everything..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, some asshole bumped into me. Like I said, I'm almost to the hall. Hell, almost at the steps. Can I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Something hit Rio in the back, hard, and she gasped slightly. Glancing over her shoulder, she was just in time for a fist to collide with her face, and down she went.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">When her eyes flickered open, Rio knew she was in the hospital.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Oh for </em><em>crying out loud,'</em> she thought.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She felt woozy and confused. Flailing an arm, she tried to sit up. Instantly, a nurse was at her side.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now, don't move around, dear. You're just out of surgery, all right? We need you to remain calm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Surgery?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, dear. Everything went very well, from what I'm told."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's that, dear?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... My girlfriend. I was going to see my girlfriend. I... Some guy hit me, I think."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just stay calm. We're going to move you to a regular room in just a little while, and then we'll see what's next, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Is... What was the surgery? Did that guy mess up my face so bad or something?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, dear. You were stabbed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"St-stabbed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes. The doctor and the authorities will discuss that with you shortly, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Please, someone's gotta call my girlfriend, I... Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll see what we can do, all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they did eventually move her to a room, the surgeon came in and droned at her. "Multiple stab wounds" this and "minimal major organ damage" that and "swelling near the spine but luckily no direct spinal involvement."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, I'm not gonna be, like, paralyzed or anything, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The surgeon shook his head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I shouldn't think so. You'll likely need a great deal of physical therapy given the probable recovery period, of course, but you're in top physical condition, so I don't think you'll have too difficult a time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks for the vote of confidence, doc."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">After he had left, there were cops for a while, grilling Rio for any details should could recall about the attacker. They got sort of pissy when it was clear she remembered very little. Then they left, and Rio felt tired and achy and alone. When a nurse entered the room to check things, Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Am I allowed visitors?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There's no order against it, so you should be."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Listen, my girlfriend... I was on the phone with her when this guy jumped me. She's probably super worried."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's her name?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha Harkness. She..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, she was here a little after the ambulance brought you in. Would you like me to see if she's still here?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please. And send her in if she is?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll see about that for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks. You're a saint, ma'am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She really hoped Agatha was okay. Not too upset or anything. Closing her eyes for a moment, Rio tried to just relax.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Eyes popping open, Rio looked to the doorway. Agatha was there, looking pale and shaky.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Cariño</em>. You okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm not the one who got hurt, am I?" Agatha said, and a tiny smile curled her mouth.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mere to me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha crossed the room and Rio reached out for her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's gonna be okay, Agatha. I'm gonna be okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You just stopped talking on the phone, and then it sounded like you dropped it and the call ended and... Well, Alice and I came downstairs to see if maybe you'd tripped on the steps or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, Jesus. You didn't..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were tears welling in Agatha's eyes, and Rio squeezed her hand gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You were there on the ground, on the path, and there was... Rio, there was so much blood."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay. C'mere and let me hug you a little."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't want to hurt you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay, <em>mi luz</em>. Just... I'm good, all right? The surgeon said the damage isn't bad. I'll be laid up a while, but I'll recover. Are you sure you're okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I thought... I thought I lost you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna take more than some asshole with a knife to take me out, Agatha. No way I'm leaving you. Not now. Not ever."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I graduate in two weeks."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and reached down to pet Rio's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I graduate in a year and two weeks," she said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Means the world's ahead of us," Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Getting nervous?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled, lifting her head from where it was pillowed on Agatha's abdomen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't know from nervous, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Bullshit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. So I get nervous. But I'm not nervous about the future. Not with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Aren't you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio crawled up to hold Agatha, sighing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No way. We're gonna make it. Gonna make a good life together, you and me. I'll get my Master's, you'll get yours, we'll get work, and everything'll be great."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if it's not?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How would it not be? Dr. Isley's basically guaranteed me work in her lab, and there's other stuff I can branch out into as well."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if... What if I mess it up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How would you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My past. My mother."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That wouldn't be you, <em>mi luz</em>. That's her shit. And she's not gonna touch us. Not after the way she cut you off after you followed through on those assault charges."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But what if one day..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha," Rio breathed, curling closer against her, "that bitch will not ever hurt you again. She won't hurt us. She won't hurt anyone or anything we care about. You're free of her. We're gonna be happy and safe, and we'll make a good life together, and someday..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off, and Agatha felt a little thrill of concern.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Someday what, my love?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I dunno. It'll just... It'll all be really great someday, is all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They lay in silence for a moment, Rio spooned against Agatha's back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think about what I asked you about?" Rio said.<br/>
"About moving in with me at the new place?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you really want me to?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I wouldn't've asked if I didn't want you to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're sure it'd be all right? I mean, maybe you'll want some freedom from me. Maybe you'll want to, I dunno, see other people."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why the hell would I want that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha Harkness, I don't want anyone but you, okay? Just you, for the rest of my life. Do <u>you</u> wanna see other people?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Never. I... I've already been dreaming so much about our future."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So have I. Hell, I have lists of names made and everything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Names for..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The kids! I'm thinking, like, Aspen or Cedar for the first one..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are we hippies now?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No," Rio said, "but I am botany."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You <u>are</u> botany?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Or whatever. I dunno. Sleepy now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Turning in Rio's arms, Agatha laughed and kissed her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sleep would be good right now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You feel okay?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. I just... Sometimes it's strange to think you want me forever."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How is it strange? I've wanted forever with you almost since I met you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Guess I still have a lot to work through."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll get through all the shit. We will."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">After Rio's graduation, they got takeout and then went back together to their place. Their apartment. Agatha's things were mostly moved in, and it was exciting to be somewhere private, just the two of them, and to know that this would be their sanctuary for the foreseeable future.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would m'lady care for another pizza burger?" Rio grumbled from her place on the couch.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll help myself, since you seem a little indisposed," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Really should not have gone for that second nacho platter."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I warned you, but you just would not be told."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Spoken like a true wife who knows better than her sad sack spouse."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We're not married yet."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not yet, no. But mark my words, <em>mi luz</em>. One day, when you least expect it, or maybe when you do, I'm puttin' a ring on your finger."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You somehow managed to make that sound ominous. Color me scaroused."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Scaroused, huh? So, are you saying we should take this party to the bedroom?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you feel capable of moving after your overindulgence."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I can probably manage an army crawl and a scramble onto the bed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And after that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You deck me out in the strap of your choosing and ride me until dawn. Or at least until we both fall asleep."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And if I don't want to ride? If I want to be pampered and petted and held down while you fuck my brains out?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">Rio leapt to her feet.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I suddenly feel incredibly rested and agile, <em>mi luz</em>. I think I can just manage all that stuff you were saying."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good boy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grinned, falling to her knees and shuffling to where Agatha sat on the floor.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can a good boy give a good girl a kiss?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Always."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Agatha turned and started to walk out of the bedroom, but Rio followed after.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait. Can we talk a minute?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. Something up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio sniffled—damn dust bunnies—and looked around the room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You, uh, looked really pretty at your graduation."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, my love. You've mentioned that several times in the month since I graduated."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I... I love you and stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I love you too," Agatha smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I... I want to make you happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You do that every day, Rio. Just by being you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha hugged her quickly, then stepped back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, is that what we needed to talk about, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Marry me," Rio rushed, taking a knee.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked down at her, eyes wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait, wait," Rio said, digging in her pocket and at last coming up with the ring box, then deftly opening it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, it's beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Amethyst. I know you like those."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It... This is all... Well, I won't say sudden, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't... You don't have to say yes. I mean, it... I get if this is a lot, or too soon, or if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"May I speak?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now Agatha knelt before Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to marry you. I want to be your wife. But are you sure <u>you</u> want <u>me</u>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, why do you always think I'll turn away from you? I adore you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I've never had anyone love me before. Not the way you do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio sighed, trying to hold back tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well I don't know why. To me, you seem quite easy to love. Will you let me love you? Let me take care of you always?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if we agree to take care of each other always? Would that be all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think we can manage that."</p>
</div><div align="center">
<hr/>
</div><p dir="ltr">"Can we have a winter wedding?" Agatha asked as they lay in bed that night.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can have any wedding you want, <em>mi amor</em>. Anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just think... I think it could be pretty. Some evergreen decor and things like that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sounds beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And then, if it's close enough to, say, Christmas, you won't have a hard time remember our anniversary."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why would I?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I dunno. My main knowledge of how marriages work primarily comes from television shows. There's always a bit about someone's husband forgetting their anniversary."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, so I'm to be the husband now?" Rio teased.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I don't..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, calm down," Rio said, pulling Agatha into her arms.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... Oh, God, I'm already screwing up our marriage and we aren't even married yet."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No you're not screwing it up. We're all good, Agatha. Just gotta take things easy and go slow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Feeling Agatha relax, Rio smiled and kissed her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're gonna be a beautiful bride, <em>mi luz</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You think so?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you. Thank you, my love."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I'll be quite the dashing groom, I'm sure."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? I already have a suit picked out and everything. And besides, sure, maybe I won't be your husband in the most traditional sense, but I do fully intend to be the father of your babies, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know all about that. You love talking about that little eventuality."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm. Speaking of..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stretched slightly and sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You in the mood to try making a baby right now?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed, and it was the most beautiful sound Rio had ever heard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I think I could probably get on board with that."</p>
