<h2 class="toc-heading">I'm Yours</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The auction was held in a nondescript warehouse near the waterfront. Outside it looked rundown and sketchy as hell, but inside the industrial space had been transformed to look more like a luxurious club. Tables and plush dining booths were positioned throughout, each covered with a sharp white tablecloth, and the finest wines and hors d'oeuvres were being served by scantily-clad betas. A brightly-lit stage had been set up at the front of the room, where the auction would take place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had always vowed she would never set foot in an auction house. She had advocated against the barbaric practice for her entire adult life, and during her likely to be short-lived political career she had campaigned on policies that would shut places like this down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she wasn’t surprised at the whispers that erupted around her when she entered the building. She wasn’t ignorant of the critical eyes that followed her as she sat at one of the booths closest to the stage. She knew that being here was career and social suicide, but she didn’t care. She sat straight, legs crossed, posture open and confident.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Senator Harkness, as I live and breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her hackles rise as the cheerful voice grated on her nerves, but she pasted on a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Valentina,” she greeted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never thought I would see you at one of my soirees,” the woman said, sitting daintily across from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Contrary to what Valentina wanted others to think, she was a beta, not an alpha. But she carried herself like one, and fought tooth and nails to maintain power and dominance in spite of not having an instinctual drive for it. Agatha surmised that not having such instincts and hormonal drive was actually a benefit for the other woman, because she could more easily keep a level head in certain situations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother has given me an ultimatum,” Agatha lied. “Mate and produce an heir or be disinherited. And since there are no romantic partners lining up to give me a pup…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, I suppose even the most morally uptight amongst us will cross lines when it comes to money,” Valentina smiled victoriously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morally </span>
<em>
<span>upright,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what I said!” Valentina insisted. She waved over a beta dressed in a silk negligee. “Get Senator Harkness a bottle of the Pétrus, I think we still have a 2005 stashed away somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, ma’am,” the beta replied, scurrying away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s generous of you,” Agatha noted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense, I’ll add it to your tab,” Valentina said with a flippant laugh. She quickly rose from her seat. “Enjoy the evening, Agatha. I hope you find what you’re looking for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A growl threatened to escape Agatha’s throat as the woman walked away, but the alpha managed to fight it down. She had to stay in control, but the longer she was here, the harder it became. It didn’t help that she was close to a rut and even with suppressants she was on edge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The barely-dressed beta brought Agatha a bottle of wine and glass just as the auction got underway. A beta man with a scruffy beard, dressed in a poorly-tailored suit, stepped up to the podium to do the bidding. Then the first of the omegas was led on stage, dressed in even less than the beta waitstaff, her eyes wide in the bright stage lights.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s short nails dug into her palms so hard that it hurt as the woman was instructed to walk from one end of the stage to the other, wobbly on the heels she wore, then turned this way and that as the auctioneer spouted her qualities: </span>
<em>
<span>female, blonde, fair-skinned, twenty-four years of age.</span>
</em>
<span> Then the bidding began, and the alphas around her began bidding, the price going up and up until…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thirty thousand dollars! Sold!” the auctioneer declared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The omega was led off the stage, and the alpha who had placed the winning bid rose and made his way to the side of the stage, where another one of Valentina’s staff was waiting to finalize the sale. Then another omega was brought on stage, this one a young man who barely looked old enough to be there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lot number two is a male omega, brunette, athletic, eighteen years of age, and virginal,” the auctioneer announced. “Shall we start the bidding at ten thousand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The omega boy turned sharply toward the auctioneer. “Ten thousand? I was told the starting bid would be twenty?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud crack echoed through the space as the auctioneer backhanded the omega, and suddenly all the small talk amongst the alphas ceased. The auctioneer straightened his cuffs and turned back to the microphone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On second thought, let’s start the bidding at five thousand,” he announced, and a moment later an alpha raised their paddle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bids went up, but the increments were smaller. Through it all the omega boy stood there, staring at his feet, tears running down his bright red cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eighteen thousand dollars! Sold!” the auctioneer declared with a sneer. The boy was ushered roughly off the stage as the winning bidder made their way to the side of the stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The third omega to the stage was another woman, this one in her late twenties, her eyes glassy and unfocused in the bright lights. Agatha could only guess what she had taken before the auction. Whatever it was, it didn’t deter all bidders, but it definitely reduced the omega’s sale price.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Legally the omegas who were auctioned off had to be consenting adults, but Agatha knew that the definition of </span>
<em>
<span>consenting </span>
</em>
<span>was very loose. As part of her advocacy work, Agatha had spoken to many omegas who had taken part in these auctions, and none of them had done so lightly. They did it because they needed money, usually large amounts of it. Some did it to get off the streets, some did it to pay off student loans, some did it to pay for medical treatment, some did it because of drug addiction. No matter the reason, it was always an act of desperation that led them to sell their bodies like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One after another omegas were led to the stage, their qualities listed, and alphas bid to purchase them. All the while, Agatha sat still and silent, sipping at the expensive wine Valentina had ordered on her behalf, never raising her paddle. As the auction went on, Agatha began to hope that maybe she wouldn’t have to do anything, that maybe the rumor she had heard had been false.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the auctioneer announced Lot 22, and Agatha saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Five years had passed, but Rio still looked the same. Her hair was loose around her shoulders, just as dark and rich as ever. Her skin gleamed golden, though it looked paler than it actually was beneath the bright lights. Her dark eyes were downcast, looking at her feet rather than the audience. She was dressed in a cream-colored lingerie set, silk instead of lace, so it covered a bit more than some of the other omegas that had been auctioned off so far, but beneath the bright lights it was clear to see that the crotch of her panties was so wet that it was nearly transparent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened as she instinctively sniffed, and a familiar orange and ginger scent filled her senses, even at this distance. Rio’s omega pheromones were even stronger than normal, tinged with spice that could only mean one thing: </span>
<em>
<span>she was in heat.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, this was bad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lot twenty-two is a female omega, thirty-four years old, brunette, olive-skinned, athletic build, and fertile,” the auctioneer announced. “And she’s in a natural heat cycle, ready and ripe to take the highest bidder’s knot and bear their pup.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rage filled Agatha and before she could stop it a deep growl echoed from her throat. Suddenly all eyes were on her, including Rio’s. The omega’s jaw dropped in shock at seeing her, but Agatha didn’t have time to focus on that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bidding was starting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s start the bidding at twenty-five thousand,” the auctioneer said, and Agatha immediately raised her paddle. “Can I get thirty thousand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another alpha bid, and Agatha fought down another growl. She couldn’t afford to lose her cool now. She countered every bid even as the numbers climbed higher, the scent of Rio’s heat filling her nose and overwhelming her senses. She didn’t care how high the bid went, she was going to win, and yet the increments kept tiptoeing upwards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sixty-five thousand dollars, can I get seventy?” the auctioneer called out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha let out an impatient snarl. “One hundred thousand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was an awkward pause in the proceedings. Then the auctioneer cleared his throat. “Senator Harkness, the current bid is only seventy thousand—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know what I said,” Agatha growled. “One hundred thousand is my bid. Now do your fucking job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” the auctioneer said. “Current bid is one hundred thousand, do I hear one hundred and five?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had hoped that by jumping the bid, the other alphas would back off. But the auctioneer had to go and say her name, and it seemed something about that had had the opposite effect, sparking interest in the omega on stage and a sense of competition against Agatha herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One hundred and five!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One hundred and ten!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One twenty!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One thirty!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One fifty!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bidding continued to climb, even without Agatha raising her paddle. On stage she could see Rio shifting her weight from foot to foot, whether from nerves or discomfort from her heat, Agatha couldn’t tell, but the move made the white silk panties she was wearing cling to her even more and her heat-scent drifted out into the room. The scent had Agatha half-hard in her pants, and she knew it was probably affecting the other alphas the same way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One seventy-five!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two hundred!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was getting out of hand. Rage filled Agatha, burning in her veins like wildfire. How dare Rio do this to herself? How dare she sign up for this, put herself in this position, put </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha </span>
</em>
<span>in the position of having to stake her claim like this? It should’ve never happened, Agatha should’ve never </span>
<em>
<span>allowed </span>
</em>
<span>it to happen. Rio should be home right now, Agatha’s claim mark on her neck, safely in her den waiting for her mate to sooth her heat, to fill her with seed and make her round with their pup. Not on an auction block where all of these alphas could see her, smell her, want her for themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood from her seat and walked toward the stage, her stride calmer than she actually felt. Around her the bidding continued, the price climbing steadily higher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two twenty-five!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two thirty!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two hundred fifty thousand!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Senator Harkness, I must ask you to please return to your seat,” the auctioneer instructed as she approached the stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m ending this,” Agatha said, but her eyes weren’t on the auctioneer, they were on Rio. The omega met her gaze and gave her a minute nod. Agatha turned to the auctioneer. “One million dollars. Finish it."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One million dollars!” The man glanced toward the back of the room, probably checking in with Valentina, to see if she wanted him to continue driving the price upward, to continue pushing Agatha, or if she wanted him to stop. “Going once, going twice… SOLD! To Senator Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked victoriously, crossing her arms over her chest as she turned to look at Rio. But instead of looking pleased, the omega still looked terrified as she was led off the stage. Agatha wanted to follow, but instead she was ushered to the side of the stage to arrange payment. The auctioneer was already beginning the next round.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lot twenty-three is…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well well well, it seems like you found exactly what you were looking for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growled outright this time as Valentina rounded the table, unable to tamp her instincts down. The woman might not be an alpha, but Agatha’s instincts recognized her as the biggest threat in this establishment, the one thing that could keep her from her mate.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her mate? </span>
</em>
<span>Oh, this really was getting out of hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I did,” Agatha replied, trying to tamp down the possessive and protective instincts. “And she’s already in heat, so I should be able to appease my mother’s demands quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm, yes,” Valentina said, watching as Agatha entered her payment information into the tablet she was offered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up at the beta, whose eyes were fixated on the rotating loading screen on the tablet. “You think I’m not good for it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, I know you are,” Valentina assured her. “I’m just trying to figure out what it is about that omega that would make Agatha Harkness, staunch advocate for the dissolution of the auction houses, bid a million dollars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like you said, she’s exactly what I’m looking for,” Agatha replied. “When I see something I want, the cost doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I do hope she fits your needs,” Valentina said as the payment went through. “And remember, if you’re not satisfied, you can always come back again. We’re always getting fresh stock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip curled in disgust. “I’d say it was a pleasure doing business with you, Valentina, but that would be a lie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman laughed at her candor. “You really know how to make a woman feel appreciated, Agatha. I’ll leave you with Mel to finish the paperwork, I have business to attend to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as the beta walked away, but instead of walking back into the crowd of bidding alphas, Valentina headed behind the stage, to where the omegas were waiting. A growl bubbled up in her throat, but she swallowed it down, turning back to the younger beta who was pulling up the sales contract on the tablet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to need you to hurry,” Agatha said, her voice low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The beta just rolled her eyes, clearly used to dealing with pushy customers. “Right, Alpha, I’m going to need you to sign here, and here, and initial here, and…”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio made her way off the stage on wobbly legs, shuffling past the next omega headed out, and was ushered into the small room where she had left her clothes. The door was shut and locked behind her, and as the air cleared, Rio finally felt like she could breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had bought her. Oh, god, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha had bought her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio never imagined she would end up in an auction house. The daughter of a single mother, Rio knew what desperation felt like. She had watched her mother work her ass off when she was a child to keep them out of situations like this, and Rio had sworn she would never end up here. She had racked up some student loans in college, sure, but nothing she hadn’t been paying off regularly. She was employed and managed her money well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then her mother got sick, and everything changed. Rio had done everything in her power to help her mother, moving back home to take care of her, taking off work to take her to her treatments and care for her after surgery. At first the cancer had responded, and doctors had been hopeful. But then, a year into the treatments, things turned. The cancer had spread, first to her lymph nodes, then to her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Around that same time, Rio was let go from her job for “excessive absences.” She hadn’t been in the position long enough to qualify for any legal protections, so she had packed up her desk and come home. It didn’t seem to matter at the time; her mother needed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the cost of treatments was also adding up. Her mother took out a second mortgage to help pay for it, Rio sold her car and stuck to driving her mother’s beat up Civic. They threw everything they could into the medical costs, and the doctors threw everything at the cancer, and yet it continued to spread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the oncologist told her about an experimental treatment protocol, something that hadn’t yet been approved in the US. There was a trial being done in Belgium, and the oncologist thought he could get Rio’s mother approved for it. But Rio had to find a way to afford to move her mother there for the duration of the trial, and the estimate on that cost was over fifteen thousand dollars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was how Rio found herself in an auction house, on the auction block, selling her body to the highest bidder. What she was still confused about, however, was exactly how she came to be purchased by Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mere thought of the alpha was enough to make Rio drip with slick. Goddess, she was fucking pathetic. Five years since she had seen Agatha, and she still had this kind of effect on her body. She really shouldn’t be surprised, though, attraction and sex had never been an issue between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just communication.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had just managed to put on her sweater when the door opened. She was expecting Agatha to enter the room, but instead it was Valentina, the overseer of the auction. The beta closed the door behind her, then turned on Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness just spent one million dollars to purchase you,” Valentina said, her voice low and measured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew, immediately, that she couldn’t let on that she and Agatha had a past. So, instead of reacting, she just blinked with feigned confusion. “Who?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t play dumb with me, omega,” Valentina scoffed. “You’re going to tell me why one of the richest alphas in the country, who could easily have any omega she wants in her bed, who is vehemently </span>
<em>
<span>against </span>
</em>
<span>auction houses and has tried to get them shut down multiple times, spent a record breaking amount of money on you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was cut off as Valentina slapped her across the face. Rio clasped her cheek and bent over into a defensive position as Valentina stood over her, shouting. “You lying little cunt! Tell me how you know her or I’ll—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Valentina.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped as the scent of lavender and amber washed over her, but it was cut with the acrid scent of Agatha’s fury. Valentina wasn’t affected by the scent, but even she could sense the barely-restrained rage in Agatha’s soft utterance of her name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Senator Harkness,” Valentina said, standing straight and taking a step back from where Rio was still hunched over in the center of the room. “I was just making sure your purchase was—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice cut off as Agatha took two deliberate steps toward her, backing the beta woman into a wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you ever touch what is mine again, it won’t matter that you’re a beta,” Agatha said, her voice low. “I will ruin you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha—”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you even breathe in her direction again, I will burn everything you value to the ground, Valentina,” Agatha continued. “Do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The beta nodded, and Agatha stood back. She turned to Rio, nostrils flaring as she took her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get dressed, we’re going home,” Agatha instructed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed her pants and yanked them on, ignoring how wet and ruined her panties were beneath the denim, ignoring how uncomfortable the fabric felt against her heated skin. As soon as she was dressed, Agatha grabbed her by the arm, not too roughly, and led her through the narrow hallway and out of the auction house, into the night air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped so suddenly that Agatha released her hold on her arm, drawing in deep breaths of the cool, fresh air. The entire auction house had smelled of a sickening mixture of anxious omegas and horny alphas, and it had set Rio’s nerves on edge. Rio looked up at the sky and closed her eyes, taking deep breaths in through her nose and out through her mouth. The industrial area of the city they were in didn’t smell great either— a mix of car exhaust and smoke from the nearby factories— but it was better than inside. Then the warm scent of lavender and amber hit her nose, mixed with warm tones of vanilla, as Agatha stepped closer, and Rio breathed it in like she was half-drowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you hurt?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her eyes and Agatha was standing just inches away, staring at her with sharp blue eyes. She reached up and cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb lightly stroking over where Valentina slapped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio assured her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She never should’ve touched you,” Agatha growled, and it made Rio smile. Five years later, and Agatha was still just as protective and possessive as ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promise I’m fine,” Rio repeated, reaching up and placing her hand overtop of Agatha’s. “She can’t touch me now.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m yours.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to remember herself, and she looked around the parking lot furtively. “Let’s go. I’d rather not be seen here any longer than I already have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to ask why she was there in the first place. While some things seemed unchanged since the last time they had been together, she wasn’t naive enough to think Agatha was the same person. Rio had always said she would never end up on the auction block, and Agatha had always been staunchly opposed to partaking in the auction process, and yet here they both were. Perhaps Agatha now frequented the places, Rio wouldn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was distracted from that train of thought when Agatha approached a private limo, the driver stepped out to open the door, and Rio was struck with yet another familiar face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alexei?” she exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Rio!” the older alpha replied in excitement, pulling her in for a tight hug. “Ach! It is good to see you, </span>
<em>
<span>kroshka!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, Agatha growled fiercely, and Alexei immediately let her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apologies, boss lady,” Alexei said. Then he turned to Rio and said in a hushed voice, “She is like a </span>
<em>
<span>zloy zayka, </span>
</em>
<span>a very angry bunny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed as she got into the limo, and Rio scooted in beside her, sending out calming pheromones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just Alexei, and he’s already mated,” she said, soothing the alpha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still don’t like it,” Agatha grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brow crinkled and she took another sniff of Agatha’s scent, confirming her suspicions: Agatha was going into rut, which explained her being possessive, or at least more possessive than normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alexei, how’s Melina and the girls?” she asked, trying to steer the conversation to remind Agatha that the other alpha wasn’t interested in her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ach! They are very good,” Alexei said, his accent heavy but his tone immensely fond. “Melina teaches at university still. Natasha works for the government, I don’t know doing what, but is very important. And my little Yelena just graduated university, she is travelling now, backpacking through Europe with her girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s amazing, Alexei,” Rio replied, leaning into Agatha’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is your mother?” Alexei asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not doing well, I’m afraid,” Rio told him. “Cancer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I am sorry to hear that,” Alexei said sincerely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Paloma has cancer?” Agatha asked, then in a lower voice, “Is that why you were in the auction?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a small nod. Agatha looked away, but the alpha’s hand wrapped around her own and squeezed and she didn’t let go for the rest of the ride.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t believe in heaven or hell, but if she did, her behavior in the back of the limo definitely earned her a spot in heaven. Sitting beside Rio, breathing in her heat-scent after five years apart, and not acting on it was the second-most difficult thing Agatha had ever done in her life. Rio’s scent, sweet and clean and spicy, filled her senses, and the omega kept leaning into her side, instinctively seeking comfort and safety, things that Agatha had once happily provided for the other woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Things Rio had rejected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alexei dropped them off at her townhouse, and Agatha placed her hand on the small of Rio’s back, guiding her up the front steps and inside. It was only once they were inside the foyer that Agatha realized she hadn’t really planned this far ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been trying to shut down the auction houses for years, even before she became a senator. It was a personal vendetta for her: her omega father had been purchased from the auction, and her mother had treated him as little more than a walking womb. When he had failed to give Evanora any children besides Agatha, she sent the omega man away and barely let Agatha see him when she was a child. He died when Agatha was eleven, before she even had a chance to get to know him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Valentina Allegra de Fontaine ran several auction houses, and had spoken loudly against Agatha’s campaign to have the practice outlawed several times. She always claimed that consent from the individuals signing themselves up for auction was paramount, and so Agatha had several attorneys and private investigators following Valentina’s auction houses, watching for any sign that the beta was breaking any laws. If Agatha couldn’t change the laws to outlaw the houses entirely, she could try and shut down the largest ones. All she needed was to find one infraction, one missed signature, one solid case of coercion that would hold up in courts, and she would bring the auction houses down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t found anything. Until she found Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice had brought her the list of omegas being auctioned off two days ago, a peculiar look on her face. It was only when Agatha read the manifest and spotted her ex’s name that she realized why.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now Rio stood in her foyer, taking in the chandelier that hung overhead and the floral landscape on the wall. This place was Agatha’s home, and so filled with her scent, but after only minutes inside Agatha found Rio’s own scent pervading the space, mixing with her own in the most comforting way. Like the omega belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck were you thinking?” Agatha demanded as she hung up her coat. If she focused on her anger, maybe she wouldn’t do anything stupid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I needed the money for my mother’s treatments. You of all people know that medical debt is one of the biggest reasons omegas end up in the auction houses, either their own or a loved one’s,” Rio explained. Then her expression morphed into anger. “And what were you doing there? You always swore that you would never set foot in one of those places, yet you were there tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew exactly what she was being accused of, and she didn’t like it one bit. “I was there for you, Rio! I saw your name on the auction sheet and I couldn’t let you do that. I couldn’t let you be auctioned off to sell your body to some stranger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s none of your business if I want to let some stranger fuck me,” Rio argued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never should’ve gone there,” Agatha said. “You should’ve just come to me. I would’ve taken care of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not yours to take care of, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, and whose fault is that?” Agatha asked, stepping toward the omega. </span>
<em>
<span>“You </span>
</em>
<span>left </span>
<em>
<span>me, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio, not the other way around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I left because you shut me out!” Rio shouted. “I left because you didn’t want me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have always wanted you, Rio,” Agatha shouted back, though it was completely unnecessary. Rio was backed up against the bottom of the stairwell, her body just inches away from Agatha’s. The alpha could feel her body heat radiating through their clothes, could smell her arousal. But she could also smell her anxiety and her sadness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t lie to me,” Rio said, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” Agatha insisted, reaching up to cradle her face. “I never stopped wanting you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you rejected me,” Rio muttered, tears welling up in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Agatha asked. She was fairly certain she had never rejected Rio, was actually incapable of doing so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her aside, and Agatha let her go. The omega sat at the bottom of the stairs and looked up at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were supposed to mate during my first heat cycle after… after Nicky was born,” she said, reaching up to wipe tears from her eyes. “I came home one day and you had left suppressants on the bathroom counter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it would be better if we waited,” Agatha said. “It had only been six months since he was born, since you’d been through a traumatic birth, since we…” Her voice trailed off as the pain crashed into her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since we lost him,” Rio finished for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and sat down on the step beside Rio. Losing their son had been the worst thing she had ever dealt with in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s conception had been an accident. Rio was a political journalist, Agatha was a staffer for Congresswoman Lilia Calderu. They had only been seeing each other for a few months when Rio had a heat that wouldn’t respond to suppressants. Naturally, Agatha had helped her through it, and they had used condoms the entire time. It had been fine, until on the last day of Rio’s cycle when the condom broke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt like a newly-presented teenager rather than a thirty-seven year old adult as she waited outside the bathroom for Rio to pee on a stick three weeks later. When the test was positive, they had debated their options, and decided that they wanted to keep the baby. Rio moved into Agatha’s apartment, and they made a go of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Things had been surprisingly easy. Not perfect: they argued over things big and small, but they always found a way to make up, and the make up sex was great. But the two of them were remarkably similar, and they fit together with ease. They talked about mating, permanently, but had decided to wait until Rio’s first heat after the baby was born.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pregnancy was completely textbook, until the day it wasn’t. Their baby boy measured perfectly normal on all his scans, Rio ate healthy and stayed active, and Agatha doted on her. Rio teased that their son would be the most spoiled baby on the planet with Agatha as his sire, and Agatha hadn’t argued that point. She constantly had her hands on Rio’s belly, feeling their baby move, and spoke to him through her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, one day, when Rio was thirty-eight weeks pregnant, she didn’t feel the baby move. They didn’t think much of it at first; the baby was big, and he was probably running out of space to move in there. But as the day went on, and hours passed without any stirring inside her, Rio grew more and more concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they got to the hospital, their son was already gone. His umbilical cord had become tangled, and cut off the blood flow and oxygen supply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What came next was absolute hell. Rio had to be induced, and she had to give birth to their son. Agatha had held her as she pushed and cried. The baby was born silent, but Agatha didn’t think she’d ever forget the way Rio screamed when she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was perfect. Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes, a head of dark hair like his mother. They named him Nicholas, Nicky for short.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They buried him two days later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Afterwards, they tried to go back to the life they had planned to have together. They both went to therapy, tried to deal with the loss. They held each other when the nights were too long and the grief too much to bear alone. Agatha kept waiting for the day that it would stop hurting, the day when she felt like her life could start again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It never came.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, six months later, when Rio told her that she could feel her heat coming on, Agatha panicked. It wasn’t that she didn’t want Rio as her mate; Rio was it for her, and even in the darkest depths of her pain she had never doubted that fact for a minute. But Agatha couldn’t imagine moving on with such a big step in their relationship when the pain was still so overwhelming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she called Rio’s doctor and requested the suppressants, picked the prescription up from the pharmacy, and left them on the bathroom counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She told herself that Rio would be grateful, that what she was doing was the best thing for both of them. But that was a lie, Agatha knew it then and she knew it now. Agatha was a coward, she shut down and didn’t even discuss it with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should’ve realized that Rio would see it as rejection. She should’ve known that a hormonal omega, especially one who was still dealing with an incredible emotional loss, needed the stability that a mating bond would bring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered finally. “I should’ve… </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck, </span>
</em>
<span>I should’ve realized how you would perceive it. I’m so fucking sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should’ve confronted you instead of just leaving,” Rio argued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I shouldn’t have shut you out,” Agatha sighed. “Fuck, Rio, you deserve so much better than me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio said, her voice once again strong and sure, “you put aside your pride, your status, risked everything just to come get me out of that auction house tonight. There is no one better than you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slightly, until she was almost facing the omega. “You still want me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly. “Sweetheart, I’ve never wanted anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips were just as soft as Rio remembered. She wasn’t entirely sure which one of them had leaned in for the kiss first, only that one moment she was staring into the alpha’s piercing blue eyes and the next her lips were on hers. She could taste wine on Agatha’s lips, and the alpha’s rich scent enveloped her like the sweetest embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take me to bed, alpha,” Rio murmured when they finally parted for air, and nuzzled against Agatha’s nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips spread in a wide smile. She pressed one more quick kiss to Rio’s lips before standing and helping her up. She led Rio up the stairs, down a narrow hallway, to a large bedroom at the back of the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The bathroom’s through there,” Agatha told her. “Get comfortable, and I’ll be right back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The alpha disappeared back out the door, leaving Rio alone in her personal space. It was decorated in Agatha’s taste— lilac walls with white trim, a king-size bed with an intricately-carved bed frame. But a pothos plant sat on one end of the dresser, its vines intertwined with fairy lights and draped over the vanity mirror. A familiar monstera sat in the corner between the bathroom and closet doors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Five years. Agatha had always acted like she hated Rio’s houseplants, but she had kept these two alive for five years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio quickly cleaned up in the bathroom, stripping off her clothes and the ruined underwear underneath. Their emotional heart-to-heart had been a momentary distraction from her heat, but it had simmered beneath her skin the entire time. Kissing Agatha had only stoked the flame, and now Rio felt like there was an inferno burning her from the inside out. She pulled back the covers on Agatha’s bed and looked down at the clean white sheets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were going to ruin those sheets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lay down on the bed, stretching languidly. She turned her head on one of the fluffy pillows and inhaled, breathing in the soft lingering scent of laundry detergent and </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha Agatha Agatha. </span>
</em>
<span>There were no other scents here, no other omegas had graced this bed, and the thought filled Rio with pride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>hers, </span>
</em>
<span>and no one else’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up to see Agatha in the doorway, staring at her with wide blue eyes and a slack jaw. The omega grinned and stretched languidly, enjoying the way the alpha’s eyes raked down her body. She could see Agatha’s cock, hard and ready beneath the dark brown suit she wore, and Rio </span>
<em>
<span>ached </span>
</em>
<span>for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I, um… I brought some water and snacks for… for later,” Agatha told her, gesturing to the tray in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart fluttered. </span>
<em>
<span>This </span>
</em>
<span>was why she had chosen Agatha as her alpha. Even burning with need, Agatha always took care of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Put that down and come to bed, my love,” she beckoned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a stubborn woman, but she wasn’t stupid. She hurried to the edge of the bed, placing the tray on the nightstand, before turning to look at Rio fully. Her blue eyes swept up and down Rio’s body, head to toe, up and down, and yet she stood frozen beside the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio called softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The alpha shook her head, a bittersweet smile twisting her lips. “I feel like if I move, you might disappear. I’ll wake up and all this will have been a dream.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up and scooted to the edge of the bed, opening her legs and reaching out to pull Agatha closer by the lapels of her blazer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going anywhere,” she promised. “Now, as gorgeous as you look, let’s get this suit off. I want to feel you against me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unfastened the buttons on the front of Agatha’s dark brown blazer, revealing a simple black front-fastening bra underneath. Rio unhooked the bra with a swift flick, and Agatha shrugged it and the blazer off, letting both pieces of clothing fall to the floor, Rio leaned forward and pressed open-mouthed kisses to the alpha’s breasts, laving her tongue over first her right, then her left nipple, before kissing her way down between the alpha’s breasts, down the flat plane of her stomach. She traced the faint outline of Agatha’s abs with her tongue, and Agatha groaned above her, reaching down to bury her hands in Rio’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She made quick work of the buttons and zipper of Agatha’s slacks, kissing along the waist as she pushed the fabric down, over the soft swell of the alpha’s hips, taking her silky boxers off in one smooth motion as well. Agatha’s cock rose to attention, thick and purple-red with need, leaking copious amounts of pre-cum. It twitched and pulsed as Rio took the base in her hand and licked her lips hungrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, don’t te— </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, fuck, Rio!” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha exclaimed as Rio took the tip of her cock between her lips and sucked lightly. Agatha panted above her, hands digging into her scalp, as Rio bobbed her head, taking more and more of the thick length into her mouth. “Not gonna last long if you keep that up, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doubled her efforts, working the alpha’s cock deeper and deeper into her throat while massaging the base with her hands. She could feel the loose skin at the base threatening to swell into Agatha’s knot as she bobbed her head, taking the alpha’s cock halfway to the base before retreating back up and leaving a wet, sucking kiss on the tip. She repeated the motion over and over as Agatha began shaking with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she pulled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the—” Agatha began, looking at Rio with wide eyes as the omega scooted back onto the bed and lay down. “Fuck, baby, I was getting close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said with a pout. “But I just couldn’t wait any longer for you to be inside me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s disappointment disappeared with those words. Her expression turned feral, and she crawled onto the bed and above the waiting omega. They fit together like two puzzle pieces, Agatha’s hips resting in the cradle of Rio’s pelvis, their breasts soft and lush against one another. Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck, pulling her down until their lips were just a hair’s breadth apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve missed you,” she murmured, grinding her hips up until Agatha’s cock was fit perfectly against her wet folds. “Goddess, I need you inside me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Agatha murmured, lowering her head to kiss the omega. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tongue licked into Rio’s mouth lazily as the hand not holding her weight traced its way down Rio’s body, stopping to cup her breast, thumb flicking softly over her nipple and the steel barbell that went through it. Then her hand went lower, across the soft expanse of her stomach, through the neatly-shaven curls at the apex of her thighs, and lower still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, you’re dripping for me,” Agatha sighed, her fingers slipping and sliding over Rio’s clit. Rio’s hips bucked off the bed as Agatha stroked her, her fingers gentle and not giving her enough pressure to really build up to anything, but that wasn’t the point. A moment later, Agatha pushed one finger into her dripping cunt, followed soon after by a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please,” Rio sobbed, nails digging into the alpha’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gonna get you ready, baby,” Agatha soothed, thrusting slowly in and out of her. “It’s been a while, gotta stretch you for my cock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned in frustration as Agatha continued her slow thrusting, eventually scissoring her fingers inside her, stretching her out. It was good, so </span>
<em>
<span>fucking good</span>
</em>
<span>, but not enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, please, my love,” Rio begged, desperate for her. “I need you inside me, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha agreed, and Rio could’ve cried in relief. She withdrew her fingers and wiped them on Rio’s stomach, but rather than moving back between her thighs, she reached toward the nightstand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Rio asked, her voice high with desperation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should have some condoms in the drawer,” Agatha muttered, stretching for the drawer handle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sob that left Rio’s throat was entirely involuntary. Agatha froze and looked toward her, and Rio clasped her palm over her mouth, just as surprised as the alpha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, too quickly judging by the look Agatha gave her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, my love,” Agatha pushed, propping herself up on her elbow, no longer reaching for the nightstand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An ache was blooming in Rio’s lower abdomen. She needed her mate, needed her teeth on her neck, needed her knot in her cunt, needed her seed deep inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want you inside me,” Rio said, parting her legs enticingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just a minute, I promise,” Agatha assured her, again going for the nightstand, but Rio reached for her, drawing her attention back to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, sweetheart, I mean…” Rio’s voice trailed off. “I want you to come inside of me. No condoms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time it was Agatha’s turn for an involuntary reaction, as a primal growl rumbled in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” she asked, but she had already abandoned her attempt to get to the nightstand and was moving back toward Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Rio said. “We’ve wasted five years. I don’t want to waste anymore. I want your bite, I want you as my mate, and I want you to put a baby in me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words seemed to strip the alpha of any modicum of self-control she had left. She moved over Rio and pressed a hungry kiss to her lips. Then she rocked back on her heels between Rio’s spread thighs, stroking her hard cock as she looked down at Rio’s glistening cunt with barely-restrained hunger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want my knot, baby?” she asked. Her voice was low and gravelly and it sent shivers down Rio’s spine. When Rio didn’t respond, she slapped her thigh, and the sting made her moan low and deep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please, my love, give me your knot,” Rio begged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me to bite you and make you mine? Mark you so everyone knows exactly who you belong to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Agatha,” Rio moaned, hips bucking. She could feel a river of slick leaking out of her, so much of it that she was sure that she was ruining the sheets beneath her, but Rio didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me to fuck a baby into you?” Agatha asked, finally moving to position her leaking cockhead at her entrance.</span>
</p><p><span>“Fuck, yes,</span> <span>Agatha, ple— </span><em><span>ease!</span></em><span>” Rio screamed as finally, </span><em><span>finally</span></em><span> the tip pushed inside of her.</span></p><p>
<span>“You feel so good around me, baby,” Agatha sighed, thrusting slowly, entering Rio inch by glorious inch. Rio reached up and grabbed onto Agatha’s shoulders, fingernails digging into her skin as she stretched her. It was good, so </span>
<em>
<span>fucking good</span>
</em>
<span>, but it wasn’t enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of slow, methodical thrusts, Agatha’s hips rested flush against her own. Rio felt her walls spasm around the length of it, and Agatha shuddered above her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s toes curled and her back arched as Agatha began thrusting, slow at first, but slowly building up speed. The alpha moved over her, her brown hair falling in a curtain around them, and she kissed Rio with surprising tenderness. The pace built steadily, and with each deep thrust Rio could feel Agatha’s cock stroking nerve endings she didn’t even know she had, sending pleasure cascading through her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clung to her shoulders, holding the alpha close, until Agatha reached up and moved her arms, taking a hand in each of hers and pinning it to the bed on either side of Rio’s head. Then she moved Rio’s legs to her shoulders and began thrusting harder, each motion making Rio hiss from the stretch and the pressure of it. With each thrust, the head of Agatha’s cock rammed into a spot just above her entrance, and it was like she had found the magic button.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god,” Rio moaned, her voice high and damn near pornographic. “Agatha, oh god, oh god, oh, oh, oh— </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio came, and came, and came, for several minutes or a small eternity, she wasn’t sure. Her clit throbbed and twitched, completely ignored, as her walls flexed and pulsed around Agatha’s length. Pleasure ripped through her body in tsunami-like waves, starting from where Agatha continued to thrust into her and radiating out to the ends of her fingers and toes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And still, Agatha continued to move. Her rut was upon her now, and she growled low in Rio’s ear. As Rio came back to herself, she could feel the beginning of Agatha’s knot swelling at the base of her cock, battering against her entrance. Agatha whined and growled, unable to thrust as deep inside her. She grabbed a pillow from the top of the bed and shoved it beneath Rio’s hips, never stopping her thrusting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it, baby,” Rio coaxed as the stretch began. “Give me your knot, Agatha, I can take it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With every thrust Agatha’s hips circled, grinding the knot against Rio’s taut entrance. For several long moments, Rio felt like it might tear her in half, and yet her instincts were screaming for the knot. </span>
<em>
<span>Bite. Mate. Knot. Inside. Seed. Pup. </span>
</em>
<span>Her basest desires repeated like a mantra through her head, her mind unable to summon anything else beyond the sensation of being fucked. She needed Agatha, needed her mate. No other alphas would have her, only Agatha. No other alphas would breed her, only Agatha. Only her love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gonna breed you,” Agatha growled into her ear, slowly but surely Rio’s entrance began to stretch for the knot. “Gonna knot you, gonna mate you, gonna put a baby in your belly, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes my love,” Rio sobbed as she stretched around the widest part of the knot. Agatha reached down between them, the blunt tips of her fingers circling her clit and pressing into that particularly sensitive spot just to the right until Rio felt a flood of slick pulse from her opening, coating the knot as it pressed against her.</span>

<span>Several things happened all at once, or at least in very quick succession: Agatha lowered her head and her teeth sunk into the side of Rio’s neck hard enough to break the skin. With one final thrust, Agatha’s knot slid past the stretched skin of her entrance. Rio came, again, white light like fireworks exploding behind her eyes as pleasure like fire burned through her body. And then, a moment later, she felt Agatha spill inside her, her hot release pumping from the end of her cockhead against Rio’s cervix.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt like it went on forever, and just when she thought it was over, Rio opened her eyes and saw Agatha’s pulsepoint just in front of her face. Agatha cried out as Rio bit down, teeth piercing skin, marking the alpha as she had been marked. Inside, Rio could feel Agatha’s cock releasing a second pulse of cum into the omega’s awaiting womb. The sensation sent more shockwaves through Rio’s body, and she shivered with pleasure against her mate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha murmured into the crease of her neck. “Mine, all mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yours,” Rio agreed, turning her head to press a kiss to the alpha’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long time, after, they only breathed, sharing each shuddering breath as pleasure continued to roll back and forth between their bodies. It had never been like this, not with anyone else, not even with each other when they were together before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, many minutes later, Agatha’s knot began to subside. She pressed a gentle kiss to Rio’s lips as she withdrew, a flood of her seed and Rio’s own fluids following in her wake. Agatha frowned at the sight, and Rio released soothing pheromones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, my alpha, you can fill me up again after we’ve rested for a bit,” Rio reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for the nightstand drawer, but not for condoms. Instead she found a tube of antibiotic ointment, which she carefully applied to Rio’s mating bite, and Rio applied to the bite she had made on Agatha’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it okay that I bit you?” Rio asked. Some alphas didn’t want to be marked by their omegas, and she and Agatha had never discussed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More than okay, my love,” Agatha assured her. “Now everyone knows we belong to each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly and Agatha tossed the ointment back into the drawer before pulling the omega back into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My omega,” she murmured, nuzzling Rio’s jaw. “My mate. My love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yours, my love,” Rio repeated again. “All yours</span>
