<strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal had a burning hatred for rich kids.</p><p>From experience, all of them were mediocre at best, but because their parents had money, they could afford sending them to her, so she could teach them how to play <em>Fuer Elise</em> or <em>Joy to the World</em> at their families’ Christmas dinner parties.</p><p>Once in a while one of them even progressed to studying music, only to change their major to business or politics later, when they figured out, they would have to keep making mommy and daddy proud and playing the piano wasn’t gonna do it. She had long and often debated, with every single one of them, when the best moment would come to tell them they should find a better hobby, one that would both give them more joy and fit better with their talents.</p><p>She wished, <em>oh and there were no words for how much,</em> those rich kid piano lessons weren’t paying her LA mortgage. She had stopped accepting such students for a while, focused on the ones the Conservatory was sending over for her to polish their style – the ones that were really, really gifted and mostly there on a grant, working night shifts at McDonald’s to pay for their groceries. As much as she really, really wanted to focus on them, the Conservatory only paid her a flat fee for their lessons; one much, much lower than what she could ask from more affluent clients. <em>She had a rule. The brattier the kid, the more she charged the parents.</em></p><p>She’d have to stick with it for another while, at least until the fall when she had an engagement in Boston coming up that paid well. Perhaps she could reevaluate her finances again after that and see if she could at least reduce her exposure to unwanted and untalented dilettantes.</p><p>She looked at her living room clock. Speaking of dilettantes – she was waiting for one, a new one. The mother had practically begged her to take her on, something about keeping her away from bad influence and partying after a ten-year break from the piano. Rio had no idea where she would be picking up from, but the doorbell finally rang. At least this one was punctual.</p><p>She ran down the stairs into the foyer where her grand piano sat and where she saw all of her students, mainly for the acoustics, but also because it meant they wouldn’t walk all through her house. The thick walls also kept the room reasonably cool during the hot California summers. She couldn’t wait to take a dip in her backyard pool as soon as she was done with the day.</p><p>The bell rang once more, an impatient one, brilliant, like that wouldn’t reflect in her play.</p><p>She opened the door after taking one last breath, only to be scrutinized from head to toe by the tween that looked at her as if she had arrived at the wrong house.</p><p>“Oh,” she huffed, red <em>Dior</em> bag in hand, humongous sunglasses on the tip of her nose, in a skirt that barely reached her knees.</p><p>“Agnes Harkness?”, Rio asked.</p><p>“It’s Agatha,” she took a break, “and you’re a woman.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow.</p><p>“I sure am.”</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting a woman.”</p><p>Well and Rio wasn’t expecting to let this much afternoon heat into her house.</p><p>“I can recommend a male colleague if you and your mother would feel better about that?” – maybe she was getting out of this after all.</p><p>“No, oh my god, no! I am so tired of white old men telling me what do,” she laughed, took off the sunglasses, and let herself in, walking right past Rio. “This is gorgeous,” she exclaimed, taking in the foyer and carelessly throwing her purse onto the couch next to the grand piano, “I love it!”</p><p>Rio pinched her eyes close as she shut the door, feeling an onslaught of migraine.</p><p>“Thank you,” she pressed out nevertheless as Agatha sat down on the piano bench, opening the fall board and letting her hands glide over the keys without actually pressing down on any of them, scraping her pointy nails.</p><p>“Those will have to come off if you want to take this seriously,” Rio carefully moved the $4000 purse and sat down on the couch, taking her student-ledger and a folder with sheet music she had prepared from the small table.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha exclaimed and made the keys underneath her fingers chime in harmony, before she turned to Rio, rubbing her fingers over her nails.</p><p>This was gonna be worse than she thought, “we’ll see about that,” she sighed. “So, tell me about you. I was told you played when you were younger?”</p><p>“Yeah, for like four years. I stopped when I was twelve and I haven’t touched a piano since then,” Agatha recalled and shifted in her seat, straightening her skirt – something Rio observed from the corner of her eye as she took her initial notes.</p><p>“So nothing for… ten years? At least that’s what your mother said. Why did you stop?”</p><p>Her opposite shrugged. “Didn’t like it anymore.”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“And why are you here? What do you want to accomplish?”</p><p>“I don’t want to accomplish anything; my mother wants me to pick this up again,” she huffed and rolled her eyes, tapping the tips of her shoes on the ground, “she likes the idea of me playing for her guests. And she thinks it’s gonna keep me away from my friends.”</p><p>
<em>Classic.</em>
</p><p>“If you don’t want to be here, I can tell your mother I can’t take any additional students this month,” Rio said dryly, looking up again, and low-key hoping this might be an easy out for both of them.</p><p>Her new student seemed to consider it for a moment, abrasively crossing her arms in front of her chest, scrutinizing Rio once again, seemingly entertaining the thought of cancelling all of this before it had even begun. There was something questioning in the way Agatha took her in, as if she was considering different outcomes to this situation, waying her options. Eventually, and to Rio’s surprise, she shook her head with a sparkle in her eyes.</p><p>“No need Miss Vidal, I’m sure there could be some fun in this,” she pouted.</p><p>Rio blinked twice before opening the folder with her sheet music and nodding, disregarding whatever the comment was aimed at.</p><p>“Anything you still remember from when you played? Or do we start from zero?”</p><p>“I still do all the agility training for my fingers,” she pursed her lips and proudly spread her hands wide for Rio to see, arching her fingers into different directions. It earned her a frown.</p><p>“Any piece of music? Do you still know how to read the notes?”, Rio ignored whatever insinuation or hidden meaning the girl was trying to convey, slowly but surely growing more and more annoyed at the immature girl in front of her.</p><p>“If you have <em>Clair de Lune</em> in there I can try,” Agatha held out her hands, waiting for the sheet music. Rio’s glance was drawn to her fingers again, slender, stretching out longer with these impossible red nails, veins and joints like paths and roads under her skin.</p><p>She pulled the Debussy piece out of her folder and placed it on the music rack in front of Agatha. Leaning slightly forward, she came closer to her head and hair, strongly smelling of lavender and sandalwood. She cleared her throat and scratched her nose instead of inhaling it.</p><p>“Go slow, no need to rush if you haven’t done this in a while,” she mumbled as she arranged the sheets.</p><p>“Oh,” she grinned, “I always go slow when I can Miss Vidal,” Agatha replied and placed her hands on the keyboard, hitting the first notes with a surety Rio hadn’t expected. It left her no time to consider how Agatha’s voice had dropped at least an octave, how her eye lashes had fluttered before she had turned to the music in front of her, and how her nails had scraped the keys before she began to play. And play she did, better than Rio had expected, slow (but then that’s what she had told her, and <em>Clair de Lune</em> wasn’t exactly fast paced), and with intention. Rio remained standing behind her, eyes darting back and forth between the notes and down to where Agatha’s fingers were hitting the keys. She watched her slip and miss notes here and there, nothing she wouldn’t have expected from someone who hadn’t touched a piano in a decade, but the longer her student played, the more Rio felt how her own glance was swept away from the piano and up to Agatha’s face: The way she furrowed her brow, the way her eyes moved over the sheet, reading the music, mouth just slightly agape with her pink tongue peeking out for less than a split second to wet her lips. It was mesmerizing – and completely inappropriate. So she swallowed hard, crossed her arms, closed her eyes and focused on the music again, making mental notes of the parts she wanted to discuss later and possible new pieces she could offer to teach her.</p><p>It took Agatha just about 8 minutes to finish.</p><p>“Jesus, I forgot how much this fucks up my neck,” she complained and rolled her shoulders.</p><p>“You’ll get more relaxed once you get into it again,” Rio answered, looking for a pencil to start the actual lesson and discuss ways for Agatha to improve.</p><p>“That’s what <em>she</em> said,” Agatha snorted and brought a hand up to her face, laughing.</p><p><em>What the actual fuck.</em> Rio looked down at her in shock. Was she doing this on purpose? All the sexual innuendos? She was too old for schoolyard humor.</p><p>“Padden?”, Rio breathed, and Agatha put both her hands next to her thighs on the piano bench, leaning forward, pushing her chest out, but looking up to her.</p><p>“You heard me,” she chimed.</p><p>Her eyes darted down to the neckline of Agatha’s top, the curve of her plump breasts, and when she looked up to her face again, Agatha was biting her lower lip, pupils fixed on Rio.</p><p>“Was I any good Miss Vidal?”, she purred.</p><p>Rio chose to blatantly ignore it. It was the only way forward; she didn’t have the energy to do this today. She would, however, include an extra charge on the bill.</p><p>“For someone that hasn’t played in a decade, well done,” she tried.</p><p>“Aww, thank you,” Agatha smacked her lips and smiled widely.</p><p>“I’m not done – there is obviously room for improvement.”</p><p>Rio stopped for a second. This was where she would normally either sit down right next to her student on the bench or pull out another stool from under the piano to demonstrate specific instructions she had for emendation, but all of a sudden she was wondering if that was such a good idea in this specific case. Agatha seemed to interpret her silence as a cue to move though, because she quickly scooched over to the right side of the chair, patting the space next to her for Rio to sit down. And as if she was an obedient little lap dog, Rio did. She simply had no idea how else to handle the situation.</p><p>Clearing her throat and pushing the thoughts that had made her head spin aside, Rio began to play a part from the very middle of the piece, her right arm gently brushing against Agatha’s – warm and soft.</p><p>“There is a very steady rhythm with very defined breaks in this,” she began to explain, “now when you try this again, I want you to be more intentional with it. The same with the <em>calmato</em> – “<em>Clair de Lune”</em> means moonlight – so that’s what we’re trying to convey through the music, we’re trying to be calm, we’re not hitting the keys so hard,” she continued to play as she spoke, all under Agatha’s watchful eyes observing her every movement. “And if you trim your nails, you’ll find that you’re not making the extra clicking-noise that’s distracting you from all of this,” she added with a grin and stopped playing, scratching her forehead.</p><p>“You know, I might be more inclined to cut them shorter if I had additional reasons to,” Agatha absentmindedly looked at the pointy ends of her nails before gently scraping her index finger over Rio’s right forearm that was still stretched out towards the piano, where her right hand still sat on the keys.</p><p>For the second time this afternoon, Rio wasn’t sure if she’d heard correctly. She jerked her arm back to her side.</p><p>“E-Excuse me?”</p><p>Agatha leaned into her until Rio could feel her breath against her ear.</p><p>“Do you even have any idea how hot you are?”, she whispered and smirked.</p><p>Rio jerked out of her seat, cold sweat running over her neck and back, goosebumps forming where Agatha had touched her on her arm.  </p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?”</p><p>“Oh c’mon, don’t tell me you’re not into women, please,” she stopped in shock, “<em>please</em> tell me you’ve had a girl before”, she almost begged, eyelids fluttering again, one hand toying with the rim of her neckline. Only now did Rio realize how bright and blue her eyes were in the lazy afternoon light that shone through the skylights above them.</p><p>“That’s none of your business,” her cheeks were burning up, her chest heaving like she couldn’t get enough air into her lungs. She hoped it wasn’t showing.</p><p>Agatha, because apparently this was her modus operandi, ignored her. Instead of submissively apologizing and returning to the music as Rio was expecting <em>– no – </em>was hoping, she rose from the bench and took a swaying step towards where Rio had almost backed herself up against the wall.</p><p>“What if I want to make it my business?”, she stopped right in front of her, hands behind her back, “God, you’re so pretty,” she licked her lips, “has anyone ever told you that? Please don’t tell me you have some boring husband that works in real estate and doesn’t treat you like the knockout you are.” Her face contorted into fake worry as she leaned in even closer, so close Rio could smell her again, heady and inebriating. Before she could even begin to form another response in her head, she felt Agatha’s hands on her waist, gentle thumbs hooking themselves underneath her shirt, pointy nails grazing over her sides.</p><p>“The things I want to do to you…”, she whispered more to herself than to Rio, her glance falling to Rio’s chest.</p><p>This wasn’t happening, this couldn’t be happening. Panic rose in her chest, made her breaths short and painful. She did not make it this far in her career to be seduced by a bored twenty-two-year-old. She had heard about male colleagues getting into all sorts of trouble, lawsuits even for alleged sexual relations with their students <em>(both female and male) </em>– she would not become one of them, and certainly not by the hand of this spoiled, little brat.</p><p>Her eyes landed on Agatha’s lips, plush and pink – soft and slightly wet. Tantalizing and maddeningly perfect speaking directly to her suppressed arousal, to the empty sting between her legs. Agatha must have noticed, because she almost took it as an invitation, an invitation to let her hands slide further up, pushing her shirt up with them until she reached the under band of Rio’s bra, excitedly biting down on her own lower lip at what she had found.</p><p>“Do you wear lace for all of your students?”</p><p>No, no she most definitely didn’t, she’d merely picked the first thing she had found in her drawer. But instead of saying that, instead of fighting her off, pushing her back and sending her home, she froze like a deer in headlights when she felt Agatha’s thumbs on her nipples. A breathless, involuntary moan escaped her lips as she felt how Agatha was toying with them over the lace, scraping at them with her nails until they became hard and sensitive. How the fuck had they ended up like this?</p><p>“Is this making you wet?”, she whispered with half hooded eyes.</p><p>It was a rhetoric question. Although she was sure Agatha would love to hear the answer. She didn’t get one though, because just before Rio could launch another futile attempt to fight back, the clock one the second floor stroke four and lifted the spell Agatha had on her.</p><p>“Do I see you again next week?”, she retracked her hands and straightened her back as if she’d not just been egging her on, “I’ll promise to be a good girl and rehearse every day,” she smirked and then added, “and I’ll go have a mani to make these”, she wiggled with her fingers, “shorter if you say it’s absolutely necessary.”</p><p>“Yah they need to come off,” was all Rio could reply, watching Agatha gather the sheet music from the piano before she collected her handbag from the couch, bending forward with her skirt riding up so far Rio could see the white underwear she was wearing just before she was able to look away.</p><p>“Thank you, Miss Vidal,” Agatha cooed and held out her hand. The hand that had been on Rio’s breasts not even a minute ago, the hand that had scraped over her arm earlier, the hand that had previously danced over the keys so effortlessly that Rio now actually wasn’t quite sure if it really not touched a piano in a decade.</p><p>She took it. Held it for a second, felt Agatha’s strong grip.</p><p>
<em>Oh she was so done for.</em>

<strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>For the better part of the first three days, she had the email to Mrs. Harkness drafted, bill for the lesson attached, kindly asking her to find another piano teacher for her daughter.  She never sent it. There was a strange, warm feeling that comfortably settled into her lower belly. She had not invited it in, hadn’t given consent to its arrival. She had no name for it, but it kept her from cancelling the Harkness lessons. She detested it, but simply thinking of it made her cross and squeeze her legs together.</p><p>On the following Thursday morning, she was almost ready to call Mrs. Harkness on the phone and tell her she was sick and needed to postpone. At first, she had planned to do it after breakfast, then decided she wanted to run a few errands first – told herself there would still be plenty time, only when she arrived back home it was already going on two. Cancelling now, would have been nothing short of rude and probably get her a bad review on yelp <em>(Rio wasn’t on yelp).</em></p><p>So she sat at the piano and waited, crossing and uncrossing her legs, debating whether to wear her hair down or not, thinking about whether she should generally be wearing perfume if someone had to sit next to her for an hour. The thought made her smell her armpits and had her rushing into her bathroom to freshen up – just in case. It was a hot summer day after all. Looking at the mirror she wanted to hit herself straight in the face. She was not gonna get all giddy like a teenager over a pretty girl fluttering her eyes at her. She was a professional. This was her job. And she absolutely had to stop Agatha from maneuvering the both of them into a million-dollar sexual misconduct lawsuit.  </p><p>To her full disdain, Agatha was absolutely, catastrophically unstoppable when it came to the matter.</p><p>The skirt she arrived in was even shorter than the last one; and she wore a red tank top with spaghetti straps to go with it, leaving nothing <em>(yeah, pretty much nothing)</em> to imagination.</p><p>“Heyah!”, she hollered when Rio opened the door, “wow that smells good, new room freshener?”</p><p>Yet another hideous luxury handbag landed on her couch when Agatha walked in past her like she’d been here a million times and eventually settled on the piano bench.</p><p>“I practiced,” she chimed and rose her hands for Rio to see, “and I had a manicure,” she proudly waved her fingers at her. Her nails were short and round and purple.</p><p>“Good,” Rio nodded, dragging a little stool next to the bench to create enough distance. Agatha looked at it with a frown. Taking a deep breath in, Rio suggested: “why don’t you show me what you’ve worked on and then we can decide which other pieces you’d like to learn?”</p><p>
<em>So far so good, no sexual innuendos, no flirting, maybe this was gonna go smoothly. Maybe her student had just wanted to test the waters, see how she would react. Hell, maybe she had lost a bet with her friends and had to try to seduce the piano teacher.</em>
</p><p>“Well, I can try if I can even focus enough with you around. Hot women just have a way of distracting me,” she bit her lip.</p><p>
<em>So much for that.</em>
</p><p>“Can you please just play,” Rio sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>“Only if you’ll sit next to me on the bench, Miss Vidal,” she retaliated.</p><p>Rio knew this could go two ways. She could sit there on her little stool and argue with Agatha, which would work her up and she didn’t want to think about the ways in which that could and would escalate – or she could sit down on the bench like the professional she was and listen to Agatha play.</p><p>“Isn’t this going to be even more distracting to you?”, she joked absentmindedly as she moved.</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s <em>so</em> worth it. And if I don’t play well enough you can-“</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes Miss Vidal?”</p><p>“Just play please,” she let out a long breath, but Agatha finally hit the keys.</p><p>It was almost hideous.<br/>She suddenly felt like the most senseless, idiotic, ignorant music teacher on the planet. It made her grin sarcastically. No one in history learned to play <em>this</em> well from one week of rehearsing. No one in history put their own spin on a piece of music like this if they hadn’t touched a piano in years. Agatha was blatantly ignoring any of the cues given by Debussy, she played faster and with more emphasis when she should not have, and quieted out notes she would have had to play in crescendo. Either Agatha had turned into a wunderkind over the past seven days, or she was a liar. A liar so good at playing piano that she was able to fake the mistakes she had made during their first lesson.</p><p>“So… you said you haven’t played in ten years? Not touched a piano since?”, Rio raised a brow when Agatha had finished.</p><p>“Oopsie,” Agatha grinned proudly, “was I any good Miss Vidal?”, she repeated her words from the week before.</p><p>“Why are you even here if you play <em>this</em> well?”, Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Well because I wanted to see you again of course,” she answered nonchalantly.</p><p>“How does your mother think you need lessons?”, Rio ignored it.</p><p>“I have an electric piano at home, I just plug in my old headphones when I wanna play,” she looked at her nails like she was bored.</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“This is wasting my time,” she held up her palms and got up, ready to ask Agatha to leave, she had better things to do than be part of this charade, but Agatha got hold of her wrist.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” she repeated, and it made Rio swallow hard.</p><p>When she looked into Agatha’s eyes, her pupils had dilated so far, there was almost no blue left within them. She looked at her with an intensity that she had never seen before. Her breath grew shallow as her heart rate sped up.</p><p>“Agatha I don’t-“, it was weak and she knew it. And Agatha knew it too because instead of letting her go and walking out of her life like she should have, like Rio wanted her to, she pulled her down again and right to her mouth.</p><p>Rio’s other hand landed on the keys, all of them chiming in dissonance, but it didn’t deter Agatha, who quickly moved her free hand to Rio’s neck, bare and stretched. Kissing turned to biting, from two pairs of dry, soft lips pressed together, to a wet mangling of tongues. Rio felt her climb into her lap, her right hand reaching for Rio’s breasts once more as Agatha kept kissing her until she was moaning into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s slender fingers found one of her nipples, deliciously and slowly stroking it over the fabric of her shirt at first before she took it between her thumb and index finger, rolling it between them, pinching hard until it made Rio hiss in warm, formidable pain. It didn’t seem to be enough for Agatha because she quickly tore Rio’s shirt out of her trousers to reach for the same spot again, cold fingers suddenly enhancing her ministrations.</p><p>“So, no boring real estate husband then?”, Agatha panted when she tore her lips off of Rio’s for a moment, staring at her with an open mouth, never moving her hand away.</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say let alone how to feel about this: her 22-year-old student sitting on her thighs, one hand firmly cupping her breast. She whined softly as Agatha squeezed her nipple again, harder this time. She didn’t have to say anything, she didn’t have to give permission, Agatha saw it in her face. No, <em>no</em> Rio didn’t want her to stop, there was no husband, there never had been – no wife either for that measure. Just shame. A lot of good, old catholic shame.</p><p>Instead of giving it any further thought, she let Agatha kiss her again, bend her backwards so it was no longer her fingers on Rio’s nipple, but Agatha’s mouth, teeth, and tongue, biting and licking and sucking at it as if she needed it to survive. All of a sudden, Rio was leaning against the keys, her shirt pushed up all the way to her clavicle. She almost didn’t bear to watch. There was something obscene to seeing Agatha’s mouth moving over her tits. Even worse, when Rio finally dared to steal just one glance, she suddenly opened her eyes, looking up at her with feverish hunger. It made her stifle a moan and it made Agatha pull away.</p><p>“I’m gonna need you to spread your legs for me,” she commanded lowly, and Rio complied as if she had waited her entire life for someone to tell her what to do. She watched in awe as Agatha came to kneel between her thighs, carefully opening the zipper of her slacks, then lifting her ass so she could take them off. It nearly took her breath away.</p><p>Agatha stared at her sodden slip as if she had just discovered a new continent. She bit her lip without ever looking up to Rio and slowly let her hand glide over Rio’s bare leg all the way up to where the fabric had darkened with need. She let her thumb glide over it, and it made Rio shiver. She was almost embarrassed at how wet and turned on she was, all good and proper intentions blown into the wind because of a pretty girl that was far too young for her. It was nothing short of shameful.</p><p>Her thoughts were thoroughly interrupted when Agatha pulled at the underside of her slip, pushing it to the side to reveal what was beneath.</p><p>“Fuck you have such a pretty cunt,” she mumbled as she looked at it, glistening and swollen. Rio hitched a breath as Agatha, without any pressure, swept her index finger over the folds of skin and short hair. It sent a sweet jolt through her spine.</p><p>“Did you like that? Me stroking your pussy?”, Agatha asked with a low voice and Rio couldn’t prevent herself from nodding.</p><p>“Say it!”, she ordered, and moved her finger over it once more.</p><p>“I-I liked it,” Rio whispered, unsure whether she had really heard herself say it, but the effect was irrefutable, she was growing more and more wet by the minute, the fabric of her panties cutting into her flesh from how Agatha was pulling at them.</p><p>She grinned devilishly.</p><p>“I bet you taste good too,” she whispered and then lowered her head, gently bringing the tip of her tongue to Rio’s clit.</p><p>It was ridiculous how good it felt, Agatha holding her in place firmly while she was pushing her hands down into the bench holding herself in place. Agatha put one if her legs over her own shoulder to steady her further, but also to have better access, as she was lapping at her, first teasingly slow and soft, almost bordering on torture, but then faster until she was sucking at it and Rio couldn’t stop herself from tangling the fingers of her left hand in Agatha’s hair, causing her to groan like an animal in heat.</p><p>It felt so good. So good that she almost forgot the years of self-imposed chastity, the shame she had felt every time she had touched herself to the thought of plump, pink lips on her body and soft hands between her legs.</p><p>She whined again as Agatha sucked her entire clit into her mouth, scraping it gently against her teeth, causing friction that made Rio see stars. Her lips were firmly wrapped around all of her, her head bobbing obscenely, purple nails digging into their upper thighs.</p><p>“Fuck, please, more,” fell from her lips as she hesitantly pushed Agatha’s face closer, soiling the bench beneath her. Agatha sped up, using her free hand to bring a thumb to Rio’s clit, circling it with fervor, pushing down on the delicate bundle of nerves. Then she suddenly looked up at Rio, still moving her hand.</p><p>“Are you going to come for me, Miss Vidal?”</p><p>If that didn’t do it, Rio wasn’t sure what else did. Maybe it was the way half of Agatha’s face was coated in her slick, maybe it was the way she grinned, like she had made Rio her plaything in embarrassingly little time, or maybe it was simply the fact that Rio imagined that this was the real reason the long nails had come off; that Agatha had sat in a nail salon, told one of to techs to cut them short and thought about getting Rio off with them.</p><p>She came with a bitter, suppressed whine and her mind went blank as her walls tightened around nothing and she collapsed onto the bench, Agatha still toying with her clit, never lifting her finger and looking at her studiously.</p><p>“I fucking love your pussy,” she bit her lower lip again before circling her tongue over her lips to lick it all off, “if you come this good for me without having anything inside of you-”, she seemed to lose that train of thought when Rio reached for her wrist, trying to keep Agatha from eagerly overstimulating her. She took her in with hooded eyes, still panting lightly. Agatha looked gorgeous between her legs, hair messy, cheeks pink and still round and soft with youth. She didn’t know what to say. Thankfully she didn’t have to come up with anything. Agatha carefully put her panties back in place – spoiled and wet, she could have just as well taken them off entirely. To Rio’s surprise she didn’t get up right away though.</p><p>“Are you going to call my mother and cancel my lessons?”, unexpectedly, she sounded much younger than she was, almost uncertain. Like she expected a scolding.</p><p>“That depends,” Rio tried to close her zipper while still seated and failed.</p><p>“On what?”</p><p>“Do you actually want to learn something from me or do you just want to…”, she vaguely gestured to her body.</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>“A little bit of both… maybe?”, Agatha tried and Rio took a long look at her, pressing her tongue into her cheek. This was bound to go sideways. This was a bad idea through and through. This easily had the potential to end her entire career.</p><p>“There are some things from Chopin you might enjoy,” she cleared her throat after rising from the bench, diverting her thoughts to where she would be getting the proper cleaner for the velvet upholstering. <em>Did Walmart carry stuff like that?</em> She definitely had to get something else to sit on for the students that would come tomorrow.</p><p>Rio walked over to where her folder of sheet music still sat on the couch and sorted through it, trying to find something suitable.</p><p>“And I want you to listen to Martha Argerich – now most people don’t like her take on Chopin, but your style reminds me of hers,” she chuckled and pulled a few sheets out of the folder, handing them to Agatha, who examined them closely.</p><p>“So Thursday at three again?”, she smiled, and it was a warm, genuine smile. No mischief, no hidden agenda.</p><p>“Thursday at three,” Rio confirmed, hands in her pockets in lieu of doing anything better with them at this point.</p><p>She walked Agatha to her door, a tiny, securely tucked away part of her brain wondering whether one exchanged a good-bye kiss after … well whatever what they’d been doing all afternoon, but Agatha didn’t seem to initiate anything, so Rio wasn’t going to either.</p><p>“One more thing,” she did turn around though, already on the first step, “do you take any other students after me on Thursdays?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, “no, you’re my last appointment for the day.”</p><p>“Good to know,” Agatha grinned, blew her a kiss and ran down the stairs down to where her car was parked.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>A week.</p><p>In simple terms, it’s 7 days, or, a little more specific, 168 hours. 167 hours if you subtract the one hour of their lessons, because obviously Agatha arrived at 3 PM and left at 4 PM, so that’s a good hour less. That also makes it 10,020 minutes, (again, with the 60 minutes subtracted). Not that anyone was counting.</p><p>Not that Rio was counting.</p><p>Rio was, however, feeling like her Friday went on for longer than any other Friday she had ever lived through. Similarly, her Saturday and Sunday dragged on endlessly even though she spent several hours cleaning her piano bench. On Monday, she decided to go to the beach to distract herself. All she carried home from that was an angry sunburn and sand in her living room. <em>Great.</em> On Tuesday, after her last student had left, she even went so far to meet a friend at a local bar go get some alcohol into her system and drown out the images that kept coming back and back to her – <em>long, brown, wavy hair between her legs, short, purple nails digging into her thigh, lips forming a sly smile</em>.</p><p>“Are you okay? You seem different,” Milena, the Bulgarian third violin of the LA Philharmonic asked with her heavy accent after her third shot of tequila.</p><p>Rio just shook her head and downed number four.</p><p>And for some godforsaken reason, <em>she should have known really</em>, having a hangover in your late thirties didn’t exactly make time go any faster either. Instead, she spent the morning bent over her toilet seat and flinched at her afternoon students’ play. At least it meant Wednesday was almost over, not that Rio would admit to anyone alive or dead, that she was waiting for Thursday.</p><p>On Thursday, however, her mood took several, sudden sharp turns. She woke up feeling much better than the day before, almost excited, even with the midday heat climbing into the hundreds. After lunch she sat down at the grand piano herself to practice and annotate her sheet music, but the closer the clock hands got to three, the more nervous she became. Not negatively nervous, but simply unable to determine what to expect. Here she had sat all week, useless, barely able to focus because some girl was being nice (nice?) to her. She felt like she was all the way back in middle-school, with Karen Pearce kissing her behind the arts building before running off to her boyfriend and she had spent the better part of the term waiting for her to dump him. Rio didn’t particularly like the thought that she was, yet again, waiting around for someone.</p><p>So when Agatha rang her doorbell just a minute after three, she had probably been expecting a more enthusiastic Rio.</p><p>“What’s eating<em> you</em> up?”, she asked, dropping her wide smile along with her sunglasses.</p><p>“Just a bit of a headache,” Rio lied, and Agatha seemingly bought it, because she shrugged and walked right past her, flinging herself onto Rio’s couch, one foot on the backrest, the other on the floor, skirt riding up, “fucking hot out there today,” she huffed.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s pretty bad.”</p><p>“Martha Argerich sucks,” she fumbled with her nails and Rio let out an amused huff, closing the door and sitting down on the opposite end of the couch, realizing she could see straight up Agatha’s skirt. Clearing her throat, she took her notebook from the table and opened Agatha’s page.</p><p>“She’s so aggressive. Like there is no depth the way she plays, there’s no… delicacy,” she looked at Rio, almost in shock, “does that mean it’s how I play?”</p><p>“No,” Rio smiled, “but it might come across as such if you don’t make changes.”</p><p>“So I do sound like her.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go as far as comparing you to an accomplished and celebrated concert pianist, but there is something to be learned here.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the ceiling, then looked over to Rio again, hands folded on her stomach.</p><p>Rio tried to hold her gaze, let herself not be distracted by the pink panties she could see Agatha was wearing under her skirt.</p><p>“So how do I do it?”, Agatha shrugged, “how am I less like… Martha?”</p><p>“That’s not what I said,” Rio rose from where she was sitting and opened the fall board on her grand piano, “I don’t want you to play or not to play like Martha Argerich,” she began to press on the keys, “I want you to play like… Agatha.”</p><p>Rio kept on playing the same music she had given to Agatha the week before, mixing louder notes, played at a faster pace with soft, drawn-out harmonies – making sure every sound was resonating with a sense of internal contemplation: two steps forward and one back, like two hands tearing at a seam, but in different directions. Only vaguely did she notice how Agatha walked over to her, carefully taking a seat next to her on the same bench she had helped soil the week before.</p><p>“Did you just play that from the top of your head? You barely even looked at your hands,” she asked quietly when she had finished. Rio almost blushed like a schoolgirl.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be a very good pianist if I didn’t,” she brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Well, I practiced all week, and I can’t do it without the sheets,” Agatha groused. Her left arm was touching Rios.</p><p>“I’m not asking you to. I’m asking you to read the music and take note of how it makes you feel, think about what you want to express to your listeners,” she picked up another copy of Fanny Mendelssohn’s <em>‘Schluss’</em> from where it sat on top of the piano and arranged it for Agatha, who studied it for a moment.</p><p>“Okay give me some space,” she announced after a while, tapping Rio’s leg, asking her to shift in her seat so Agatha could sit more centrally, before placing her fingers on the keys to play.</p><p>Rio stopped her after a good minute.</p><p>“No, no don’t copy me, I want to hear <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Involuntarily, she poked her finger into Agatha’s upper thig, emphasizing the ‘<em>you’</em>, realizing it was the first time she had initiated contact between them, maybe ever. If Agatha noticed, she didn’t show it. Instead she nodded, rolled her shoulders, and began anew.</p><p>This time, Rio heard how she was putting more effort into interpreting the music she was playing, adding slower breaks with quieter notes, using the pedals more firmly and holding them down for quarters of seconds longer than intended by the composer, giving it a new, gentler spin.</p><p>“That was very good,” Rio smiled when Agatha’s fingers came to a rest.</p><p>“Do I get a reward, Miss Vidal?”, Agatha fluttered her eyelashes suggestively and Rio thought she would never get used to the blatant flirting. But she began to mind it less, began to take it almost more as a compliment, that apparently, she was still attractive enough to a 22-year-old, who arguably couldn’t wait to get into her pants.</p><p>So when Agatha had repeated the exercise twice and Rio had annotated her sheet music for her, highlighting areas to improve on and suggesting a few changes, she leaned in for another kiss when Agatha asked her to.</p><p>She also let Agatha into her bedroom on the second floor and for what felt like the first time in her entire life, she let her suck two pulsing, dark bruises into her neck. Greedy as ever, Agatha made her way down her body fast, leaving a trail of kisses and bites on her breasts and upper stomach. When she made herself comfortable between Rio’s legs, still fully clothed, Rio stopped her.</p><p>“Is there… is there a reason you don’t let me touch you?”, she asked with a shaky voice.</p><p>“Do you want to?”</p><p>“I-I guess?”</p><p>“Guessing isn’t enough.”</p><p>“Yes. Yes I want to.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha finally nodded, as if she was contemplating it, almost as if she wasn’t sure she wanted to lose the upper hand, give someone access to herself.</p><p>“Take off your shirt,” Rio asked, with her own blouse already on the floor and jeans zipped open.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha complied and needlessly opened the three buttons beneath its neckline first before pulling it over her head with a grin. She was wearing a white, properly filled lacy bra that showed her aroused nipples, stiff and dark beneath the fabric.</p><p>“Can you take that off too?”, Rio asked, trying not to sound too desperate.</p><p>Agatha frowned but the leaned forward, guiding Rio’s right hand behind her back.</p><p>“Do it yourself,” she grinned and let her unhook the clasp.</p><p>It fell off immediately as if there had been a little strain on it, and it honestly wasn’t a surprise, because Rio immediately felt self-conscious. Where she was built more androgynous, Agatha was <strike>gorgeously</strike> relatively well-bestowed. And as if Agatha sensed it, she leant back again, straddling Rio’s lap and throwing her hair back.</p><p>“Like what you see?”, she hummed, teasing a nipple between her index finger and thumb and Rio swallowed hard. Looking down, she saw that her left hand had cramped up next to Agatha’s knee <em>(old habits die hard)</em>, so she gently moved it up and under her skirt, fingers gliding over Agatha’s inner thigh until her knuckles touched wet cotton.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say any encouragements, she didn’t have to, because as soon as Rio found the most sensitive part over the fabric, Agatha began to shift her hips, trying to find purchase, rubbing herself against the tips of Rio’s fingers.</p><p>The way she let her head fall back, hair pouring over her bare back made Rio’s mouth go dry. She tried to rub faster, with more pressure until she heard Agatha moan quietly, barely audible but sweet and low.</p><p>“I want your fingers,” she breathed, falling forward, kissing Rio hard, “and I want them now!”</p><p>Flabbergasted, Rio nodded and brought her right hand under Agatha’s skirt as well, removing her panties – pink – but sodden at the center.</p><p>“How-how many do you-“</p><p>“Start with two,” Agatha whispered and adjusted herself over Rio’s hand, skirt still on, and upright.</p><p>When Rio gently glid between her folds, she felt Agatha move again, spreading need on her fingers until she found her path inside of her, strong muscles wrapping around her until she couldn’t move any further.</p><p>It felt marvelous, warm and sticky, just wet enough for her to easily slide in and out, soft noises of panting filling the room as Agatha began to move on top of her again, head tilted back, but all of her beautiful hair now falling over her chest, shifting on and off her breasts as she fucked herself on Rio’s fingers, soon begging for a third and using her left hand to rub at her clit. Falling forward again, catching herself with her right arm, she looked straight into Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“More,” she panted, and Rio began to thrust harder and all the way in, “more,” she still mewled again and again until Rio felt how she was tensing up and came around her fingers in subtle waves accompanied by loud moans and profanities. The skin on her fingers tingled whenever she felt Agatha’s muscles contract once more.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha didn’t even hesitate to tear Rio’s jeans off when the last wave of her orgasm had subsided, slip along with them, shoving her fingers right inside Rio, eyes still half-glazed over and plump cheeks rosy. It took embarrassingly little time for her to come, like, highschool-boy quick. She blamed it on Agatha’s breasts, bobbing up and down over her face as she was fucking her.</p><p>Even more embarrassingly, she drifted off into a nap almost immediately after. Later, she wouldn’t remember if Agatha had laid down next to her, perhaps gingerly snuggling into her side, resting with her after the ordeal. Maybe she had only dreamed of the feeling of mahogany locks draped over her body.</p><p>When she awoke with a shiver, the sky was already orange. She could hear the AC unit hum but found the bed empty next to her. For a moment, she assumed Agatha had left without waking her, but at second glance, all of her clothes were still strewn around the bed.</p><p>She reached for her silk robe and slipped into it, naked underneath. When she couldn’t find Agatha on the second floor, she walked back down and discovered the door to her study open. The room was warmer than anticipated, even though the AC was on. Only the gentle sway of the curtains revealed that someone had stepped out into her lush garden.</p><p>Between Mediterranean trees and high-growing bushes, she found Agatha in her pool, taking a swim as the sky began to burn above her.</p><p>“Heeey!”, she squeaked and paddled towards Rio, “I didn’t know you had a pool! This is gorgeous!”</p><p>When Rio would later muse about the exact moment when and where it had all started, she would estimate that it was right there and then. The happy girl with the low voice, naked in her turquoise swimming pool, giggling and cooling off from the Californian heat and reaching her hands up to touch her cheeks and pull her in for an almost gentle kiss. If it hadn’t been that, maybe it had been later, when she made Rio sit on the edge of the pool and began to eat her out, clammy hands holding on to her butt-cheeks, pressing her face down into the apex of Rio’s thighs, making her come for a second time that day. Or after that, when she had pulled her into the pool, her hands gliding over Rio’s stomach and sides as she was kissing her, unbothered by the setting sun and the cicada noises in the cooling air. There had been something celestial in her face, her eyes glittering in the fading light as she began to splash Rio. Her laugh sounded heavenly.</p><p>It had somehow felt harder to let her escape into the night that evening, hair still wet and tangled, skin cold and smelling of chlorine. When she was almost down the steps, Rio called out for her one more time.</p><p>“Thursday then?”</p><p>“Is three fine again?”, she had turned around and answered.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah sure,” Rio had nodded, suddenly fighting the uncomfortable urge to walk down to where Agatha was.</p><p>“Good night,” she had waived instead. She regretted it instantly.</p><p>167 hours.</p><p>Maybe 161.</p>

<strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The summer heat continued to torture her over the course of the next week. Some days, Rio avoided going out all together if she didn’t need to, kept all windows and door closed for as long as possible, ushered students in more quickly than usual so the warmth wouldn’t creep in. Damningly, it gave her more time to think, and she wasn’t sure if <em>thinking</em> was the best course of action, given the situation she had maneuvered herself into.</p><p><em>Thinking </em>led her to install Instagram on her phone again.</p><p><em>Thinking</em> made her restore her old account one evening when she was on one of the sunbeds next to her pool, searching for Agatha’s profile.</p><p>She huffed when she found it was public and had more than a thousand posts, various pictures of Agatha with other people her age, usually somewhere around the city, or vacation photos from what looked like a trip to southern Europe over Easter.</p><p>Curiously, there was also an insane number of pictures and videos of a bunny, sometimes on its own, sometimes in Agatha’s lap. One from earlier in the year showed a boy the same age as Agatha smoking a cigar while petting the rabbit. <em>Ralph &amp; Señor Scratchy</em> read the caption and it suddenly made Rio almost hyper aware of the young man. There were other pictures of him from more recent months, one arm around Agatha on a boat, her hand resting on his chest. The two of them in front of what looked like a church, same pose, same wide smiles. Another one showed them with a larger group of friends. While she was scrolling all the way down, she wondered how far would be acceptable and where she would be crossing the line to downright stalking – but curiosity got the better of her: The first time he appeared on Agatha’s feed was in February 2023. The caption read <em>my valentine</em>.</p><p>Rio threw her phone on the neighboring sunbed and dove straight into her pool.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to ignore the urge to go back to it when she was warming up leftovers for dinner later and left her phone in the kitchen when she sat down at her grand piano, trying to focus on something else for a while.</p><p>As usual, the sounds the instrument produced under her fingers soothed her thoughts and wrapped her up in a bubble made of music, but the longer she played, the more it started to wear off. She had so much work to do. She wasn’t even halfway through everything she had to prepare for her concerts in Boston – sure, she knew it all well, had played them many times before, but it had been years and if she wanted to be able to mask her stage-fright, she had to practice <em>the fuck</em> out of everything.</p><p>Wood hit wood when she slammed the fall board shut and buried her face in her cold hands. This was hideous. It was driving her nuts, the thought of that boy even existing in Agatha’s periphery. Was she sucking bruises into<em> his</em> neck as well? Was she letting him touch her the same way she let Rio? The thought of that boy laying even a hand on Agatha almost made her gag.</p><p>She quit playing for the night - brushed her teeth and crawled under her sheets, switching on her phone again, the cold light illuminating her little sheet-cave.</p><p>Ralph, as it turned out, did not have a public Instagram profile. She could see, however, that he followed 146 accounts (<em>Evan Spiegel and the likes among them, urgh</em>) and had posted all of two pictures. Back to Agatha’s profile then. Rio snorted at the <em>rich girl</em> <em>content</em>. Only at second glance did she notice the expensive bottles of champagne in the background, the luxury handbags she already knew, flung over chairs or on the floor as per usual, the clover-shaped necklaces and bracelets, and the sheer number of pictures in exotic locations. She snorted again. What the fuck were Agatha’s parents doing to have this amount of money? She made a mental note to ask her next time she saw her. Preferably in the sub-sentence of a sub-sentence.</p><p>Absentmindedly, she tapped on a picture of Agatha in a bikini, somewhere on some beach. Only it wasn’t a picture, it was a video and <em>holy shit</em> she had thought those social media platforms filtered for inappropriate content. She switched off her phone and put it on her nightstand. Time to sleep.</p><p>Now – at least that was the official version.</p><p>Rio wasn’t particularly proud of the unofficial one.<br/>The one where she stared at those bikini videos a little too long. So long that she had to check the date they were posted (<em>they were just a few months old, thank fuck</em>) to make sure she had not just gotten herself off looking at videos of an underage Agatha. Not that that made things any better – twenty-two was still fifteen years too young for her. <em>She was a fucking pervert.</em> Was this the moment where people would usually submit themselves to the authorities for treatment? She had seen ads for that on TV. Alternatively, she could think about that conversion therapy nonsense again that Father Percy had offered her in senior year.</p><p>Annoyed at herself, she got up and washed her hands in her bathroom sink.</p><p>When she came back and checked her phone, a pink-and-yellow circle had appeared around Agatha’s profile picture. She felt like a dinosaur when she tapped on it and a shaky video began playing. She recognized Ralph by his trust-me-bro-university glasses, some of the other faces seemed familiar from other pictures as well, but then the camera pointed at Agatha in a very short, orange dress, dancing on top of a patio-table, voices and loud music coming from the background.</p><p>
<em>Agatha is AT it again!… urgh girl turn around…haha…omg Agatha your mom is gonna kick us all out…Ralph shut your MOUTH, oh my god… slay girl!! WHAT A BRAT.</em>
</p><p>More laughter, more of Agatha dancing and drinking straight from a bottle Rio only recognized as expensive from its color-scheme. Is this what kids did for fun these days?</p><p>The video ended and a grainy picture popped up next, posted 27 seconds ago. It showed Agatha in Ralph’s lap, his arms around her waist, his face in the crook of her neck, Agatha looking away.</p><p>She uninstalled the app from her phone and swallowed two of her tenner melatonin pills, hoping sleep would find her quickly.</p><p> </p><p>To Rio’s disdain, they knocked her out so well, it was already past eleven when she came to on Sunday. <em>Gentle Sleeping Aid</em> her ass. At least temperatures hadn’t climbed into the hundreds yet, her phone told her. Frustrated with herself she took an ice-cold shower before she decided to leave her house for once to pick up some coffee and breakfast from her neighborhood Starbucks. It surprisingly cheered her up more than she had expected, so much so that she decided to give the barista a flirty smile and treated herself to a cake-pop to go along with her sandwich and $9 caramel iced coffee. It almost looked as if her weekend was finally about to take a turn for the better when the right music started playing on the radio and Rio hummed along while sipping her sugary wake-up drink.</p><p>
<em>I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine, I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh-oh</em>
</p><p>Maybe she could even hit up Milena for a trip to the beach later, she mused, because screw whatever Agatha was doing with her boyfriend (?). And screw the mushy feelings she gave her. She was an independent, unattached, successful woman in her prime years. There was no reason she wouldn’t be able to find someone more age-appropriate to fawn over.</p><p>But no – her day did not take that lovely, stress-free turn she had hoped for.</p><p>As soon as she pulled into her driveway, she saw that another car was already parked there.</p><p>“What the-“, she mouthed to herself as she drove up next to the familiar BMW.</p><p>Agatha was sitting on her steps, raising her head from where it had rested on her knees as she heard her approach. She was wearing less make-up than usual.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”, Rio asked, exiting her car, reminding herself that Agatha didn’t know she had stalked her Instagram account all night and still assumed they were on post-coital terms.</p><p>“Hi,” she raised her hand and got up.</p><p>“It’s Sunday,” Rio established.</p><p>“Duh, I know,” Agatha retaliated condescendingly.</p><p>“So then what are you doing here?”</p><p>“Can’t I come visit my favorite piano teacher on a Sunday?”</p><p>Rio huffed. She knew what this was.</p><p>“You know a booty call usually includes an upfront phone call, or at least a short text. I’m not just sitting around here waiting for you to come by for a tumble through-“</p><p>“I’m not here for that!”, Agatha shut her up and raised her hands defensively. She seemed less sure of herself than usual and began to chew on her nails.</p><p>“Is… everything okay?”, Rio tried a gentler voice. Everything had seemed okay in the videos last night.</p><p>“I have a request. And I know it’s a lot to ask, but I literally don’t know who else to go to – I need someone dependable.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow, almost bracing herself for what was coming. Even through the sunglasses she could see the dark circles under Agatha’s eyes as she hesitated to continue, chewing on her lower lip and rolling her shoulders.</p><p>“My mother wants me to get rid of my bunny!”, she blurted out all of a sudden, “and none of my friends will take him, I don’t even have to ask any of them, please Miss Vidal, I have to bring him to a shelter if you can’t take him!”</p><p>How – after the two stints against the piano and in her bed, and whatever kids these days called the action she had gotten on the brim of her pool – she was still <em>Miss Vidal</em>, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>Agatha brushed a strand of hair behind her ear, quietly adding, “I can… I mean I can be very thankful if you-“</p><p>“Are you offering me <em>sex</em> so I will take care of your pet bunny?”, Rio interrupted her, “what kind of person do you think I am?”</p><p>
<em>A disgusting one. Which she technically was. Fifteen years age-gap and all.</em>
</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t… I just need someone for him, please Miss Vidal-“</p><p>“It’s…Rio,” she pressed out and began massaging her temples.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha muttered quietly.</p><p>This wasn’t a good idea. This really wasn’t a good idea. She had never cared for a living, breathing thing, let alone a rabbit.</p><p>“I don’t know how to care for a bunny,” she tried.</p><p>“I brought everything you need, and I can show you, and I can clean his cage and look after him when I come for the lessons,” Agatha was quick to offer, visibly excited that she seemed to have gotten a metaphorical foot into the door, “and I will literally pay for everything he needs – he is free roaming but-“</p><p>“He is <em>free roaming</em>? Agatha I can’t have a bunny roam around my house, I have cables everywhere!”, she protested.</p><p>Agatha put a hand on her arm, “I was just about to say, I brought his cage and you can keep him in there most of the time, just let him out when you have some time, he is very clean and well behaved.” A second hand came to Rio’s arm, and she looked down at it, feeling how small goosebumps were threatening to form. </p><p>Pressing her eyes closed, she let out a pained, “this is for a limited time only.”</p><p>“Oh my god thank you so much Miss Vidal!”</p><p>And yes, it sure did feel nice having Agatha almost jump her and pull her into an embrace. So nice indeed that Rio put the hand that wasn’t holding on to her iced coffee on the small of Agatha’s back, caressing it carefully.</p><p>Turning off the air conditioning in her car, Agatha lifted a small transport box from her passenger seat and handed it to Rio to carry inside. She sat it down on the floor next to her piano and peaked through the openings, curious black eyes looking back at her, while Agatha was unloading her car, bringing more and more bunny related things into the house.</p><p>They decided to set up his cage in the corner of her office and Agatha did as she had promised and took care of everything, explaining feeding schedules and how to clean his water bottle. Rio watched her, suspiciously raising her eyebrows at the assumption she wasn’t going to accidentally kill him on his first day here.</p><p>“Do you think you’ll be okay?”, Agatha asked when they sat on the couch and chair in Rio’s office waiting for him to settle in his new environment.</p><p>“I can’t promise anything,” Rio raised her hands. For nothing in the world would she admit how cute and soft he was. Agatha had made her hold him before they had moved him to the office. Rio had successfully resisted the urge to press her entire face into his fur. No guarantees she would be able to abstain from that forever.</p><p>“I’ll come up with a good way to thank you,” Agatha muttered, toying with a pen she had found on Rio’s desk.</p><p>“Please don’t”, Rio huffed and looked down.</p><p>“No, I mean like in a… non-sexual way.”</p><p>Rio nodded at that and let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Although I would like to continue the… sexual stuff.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow at that, turning in her chair. It had been quiet, but she was sure Agatha had actually said it.</p><p>“Are you sure about that?”, she asked, “I’m like a decade and a half older than you. I was in high school when you were born. I feel like a fucking groomer here.”</p><p>A sly smile appeared on Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“I like older women,” she admitted, “and I’m not like… a teenager.”</p><p>For a moment Rio thought about asking why she had a boyfriend then, but it felt like enough had already happened on her quiet Sunday. And she didn’t need any further disturbances of her peace for the rest of the day. The clock agreed with her. It was already past two.</p><p>“I should really get some work done here Agatha,” she crossed her arms defensively and <em>thank fuck</em>, Agatha took the hint, nodded, and rose from her seat on the couch.</p><p>“Bye buddy”, she caressed the rabbit through the gaps of his enclosure one more time.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio walked her to the door, Agatha had one more request.</p><p>“Can I have your phone number maybe? So, you can send me pictures of him once in a while?”</p><p>Rio thought about it for a moment, but eventually rolled her eyes and nodded, dictating her number so Agatha could save it on her phone.</p><p>“Anything else about Mister Scratchy I should know?”, she asked when Agatha picked up her backpack from the couch.</p><p>She looked at her funny for a moment, raising an eyebrow, but then shook her head. “No, he’s super easy, I promise Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha smiled.</p><p>And instead of opening the door right away, Agatha leaned in, one hand warm on Rio’s chest, the other on her neck, kissing her gently. It was softer than usual, Agatha wasn’t trying to get into her pants. Nothing would follow this, but a soft goodbye. And that’s what eventually made the insides of Rio's stomach twist. She knew how to do casual. She knew how to do hook-ups (<em>well, the few occasions she had had them</em>). Caringly being kissed by a twenty-two-year-old that had just dropped her pet bunny off with her?</p><p>
<em>Abso-fucking-lutely outside of her playbook.</em>

<strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On Monday morning Rio sat in her office, staring at the patchy bunny, finally fully realizing she had a house guest. Señor Scratchy looked at her curiously, his tiny nose scrunched up, floppy ears hanging comfortably from his head.</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked at the bag of bunny food Agatha had left with her. A yellow post-it detailed how often and much to feed him, but Agatha had such a terrible handwriting, she had to read it several times to fully understand.</p><p>It was nice though – him looking at her while she was writing bills on her computer and getting through some calls she had to make. Around lunch time, she even lifted him out of his cage and sat him down in her lap, while she listened to a longer lecture on Listz’ late-life religious compositions. Sniffing around, he made himself comfortable and let her pet him. For a moment she considered sending a picture of him to Agatha. She took her phone off the desk, pointed it at him, then put it back down. She felt an uncomfortable pressure built behind her forehead. <em>Really, what was the harm in it anyway?</em> Picking it back up, she snapped a picture and sent it to Agatha without text.</p><p>It didn’t even take her ten seconds to reply.</p><p><strong>AH: OH MY GOD, HE LOVES YOU</strong> 🐰</p><p>Rio huffed. Her phone chimed once more.</p><p><strong>AH: Is he being good?</strong> 🥰🐰</p><p>How the heck was she supposed to know if he was “being good”?</p><p><strong>He hasn’t pooped on me yet. </strong>She tried.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Send me a selfie of the two of you!</strong>
</p><p>Yeah sure, like she didn’t have anything else to do with her time.</p><p>But when she didn’t respond immediately, her phone began to ding aggressively.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Pleaaaaaseeee.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: It’s Monday, throw me a bone!</strong>
</p><p><strong>AH: Please Miss Vidal? </strong> <strong>😍</strong></p><p>She looked at the lecture on her computer, buried her face in her hands and tried to lift the bunny up to her face without hurting him to take a selfie. It looked horrible. She wasn’t even wearing make-up. Filter maybe? Where were they on her phone? Did it even have a built-in filters?</p><p>And that was how respected pianist Rio Vidal, youngest woman to ever play in the LA Walt Disney Concert Hall, came to lie on the carpet next to her desk, another woman’s bunny next to her while she tried to take a selfie that did not make her look old, tired, or dumb.</p><p>Needless to say, it took her an embarrassingly long time. At least her boobs looked good from the way she was perched up on the floor. Rio was gonna give herself that credit.</p><p>Agatha’s answer did not contain any words.</p><p><strong>AH:</strong> 💘🥴🐰🥵💜💧💧💧</p><p>Maybe she had accidentally opened the emoji-menu when she had meant to type?</p><p><strong>That okay? </strong>Rio responded to make sure.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Rio you’re making me weak!!!</strong>
</p><p>Rio flushed and was grateful no one else was there to see it.</p><p>She left her phone in her office after finishing the lecture but took Señor Scratchy with her to the kitchen. Closing all doors, she reckoned there was nothing he could chew on while she made herself lunch. He seemed to like it and curiously hopped around her, exploring the space while she ate, and Rio almost felt bad about putting him back into his enclosure when the first of her afternoon students was about to arrive.</p><p> </p><p>The next time she checked-in on him it was already getting dark. In the twilight, she saw the tiny light on her phone blink, indicating a new message was waiting for her.</p><p>
<strong>AH: So, I’ve been thinking. Are you free Wednesday or Tuesday night?</strong>
</p><p><strong>What for? </strong>She typed back and started to power down her computer.</p><p><strong>AH: Let me surprise you? </strong>💜</p><p>Phantastic, like that didn’t sound as if Agatha was going to show up at her front door with nothing on but her underwear.</p><p>
<strong>I told you I really don’t want you to think you need to sleep with me because I’m taking care of your bunny.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: I promise it doesn’t contain anything like that if you don’t want it to!</strong>
</p><p>Rio sighed and pulled up the calendar on her phone. Her last student on Tuesday wouldn’t come in until five in the evening, maybe that was a bit late. Wednesday looked good though. And if she was completely honest with herself, it did sound nice to not have to wait until Thursday again to see Agatha. Something warm spread in her chest when she texted back.</p><p>
<strong>I’m free after four on Wednesday. Will you come here?</strong>
</p><p><strong>AH: I’ll be there at four</strong> 😍 <strong>Have a nice night</strong>! 💋</p><p>Rio stared at those kissy lips for longer than she would have liked to admit.</p><p> </p><p>Wednesday afternoon was on the warmer side again. The sun hung high in the crystal-blue sky, casting a golden haze over Los Angeles. From the top of her stairs, she could see the pavement shimmer with heat when she stepped outside just a minute before four. She had briefly considered reaching out again to check if she needed any specific footwear, but assumed Agatha wasn’t the kind of girl that went on hikes in a hundred-degree heat (to be fair, Agatha didn’t seem like the kind of girl that went on any kind of hikes). And while Rio wasn’t particularly fond of surprises, she was willing to let this one play out for now. Whatever Agatha had planned, she was hoping it would be indoors though. She could already feel herself sweat underneath her arms again.</p><p>However, her hopes were not fulfilled when Agatha didn’t pull into her driveway with her usual car, but instead stopped on the street and honked twice, waving at her from a red convertible with its top down.</p><p>“Whose car is this?”, Rio asked with a frown when she walked down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha was in a matching red, sleeveless dress with a cut-out that was so low, Rio wasn’t sure if she could see her nipples from this angle. She suddenly felt uncomfortably underdressed in her black slacks and green tank top.</p><p>“It’s my mom’s, I borrowed it for the day”, Agatha beamed and beckoned her, “come on, get in!”</p><p>“Your mother makes you re-house your pet bunny but let’s you borrow her car?”, Rio crossed her arms.</p><p>“She’s got another one – will you get in now so we can get going?”, Agatha leaned over the middle console to open the passenger-side door for her. Rio wasn’t entirely convinced how good of an idea this was, but sure enough it didn’t take more than a pout from Agatha for her to finally get in. How Agatha managed to turn her into a compliant ball of over-fermented dough every time she wanted something from her, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>As she sunk into the beige leather seats, Agatha turned around and reached for something in the back seat. “Thank you,” she smiled through her sunglasses and offered Rio a silk scarf to cover up her bare shoulders.</p><p>“So, where are we going?”, Rio asked when she had wrapped the expensive looking cloth around herself, and Agatha shifted the car back into Drive.</p><p>“I thought we’d go for a drive and get out of the city,” indicating and looking back, Agatha pulled back onto the road, “sound good?”</p><p> </p><p>There was something to having your controversially young situationship chauffeur you around in a luxury car on a random Wednesday afternoon, Rio decided, leaning back into the seat after a while, relaxing her muscles. Above, she saw them passing the palm trees that lined the roads, gently swaying in a light breeze. She heard Agatha turn the radio on to a jazzy station and chuckled at how hard she was trying to put her best foot forward. She didn’t mind either, when she felt Agatha’s hand coming to rest on her thigh. She even covered it with her own.</p><p>The familiar smell of blooming summer jasmine soon turned into the salty tang of ocean air when Agatha turned onto the Pacific Coast Highway, north towards Thousand Oaks. Rio marveled at how the seemingly endless ocean stretched into infinity before them, the high and rugged cliffs towering over the road.</p><p>“Have you ever gone up this way?”, Agatha snickered at the face she must have been making.</p><p>“No, at least not in a cabriolet,” Rio answered, squeezing Agatha’s hand involuntarily.</p><p>The smile it earned her was radiant and beautiful.</p><p>Agatha continued to drive them up north for another thirty minutes, pointing out little beaches she had been to as a child or lookouts she offered Rio to stop at. The way her hair billowed in the wind made Rio want to reach out for it, weave her fingers through it, and never let go. Every time Agatha lifted her hand from her thigh to make a tighter turn, she almost winced at the loss and found herself fretting Agatha might not return it to where it had been. Equally, she felt her skin tingle each time it came back the rest on her leg again.</p><p>“Are you hungry yet?”, Agatha asked when they were making a stop at a viewpoint so far uo the coast, Rio had never been to it.</p><p>“I don’t know if I want to go back yet,” she confessed wearily. Golden hour was drenching the waves below in a soft, yellow light, making them sparkle. But it was more the fact that Agatha was standing so wonderfully close to her, her side pressed to Rio’s, her elbows resting on the parapet in front of them. She didn’t want it to end yet.</p><p>“Oh no, we’re not going back,” Agatha smiled and looked up to her, “we have a reservation for dinner a little further down the road, but I can call them if you’re not hungry yet.”</p><p>A reservation.</p><p>For dinner.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>“Oh…uhm…no, let’s go then, I guess?”, she stammered.</p><p>Agatha looked her with a smile, then took off her sunglasses. Light-blue eyes eying Rio curiously.</p><p>“Has anyone ever told you how cute you are when your cheeks blush like that?”, she asked and fumbled with her hands.</p><p>The only viable reaction in Rio’s repertoire was to flick a finger into her face. She had never been good at handling compliments. And certainly not when they came from someone like Agatha. Where they might have been true.</p><p> </p><p>It only took another ten minutes of a ride until Agatha turned off the road and into the cliffs. Soon, a large blue sign announced a Spanish sea-food restaurant with two white stars under its name. Instead of turning in a parking lot, Agatha stopped the car right in front of the building’s entrance and left the key in the ignition angling for her purse on the back seat.</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t think I’m wearing the right kind of clothing for a place like this,” Rio stopped her when she wanted to get out.</p><p>“Rio you’re here with me, they won’t care,” she stashed away her sunglasses and patted Rio’s thigh nonchalantly.</p><p>Right, that sub-sentence of a sub-sentence regarding what Agatha’s family was doing would have come in handy right there and then. Or a minute later, when a tall man in a black suit greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. Or a minute after that when he led them to a table out on a large balcony, overlooking the ocean and asked whether <em>Miss Harkness</em> wanted <em>the usual</em>.</p><p>The ‘effin <em>usual</em>.</p><p>“I take it you come here more often?”, Rio raised a brow again when the waiter had poured both of them a glass of white wine.</p><p>“Not as often as I’d like,” Agatha raised her glass and waited until Rio met it with hers, making them chime in unison.</p><p>Looking around, Rio wondered if she had been here with the boy from her Instagram pictures. If he had driven her out here in a nice car too. If they had sat in this very spot, looking at the setting sun on the ocean as well.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”, Agatha asked, taking another sip.</p><p>“Nothing much, “Rio cleared her throat, swallowing the jealousy like it was bile.</p><p>“Fine, my thoughts then”, Agatha grinned mischievously and bit her lip, “see, I have been wondering about something,” the waiter came back, placing an assortment of small, tapas-style starters on their table, Agatha thanked him and then turned back towards Rio, “how come you have a Wikipedia page, but no notable social media? You’re an artist, right? Shouldn’t you be promoting yourself?”</p><p>Rio began to shift in her chair uncomfortably. When she didn’t answer, Agatha continued, swiping a bit of sourdough bread through olive oil, “I’m just asking, because I was wondering whether you might indeed actually have an account on Instagram,” she playfully raised a brow, “something like… piano_girl87? Perhaps?”</p><p>
<em>Fucking shit. </em>
</p><p>Every bit of color must have drained from her face, and she had to fight hard not to choke on her wine, suddenly more acidic than before.</p><p>Agatha laughed and snorted, covering her mouth with one hand. It sounded like heaven.</p><p>“Rio do you know you can see it when people watch your stories on Instagram?”, she asked in all honesty, “like it shows me the names of the people that have seen my story or interact with my posts?”</p><p>“The what?”, Rio coughed violently and put the glass back on the table. She had tears in her eyes.</p><p>“You know the pictures and videos that disappear after 24 hours?”</p><p>
<em>Holy fuck.</em>
</p><p>“Mhmmm,” she pressed out, color probably coming back to her face, turning her cheeks bright red, “no, no I don’t use social media,” she tried in a last desperate attempt at concealing her nightly escapades on Agatha’s Instagram profile.</p><p>“How did you know Scatchy’s name then?”, Agatha challenged her, leisurely popping a cherry tomato between her teeth. Rio could see its juice coating Agatha’s lower lip, tiny seeds becoming white specks on her pink, plush mouth.</p><p>“C’mon you told me his name when you brought him over,” she shook her head.</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Had she though?</em>
</p><p>“No, no I didn’t. I probably should have, but I was so agitated, I forgot. Until you mentioned it when I was leaving.” And as if all of that had not been enough humiliation, Agatha felt like it was necessary to add: “so when I was back home, I started thinking, and the only way you could have known, was if you’d seen him in pictures on my social media,” she took out her phone and showed Rio a screenshot with a white background. Listed there were approximately ten pictures, Rio’s handle next to each of them, small pink hearts signifying she had reacted to them: Agatha in that tiny bikini, Agatha and Señor Scratchy, Agatha and her friends.</p><p>Her thoughts raced themselves down a racetrack inside her brain.</p><p>“No clue who that is,” she feigned ignorance and finally reached for a buttery shrimp in one of the little trays.</p><p>“So piano_girl87 is not your account? Because 1987 is the year Wikipedia says you were born, you know?”, Agatha persisted with a half grin.</p><p>“No, I hate social media,” Rio washed the shrimp down with the remainder of her wine, signaling for another glass. She needed more alcohol. When she looked back at her, Agatha was biting her lower lip, toying with one of the rings on her fingers.</p><p>“You’re adorably bad at lying”, she started laughing, and in all honesty, it was the most gorgeous thing Rio had ever heard. There wasn’t a single ounce of neither spite nor arrogance in it. And for the first time in a long while she felt as if she wasn’t just being appreciated for the things she was good at, but also for the parts of herself she wasn’t particularly proud of.</p>

<strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had never had the chance to empirically study the effects of the setting sun on another woman’s face. Maybe she had never paid enough attention. Not noticing how the dimming California light was transforming Agatha’s skin into pure gold, however, seemed near impossible.</p><p>Coming back from the restroom, she stopped in the open door frame under vines of blooming wisteria. Agatha was looking out over the ocean, her curls a cascade of mahogany, catching the light, each strand a thread of molten amber. Her skin was shining with a warmth that envied the soft, rosy sun rays stretching out from the sky. For a moment, Rio had to remind herself that she was real. That in this very moment, they were actually here.</p><p>Agatha turned her face, and it lit up as she saw her approaching.</p><p>“Ready for something sweet?”, she asked, pointing at the small dessert menu on the table that hadn’t been there when she had left.</p><p>“I think I’m full,” Rio answered, sitting down, well aware that not having desert would mean they slowly needed to drive back to the city.</p><p>“Coffee maybe?”, Agatha suggested and signaled the waiter, and yes, she could do that at least.</p><p>Just like the rest of the dinner, her espresso tasted heavenly – so good, she didn’t even mind she was going to have difficulties sleeping.</p><p>“I hope you liked it,” Agatha said as she finally signed the bill.</p><p>When she accidentally dropped her credit card and leaned down to pick it up, Rio got a peek at the final sum and swallowed hard.</p><p>“Agatha, I can’t let you pay that,” she hissed and grabbed the small black leather folder.</p><p>“What are you talking about, I told you this was my <em>thank you</em> for taking care of Scratchy?”, Agatha tried to get it back, “besides I already signed.”</p><p>With how she was leaning over the table with her chest pressed to its surface, Rio got distracted for a split second and lost control over the folder as Agatha snatched it back.</p><p>“Let me at least pay half,” Rio almost whined.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha got up and extended a hand to her, “c’mon I wanna cuddle Señor Scratchy before I go home.”</p><p>Rio looked at the hand stretched out to her. Was she supposed to take it? Was it to help her get up or would she get to hold on to it? Funny how sometimes the easiest choices became the hardest if one thought about them a little too much. Nevertheless, she took it and felt how it squeezed around her fingers. Agatha led her through the restaurant and out to where a young man was parking the car for them. She almost winced when Agatha let go to tip him and proceeded to get back behind the wheel.</p><p>“This was very nice, thank you,” Rio said with a voice softer than she had intended when Agatha shifted the gear.</p><p>“My pleasure,” Agatha responded with a smile, and Rio was almost glad she wasn’t looking at her. She wasn’t sure what Agatha would have seen in her face if she had.</p><p>The California sky above them slowly lost its golden sheen, the vibrant hues of the sunset fading into a rich indigo, as Agatha drove them downhill, back onto the Pacific Coast Highway. The heat of the day was still lingering in the evening air, but the airstream around the cabriolet almost made Rio shiver. She watched the sun dip below the horizon, listening to owls and cicadas striking up a vespertine concert, all while avoiding another, unnecessary look at the woman in the driver’ seat. No, the <em>girl</em> in the driver’s seat. She pinched herself, she desperately needed to stop thinking about Agatha as an adult. Twenty-two might mean she wasn’t going to jail for seduction of a minor, but it didn’t make what they were doing any more acceptable.</p><p>Still. She couldn’t deny the aching, sickening softness she was beginning to feel when she thought of Agatha. She closed her eyes and listened to the wind and motor roaring in her ears. Feeling Agatha’s fingers on her thigh again, she fought the urge to remove them. She shifted uncomfortably instead, and Agatha lifted her hand back unto the wheel. And <em>oh</em> – the way she immediately regretted it haunted Rio for the rest of the drive.</p><p> </p><p>It was properly dark by the time they arrive back at her house. When she switched the lamps back on, Agatha coming in behind her, it felt like the big bang had just happened all over again. She squinted at the blinding light.</p><p>Curiously, Agatha didn’t immediately storm over into the study to cuddle her the bunny like she had announced. Instead, she sat her purse down next to the piano and lifted the fall board up, carefully letting a few of the keys chime – E-minor, Rio recognized it.</p><p>“Your lesson isn’t until tomorrow,” she joked and came to stand next to her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up to her and seemed to be contemplating something, gently switching to D-major.</p><p>“Will you play something for me?”, she eventually asked, lifting her eyes to Rio.</p><p>“What do you want me to play?”, Rio smiled at the request.</p><p>Agatha seemed to consider the question, rolling it over in her head before folding her arms.</p><p>“Something <em>you</em> enjoy. Something that’s not <em>for me</em>, something that’s for <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Rio let out a surprised huff and took her in, asking herself for the second time in the span of a few hours <em>what this was</em> that they were doing here and when Agatha had decided she wanted to hear her play instead of checking on her pet.</p><p><em>Something for her.</em> Oddly unspecific, really. Maybe something more modern then? Something she wasn’t usually playing at a concert?</p><p>“Sit down then,” Rio gestured to her couch and Agatha let herself sink onto the very edge of it, turning to Rio.</p><p>Stretching her fingers, she went over the notes in her head one more time. It had been a while. Usually nobody wanted to hear her self-transcribed ABBA renditions. To be fair, nobody knew they existed. She had written them when she had been in middle-school as an exercise. So when she carefully began to play the first notes of her very own piano version of <em>The Winner takes it All,</em> it was probably the first time anyone but herself actually listened to them.</p><p>She had to admit, it sounded quite nice. Even after all these years, there was still something special to it, even more so now that she had an audience. She allowed herself a peek at Agatha once in a while, still in her red dress, she had closed her eyes, head leaned to the side. It meant something to Rio, having her sole attention like that, nobody else on her mind but Rio and the music. Her thoughts started drifting to the other people that were a part of Agatha’s life, people that didn’t know Rio. That didn’t know <em>about</em> Rio. About what they were doing, about what she was sharing with Agatha. She looked back ahead to where no music sheets were sitting on the rack and continued, stretching out the bridge and repeating the refrain, a faint feeling slowly settling in that she was playing on borrowed time and that Agatha would soon know too. Reluctantly, she struck the keys more softly, lingered longer until the last, slow harmonies subtly faded into silence.</p><p>She didn’t want to ruin the evening, but her tongue burned with questions about the boy she had seen in Agatha’s pictures. The boy she called <em>my valentine</em>. The boy on whose chest she had placed her slender hand on in the photographs, looking more like an obedient wife than the chaotic, horny menace Rio had come to know her as. That hand had felt so much better on her thigh.</p><p>When she looked over, Agatha’s eyes were no longer closed but fixated on where Rio was sitting at the grand piano. There was something in her expression Rio had a hard time interpreting, something almost sad. It was gone in a flash when Agatha noticed her attention.</p><p>“Did you like it?”, Rio almost whispered and scratched herself behind her ear.</p><p>Agatha took a long breath in and out before she walked over until she stood next to the piano bench, her right hand coming up to Rio’s chin.</p><p>“Rio... baby I think if I have to wait another second for you to be inside of me, I might explode.”</p><p>Agatha slid down into her lap without another warning and kissed her hard, wrapping her hands around Rio’s head and neck, pressing herself close, so close Rio could feel her breasts against her own. So close it temporarily wiped all questions she might have had from her brain. Agatha was louder than usual too <em>(if you could classify the few times they had been together as ‘usual’)</em>: Sniffing and moaning into the kiss. Rio’s hands came up to her sides, resting on Agatha’s wonderfully curvy hips before trailing all the way along her back, holding on to her as if she was about to fall off. Her fingers found the zipper of Agatha’s dress and for the first time she felt brave enough to pull it all the way down, to undress her without asking. To touch her without second guessing.</p><p>She wore no bra underneath, her perky breasts easily springing free with nipples hard and dark. Agatha was panting when she had finally stripped down to a white G-string and sat back down in Rio’s lap, pulling her into another kiss and tangling her fingers in Rio’s hair, pulling until it made Rio hiss with pain-induced pleasure.</p><p>She buried her face between Agatha’s breast pressing a myriad of tiny, soft kisses everywhere she could reach. Where she found her skin tasting salty, she swiped her tongue over it. Agatha’s moans came deep and drowned out every other sound. Rio felt her hands on her back, short nails making tiny circles and leaving goose bumps everywhere they went before they bore into her skin, sure to leave crescent-shaped marks, fleeting tattoos that would turn into memories far too soon.</p><p>Rio pulled herself away for just a moment only to gasp at the way Agatha was looking at her with flushed cheeks, eyes glazed over and almost delirious with need. She was heaving when she took Rio’s right hand into her own, slowly pulling it down between her legs, the pathetic little thong utterly soiled to a degree where Rio could smell it.</p><p>“Please don’t make me wait any longer,” Agatha whispered, her breath hitching.</p><p>Rio pushed the fabric aside, feeling how Agatha’s clit had swollen up, puffy folds smooth and warm on the outside, but wonderfully wet as soon as Rio broke through them with her fingertips, gathering the wetness that had pooled there before she pushed inside, feeling Agatha’s walls wrap around her. Agatha began to move as soon as she was inside, slowly lowering her hips onto Rio’s fingers, meeting her thrusts and spreading more of herself onto Rio’s knuckles and legs.</p><p>At first, she pressed her face to Rio’s left cheek, holding on to her tightly and making toneless moans, kissing the top of Rio’s ear whenever she seemed coherent enough while she was taking her pleasure.</p><p>Rio desperately wanted to say something. Wanted to urge her on, wanted to tell her how good it felt to be inside of her, how beautifully she was taking her, how it was making her wet too, but none of it left her lips. The moment felt almost too precious. She didn’t want to risk missing out on any sound Agatha was making. <em>They were too beautiful. She was too beautiful.</em></p><p>After a particularly hard thrust, she had not intended to make, but could not restrain herself from, Agatha gasped audibly, moving their foreheads together so that Rio was looking directly into her hooded eyes. Even in the glaring lamps of her foyer they were almost turquoise, shining with fondness. Agatha’s left hand came to rest on the side of Rio’s face again, her thumb gently stroking her cheek as she kept steadily grinding herself on Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Something escaped Rio’s lips she hadn’t meant to say out loud.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful.”</p><p>She could feel how Agatha’s walls were starting to flutter around her, not quite there yet, but eager and ready. Her cheeks were rosy, and it made Rio’s heart ache, seeing her like this, about to come undone in her arms, rutting against her hand. She desperately wanted to see it, the way Agatha’s face had contorted the last time she had come on top of Rio in her bedroom upstairs. She had to see it. Had to know that it was her causing it.</p><p>Swiping her thumb over Agatha’s clit, she heard her whimper. Pressing herself harder against Rio’s hand, her mewls became more coherent again.</p><p>“God, <em>pleasepleaeseplaese</em> Rio it feels so good, it feels so good with you.”</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Rio could have sworn she saw a tear run down Agatha’s face, but she was distracted when Agatha finally came with a whine, soft flesh contracting around Rio’s fingers as she road out her orgasm, pressing open mouthed kisses to Rio’s lips.</p><p>She didn’t even care she probably had to clean the upholstery on the bench again. She’d clean up a hundred stupid chairs if it meant seeing Agatha like this, being the one that made her sound like this.</p><p>“Can we go upstairs for a bit maybe?”, Agatha asked with a small voice, her forehead resting against Rio’s mouth. She couldn’t deny her. In fact, she wasn’t sure whether there was anything she would have denied her had she asked.</p><p>Agatha curled into her as soon as they landed on the mattress, the palm trees in her garden painting stupendous pictures onto the sheets as if they were moonlit brushstrokes. She held on tight, barely letting Rio take off her trousers to climb into bed with her. Agatha’s breathing slowly grew more shallow until the sound of it and nothing else engulfed Rio, letting her fall into a dreamless sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Sometime later, and Rio wasn’t sure exactly when, she felt Agatha kiss her nose and caress her cheek before she heard her whisper.</p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow. Sleep well.”</p><p>On some level she noticed her slipping out, heard how the front door softly closed.</p><p>But then, it might’ve all just been a dream.</p>

<strong>CHAPTER SEVEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She still felt the ghost of Agatha’s hands on her body when she woke up the next morning. Drowsily, she tried to orientate herself between her sheets, briefly forgetting that Agatha had even been there at all.</p><p>Brushing her teeth, she looked at herself in the mirror, a large hickey staring back at her from her neck. No dream then, for sure, but it didn’t feel entirely real either. It had begun to unsettle her, the way her heart would flutter every time the younger woman was in her orbit, occupying her personal space. Washing her hair, Rio scolded herself. The years of being a pathetic celibate and loner had apparently made her susceptible for the advances of people she should not consider as part of her dating pool – <em>students</em> for one, and <em>women way too young for her</em> apparently topping the list.</p><p>Over breakfast, she was wondering if she needed to see a lawyer about this, to at least understand what kind of repercussions this would have for her. Secretly, she also thought about whether such legal counsel could also tell her how to go forward should they ever want to explore more… <em>serious</em> versions of this clearly and purely casual, transactional, sexual kind of a relationship. Just in case the way Agatha had spoken to her the night before, with those soft and tender whispers, telling her how good it felt to be together, had meant anything. Not that Rio was allowing herself to hope it did. No, she was just hoping this would all just end and blow over with careers still intact and no feelings hurt. After all, Agatha still had a boyfriend – who knew how seriously she was taking any of this?</p><p>At least that was what she kept telling herself when she lifted her new housemate out of his enclosure to conduct her daily face-squishing ritual that Agatha certainly did not need to know about. Somehow the world seemed a little easier when one was breathing through the soft fur of a little bunny.</p><p> </p><p>Afternoon rolled around soon enough and to Rio’s surprise, Agatha wasn’t punctual as usual, no, she was ten minutes early. It was also the first time Rio ever saw her wearing pants, even though they were lilac and at least a size too small judging from the way they clung to her ass. Opening the door to her, she was almost sure if should even see the outlines of her folds between her legs.</p><p>“Where is my baby?”, was the first thing Agatha asked when she came through the door with her Louis Vuitton shopper hanging open and overflowing with bunny treats.</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows and chuckled when she walked Agatha to her office and watched her have a full-fledge conversation about hay and the best kinds of treats and how she was still his momma even though he was living with someone else now. She still had trouble reconciling this side of Agatha with her usually cocky demeanor.</p><p>“He looks happy though,” she finally summarized when she put him back in his cage and fed him one last treat.</p><p>“I try to let him out as much as possible, I’m just always worried he will chew on a cable and get electrocuted,” Rio sighed and crossed her arms, leaning back in her office chair.</p><p>“Thank you, I know you’re doing you best,” Agatha stepped closer and reached for Rio’s hand, squeezing it gently.</p><p>“It’s alright. He’s a good boy.”</p><p>The way that made Agatha’s face light up was worth any trouble Rio could have gone through regarding the bunny.</p><p>“So, what are we looking at today? How did you like Fanny Mendelssohn?”, Rio asked when she closed the door to her office once more, walking downstairs next to Agatha.</p><p>“I didn’t practice a whole lot, but I liked it! I can play it for you if you want?”</p><p>“Yes please, I’d like to see you interpret it,” Rio nodded. She had rarely felt such a pang of excitement for a student’s performance.</p><p>“There is something else,” Agatha sucked in a long breath before releasing it, “my mother’s birthday is coming up and she would like me to play for her guests.”</p><p>
<em>Ah. Just as expected.</em>
</p><p>Rio tried to act as if she’d never heard the request before.</p><p>“Oh, how nice your mom likes your play so much,” she faked the acknowledgement.</p><p>“Save it, my mother is dragon,” Agatha crossed her arms and sat down on the couch next to the piano. Rio could see something uncomfortable in her eyes when Agatha rolled back her shoulders and avoided looking her way. For a moment she wasn’t sure how to react – or more precisely in which role she was supposed to react. The piano teacher who would encourage their student and not drill any deeper – or the woman Agatha was currently sleeping with and that had a growing interest in what was going on in Agatha’s head at any given time.</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear…,” probably worked for both.</p><p>Agatha scratched her chin and then looked back at Rio.</p><p>“Anyway, I need something to play, something maybe a little longer so she can’t say I chose something short to be done with it quicker.”</p><p>Rio nodded and began to flick through her brain’s library of music.</p><p>“Something modern, maybe?”</p><p>“Oh no, she’d hate that. Maybe Beethoven?”, Agatha suggested and looked impartial.</p><p>“There is a sonata that’s about 10 minutes long, but it’s fast and not specific for a birthday, mind you,” Rio offered, reaching for her folder.</p><p>“I love fast!”, Agatha bit her lower lip, a small smile creeping onto her face again most likely at the thought of the challenge. If Rio had learned one thing about her student, it was that she loved to be challenged.</p><p>“The first time you were here you said you liked going slow,” Rio countered nevertheless, focusing on looking for the right sheets of music and only realizing what she had said when it was already out. Of course, it only took a second for Agatha to bite her teeth into it.</p><p>“Oh Miss Vidal,” she purred, rising from her seat and walking over, “you should know by now that I excel at both playing it quick and slow,” she pressed Rio’s legs together and took a seat in her lap again, mirroring the interaction from last night and leisurely putting both of her arms around Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “your libido is ridiculous.”</p><p>“But isn’t that what’s supposed to be fun about a younger lover? That they literally just want to fuck all around the clock?”, she pouted and obscenely bit her lower lip, lightly fluttering her eyelashes.</p><p>Rio pinched her eyes together and shook her head, unsure if she had maneuvered herself exactly where she had hoped or miles away from it.</p><p>“I thought you needed to find something to play at your mother’s birthday?”, she settled for, wondering why the heck she was still so adamantly playing hard-to-get. Who was she fooling here? Agatha had surely long deduced she was enjoying the sex as much as her at least.</p><p>Who was she kidding, it left only herself as the target.</p><p>“You’re no fun at all,” Agatha mocked, “will you let me eat you out later at least? I didn’t even get to return the favor last night?”, she mumbled. It sent a stroke of heat down Rio’s belly and it her right between her legs.</p><p>
<em>Fuck it. What use was it fighting this if she knew both of them wanted it anyway? </em>
</p><p>She couldn’t come up with a good-enough answer neither then nor later when she had both of her calves over Agatha’s shoulders, her hands tightly holding them in place while she fucked Rio with her tongue moaning so loudly, Rio wasn’t sure whether it was real or meant to be a show.</p><p>“Fuck you just taste so damn good baby,” Agatha croaked between breathes, eyes fixed on Rio’s glistening cunt as if she had just gotten a glimpse of another universe. The way Agatha’s face was covered in her filth made Rio swallow hard. Even more so when Agatha licked her lips and looked at her like a predator about to exterminate its prey. But then, maybe she was and Rio wanted nothing more than to be mauled.</p><p>She was in heaven when Agatha went back to her ministrations, sucking her entire clit into her mouth and bobbing her head in a way that made Rio’s mind go almost blank with desire. Now that she felt almost certain Agatha would welcome and even enjoy Rio’s reactions, she placed a hand on her head, finding purchase in the younger woman’s hair and carefully pressed her to her center.</p><p>She knew now how much Agatha enjoyed talking to her while they were at it, how much she loved to share her thoughts. And Rio would have loved to reciprocate it, would have loved to tell her the most unhinged obscenities, but there was only one thing on her mind and lips as she came, violently throwing her head back into the mattress and mewling her lover’s name.</p><p> </p><p>It took her longer than she had expected to come back to her senses afterwards. Bathing in the waves of her orgasms with Agatha almost pinned to her body had somehow become her favorite part of it all. Her fingers lost themselves in the lush curls covering her breasts as Agatha rested her head on her stomach, placing quiet, butterfly kisses on Rio’s skin.</p><p>It was then that she could barely take it any longer. The sour questions bubbling up in her chest wanted out, wanted to be acknowledged. The thought of anyone else sharing this serenity with Agatha had finally transformed from a subtle nagging into something that made her sick. How was she supposed to share this? How was she supposed to share Agatha with anyone?</p><p>“Agatha?”, she asked with a hush voice, testing if she had fallen asleep.</p><p>“Yes?”, Agatha didn’t turn her face, perhaps making it a little easier.</p><p>“Just… hypothetically speaking,” Rio paused, “if I had an account on Instagram – and I’m not saying I do! – but just hypothetically if I had looked-“</p><p>“stalked”, Agatha corrected, and Rio could feel her lips forming grin on her stomach.</p><p>“-well… let’s just say <em>gone</em> through some of your posts…”, <em>shit how was she supposed to phrase this semantically correct</em>, “now let’s say I’d seen a boy in some of the pictures with you…”</p><p>She felt how Agatha lifted her head and instantly grieved the loss of her warmth.</p><p>“I was wondering when you’d ask,” Agatha intercepted her with a somber face, suddenly feeling the need to cover her body with the sheet.</p><p>“Who is he?”, Rio finally asked the actual question.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha sighed, “he’s such a tool, that’s what he is.”</p><p>“A tool?”</p><p>“An idiot. Our parents are friends, he started making googly eyes at me towards the end of senior year and I thought I should probably just try it out?”, it was more an question than an answer.</p><p>“Try what out?”</p><p>“The whole <em>heterosexual thing</em>, I guess.”</p><p>“So you’re not… bi?”, Rio tried to clarify. Because if she was honest with herself, so far she had assumed Agatha was using her to explore her preferences. And yes, the idea of being used for that had bothered her. But then it wasn’t as if she hadn’t gotten something out of it herself. Transactional relationships were sometimes the easiest.</p><p>“Urgh no, I fucking hate men, have you ever smelled one? They’re disgusting. He is disgusting. I had hoped we could do this whole <em>purity thing</em>, you know, waiting 'til marriage, but…well”, she scratched her face again, looking away, “I sometimes let him do some stuff with me, so he doesn’t complain too much.”</p><p>Rio felt like she was going to be sick. Angling herself up on her elbows she wanted to reach out, but Agatha was too far away.</p><p>“Why are you still together then? Assuming you are?”, she tried quietly, afraid she was asking too many questions.</p><p>“Well, it turns out as long as my mother thinks I am happily in love with him she pays a little less attention to other extracurricular activities of mine,” apparently catching Rio’s frown she added, “which – duh – is currently <em>you</em>, and nobody else in case you were wondering.”</p><p>It took Rio a moment to unpack all of that. She felt her heart become heavier with every beat as it almost slumped down in her chest. Partially covered in that white sheet, Agatha looked more vulnerable than she ever had. Playing with the skin around her nails she suddenly seemed so girlish it almost left a scar on Rio’s soul. She wanted to crack her beautiful head open and extract all of the worries from it, throw them into the wind so they would never hurt her again. And because she couldn’t do that, she did the one thing she felt came close to it. She extended her hands over the bed, opening her arms, hoping Agatha wouldn’t make fun of her or call her sappy.</p><p>Rio swore she could hear faint music when Agatha dropped the sheet from her chest and crawled into her arms, her head coming to rest in the crook of Rio’s neck, her breath sweet on Rio’s ear. It was probably the first time she was properly holding her like this, pretending her arms could be a shield keeping her from harm forever. Somehow she became distantly aware of the burning pyre within her that urged her to never let go.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER EIGHT</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't stay the night.</p><p>It was something Rio was slowly getting used to. However long and comfortably they would lie together, the moment when Agatha would leave would always come. And for the first time, Rio felt how much it truly stung underneath her skin.</p><p>She wanted to reach out for her and sling her arms around her waist as she was getting dressed on the edge of the bed, tying her down so she wouldn't leave and stay the night. It was the first time she became aware how much she wanted to wake up next to Agatha. How much she wanted to find the other side of her bed warm instead of deserted. A gush of guilt spread in her chest at the thought of it. But it only turned into something worse when she thought about the other person that got to rest his head on the same pillow as her.</p><p>“Take my spare key,” came out of her mouth before she had a moment to think of it.</p><p>“Wow, u-hauling much?”, Agatha laughed and turned around with her breasts still bare and pointy. It distracted Rio for a split second.</p><p>“No, no I mean so you can come in and see Señor Scratchy whenever you want. You can even come in through the garden if you don’t want me to notice…”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow at that, but then shrugged, pulling her shirt over her head.</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>Rio went downstairs with her and grabbed the second pair of keys she had held onto so far from a small box in her utility room, handing them over to Agatha.</p><p>“This one for the front door, that one for the back door,” she explained, holding each of them up.</p><p>Agatha’s grin went wide, and Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I didn’t know I needed keys for that, so far, your front door always looked open for me, but we sure can talk about the-“</p><p>“Alright, you’re insufferable, get going,” she joked and slapped Agatha’s butt, earning her another laugh.</p><p>Somehow the air was even more humid than most nights. Even now, closer to tomorrow than to today, it was insufferably warm outside. Agatha checked one more time that she had unloaded all of her treats and packed the sonata Rio had picked for her, but for a moment Rio wondered if she too was trying to stretch out the time they had together as much as possible. When she seemed ready to go, she crossed her arms and cleared her throat, looking down at her shoes and gingerly tapping them on the cement on the top of Rio’s stairs.</p><p>“What? So does the girl who just gave you incredible head not even get a kiss before she leaves?”, she mumbled, glance pointed down still as if she was afraid to look in Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio huffed and shook her head.</p><p>“Well normally you’re the one who just takes what she wants,” she shrugged and sheepishly nudged Agatha’s hand with her own. They had kissed goodbye before, but somehow it now felt so much more meaningful and momentous. So much so that Rio barely dared to move.</p><p>“Yeah whatever,” Agatha huffed and let out a long breath, scratching her hair and finally looking straight into Rio’s eyes, cheeks pink. Eventually, she leaned in and gave Rio a peck that felt like it had been aimed for Rio’s cheek but landed on her mouth. It was warm, and sweet, and honest, and far too short.</p><p>“G’night,” she murmured, “and thanks for the keys!”</p><p>“Text me when you’re home,” Rio tried to smile, still wondering why, if it felt so good, Agatha couldn’t just stay with her.</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>AH: Made it home. Thx for listening. Might drop by tomorrow. </strong>
</p><p>Came about 35 minutes later.</p><p><strong>AH: Sweet Dreams </strong> <strong>💜</strong></p><p>Followed it.</p><p>Rio only saw it on her lock screen, turned around and hid beneath her sheets.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not drop by the next day.</p><p>Or at least if she did, Rio didn’t notice, and she wasn’t sure if that was for the better. Just a week ago she had been counting the hours until she could see Agatha again, now she was torn between wanting just that and hoping she would only find traces of Agatha having been there, little remnants to hold onto so she knew she hadn’t been abandoned yet, but never the real thing that would only worsen her ache.</p><p>It was a funny thing when that what you wanted most presented itself to you on a silver platter, only to shout<em> you cannot have me</em>.</p><p>She thought of that the first time Agatha made her wear a strap a few days later, when she had finally snuck in through the garden door, not only to check on the bunny, but also to take another naked swim. She had come in to dry herself off and had obviously gone through Rio’s bedside tables. At least that was what Rio surmised when she came downstairs while Rio was playing, proudly holding the strap and harness she hadn’t used in at least a year in both hands.</p><p>“I want you to fuck me so hard I can’t remember my name anymore,” had been the only thing Agatha had said.</p><p>The way she rode her, one hand on Rio’s throat, the other on her right shoulder, holding her down forcefully, turquoise eyes fixed on mocha irises, made Rio question any kind of feelings she had ever harbored for anybody else.</p><p>She could see the individual pearls of sweat gathering on Agatha’s forehead and wondered if they were able to reflect light in such a way that it could make rainbows.</p><p>“Bet’chu would like to come inside of me if it wasn’t made of plastic, huh?”, Agatha asked and Rio didn’t dare to move her neck to answer, fearing Agatha would understand it as a sign to ease her grip.</p><p>The pace she was setting only made the leather harness barely rub against Rio’s clit with every thrust. It gave her the coherence to raise her own hand to where Agatha and she were joined. With a stroke of her thumb, she urged the tender flesh up, getting her better access to the nerve endings Agatha was almost hiding from her with every roll of her hips. When Agatha moaned at the contact, Rio auddenly felt the violwnt urge to bite into every inch of her body, leave marks, scratch her open so he would know. So he would know someone else was <em>taking better care of her them him</em>. So he knew someone else <em>loved her better than him</em>.</p><p>If one could go blind with jealousy, she would have lost her eyesight then and there.</p><p>She felt ridiculous for it. Competing with an unknowing boy almost half her age for the affection of his girlfriend.</p><p>Agatha gave her a light slap on the cheek, <em>and God did she loved it</em>.</p><p>“I’m up here, look at me,” she hissed and moved her hand from Rio’s throat to her chin, taking it into her hand and leaning down, all while continuing to fuck herself and letting Rio stroke her clit. “Don’t you dare look away,” she groaned, tightening her grip. Rio shivered at it.</p><p>“Baby, you have no idea how good it feels to be full of you, fingers or this, both,” she pressed out, still rutting, but clearly close enough to her orgasm, that it wouldn’t take her much longer. Rio could see it in her face, hear it in her voice.</p><p>“S-Say that you want me,” Agatha blinked then, eyes still fixed on Rio’s, and it only came out as a whisper, as if there was any true doubt what the answer would be. As if she was bracing herself for Rio to deny her or possibly laugh at her.</p><p>“I want you,” Rio answered, and nodded out of reflex, her fingers still circling above where the wet strap disappeared inside of Agatha.</p><p>
<em>She wanted her more than anything else in the world.</em>
</p><p>And she didn’t know where the bravery came from, but a split second later she added: “I want you like this every day.” Only later, when she went over it all again and again, did she realize it had a double meaning, could be interpreted in two ways. One – that Rio was so horny for Agatha that ‘every day’ was a placeholder for ‘as often as possible’ and Two – that Rio actually wanted to hold onto her like this every day of the week, spend every waking hour with her. Two things could be true at once, even if Agatha’s grin told her she only thought as far as option one.</p><p>Right there and then it didn’t matter, because as soon as Agatha grew quieter and she started pressing her eyes together, Rio knew she was ready. She came with a scream, falling forward and resting her forehead to Rio’s, still moving aagainst her gentle thrusts and sighing with the rhythm.</p><p>Rio brought both of her hands to cup her cheeks and kiss her, realizing that she wasn’t sure when she had last properly kissed Agatha like that, long and gentle, giving more than she was demanding. It was a funny thing that even when they could fuck like this, her heart ever only truly stopped beating when she got to kiss her, when it felt like for just a moment Agatha was truly <em>hers</em>.</p><p>Rio could have held her like that for hours, enjoyed the sweet and tangy smell of Agatha’s sweat, but of course the younger woman had other plans, dismounting her and immediately slipping her fingers inside of Rio’s wet and aching cunt, making her come ridiculously fast and loud with less than four, half-assed pumps.</p><p>To her surprise, Agatha didn’t have a snide remark about it, just licked her fingers clean and nibbled on the inside of Rio’s thigh, content to lie in between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you getting by with the sonata?”, Rio absentmindedly asked when Agatha had later started playing with her hair, curling it in between her fingers and looking up at the ceiling deep in thought.</p><p>“So-so,” she turned to her and shrugged, “can we try something more modern after this maybe? I actually quite liked the ABBA you played last week.”</p><p>“Sure, but didn’t you say your mother would like something more classic? Don’t you want to focus on that for now?”, Rio suggested.</p><p>“But my lesson isn’t until Thursday?”, Agatha frowned and Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Jesus Agatha, aren’t we past that?”, she swung her legs of the bed and stretched out a hand, “c’mon, show me what’s giving you trouble, we’ll go over it together.”</p><p>The way they would continue to hold hands until Rio opened the fall board on her piano would haunt her for at least a day. Dressed in nothing but silk robes, she made Agatha take it from the top, play it through start to finish, noticing that she must have barely practiced at all.</p><p>“We could go for something easier, if you’d like?”, she offered, but Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, it’s on Sunday, I don’t have time to learn anything new now.”</p><p>Rio poked her cheek with her tongue and tried to come up with ways that would quickly get Agatha on back on track. Together they went through the most difficult parts, playing them again and again until she seemed to have gotten the hang of it and the moon was so high in the sky Rio wasn’t sure if the next day had already started.</p><p>“Will you come?”, Agatha asked then, something like hope in the corners of her eyes.</p><p>“To your mother’s birthday?”, she raised a brow, “are you sure that’s a good idea?”</p><p>“Oh she’ll be thrilled – it’s just a lot of family members and my stepfather’s boring business associates. I’d feel better if you were watching over me when I play.”</p><p>
<em>Hm.</em>
</p><p>“I have been meaning to ask, what exactly does your family do for money?”, Rio finally asked, though not as casually as she had hoped.</p><p>“Oh we don’t do anything for our money we just roll around in it,” Agatha let out a deep, ironic chuckle.</p><p>“Yeah, but how?”, Rio pressed on.</p><p>“I’d rather not say, it’s embarrassing, really.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes must have widened at that, so Agatha raised her hands defensively.</p><p>“Fine, so… do you know sugar cubes?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“My great-great grandfather invented them,” she shrugged.</p><p>“What do you mean he invited sugar cubes?”, Rio laughed and closed the fall board.</p><p>“He invented sugar cubes and how to make them, there is a patent for it and every company in the world that wants to make them has to pay us for it.”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>Rio looked at her with a testing frown. Was Agatha taking the piss out of her?</p><p>“I’m not kidding, you can look it up, you’re not the only one with Wikipedia page here,” the way Agatha said it so matter-of-factly made it seem even more hideous. It took her a full ten seconds to reply.</p><p>“Fuck. That must be the most ridiculous way anyone has ever become rich,” Rio laughed and Agatha joined in, nodding and brushing through her hair with her hand.</p><p>Afterwards, she fell silent for a moment and looked through the window and into the night sky.</p><p>“So will you come?”, she asked one more time, placing a hand on Rio’s naked thigh, and then added more quietly, “please?”</p><p>And since Rio hadn’t regained her ability to deny Agatha anything within the last half hour it made no sense to fight it any further. So she nodded and asked for the address.</p><p> </p><p>When Sunday rolled around, Rio suddenly realized that going to a birthday party meant putting on something nice. She then also noticed that birthday parties usually included a lot of guests and that as such a guest, one would normally speak to the other guests. Which meant she had to talk… to actual people. People she didn’t know.</p><p>All of a sudden, she wasn’t sure how good of an idea this was anymore. She hated cocktail parties, hated standing around a room full of people making forced conversation while actively planning her escape. It drained her like nothing else. She didn’t even like going to her own opening night parties, how was she supposed to act around the family and friends of the twenty-two year-old that was casually fucking her after her piano lessons?</p><p>She was halfway into cancelling when she saw Agatha’s text message on her phone.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AH: So excited you’re coming.</strong> 🎹🎵🤗</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Oh fuck, how was she supposed to say no to that now?</em>
</p><p>Grumbling, she squeezed into one of her black concert dresses and reluctantly put on some red lip gloss along with her cheap costume jewelry she had long been wanting to replace with at least some sterling silver.</p><p>Fuck it, she could always watch Agatha play and then immediately leave.</p><p>At least that was what she told herself when she drove through the gate of the lavish Beverly Hills property Agatha had sent her the address to. The driveway was longer than the entirety of her property, lined with pink hydrangeas and palm trees that lightly moved in the evening breeze. The sugar cube business must have been going alright then. At least judging by the sheer size of the house, white and old-worldly, almost plantation style (which said enough), with an insane number of luxury cars parked in front of it. Rio took off her stainless-steel earrings and hid them in her glove compartment. Better no jewelry at all then. Not that her off-brand purse and well-worn shoes wouldn’t do their part in giving her away.</p><p>She sighed one more time before she walked up to what looked like the main entrance. Only when she had already rung the bell did Rio realize that she hadn’t even thought about bringing a present. For a moment she considered leaving again, maybe getting flowers from somewhere, but then the door had already swung open, a young, familiar face with 'finance-bro' glasses staring back at her.</p><p>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK</p><p>He scrutinized her for a moment before his face lit up in the most ridiculous way. If he’d stretched out a hand for her to shake, she’d have probably ripped it off.</p><p>“Oh! You must be the piano teacher? Agatha said you would come too, I’m Ralph, I’m Agatha’s boyfriend. So nice to finally meet you!”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER NINE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio wanted to say <em>yes, yes I know</em>. She wanted to scream into his face, rip the glasses off and spit on his shoes. How dare someone like him lay his dirty, grabby hands on her, pressure her to do things she clearly didn’t want, and still flash that disgusting grin at Rio? How dare he take <em>the one thing </em>she wanted to have for herself? How dare he act so fucking casual?</p><p>Rio had to remind herself that he didn’t know, that he probably thought she was just the boring, old piano teacher his girlfriend visited once a week. Did he know about the bunny? Why had he not taken him if he was such a good boyfriend? Images of them flashed before her eyes, the ones she had seen and others her brain made up with the purpose of making her gag.</p><p>She had almost found the courage to make a snide remark, maybe pretend Agatha had never mentioned a boyfriend, something else that would hurt, but she didn’t get the chance when Agatha appeared in the hallway behind him. She looked absolutely beautiful with her curls all down and in a long, purple dress, ears adorned with large, white gold jewelry. Suddenly her rage turned into quiet desperation.</p><p>“You came!”, Agatha’s face lit up and her pace got faster once she saw her. Rio was about ready to pull her into a tight embrace, hold on to her, and beg her to let her go home again. Instead she got the quickest, one-armed hug of her life.</p><p>“I didn’t bring anything for your mother,” she murmured, desperate to hold on to Agatha’s hand for a moment.</p><p>“Oh don’t worry, she has enough shit,” Agatha waved it off, turning to her boyfriend, “can you skedaddle? I’ve got this. Go get her something to drink, she likes a Bellini.”</p><p>“Sure,” the way he smiled and didn’t even object sounded oddly familiar.  Agatha had a type, and they liked to be ordered around. But Agatha had also just remembered the drink Rio had ordered two weeks ago when they had been on what Rio sometimes referred to as their <em>first date</em>. The duality of it made her feel warm.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, he was faster than me,” Agatha rolled her eyes, “come in?”, she finally beckoned Rio and stepped aside.</p><p>Rio followed her into a grand hall, her eyes widening at the extravagance before her. The marble floors gleamed under a hideously big crystal chandelier, casting glittering light across the space. A sweeping staircase with a polished white banister curved upward to another floor. She couldn’t help but gape at the at the absurd splendor of the entrance hall alone.</p><p>“I guess the sugar cube business is still going fine then?”, she repeated her thoughts from before to Agatha.</p><p>“I guess so,” she huffed and led Rio towards the noise coming from the back of the house, where dozens of people were sitting and standing in a humongous living area, sipping on their glasses or nibbling on canapés waiters were carrying around on silver trays.</p><p>“You said this was just some relatives and business partners,” Rio whispered, spotting a grinning Ralph that was making his way back towards them, holding two glasses of sparkling champagne.</p><p>“Well that’s what it is,” Agatha took them from him and handed one to Rio, “to mommy dearest,” she cheered sarcastically and downed almost the whole glass at once. Rio was sure she was in the middle of a train wreck waiting to happen.</p><p>She watched Agatha complain to Ralph about the taste of the champagne and eyed him curiously. He was scrawny, half-long hair, and looked exactly like in the pictures. He had a humongous watch on his wrist, worth probably more than Rio made in a month. The only thing that was missing way a blue Patagonia vest.</p><p>“And what do you do, Ralph?”, she interrupted them, almost sure she knew the answer, and Agatha looked at her in surprise.</p><p>“Finance, I’m almost done with my undergrad, but I’m doing a summer internship right now,” he looked back at Agatha and touched her side, “gotta take good care of this one when the time comes”.</p><p>For the second time this evening, Rio felt the urge to gag. Instead she nodded and flushed it down with her drink. She needed a second one if she was going to last through the night.</p><p>“What he means to say is that his daddy wanted to keep him busy over the summer, so he makes coffee for his golf buddies now,” she slapped his hand away, but he didn’t even flinch.</p><p>How he put up with all of her sharp retorts, Rio didn’t know. They sounded like a match made in heterosexual heaven. What for was Agatha putting up with <em>this</em> in twenty-first century Los Angeles?  She wasn’t stupid and she had all this money. Sure, Agatha had hinted at her mother not exactly approving of whatever Agatha was doing during her escapades, but how bad could it be that she felt the need to keep him entertained?</p><p>A waiter walked by and she got herself another glass of champagne when she saw a woman walk up to them, tall and thin, with even longer hair than Agatha but the same facial features.</p><p>“Miss Vidal! What a pleasure!”, she chanted, her face contorting into something like a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, “Agatha has been speaking so highly of you! I need to know what you have done to my child, ever since she started working with you, she’s been on her best behavior!”.</p><p>She took Rio’s hand with two of hers, ice cold, and shook it. From where Rio stood, she could see Agatha rolling her eyes and working on her next drink.</p><p>“Glad to hear,” was all Rio was able to press out, deadly afraid any of her actions or words would give away exactly what Agatha and she were ‘working’ on every week.</p><p>“I’ve always said it and will say it again, hard work and dedication to God, family, and craft will always put a restless woman’s mind at ease.”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck was that supposed to mean?</em>
</p><p>“Ahh yes, Pastor Jim spoke about that on Mother’s Day, that was such a great sermon,” Ralph nodded, and Agatha’s mother smiled at him, putting a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Pastor Jim is such a gem, Agatha you really need to let Ralph take you to mass more,” she turned to Agatha who was flashing a false smile and nodding.</p><p>Rio had seldomly felt so out of place in a conversation she nothing to add to. She was missing so much context, the only option was to smile and nod.</p><p>“Well, I do sure hope Agatha isn’t giving you a tough time, we all know she can be an absolute nuisance, and I know you have your tour to prepare for,” she turned to her child, Agatha’s eyes going wide. There was nothing but disdain in her voice.</p><p>Something inside Rio switched suddenly.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what exactly it was, only that it was new and that she had never felt it before. An urge to stretch her entire body out as a protective shield from which anything would simply bounce back. A more primal part of her wanted to scratch, beat, and bite, lecture the woman about unkindness and disrespect. But then, something told her that fighting fire with fire wouldn’t help Agatha.</p><p>“She is my best and most agreeable student; I look forward to every lesson with her,” was what she said instead in the most graceful tone that could still mask the tremble in her voice. The three of them looked at her with different expressions each and it suddenly felt a little too much for her introverted brain. The brief silence that followed wasn’t helpful either.</p><p>“Glad to hear, please let me know if she gives you any trouble at all,” again – her smile never reached further than her nose, when Mrs Harkness finally answered, “so kind of you to come, enjoy the party!”.</p><p>She shook Rio’s hand one more time before she walked off, raising her hand towards a group of people in the corner.</p><p>Rio suddenly felt like she was about to suffocate. Ralph had turned back to Agatha, going on about <em>Pastor Jim</em>, giving Rio a figurative gap to slip through, as she strode to what looked like the doors to the back yard (a back yard that turned out to be twice as big as the house, with not one but two pools surrounded by thick, high walls). She took off her shoes and slid her legs into the water, rubbing her face in her hands, before she realized she was wearing make-up.</p><p>“Fuck,” she mumbled to herself, looking for smears on her hands in the dim pool lights, when she heard steps approaching.</p><p>“I’m <em>so</em> sorry,” Agatha huffed and slumped down next to her, blowing raspberry.</p><p>“What are <em>you</em> sorry for?”, Rio questioned and looked over to her.</p><p>“She’s a handful,” Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“It’s not nice to talk about your own daughter like that to strangers,” Rio argued.</p><p>“Oh, she’s always been like that, can’t worry about it too much,” Agatha waived it off and also lowered her feet into the pool, humming with enjoyment in a way that made Rio’s mouth go dry and distracted her from situation inside.</p><p>The sudden urge she felt to kiss it all away did not startle her. She would have given a year of her life to simply wrap her in her arms and whisk her away from all of this.</p><p>“You have a pool,” she noticed instead, as if saying something entirely unrelated was the only way to stop herself.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha nodded and gently moved her legs, making small waves Rio felt on her skin.</p><p>“Why do you come swim in my pool then?”</p><p>“It’s nicer.”</p><p>Rio gestured to the sheer size of it, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“This is a <em>very </em>nice pool, Agatha.”</p><p>“Yeah, but yours is like an oasis with all the green and growth around it. This is just concrete. Plus I’m not allowed to swim naked in here,” Agatha chuckled and took another sip from her glass.</p><p>For a moment they fell quiet and listened to the summer cicadas in the trees and the way the water made wet sounds again the pool walls. Once again Rio noticed how young and beautiful Agatha looked when she smiled like this, maybe a little tired and too unbothered to wear her mask.</p><p>
<em>Did he get to see her like this as well? Or was this just for her?</em>
</p><p>“Why did you invite me if he’s here? I feel like I’m the mistress meeting the husband.”</p><p>
<em>And in a way, she was, wasn’t she?</em>
</p><p>“First of all, I didn’t know he would come, my mother invited him, not me, it was supposed to be a surprise,” she shook her head and let out a sigh, “and secondly why do you care, it’s just sex, right?”</p><p>It was <em>just sex</em>, yes. Mind bending, raunchy, steamy, fulfilling, sapphic sex. Probably the best she had had in her life if she thought about it. But then to Rio it wasn’t<em> just sex</em> anymore. It had stopped being <em>just sex </em>when she had first noticed the sparkle in Agatha’s blue eyes, or maybe when she had decided nothing sounded sweeter than Agatha moaning into her ear, digging her nails in, when she was about to come. Rio has realized that when she played, Agatha wasn’t listening to the music, she was listening to her, truly Rio herself. Nobody had ever made her feel so seen.</p><p>How was she in so deep while Agatha wasn’t?</p><p>How was she so shamefully enthralled while Agatha was above it all?</p><p>“Yeah, I guess,” was what she replied, focusing on how the water felt around her calves.</p><p>Agatha must have noticed the dip in the mood, because all of a sudden, she cheered up and nudged Rio gently.</p><p>“Hey, I was thinking! I know this really nice place up in Nappa where they do private wine tastings and dinners in the vineyards, would you like to go?”</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t think I can afford private wine tastings and dinners, my family didn’t leave me a patent for sugar cubes,” Rio laughed. <em>It had worked.</em></p><p>“You’re really not getting over the sugar cubes, are you? That’s why I didn’t want to tell you,” Agatha shoved her with two arms, almost spilling champagne on Rio’s dress, “besides I was gonna invite you, no biggie.”</p><p>“You can’t always say that.”</p><p>“Say what?”</p><p>“‘No biggie’ – private dinners are something ‘biggie’ for me, I’ve never had a private dinner in my life.”</p><p>“Well, all the more reason to start now,” Agatha suggested. Turning around to make sure they were alone, she took Rio’s hand in hers and gave it a kiss. <em>Just sex</em> was reverberating in Rio’s mind as she stared at it while it tingled like a thousand mosquito bites.</p><p>“Will you think about it please? I’d really like to go with you Rio.”</p><p>In hindsight, Rio should have said yes right then and there and probably spilled her heart out too. Gone back to the whole<em> just sex </em>point Agatha had made, told her that they were past<em> just sex</em>, and that if Agatha wanted to keep having <em>just sex</em>, she would have to go find someone else, because Rio was done having <em>just sex</em> with her. Jesus, she had really hung herself on that <em>just sex</em> comment, hadn’t she?</p><p>In any case, that moment right there on the brim of the Harknesses’ ridiculous pool had practically been offering itself as the right time to spill the beans, come clean and tell her about all the things she had on her mind. About how every day she spent without Agatha felt empty in comparison, how she had no clue what something more serious would look like between them, but that she was bursting at the seams with <em>want</em> for it. She felt like a bird that held the key to its golden cage in its beak and couldn’t figure out a way to use it.</p><p>For a moment she looked at Agatha, finally brave enough to speak, but then it left her again and the fear of being rejected got the better of her. None of it made any kind of sense anyway. So she simply nodded, the summer air not feeling remotely warm anymore.</p><p>The noise from inside grew louder again for a moment and both her and Agatha turned around to see Ralph standing in the door frame.</p><p>“Your mother is asking if you’d like to play now sweety pie?”</p><p>
<em>Sweety pie.</em>
</p><p>“Yes, we’re coming in,” Agatha answered and sighed, taking her legs out of the water and reaching for a towel to dry off.</p><p>When they walked back in, people were already expectantly looking at Agatha. She handed her glass to Rio and cleared her throat, whispering: “can you sit in the front, so I can look at you if I need to?”</p><p>Rio gave her a nod and followed her to where a shiny, black piano sat in the corner by the windows, sitting down on a small, padded stool in Agatha’s visual field. Opposite her, Ralph and a man she had seen earlier with Agatha’s mother had taken their seats on a lavish, white couch.</p><p>When Agatha had arranged the sheet music in front of herself, Mrs Harkness joined her by the piano, putting a hand on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“This year I was finally able to convince my Agatha to play something nice for us. She has been studying with Miss Rio Vidal here, and I know some of you have tickets to her East Coast concerts in the fall, so it’s such a pleasure to have her here with us as well tonight,” she turned to Rio and the room gave her a small round of applause she felt absolutely terrible about. Rio still faked a smile and bowed her head. She was going to listen to Agatha and then she was going to get the fuck home.</p><p>“Please enjoy, everybody!”</p><p>Mrs Harkness sat down next to who Rio was now fairly sure was Agatha’s stepfather and gave her daughter a nod to begin.</p><p>Rio looked over to her student only to see a frown on her forehead as she began to play. From where Rio sat, she couldn’t see how Agatha’s fingers were trembling slightly as they hovered over the keys, but she could hear it, the way every tone came out with hesitance. To everyone else it probably sounded more or less intended, but Rio knew by now that this was not how Agatha played. She was cocky, daring, she liked to play everything that offered itself to her in crescendo and she normally slammed down on the paddles like she had to exterminate a spider under her foot. This was none of that. Rio could only see her glassy eyes, focusing on the music, darting up her way for split seconds, probably trying to find some sort of comfort, and Rio tried her best to smile every time, hoping she would see it as encouragement and know she was cherished, no matter how well she was playing.</p><p>
<em>The only thing she wanted was to take her home.</em>
</p><p>To everyone else she must have looked mostly composed, the occasional stumble in her melody barely noticeable, but Rio knew couldn’t wait to be finished. Stage fright had always been a stable companion to herself and with a mother like that, she assumed Agatha would hear about it if Mrs Harkness noticed Agatha wasn't on top of her game.</p><p>From the corner of her eye Rio saw her lean over to Ralph, whisper something in his ear, but she barely paid it any mind, waiting for Agatha to reach the last third of the sonata, which had given her less trouble the last time they had gone over it together.</p><p>So Rio also didn’t notice at first how Ralph rose from where he was sitting, slowly walking over to the piano. Only when Agatha turned away from the keys as well, playing the very last notes , did Rio pay him any attention. He smiled at her like a puppy dog and got down on one knee. Agatha looked at him as if she was going to lash out.</p><p>“Sweety pie, you know I’m really not good with words. But this last year together with you has been such a blessing, and with all of these wonderful people assembled here tonight, I simply wanted to ask if you’d consider becoming my wife?”</p><p>There was an audible gasp going through the room, women raising their hands to their chests, taking their husbands’ hands, waiting for the answer. Rio’s head was swimming, a painful breath stuck in her chest. <em>Look at me, please look at me, you don’t have to do that if you don’t want him, </em>she thought, willing Agatha’s gaze to fall on her. But it never did.</p><p>When Agatha began to nod, the only thing Rio could think of was the way she liked to rest her forehead against Rio’s. When the room erupted with applause, she only remembered how smooth the skin was on the inside of Agatha’s upper thighs. And when Ralph got up to shove a ring with a ridiculously large diamond onto Agatha’s finger, she thought of the way singular strands of hair would cling to her cheeks when it was wet after swimming.</p><p>Only then, when he swooped her into an embrace and Agatha’s parents had risen from their seats to join him, did Agatha look over to Rio, the shimmer gone from her blue irises.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER TEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She waited just about long enough for people to block her view of Agatha until she got up and left. How she found her way back to the entrance, Rio wasn’t sure. She frantically searched her handbag for her car keys, pretending her eyes weren’t slowly glossing over. She sniffled when she found the key to her front door, but not to her car.</p><p>It wasn’t her place to be upset, it wasn’t her place to be angry. Both for herself and for Agatha’s sake.</p><p>How had they ended up here? Agatha agreeing to marry a man she did not even want to be touched by, and Rio devastated by the prospect of it. She took a deep breath and looked into the faint stars in the sky overhead. She willed the tears back, and when they didn’t magically disappear, she wiped her face on her sleeve, probably smudging her make-up.</p><p>She was almost at her car when she heard faint steps behind her. Almost certain who they belonged to, she pushed the unlock-button several times, accidentally closing the car again instead and rattling on the door handle in wain.</p><p>“Rio, stop!”, she heard Agatha behind her, “have you gone deaf? I’ve been shouting for you!”</p><p>Rio did not want to turn around; she did not want to look at her.</p><p>“Jesus, you left so fast, what’s gotten into you?”, she could hear her panting.</p><p>
<em>The audacity.</em>
</p><p>“What’s gotten into <em>me</em>?”, Rio barked, wiping around the lower part of her eyes one more time to get rid of any tears that might have still sat there, “I don’t know maybe it confuses me that you just got engaged to a boy you don’t love?” To say <em>‘it came out sharper than she wanted’</em> would have been a blatant lie.</p><p>Agatha still looked at her in confusion. “I mean how was I supposed to say ‘no’? There was a room full of people watching us,” Agatha shrugged and crossed her arms in the cooling air.</p><p>“It’s not about that Agatha!”, Rio got louder, feeling her string of patience growing thin, “what even is this? Why are you keeping him around when you’re clearly not interested in him and his entire species?” – the simple fact that she had to ask this question made her feel like she was going insane.</p><p>“Can you keep it down?”, Agatha tried to appease her, phone in one hand, reaching out, but Rio evaded her.</p><p>“No Agatha, I’m done keeping it down!”, she shouted, “you can’t just tell me it’s casual, then invite me to a romantic get-way, and then proceed to get engaged to a man – what has gotten into you?” It was as if the cracks that has long been forming inside of her were finally breaking open.</p><p>“We don’t have to go to Nappa if you-“</p><p>“Agatha it’s not about not going to Nappa – I <em>want</em> to go to Nappa with you!”, she let out a frustrated sigh. How was she unable to see the point of this?</p><p>“Well then let’s go! I can book us a room for Friday!”, Agatha suggested so blatantly it felt offensive. Rio looked at her in utter bewilderment Was she taking none of this serious? Was all of this just a game to her?</p><p>“We can’t go to Nappa on Friday Agatha, you just got engaged!”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“<em>So</em>?”</p><p>“Yeah, nothing has changed, we don’t have to stop seeing each other over this…”</p><p>Rio almost missed it, but there was something pleading in her voice, something asking for permission, rather than demanding, but then the content of it alone made Rio’s blood boil.</p><p>“What do you mean? Agatha, he asked you to marry him and you said <em>yes</em>!“</p><p>“Ah! I didn’t say <em>yes</em>!”, she raised her finger in defense.</p><p>
<em>Fucking smartass.</em>
</p><p>“You nodded! Agatha that means something to this boy and your parents and his parents and it means something to me! I’m not fucking off to Nappa with someone who is engaged to be married! Do you even have any kind of idea what this all feels like for me?,” she almost gasped for air, “I’m fifteen years older than you, I’m your teacher, your mother pays me for my time – I already have all of that to process - and now you’re asking me to keep on doing what we’re doing even though you wear that,” she pointed to the diamond on Agatha’s hand, “that atrocity on your finger!?”</p><p>“Well she doesn’t pay you to fuck me,” Agatha commented almost incidentally and with a tonality so indifferent, Rio wanted to lash out at her.</p><p>“<em>That</em> is what you’re taking from everything I said?”, she asked in sheer disbelief.</p><p>Agatha sighed, “I’m just saying, nothing has to change. I’ll sort this out.”</p><p>“Stop treating this like a minor inconvenience, God – nothing is ever serious to you,” she sucked in a deep breath and pinched the bridge of her nose. A stress-induced migraine was knocking on her door – and violently so.</p><p>“Do you want <em>serious</em> then?”, Agatha asked, making it sound like a joke. Where it came from, Rio wasn’t sure.</p><p>“I don’t want <em>serious</em> with a bratty, little girl that can’t make up her mind about what she wants!”, Rio spit, meaning to hurt.</p><p>“Quit calling me a girl, I’m not some imbecile!”, Agatha fought back, finally visibly enraged now.</p><p>“Then answer me, why do you keep this up?”</p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ, because I get nothing if I do something she doesn’t approve of!”, it was the loudest and angriest Agatha had gotten so far, “anything I inherit is in a trust fund she is in charge of, and I don’t get any real control over it until I’m married. <em>To a man</em> – in case you were wondering”, she huffed and looked to the side, almost embarrassed.</p><p>Rio’s thoughts came to an abrupt halt.<br/>This was about money? About nothing else but fucking <em>money</em>? Hundreds of years of lesbian suffrage and this is what it came down to now?</p><p>“I’m too old for this shit,” Rio murmured just loud enough for Agatha to hear and reached for her car’s door handle again, but Agatha was quicker, pushing the door close with her body. Her face was mere inches away from Rio’s.</p><p>“Rio I would be left with nothing. She’d literally disown me,” she whispered, but Rio had about had it.</p><p>“Get a job Agatha, it’s the 21<sup>st</sup> century, you won’t end up destitute. Go to a community college, get any kind of degree,” Rio gesticulated, stepping away from her, “Jesus, you could probably teach music if you wanted, you’re really fucking good at it and you don’t even realize!”</p><p>“You say it like it’s easy, it’s not that that easy!”, Agatha shouted.</p><p>“Easier than selling your sexual freedom! Easier than marrying someone you don’t love!”</p><p>Rio got quiet when it was finally out.<br/>All of this was <em>so </em>far outside her comfort zone, she wasn’t even sure she’d find her way back when she was done.</p><p>“I said I would sort it out,” Agatha looked down at her legs. The same legs that had dangled in the pool next to Rio’s not even an hour ago.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and tried to breathe more slowly, calming herself down by thinking about the next three things she was going to do.</p><p>One – she way gonna get in her car and drive home</p><p>Two – she would open the fall board of her piano and play</p><p>Three – she would never have to see Agatha again if she did not wish to</p><p>But then again, that was very much not what she wanted to do. Truth be told, the things she wanted to do had moved far outside her reach.</p><p>Resigned, she huffed and shook her head. “Let me just ask you one last thing, Agatha, are you really too blind to see? Is this all just a fucking game to you? Why do you keep pretending this is all<em> just sex</em> for either of us? I know you didn’t plan on catching any feelings for me, you probably just wanted to live out your little s<em>crewing the teacher fantasy</em>, but I’m not gonna be your fucking toy anymore. This meant something to me, even if it didn’t for you!”</p><p>Finally, finally Agatha’s face twitched into something raw for just a moment. Catching her off guard, Rio managed to finally pull the car door open and push Agatha aside. She just stood there, looking at Rio as if she had seen a ghost. Rio ignored it, she tried to not to look her way and started the engine with a howl, turning away, afraid Agatha might see a fresh gush of tears in her eyes.</p><p>She wasn’t showing any weakness anymore. She was done being the vulnerable one, the accommodating one; if this was what Agatha had chosen for herself, who was she to deny her?</p><p>She still drove home wiping tears from her eyes and suppressing the occasional sob. Why did it have to hurt so much? Why did something she hadn’t even chosen for herself feel like it was the most profound thing to happen to her since she had first put her fingers on a set of piano keys? She had not asked for this. Agatha had wiggled herself into her life and made herself comfortable, carved out a space and demanded affection like it was her God-given right.</p><p>She tried not to, but when she arrived home, she dropped her bag on the floor and went to her office. In his enclosure, her house guest sat and looked at her with big black eyes when she turned on the light and carefully lifted him out, cuddling him and holding him close to her chest so she could feel him move with her touch. She both hated and loved how it felt like she was holding on to a part of Agatha, giving something love that willingly took it instead of making her feel like she wanted too much, like she demanded too much. She suddenly felt like a little child again, at the mercy of a cruel bully that was feigning indifference.</p><p>She went to bed with a heavy heart and bunny hair stuck to her nose.</p><p> </p><p>She slept in the next day and cancelled all her lessons as soon as she woke up. When she had reached all of her students, she slumped back in her office chair and looked over to Señor Scratchy, chewing away on some hay. Would Agatha come and pick him up? Rio still hadn’t figured out why he had had to move out, but shouldn’t the engagement at least sort <em>this</em> out?</p><p>She heard her phone chime when it sat on her desk. Turning it around, she saw it was a text from Agatha.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Hope you slept well?</strong>
</p><p>There were more she had missed. They had time stamps from the night before.</p><p>
<strong>AH (12:34 am): Did you get home alright?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH (02:02 am): Can you call me when you’re up? </strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH (02:13 am): Rio please?</strong>
</p><p>There were two missed calls as well. She ignored them and got the bunny some fresh water and lettuce.</p><p>She left her phone upstairs on purpose when she had eaten breakfast and made herself comfortable on the piano bench. At least there was nothing now that would distract her from her rehearsals. She had enough to work through and if centuries of musicians had been good any anything at all, it was using music to work through their heartbreak, right?</p><p>So that was how she spent her Monday and Tuesday, alternating between the piano, the pool and Señor Scratchy. She only checked her phone before she went to bed, ignored any of Agatha’s texts, and instead channeled any surplus in energy she had into transcribing new songs as a treat for a rehearsal she was especially pleased with. If it were the sappy love songs she had listened to as a teenager, that was nobody’s business but her own.</p><p>Her little bubble violently burst when her doorbell suddenly rang on Tuesday evening. She half expected it to be Agatha and didn’t answer at first, trying to stay still and pretend she wasn’t home (even though she would have most likely heard the music and how It had abruptly stopped).</p><p>It rang for a second time, followed by a knock and then a male voice asked whether anybody was home and that he had a delivery. She put the chain on and opened the door, peeking through the slit.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I'm looking for a Miss Vidal?”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s me,” she frowned before she finally saw the humongous bouquet of flowers in his left hand: white roses, lilac azaleas, and yellow daffodils crafted together with beautiful greenery and a small, envelop that had only her name written on it.</p><p>She signed for the delivery and started searching for a vase, unsure if she even wanted to look into the envelop at all.</p><p>In the end, curiosity got the better of her and she sliced it open with a kitchen knife.<br/>There was but a single line written on it.</p><p>
<em>I miss you so much, talk to me please?</em>

<strong>CHAPTER ELEVEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She did not want to talk to Agatha.</p><p>Of course that was a lie. Everything inside of her wanted to talk to Agatha, practically stretched itself out and continually reminded her of her heartbreak.</p><p>But there was anger too, anger that would not be flushed out by a bouquet of pretty flowers. And there was cold, hard reason too. What would she talk to Agatha about? She had said what she had to say. There was no use in speaking to her if she was still engaged to be married. And Rio knew she was still engaged because in a very weak moment two nights ago she had created a new, anonymous Instagram account and had followed all of Agatha’s friends.</p><p>In the privacy of her dark bedroom she had watched them all congratulate her, raving about the disgusting rock on her finger, posting <em>stories</em> with Agatha and Ralph leaning into each other, proudly presenting themselves as <em>Future MR &amp; Mrs Bohner</em>. Agatha had smiled in each and every one of them, but Rio hadn’t been sure if it had ever really reached her eyes.</p><p>Agatha herself had merely re-shared the <em>stories</em>, not posted anything herself – but they were all there on her profile. She was practically bathing in the attention she was getting, and for a moment Rio had let herself think how she would give her all the praise and love and attention in the world if Agatha’d only let her. Why did all of this seem so much better to Agatha when she was here, unable to sleep, pining for her with her entire heart, ready to hand it over on a leash if Agatha only asked for it?</p><p>She had money too. Granted, not the kind of money the Harknesses had, but somewhere in the small hours she had let herself estimate what it would take for them to live off of what she was making, whether she alone would be able to support them for a while. It was the first time she would admit to herself, that not only did she want <em>something more than casual</em>, that she didn’t just want Agatha to <em>leave Ralph,</em> but<em> leave him for her</em>.</p><p>But none of it mattered. It all hurt too much; it was practically bursting out of her, making her physically ill.</p><p>On Saturday morning Agatha’s friends were throwing her an engagement brunch, hideous white sashes and everything. Happy videos of champagne flutes and a personalized white heart-cake reading <em>A&amp;R</em> were flooding her feed. She pitied herself for replaying them only so she could see glimpses of Agatha in her white embroidered dress, hair all open and lush.</p><p>She missed how it felt underneath her palms.</p><p>Another text arrived shortly before noon. Agatha had tried and tried again to call, but Rio hadn’t picked up or reacted to any messages. But she read all of them. Several times. Until it had stung too much.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Did the flowers arrive?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: Please will you talk to me? I can’t stand not hearing your voice.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: I miss playing with you.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: Is Scratchy doing okay? </strong>
</p><p>
<strong>AH: I’d die for another picture of you two </strong>
<strong>💜</strong>
</p><p>One came in the middle of the night.</p><p>
<strong>AH: I’m thinking of you. Can I try calling you in the morning?</strong>
</p><p>She had tried, four times, but Rio hadn’t picked up.</p><p>Now, there was another.</p><p>
<strong>AH: I’m so sorry how we left things off. Can we please talk?</strong>
</p><p>She wouldn’t answer this one either. Not when she knew Agatha had sent it from the very same table that was currently celebrating her engagement.</p><p>Instead, she decided it was time to finally get out of her bubble. If she wanted to move on from this before she started her concerts in Boston, she couldn’t keep sulking in her house. There were things to do now anyway. She needed a new dress and shoes and a second suitcase to carry all the things she would take to the East Coast. If she focused on all of that for a while, maybe it would give her a chance to rearrange her priorities. At some point, she had looked forward to all this, had she not? Fall in new England – with its turning leaves and crisp, cold mornings? She hadn’t experienced proper seasons in at least ten years.</p><p>If nothing else would – putting distance between herself and Agatha would sort her out, she figured when she came back home in the early afternoon, having found a suitcase and shoes, but no dress she had liked well enough. But the moment she closed the door behind herself, and her glance fell on the plush, velvet piano bench, the emptiness and longing returned.</p><p>She had to force the visions of Agatha playing on the piano out of her head.</p><p>She needed distraction, she needed someone to talk to. So she called Milena, tempting her with German Gewürztraminer and a dip in her pool.</p><p>She did raise her brow when Rio spilled it all out to her over half a bottle of the wine, scolding her for not reaching out any earlier in her thick Bulgarian accent.</p><p>She didn’t judge her though, not for sleeping with a student, and not for the age difference.</p><p>“Rio that girl is no good for you, you need to drop it,” she argued as she took off her dress next to Rio’s pool, swimsuit underneath.</p><p>“I am dropping it,” Rio nibbed on her glass, her legs in the water. The alcohol felt good, numbing her thoughts in the warm evening breeze.</p><p>“I mean it, block her number, tell her to pick up rabbit – over, done,” she gestured, letting herself slip into the water, “you have so much to look forward to, you don’t need distraction.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio sighed and looked over to where the trees were swaying lightly.</p><p>Milena mumbled something in Bulgarian and reached for the glass that set next to Rio, emptying it.</p><p>“And then you look for a nice woman in Boston, do you know this – argh what is it – Tin-Duh? It’s online, full of horny people, I tell you, just like … how do kids say these days? Fuck it out?”, she snorted and let herself fall back into the water.</p><p>Rio chuckled and let her shoulders relax for what felt like the first time in days. Closing her eyes, he listened to the sound of the waves Milena was creating in the water. She would make it through this, right? Everything had been great before Agatha had waltzed into her life, had it not? She had this house, she had her career, her music, lots of things to love about her life. Maybe this was the nudge she had needed to start dating again, once she was over this entire affair. Maybe from these ashes she would build something new, something wonderful. And all this would be a memory, perhaps a wild story to tell one day.</p><p>She took a deep breath, smiling to herself, before she heard the familiar creaking of the garden gate behind her. Not processing the meaning sound fully, she looked over as Milena poured herself another glass on the ridge of the pool next to her.</p><p>There Agatha stood in her white embroidered dress, in between the bushes and trees, legs bare and hair open like it had been this morning. She looked like a forest goddess and a painful ache in Rio’s chest suddenly reminded her of all the beautiful things she couldn’t have.</p><p>“What the fuck is this?”, Agatha’s face contorted at the sight of the both of them.</p><p>
<em>The nerve this girl had.</em>
</p><p>“What are you doing here?”, Rio replied with a question, carefully keeping her voice neutral.</p><p>“Oh is this her?”, Milena supplied, raising a brow.</p><p>“I sent you a text,” looking at Milena, Agatha added, “who the fuck is this?”</p><p>“She’s a friend, and I didn’t say you could come here.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, her forehead wrinkled angrily. Rio could see that she was grinding her teeth, that she was suppressing a clamorous outburst – at least for now.</p><p>“Are you <em>fucking</em> her?”, she suddenly snapped, pronouncing every syllable like an accusation.</p><p>Milena snorted once more and sipped on her wine.</p><p>“That’s rich of you,” Rio laughed, poking her cheek with her tongue, and rose from where she was sitting. How had they gotten here? How was <em>she </em>suddenly in the wrong?</p><p>“So you are?”, Agatha hissed, jealousy dripping from every word. Her face was almost green with it. But there was something pained too, something insecure right in the corner of her mouth, where her lip was twitching.</p><p>“Let’s go inside,” Rio turned to Milena, “I’m sorry, I’ll be right out again.”</p><p>“No she won’t,” Agatha spat, arms still crossed, flinching at Rio touching her to steer her in through the office doors.</p><p>“What has gotten into you?”, Rio chided when she had closed the doors, hoping to keep al least the remainder of the conversation private.</p><p>“I just didn’t take you for someone who had numerous hoes on short dial,” Agatha sneered condescendingly.</p><p>The only reaction Rio could muster was a hollow laugh.</p><p>
<em>The audacity.</em>
</p><p>“First of all, Milena is not a <em>hoe</em>, she is a friend. Second of all, no I’m not sleeping with her, but even if I did, it would be none of your business,” she pointed to the ring on Agatha’s hand, “last time I checked you still had a fiancée.”</p><p>She saw a traitorous flicker in Agatha’s eye. It felt good to see her like this, it felt good being the one denying Agatha something when she was so used to getting what exactly she wanted.</p><p>“I don’t believe you! I’ve been trying to reach out all week, I have been sick with worry for you, I called so many times I ran out of excuses for hiding while doing it!”, she argued, and Rio could hear that her voice was almost breaking, “and all this time you’ve been replacing me with the next best slut!”</p><p>“You don’t have to find excuses to hide to call me, you can end all of this, it’s in your hands, tell them the truth, tell them you don’t want to marry him!”, she retorted, not even acknowledging Agatha’s envy.</p><p>“I told you it’s not that easy!”, she shouted, stomping on the ground.</p><p>“Then why are you here?”, Rio was starting to lose her temper, and her voice grew louder than she had intended.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer immediately.</p><p>Instead, she let out a quiet breath, rolling her shoulders uncomfortably and biting her lip and fumbling with her fingers, her glance pointed at the floor. “Why-why do you want me to break it off?”</p><p>Rio gaped at her incredulously, thoughts racing and tumbling all over one another, unable to form one coherent answer – no matter how easily it could have been condensed down to <em>because I want you so much it hurts</em>.</p><p>“Last time we spoke you-you didn’t answer my question. Not really, you just said you didn’t want anything serious with someone who can’t make up their mind,” Agatha whispered, probably uncomfortable with the silence.</p><p>“Agatha, it doesn’t matter what I want right now, you can’t just come here and accuse me of sleeping with someone else when all you ever said you wanted was just sex. What do you think does it feel like knowing you go home to someone else after… after we have sex? After you tell me how good it feels to be with me? After you-”, Rio buried her face in her hands.</p><p>“That’s different, and you know it is! I don’t even like him!”, she whined, her voice rising again.</p><p> “And how is that supposed to make me feel better?”, Rio retorted, she was reaching the end of her thread of patience, and she could feel it. Her skin was burning, her chest was heaving, “I’m still the one that wakes up alone, so forgive me if I invite friends over to feel it a little less.”</p><p>“I could have come over; I could have been here this whole time!”, Agatha yelled in accusation.</p><p>“I don’t want you here like that, Agatha! I don’t want you here if all I am is a dirty secret you hide from everyone,” she took a deep breath, angry, desperate and hurt enough to add: “And you know what? I don’t want to see you here anymore at all. I’ll recommend someone else as a piano teacher and perhaps that fiancée of yours can find some space for Scratchy, seeing that I am sure he loves his future wife very much.”</p><p>“You don’t mean that,” it was barely more than a whisper.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>
<em>She didn’t.</em>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Something inside Rio expected her to fight back, to make one more snide remark, perhaps ask for another way forward. Something tiny inside her hoped Agatha would simply take it as another challenge, or instead come to her senses, realizing how special the weeks they had spent together had been.</p><p>But she didn’t. She quietly nodded and pushed a loose strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>Opening the office doors, she stepped out and walked away without turning around.</p><p>Rio felt a sharp sting between her shoulder blades. It eased when Agatha closed the gate behind herself, and she made a hollow, bitter peace with it.</p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER TWELVE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>One week passed without another call from Agatha, and then another.</p><p>Before Rio knew it, August knocked on her door with its 100-degree days and chokingly humid nights. She got tan lines from not even an hour spent in her garden and thick callouses on her fingers from entire days of playing and practicing.</p><p>Poor Señor Scratchy was so warm in her office that she let him run around the foyer freely most days after finally making it bunny-proof.</p><p>She knew Agatha was still sneaking in when she wasn’t home. She found little traces of her – whether they were involuntary or left on purpose, she was never quite sure: The fall-board on the piano open when she was certain she had closed it, a little hay on the floor of her office when she had cleaned up the day before, a towel damp and re-arranged on a sunbed she never used.</p><p>Sometimes she found herself letting her fingers glide over the keys she was sure Agatha had touched and left invisible traces on. She resisted the urge to hold the towel to her face in hopes of finding Agatha’s scent on it, but she didn’t have the heart to wash it.</p><p>Her head made progress, busied with work and errands, but her chest still contracted uncomfortably every time she came home from any regular activities, anticipating to find a new hint Agatha had visited.</p><p>Her Instagram went silent as well. No more new pictures or stories. The initial excitement must have slowly worn off. Rio barely even spotted her in anything her friends shared. At some point she had noticed that Ralph’s profile was no longer on <em>private</em>, but all of his posts were at least a month old. She still followed with her decoy account – just in case.</p><p>Ideally it would have prepared her, perhaps warned her, but then she wasn’t glued to her phone 24/7 and had tried to stick to a more regular bedtime routine that meant she turned the lights off just after nine and switched the Wi-Fi off even earlier <em>(yes – of course she had googled how to best recover form heartbreak, and yes, a steady day-night rhythm was part of that, along with a smoothie-cleanse)</em>. Normally, she also turned on airplane mode, but she sometimes forgot when she was too tired.</p><p>That night she had fallen asleep over a book with her phone still on the second pillow next to her, almost out of battery, when it began to ring. Wearily, she sent the call to voicemail – whatever it was, it could wait until the morning. It rang a second time, but when she squinted at the screen reading <em>unknown caller</em> Rio silenced the call and placed the phone on her nightstand.</p><p>She +had almost fallen back asleep when it rang for a third time and Rio let out a long sigh. She picked it up again, looking at the time. It was quarter past one. What was so important at quarter past one that someone tried to call so incessantly? She half expected it to be a scam call, but then her phone normally filtered these out pretty well.</p><p>It didn’t matter. If they had called three times, they would call a fourth time. So she finally picked up, cursing with a raspy voice.</p><p>“Who the fuck is this?”</p><p>“Hiiiii oh my god, you finally picked up!”, a female voice that sounded somewhat familiar babbled, “is this Rhee-o?”</p><p>“It’s past one, who are<em> you</em>?”, she evaded the question (in case she was still being scammed).</p><p>“Right, I am so so so sorry to be calling this late, I’m McKayla, please tell me I got the right number, I was trying to reach a Rhee-o Vidal?”</p><p>Rio could hear loud music and a cacophony of voices in the background. Something splashed, then she heard a loud shattering sound that made her turn down the volume.</p><p>“Shut up Teegan, I’ve finally got her on the phone!”, the caller yelled at someone else, before apparently turning back to Rio, “listen, I wanted to call an ambulance, but the others say her mom will totally spiral after last time, like no cap, and Aggie’s been asking for us to call you instead-”, something else shattered in the background. It sounded like glass.</p><p>
<em>Aggie?</em>
</p><p>Rio was suddenly wide awake. There was a @McKayKay that had posted most of the stories from Agatha’s engagement party. She was about the same age as Agatha and wore the same kind of handbags.</p><p>“Wait who is this one more time? What’s going on with Agatha?”</p><p>“That’s the problem… we don’t know,” there was a crack in the line, “she was fine an hour ago. Teegan and Finny say she had too much to drink, but I’m not sure if she might have gone skiing in the bathroom.”</p><p>
<em>Skiing in the bathroom? What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>“She can’t sit up straight and she’s not making a lot of sense,” McKayla added, there was something whiny in her voice, “I don’t know what to do, none of us can drive and she doesn’t want to go home.”</p><p>“Have you tried her boyfriend?”, Rio massaged her forehead and switched on the light on her nightstand.</p><p>McKayla snorted on the other end.</p><p>“Yeah, like that would be any better. He flipped last time she got drunk. He doesn’t like when she parties…”, she let out a hollow laugh, “Aggie gets a bit… <em>unhinged</em> when she drinks… like she fools around – like totally innocent, just with girls sometimes, fuck I’m probably not supposed to tell you any of this…”</p><p>
<em>Extracurricular activities. So much for that.</em>
</p><p>Rio pressed her eyes shut again and let her face sink into the pillow below.</p><p>“Listen, I don’t know who you are to her...” McKayla’s voice turned softer, and the background noise seemed to quiet down a little, as if she had turned away from it, “but she’s only been asking for you, nobody else. Do you… do you think you can you come and pick her up? I can text you the address, we’re just at a friend’s house…”</p><p>Rio scratched the top of her head and felt a sting behind her temples. What did she care? Not her circus not her monkey. No need to get involved. Perhaps a good scolding was what Agatha needed, perhaps she needed to hit rock bottom to understand that her actions sometimes had consequences. That, like anyone else, she couldn’t have it all.</p><p>“What part of LA are you in?”, she moaned and flung her legs over her bed, looking for her slippers.</p><p>“Loz Feliz – can you hurry? That you so much! She really doesn’t look good, I’m sending you the address right now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in her car a solid five minutes later, wearing ugly sweatpants and a hoodie over her pajama top. She covered the distance that would have taken her a good hour to drive in normal traffic, in twenty minutes. It was still enough time to ask Siri about the meaning of “going skiing” and the answer increasingly worried her. She had always taken Agatha for a <em>wild child</em>, for someone who liked testing her limits – but recreational cocaine on top of alcohol? Even she should have known that that was just downright reckless and stupid. Biting the skin inside her cheek, she pushed down a creeping feeling of guilt.</p><p>Her left leg was nervously tapping the floor of her car as she turned off the freeway and into another posh neighborhood with large, Spanish style houses on big plots of land. She could hear the music from the moment she turned into the street McKayla had sent her the address to. A crowd of college students were coming in and out of the house. It smelled like weed and there was litter everywhere in the front lawn. How none of the neighbors had called the cops yet remained a mystery to her.</p><p>She parked her car on the opposite side of the road in a tow-away zone (but to be fair, who would tow her car at quarter to two in the morning?) and immediately got out, texting McKayla that she had arrived.</p><p>It took less than thirty seconds for the blonde to cross the street to her. Rio recognized her immediately, tall and skinny, with straight hair and a golden cross around her neck. She had been to Europe with Agatha earlier that year – at least if Agatha’s Instagram posts were to be trusted.</p><p>“Oh my god you actually came!”, she shouted, tumbling a little, visibly inebriated.</p><p>“Where is she?”, Rio cut to the chase, phone in hand in case she actually had to call an ambulance.</p><p>“We moved her outside, she’s by the garage,” McKayla pointed to the side of the house. It was too dark for Rio to see, but as she came closer, she was able to make out Agatha’s silhouette and then all of her. Beautiful long curls falling over a tiny top that looked more like a bra with an additional ribbon of lace. She was wearing the shortest skirt Rio had ever seen her in, but what was worse was that she looked pale and zoned-out, pupils dilated to the max and unable to focus on anything properly. Rio’s heart broke in half, both parts shattering on impact. Had somebody done this to her? Or had she done it to herself?</p><p>“This is how she’s been since you called and you didn’t think an ambulance would be appropriate?”, she snarled and quickly knelt down in front of Agatha, shoving another girl away.</p><p>“N-no'mbulance, memothur's gunna kill me,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Rio took her face in both of her hands.</p><p>“Agatha what did you take? Just booze or did you use anything else?”, she shook her lightly until her gaze met Rio’s and her face twisted into something incredibly sad.</p><p>“R-Rio?”, she asked with a toneless voice, “baby I don’t feelsegood.”</p><p>The way she murmured the pet name made something twist inside Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“I know, I know,” she bit her lip and nodded, “can you tell me what you took? Did you do any drugs? Are you overdosing?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted again, her pupils turning left to where a bright light shone in the garden behind the house, where the party still seemed to be going on.</p><p>“Agatha mi amor please talk to me,” she almost begged, gently rutting on her head as if she could shake her out of it. How had it come to this? How were they here, sitting in the damp grass against someone’s house, surrounded by drunk people and loud music when they could have been huddled up together on Rio’s couch, watching a movie, cuddling with Señor Scratchy. How was<em> this </em>better?</p><p>“A-are you gunna tae' me home, p-please?”, Agatha shivered, a small tear forming in her eye as she looked back at Rio, “’m cold. I only smoked a joint, I swear! I’m so sorry!”</p><p>Rio nodded and bit her upper lip.</p><p>“Do you think you can stand and walk to my car?”, she asked and stroked Agatha’s cheeks one more time, they were icy cold “where is your purse, do you have the keys to your house with you?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”, Agatha dragged the last syllable out, before her eyes widened, “no, no I can’t go to my house, my mom-my mom is gonna skin me alive!”, she shouted with whatever strength was left in her.</p><p>“Last time she partied she had to take her bunny to a shelter,” McKayla supplied, head down, arms crossed in front of her chest.</p><p>
<em>To a shelter? </em>
</p><p>Was that what she had told her friends?</p><p>“You’re all some great friends, aren’t you? Calling someone you don’t even know to pick up a drunk girl,” Rio snarled, propping Agatha’s left arm over her shoulder.</p><p>“She only wanted you,” the other girl scratched her head and looked to the ground, “she’s been talking about you all night.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and lifted Agatha up, gently putting her arm around her waist.</p><p>“Can you walk at all?”, she whispered into Agatha’s ear and received a weak nod.</p><p>Slowly but surely, she maneuvered her to her car, hearing her mumble on about not having had <em>that</em> much and how sorry she was for the mess she was making. Gentry rubbing her back, Rio tried to soothe her before she buckled her up in the passenger seat.</p><p>“Tell me if you need to throw up, I don’t have a bag on me,” she told her when she started the engine, Agatha blankly stared out of the window with half-hooded eyes. The breath made the window go foggy. Maybe a hospital would have been the better choice after all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t throw up during the drive, but as soon as Rio had walked her into the house, she started retching and barely made it into Rio’s downstairs bathroom before she emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how long they sat there together, her holding Agatha’s hair back, tracing her fingers over the small of Agatha’s back, telling her it was alright, telling her she was there and not leaving her alone. She still looked beautiful like this, with smudged make-up, red eyes, sweat-soaked clothes, and unmade hair. No matter how angry Rio was, no matter how much a tiny, resentful voice inside of her argued she should never have picked up the phone, she would not have entrusted anyone else with looking after Agatha like this.</p><p>“How are you feeling?”, she asked, holding Agatha’s hand, slowly watching her skin turn rosy again, when she hadn’t thrown up for a good while.</p><p>“Better,” she mumbled, eyes closed, head leaning against the cold tiles.</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll get the guest bedroom ready for you,” she sighed and tried to get up, but Agatha pulled on her hand.</p><p>“You said you wouldn’t leave me alone”, she whined, “please don’t make me sleep alone.”</p><p>Her heart cracked again.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Together, they made it up the stairs to the first floor. She helped Agatha out of her party clothes and gave her an old, Oregon-themed sleep shirt to wear in bed, before she placed a glass of water on her side table and pulled the blanket over them both.</p><p>She expected Agatha to turn away, still delirious and dizzy from the combination of alcohol and marijuana, but instead she scootched over, burying her face against Rio’s back and digging her nails into the fabric of Rio’s pajama top. She let it happen when slowly, Agatha’s hand crept around her waist and the length of her body pressed up into Rio.</p><p>There was only one, small sob before she whispered, barely audible: “please don’t replace me with someone else”.</p><p>At any other hour of the day, Rio would have responded, would have told her she wasn’t replacing her. That she was irreplaceable. That she needed to know what she had to do in order for Agatha to call off the engagement, so she could do it. But tired and exhausted like this, she didn’t have the strength to start another argument that would lead nowhere.</p><p>And perhaps that was the wrong call to make, perhaps she should have just turned around and had that conversation right then and there. Because at some point during the night something must have snapped inside Agatha’s mind. There was no other explanation she could have imagined for the way she woke up, lazy twilight shining through her windows, Agatha’s head between her legs, her pants pulled all the way off. She was staring up at her, her lips over Rio’s clit, sucking the swollen skin all the way into her mouth as her nails, now long and pointy again, dug into Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?”, Rio breathed, aroused and confused at the same time. A better person would have shoved Agatha away, a better person would have immediately told her to stop. But the sight of her lover like this after so much time apart had made her weak, weak for every touch she could get.</p><p>Agatha let go of her and crawled next to her, sloppily pressing her glistening lips to Rio’s so she could taste herself as Agatha’s left hand came up between her legs again, eagerly collecting any traces of moisture she had left there herself moments ago.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t help it. She moved her right hand to Agatha’s waist, then stooped lower, finding short, soft curls between her legs, damp with arousal. She dipped two of her fingers through them, finding the small, familiar bead on top of Agatha’s folds in an instant.</p><p>“Say that you’re mine,” Agatha pressed out and gasped at the touch, “say that you’re mine, say that you only belong to me!”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard and pressed down a tear.</p><p>
<em>Yes, yes, yes - now and forever if you’ll have me, please, for every day of my life.</em>
</p><p>“Leave him, please,” she murmured, resting her head against Agatha’s.</p><p>There was no response. Of course there was no response.</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s fingers pushing through her slit, she could feel the pointy nails and wondered for a split second why she had been so opposed to them. The way they stung was delicious.</p><p>“I’m gonna ruin you for everyone else, you’re not gonna be able to ever let anyone else fuck you Rio, I’ll make sure of it,” Agatha snarled with a low voice as she increased her speed. It was hateful. Hateful because it was desperate and entirely unnecessary. There was nothing to ruin anymore, the spell had already been said and cast long ago.</p><p>She tried to focus on her own fingers, tried to work her way down as she continued to make small circles, eliciting raw moans from Agatha, but it became harder and harder when Agatha started biting her neck, sharp teeth plummeting into her skin as if she thought there was a way to physically mark her as her own.</p><p>She came like that, reveling in the pain, unable to continue her own ministrations. She was sure Agatha could feel her clench around her fingers, but even if she did, she didn’t seem to care. She continued to fuck her through it, and when she was done, she shuffled so she sat on top of Rio, one hand on her neck, the other, still slick with Rio’s cum, playing with her clit again.</p><p>“Again!”, she ordered, and Rio coughed, staring into Agatha’s blue eyes as she gasped for air, unsure if she needed to fight the hand on her throat or press it tighter. Either way, it was ridiculous how quickly she recovered, feeling a familiar cold tingle between her thighs as she grew overstimulated. Agatha held her down as she switched between pumping into her with wet sounds and rubbing her clit until black dots appeared behind Rio’s vision and she came again, throwing her head back with a silent scream.</p><p>She almost didn’t notice Agatha climbing off of her.</p><p>At some point, she heard water running in her en-suite, before her mind slipped into a shallow slumber. It felt like seconds, but really almost an hour must have passed. When she woke up again, the room smelled like her favorite body wash. Agatha must have had showered before she had gotten dressed, now standing in her door frame. She was still wearing the shirt, but Rio could see the fringe of her skirt underneath and her handbag slung over one shoulder.</p><p>“I can’t Rio. I just can’t. I’ve only ever known <em>this</em> life. I can’t lose my family; I don’t even know what I would do with myself without it all.”</p><p>And Rio knew there was no arguing anymore, that there was nothing she could have said that would have swayed her.</p><p>“Then you’ll lose <em>me</em>,” was the only thing she could reciprocate.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and nodded, clutching the strap of her handbag. Rio could see that there were tears forming in her eyes.</p><p>“Goodbye,” she sobbed and turned around, running down the stairs and out of the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>There was a tiny spider on the ceiling above her, moving in the crack that connected it to the wall. She had been watching it for a good while. It had wandered all the way over to the other side of the room and come back. She made a mental note to take it to the basement later to make sure the cleaners wouldn’t get to it. Something so tiny didn’t deserve to be killed. While she was at it, she also had to take out the trash herself, she didn’t need anybody else to find the tiny liquor bottles Teegan and her had emptied over the weekend while pre-gaming.</p><p>She took a deep breath in, listening to her bed creak. How long was this gonna take? Would it be rude if she checked the time on her phone? He’d been at it for least twenty-five minutes straight. Who took that long to come? It almost felt insulting to her.</p><p>“Hmm are you doing good?”, she plastered on her sweetest smile and looked up to him.</p><p>Ralph had his eyes close, as per usual, and didn’t open them when she addressed him. Sometimes she wondered if he was thinking of other people too. He also didn’t respond. Good. At least he wouldn’t complain about the condom again.</p><p>Closing her own eyes, she felt how dry her pussy was. So dry in fact the only sound in the room was his shallow panting. <em>Welcome to the rest of your life, Agatha Harkness</em> – no – <em>Bohner</em> if he had his way. Fuck this shit. She needed him to hurry up, she didn’t have all day to perform uninspired hetero missionary for him.</p><p>Thinking of something else had helped in the past. Thinking of Rio had usually helped.</p><p>Flashes of long black hair appeared in front of her eyes along with plump, red lips, open for her to stick in her fingers – or other things. Lord, she had wanted to wear that strap for her so bad. Fuck, she should have done that while she had still had the chance to, “please, baby, please,” she moaned. She almost felt the afternoon breeze coming in through an open window in Rio’s bedroom, the white, messy sheets underneath her, Rio’s soft hands on her body, <em>mi amor</em>.</p><p>Suddenly, she wanted to scream.</p><p>“Stop it,” she opened her eyes and moved, “for fuck’s sake stop it or I’ll throw you off the bed,” she threatened and pushed him away.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”, he almost whined.</p><p>
<em>Pathetic.</em>
</p><p>“I’m tired and I’m getting a headache,” she grumbled and wrapped herself up in a robe. She needed a shower. She always needed a shower after he’d been near her.</p><p>“Oh no, do you want some Advil?”, he ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>“I’m good thank you; can I call you tomorrow? I have some stuff to do…”</p><p>“Yeah, sure sweety pie,” he flung the used condom into her trash and put his trousers back on, “we can try again, don’t worry.”</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, pulling her legs to her chest, as he placed a kiss on top of her head.</p><p>“You make me <em>so</em> happy,” he whispered, and Agatha wanted to puke.</p><p>“Have a good day,” she pressed out, the corners of her mouth twitching with the fake smile.</p><p>It had taken her three full weeks to let go of any spontaneous inklings to drive over to Rio’s house at a moment’s notice to hang there for a bit. Going through her phone, she found the pictures she had taken of Rio’s calendar in her office. She had only photographed the pages up until the last weeks of July, but then Rio’s schedule didn’t change much from week to week. If they were still correct, she was at the institute right now for her weekly meeting with a group from the LA Philharmonic, afterwards one of her students would come by. No window of opportunity to sneak in anyway then. It frustrated her. What was she supposed to do with this random Tuesday now that she had gotten rid of Ralph? For a moment, she wondered if hitting up Kareem, her Dior Sales Assistant, was an option. But then she had already dropped ten grand there the week before. The shopping bags were still unpacked, sitting in the corner of her room, with pretty white bows tied around them. It took her a second to think about what she had even bought.</p><p>So no Dior then. Maybe dropping by the spa? She could get her nails done now that they didn’t need to be short anymore, she guessed.</p><p>
<em>For fuck’s sake when had her life become so boring?</em>
</p><p>When her phone <em>dinged</em> then with a new message, it should have caused her excitement, but it was just a reminder: A reminder for the wedding dress fitting the next morning.</p><p>Her mother had made the appointment, probably eager to get the dress sorted as soon as possible. She and Ralph’s mother had set the wedding date for March the next year. They would have probably gone with even earlier if most of their favorite locations hadn’t already been booked-out for the season. Lorie Bohner was coming for the fitting of course. Lorie Bohner was unstoppable in that regard; she had already sent Agatha trillions of pictures regarding her own outfit and had shortlisted five caterers.</p><p>Naturally, she was in insanely high spirits when they met her at the bridal shop the next morning. The thing was, Lorie Bohner had no daughters, just two sons of which one was gonna marry Agatha in the spring, and one was in the military and stationed in Guam with few prospects for a wife (and even fewer for one that that would speak her language) – which meant that she had quickly started calling Agatha her “favorite daughter”.</p><p>It was almost disgusting seeing Lorie and her own mother going through the dresses together, suggesting the ones they liked best to Agatha. The poor saleswoman was trying to loop her, <em>the bride</em> – after all, in as best as she could, but Agatha quickly confirmed what she was already expecting: she had no say in the matter whatsoever. And really, she didn’t care enough to bother. Let them pick a dress for her.</p><p>“Honey is there anything <em>you </em>like?”, the elderly woman tried.</p><p>“Oh don’t worry she has no taste,” her mother laughed, “if this was up to Agatha, she would be in a mini dress with her breasts out.”</p><p>
<em>Granted, she was probably right.</em>
</p><p>“I’m sure we can look for something short yet modest-”, she woman tried once more, but was shut off immediately.</p><p>“No, my son isn’t into that kind of stuff, she’s his princess, we absolutely need something regal!”, Lorie snickered and brushed Agatha’s arm.</p><p>Agatha nodded with a fake smile and rolled her eyes as soon as she had turned around again.</p><p>“Will she be okay with sizing? She had a large breakfast and is 10 pounds up form her usual weight,” her mother asked in all earnest and Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Mother!”, she yelled, but it was to no avail.</p><p>“The seamstress can take that into account when she comes for tailoring, it’s not a problem at all,” the saleswoman answered, not without giving Agatha one more sympathetic look.</p><p>They stuffed her into two princess ballgowns, one mermaid cut, and an A-line that was so unflattering she could have gotten married in a potato sack instead. She was sweaty, her hair was straggly, and her breakfast was rumbling in her stomach, looking for a reappearance.</p><p>“Jesus Christ Almighty, Agatha what’s taking you so long?”, her mother moaned when she was squeezing herself into their last pick, something more tight, but embroidered with Swarovski rhinestones from top to bottom.</p><p>“Calm down for fuck’s sake, I just need a moment!”, she yelled back.</p><p>In hindsight, she should have probably not sent the saleswoman away. In hindsight, she should have let her help her zip her up, but if she had felt <em>one</em> more touch on her body, she would have flipped.</p><p>She stared at herself in the mirror. The zipper on her side was only halfway closed, the dress was way too tight for her. No wonder, it was an Italian 34. She looked like an overstuffed sausage, bursting at the seams.</p><p>Rio had liked the way her stomach sometimes rolled in on itself when she sat on top of her, pinning her arms down. Rio had loved squeezing every inch of her hips. Rio had never once commented on any of the curves that made up her 145 lb body.</p><p>Agatha felt her lower lip tremble as she stared at herself in the mirror. And then her breakfast did make an appearance again. It came over her so quickly, that she barely reached the bowl of the toilet in the adjacent restroom before shutting the door and switching on ventilation for noise. She retched into the ceramic, emptying the contents of her stomach with painful cramps as her throat burnt up and her nostrils filled with snot.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck was she doing here?</em>
</p><p>“Agatha honey are you alright?”, she heard Lorie knock on the door.</p><p>“’m fine, thank you, just a moment!”, she croaked, spitting into the toilet once more.</p><p>
<em>What kind of deal was she signing here?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like any of them,” she announced when she stepped out, back in her hoodie and sweatpants, “we need to keep looking.” She was done for the day.</p><p>Under her sunglasses, she stared right into her mother’s face, looking for a reaction, waiting for a condescending remark. But her face remained the same, stone cold and unmoved. Lorie shrugged her shoulders and sighed.</p><p>“Oh it’s no matter honey, we’ll find something for you!”, she reassured her, “I didn’t find my dress until we hit the fourth store!”</p><p>Agatha gave her a neutral shrug.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope you know how much effort everyone if making for you. You could have done much worse,” her mother reprimanded her when they were back in the car, driving home, “not every man puts up with antics like yours.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and stared out of the window and into the rows of happy homes that lined the streets of Beverly Hills.</p><p>She holed up in her room for most of the afternoon, playing farming games on her phone, listening to Fanny Mendelssohn while she tried to ignore the empty corner, she had kept Scratchy’s night cage in.</p><p>She didn’t feel like dinner.</p><p>The next morning she missed him so bad, she got into her car and drove over. She had to figure out what to do with him after all. At some point Rio would grow tired of him, and if she noticed Agatha coming in and out of the house, she would probably spiral. On the drive, she thought about whether Lorie would make a good advocate for Scratchy coming home, at least until they had found a house for her and Ralph. Oh well – there was an upside to all of this Agatha hadn’t even thought about yet: She was moving out. Granted, she was<em> moving in</em> with Ralph, but who would he be to deny his wife a pet in her own house?</p><p>She made a mental note of that when she slipped though the garden gate <em>(make sure future house is bunny-suitable)</em> and walked over to the office door. Unlocking it, she had to rattle on the door handle when it didn’t immediately open, it had probably just slightly warped from the heat. When she gently threw herself against it, it opened. Scratchy instantly noticed her and got up on his hind legs, leaning against his encloser to greet her.</p><p>“Ohhhh my baby boy I’ve missed you so much”, she cheered and sat her bag down by the desk, lifting him out and letting him kiss her nose, “I know, I know my sweet boy, mommy is so, so sorry,” she reassured him, squishing her face into his fur, “I’ll find a way to take you home, I promise!”</p><p>She closed her eyes and sucked in the fresh scent of hay on him through her nostrils. In another life, she sometimes liked to think, she would have had a farm somewhere far away from California. In another life, she wouldn’t have had to move Scratchy into her piano teacher’s house and offered to fuck her as a <em>thank you</em>.</p><p>Deep in her thoughts, she didn’t notice the door opening behind her and someone stepping through. She only realized she wasn’t alone when something pointy was stuck into her back, and she heard an unfamiliar, shaky voice.</p><p>“Don’t move or I’ll shoot!”</p><p>
<em>As if.</em>
</p><p>Agatha turned around and raised a brow, “that’s a fucking umbrella not a shotgun you imbecile,” she huffed, continuing Scratchy’s ministrations like she was some grade-b villain.</p><p>The boy in front of her had short and black curly hair. He was barely taller than her, and probably even a little younger, maybe in senior year.</p><p>“The fuck are you?”, she asked.</p><p>“No you tell me your name first; you broke in here after all!”, he stammered.</p><p>“How do I know <em>you’re</em> not the intruder? The heck are <em>you</em> doing in Rio’s house? Where is she?”, she snorted.</p><p>“I’m taking care of it while she’s gone,” he pressed his hand to his mouth, “which I don’t think I was supposed to tell a stranger, shit, I’m sorry!”</p><p>Agatha raised her brow once more. Jesus Christ, what was it with men these days? But then she remembered the first part of his answer.</p><p>“She’s gone? Where’s she gone? For how long?”, Agatha’s eyes widened with an onslaught of worry.</p><p>“Uhm, she is in Boston, on her tour… are you some kind of friend of hers? Or why are you holding her bunny?”</p><p>
<em>Fucking hell, of course she was in Boston. How did Agatha forget that?</em>
</p><p>“Excuse me, he’s <em>my</em> bunny, Rio’s just taking care of him!”</p><p>“Okay, okay I’m sorry – I’m just here to feed him and clean his cage and water Miss Vidal’s plants. She lets me use her grand piano to practice on in exchange,” he raised his hands defensively.</p><p>Agatha scrutinized him curiously from head to toe. He was a bit of a goth, ripped jeans, black nails and all, but generally seemed harmless.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>“Wait, are you Agnes?”, his face lit up at once.</p><p>“The name’s Agatha!”, she spat, “and what if I was?”</p><p>“Yes, sorry, right! Uhm, there is a letter for you on the keyboard,” he pointed to the desk behind her, and he was right. There, over the black, old cable-keyboard in front of Rio's monitor, sat a large, white envelope that had her name on it, “she said you might drop by.”</p><p>Agatha carefully placed Señor Scratchy in his cage. She hoped the boy didn’t notice how shaky her fingers were when she took the envelop into her hands, holding it like it was made out of thin glass. She looked back at him, and he began to stammer again.</p><p>“I…uhm…I guess I’ll leave you to it then, uhm, maybe lock the door when you leave?”</p><p>She nodded and sat down in Rio’s chair, thinking how strange it was to see the room from her perspective. For a moment she hesitated to open the letter, wondered if she really wanted to read the words inside of it. But then, it was all already written. No matter how long she waited, the words wouldn’t change. So she read.</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Dear Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>If you are reading this, I believe congratulations are in order. I can’t say I have much advice to give, I have never been married, but my mother always used to say the key to a good marriage is never to go to bed before an argument is resolved, and never to forget that the other person is just human too. </em>
</p><p>
<em>So much for that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I wanted to use this occasion to thank you for our time together. Every single moment was precious to me, each and every one of them I hoped I would get to relive infinitely. Whenever you left, I would start counting the hours until I would see you again. And every hour spent together was much too short. Now that we are going separate ways, I wish I could rewind the clock just to do it all again once more, enjoy it from the very start until its end. </em>
</p><p>
<em>I am not mad with you. Some things run their course. Some things are not meant to last. I think I understand now, that all of this is perhaps more difficult for you than it is for me, even though at the beginning I was sure it was the other way around. I wish you nothing but happiness, I hope he takes good care of you and makes you feel loved. And I hope you get to love him with all your soul as well. Sometimes these things just need a little time. Forgive me if I have misspoken before. It was not my place to judge.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I am due back on October 14<sup>th</sup>. Ideally you will have found a better place for Señor Scratchy until then, one of my students is taking care of him right now, I showed him how and he is a good boy, he’ll be gentle with him, so please don’t worry. I already miss him and his fluffy fur.</em>
</p><p>
<em>One more thing, I see a lot of people trying to find their way around music, and believe me, most of them are absolutely useless at it. Of course that doesn’t mean they can’t just enjoy for themselves, but my point is – you are <u>not</u> one of them. You are talented. You are special.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t forget that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours, R.</em>
</p><p>Enclosed with it came a hand-transcribed version of <em>Thank You For the Music, </em>arranged for the piano.</p><p> </p><p>The tears didn’t really come until after she had left and driven to the beach. She wasn’t even sure which one, she had just driven aimlessly and suddenly seen the sign for it and parked. For all of it, she had felt as if an anker chain had wrapped around her chest, weighing her down and rendering her unable to breathe properly. The convulsive sobbing had eased it a little.</p><p>
<em>makes you feel loved</em>
</p><p>But now she was sobbing and gasping at the same time, swallowing air in heaps as she sat on the beach, Rio’s letter still in her hand, some of the precious words smeared.</p><p>
<em>some things run their course</em>
</p><p>She coughed and hammered the free fist into the sand until it hurt.</p><p>
<em>love him with all your soul</em>
</p><p>Fucking shit, how fucking blind had she been with all the dirt she had smeared on the windshield of the car she was driving? How had she truly believed that she could be happy in this sorry excuse of a life: Sleeping until just before noon, shopping, drinking, fooling around with other drunk girls because it didn’t count when you were both so shitfaced at least the other one would have forgotten in the morning. But Agatha never forgot. Agatha never forgot how their plump, soft lips felt, how their hands were so much gentler and how she got wet every time one of them would touch her with even a pinky.</p><p>And then Rio. Her nerdy, sweet, savant-y, obnoxious, introverted, loving, talented, beautiful Rio.</p><p>She loved her so fucking much. She loved her so fucking much and she had known it for so fucking long and hid it so well for so much time until it had all run out on her. What if she had just told her? What if she had just dared to peak out of that secure, little cave she had barricaded herself in and for just a moment allowed herself to admit that the little horny crush she had harbored within herself since that very first day she had stepped through Rio’s door, was actually full-fletched, cinematic, all-consuming love? But then that would have ruined her perfect little, unimportant life. That would have been an inconvenience.</p><p>
<em>Rio. An Inconvenience. What the fuck was wrong with her?</em>
</p><p>She thought of the way Rio touched her, kissed her, made her shiver with need. She thought of how she hadn’t known the difference between <em>fucking</em> and <em>love-making</em> before Rio had first laid hands on her. She thought of how Rio had willingly caught her every time she had tumbled.</p><p>If only she had been brave enough to acknowledge it then, when she had still had her. Oh the days and weeks they could have had together…</p><p>Now she was fucking stuck here, about to become Agatha Marie <em>Bohner</em> in a hideous princess dress. Because God forbid, she had to show someone her true colors. Someone, who would have probably scooped her up in her arms and told her it would be fine and that they would figure out what to do about the fucking money.</p><p>In her sobbing, she looked over to three women that were flying colorful kites in the shapes of sea animals, krakens and whales. High in the sky, they were dancing under the clouds. The small lines connecting them to the ground were almost invisible. One could have thought they were free, moving based on their own volition.</p><p>She cried until the sun was nothing more than a faint yellow line over the horizon and a strong wind had picked up. There were dark clouds on the horizon, midnight-blue and wrathful. In her self-pity, she over-dramatically wondered if she could just wait until a flash would hit her. But then hadn’t that been exactly what had gotten her here? Just waiting around for things to unfold so she didn’t have to make any hard decisions? And how had that worked out for her?</p><p>Perhaps it was time she started standing up for herself instead of wallowing in self-pity.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s feet hurt. They hurt so much she had to massage them every night and change shoes on a daily basis so different parts of her soles would hurt instead of the same over and over again. She had blisters too and already gone through multiple packages of hydro-seal Band-Aid. She simply wasn’t used to all this walking. When she had called the event manager at Symphony Hall to ask whether she needed to rent an apartment with street parking, he had laughed and told her she wouldn’t need a car. Which had been true – but now she was walking everywhere, back and to the concert hall, to the supermarket, into the city (granted she could have taken the tube, but that would have saved her next to no time). Technically, it was probably good for her stamina and fitness, but <em>jesus </em>did she miss her car.</p><p>It had another upside too though, one more important to her even: She was getting familiar with the city even quicker than she had hoped. Boston was the complete opposite of Los Angeles and therefore seldomly reminded her of Agatha. With its old, cinder-colored buildings, it’s green leaves that were just on the verge of turning yellow, and the many cute little coffee shops she walked up to every time she simply felt like it, it seemed like a whole other world. Maybe even another life.</p><p>And no, she wasn’t <em>okay</em>, she was far from <em>fine</em>. But she would be. At some point.</p><p>Her concerts had started out great with a fully sold-out house on her first weekend. Thinking of it had made her nervous back home, but now that she was here, recovering from her summer romance, the melancholy had quieted her stage fright. The standing ovations she had gotten on her first night had helped as well. She had played an encore every night since then, mostly her self-transcribed music, a little bit of <em>Roxette</em>, something from <em>Fleetwood Mac</em>, and even a <em>Madonna medley</em> to mix it up before her guests were leaving.</p><p>The Globe had even written about it and praised her for her performance.</p><p>
<em>Unlike other childhood prodigies – Rio Vidal has actually managed to develop her talent. She plays with so much emotion, one is almost tempted to ask ‘who hurt you’ and ‘can we thank them for this’?</em>
</p><p>Well, as they say, sometimes a broken heart did wonders for an artist.</p><p>Her concerts ran Friday through Sunday, one performance per night and followed by a meet-and-greet afterparty on Saturdays, with no more than thirty guests and some of the venue manager’s staff. The first one of them had been nice – there had been canapes and champagne, and the guests were mainly elderly people that either been listening to her since she had first gained recognition or simply enjoyed Schubert’s music and were interested in her interpretation of his work.</p><p>The teaching also helped. She had been invited to give a series of guest lectures at Boston University, just one or two per week, but the preparations kept her busy. She had forgotten how much she actually liked musical theory. She was good at it too and the students were engaged every time she lectured. All of them <em>wanted</em> to be there, her course was optional, but she saw the same crowd attend every week.</p><p>She had dated too. Well, she had gone on two first dates with women she had met online, native Bostonians, both about her age. They had been nice. Easy on the eyes, and each of them fun in her own way. The first one had taken her to a bowling alley on a Thursday night before they had gotten deliciously thin pizza from a sketchy-looking takeout place. She had lived her entire life in Boston and was recently divorced from her male high school sweetheart. She would have gone home with Rio, if she had asked her.</p><p>The second one had taken her to see a baseball game and invited her for sushi. She had flirted with Rio so hard it had been difficult to fend her off at the end of the night. There had not been a single thing they had been able to agree on during the entirety of the afternoon, yet for some reason she looked completely disappointed when Rio gave her a kiss on the cheek and said goodbye when they had eaten.</p><p>None of it had felt <em>right</em>. None of it had felt<em> fair</em>. None of it had felt any <em>good</em>.</p><p>What felt good though was that the small, studio apartment she had rented came with an electric Yamaha piano. It was small and the sound was not even close to the quality of the grand piano at Symphony Hall, but it allowed her to play in private. And sitting right there, in the quiet of the tiny space with the big windows, she played and thought of Agatha.</p><p>She like to imagine her dress shopping to the tune of<em> slipping through my fingers</em>, getting her hair done at the salon to <em>honey honey</em>, or snuggling with Scratchy with <em>dancing queen</em> playing in the background. Sometimes she thought of herself as a silent spectator in this life she had constructed for Agatha, where she was a happy bride, giddy to get married to the boy of her dreams.</p><p>By now, she was sure, Agatha would have come around to find her letter. And because she hadn’t heard anything from her, she figured it had been the right thing to do. It was Rio’s lifeline, really, that <em>she</em> had given it all up and set Agatha free so that Agatha would no longer have to make that choice. She often smiled at the thought. Agatha was so much more resilient than her, she was probably already so far over the whole thing it was nothing but a summer-fling to her. At least Rio liked to think that. That Agatha was suffering less than her. That she wasn’t turning around in the street when she saw someone walk by that resembled Rio, that she didn’t think of Rio’s wet hair when she smelled chlorine.</p><p>One evening right after she had arrived in Boston and felt particularly lonely, she had felt the urge to creep back onto her Instagram profile, just to check up on her, on how the wedding preparations were going. But the moment she had seen the pink circle around Agatha’s profile picture she had reconsidered and unfollowed her and all of her friends. She hadn’t opened the app ever since, and when her first Friday concert had rolled around, it had distracted her enough not to try again.</p><p>By the second weekend now, she had mostly gotten the hang of it already.</p><p>The concert started at six, with doors opening at five. Which meant she had to be there by three at latest to speak to the piano- and stage technicians and check the tuning and sound quality of the piano and the get at least a few minutes of warm-up and preparation in. At four she went into her dressing room to settle, and put on one of the dresses she had bought literally just a day before she had left LA. Afterwards, the theater assistant, a young woman that went by Mackie, and the make-up artist the concert hall had hired for her, Barbara, would swoop in and get her ready.</p><p>It had been the same on all three nights the week prior. Mackie would talk her though the special guests that were attending, VIPs that would either like to greet her during the intermission or later at the afterparty – usually major donors or local politicians, nobody that Rio knew. It had all been pretty much the same, which was why when she walked into her dressing room on the second Friday she was playing, she was rather surprised by the large bouquet of flowers sitting on a table next to the vanity. A representative from Symphony Hall had presented her with one after the first night she had played, sure, but that had been just that – after, on stage, and personal.</p><p>“Mackie?”, she stepped out of the door again, calling for the tiny brunette that was nowhere in sight in the hallway, “Mackie?”, she frowned and stepped back in.</p><p>The bouquet was ginormous, all in white: roses, hydrangeas, baby breath, and chrysanthemums paired together with pale greenery. How on earth was she supposed to even get that home? Stepping closer, she saw that there was a card attached to it.</p><p>
<em>the way you play makes my soul bloom</em>
</p><p>The font was swirly and upon closer inspection, she saw that it was handwritten in blue ink. Rio raised an eyebrow and the corniness of it all, completely over the top. Why the heck was this anonymous? She finally heard Mackie stepping into the room and turned around.</p><p>“Do I have to be concerned about a stalker?”</p><p>Mackie chuckled.</p><p>“Only <em>you</em> would get a bouquet and immediately think you had a stalker.”</p><p>“But it’s anonymous. Who sends flowers anonymously?”</p><p>“Well, some men like to be mysterious I guess,” she gestured to the card, “what does it say?”</p><p>“The way you play makes my souk bloom,” Rio repeated it to her.</p><p>“Aww sounds like someone older maybe?”, she gushed and stepped closer, “anyway, it was delivered about ten minutes after you got in, I could ask reception if they remember from which vendor it came – just in case you’re concerned.”</p><p>“Would you mind?”, Rio bit the inside of her lip.</p><p>“Of course, maybe he’ll reveal himself during the intermission though. I’m sure it’s just one of the VIPs wanting to make an impression,” she smiled.</p><p>He didn’t. An elderly gay couple in their seventies did come to chat with her behind the stage during her intermission, but if they had sent the flowers, they didn’t mention it to her. And if it had been from them, wouldn’t the card have read “the way you play makes <em>our</em> souls bloom”?</p><p>It didn’t sit right with her when she stared at it later, after the show, massaging her fingers and waiting for Mackie to see if there was anything that still needed preparation for the next day and to hear if she had been able to find out about the delivery.</p><p>“So reception said it came from a local flower shop in Cambridge, but whoever ordered them didn’t leave a name and paid through their website,” she shrugged, “I wouldn’t worry Rio, most of our artists get these, sometimes dozens of them, and the message isn’t threatening or over the top.”</p><p>Rio gave her a nod and looked back the flowers.</p><p>“Can I leave them here? I don’t want to carry them home to be honest.”</p><p>“Yeah sure, I think someone else is in here on Monday, but we can always figure something out for when you leave on Sunday?”</p><p>Rio gave her a tentative nod.</p><p>“Other than that you’re good to go, the crowd has cleared out – did you want me to call you a car this time?”</p><p>“No I’m fine,” she said and sighed, getting up from her chair and wrapping her coat around herself. Probably by something akin to muscle memory, she suddenly felt the urge to bury her face in soft bunny fur.</p><p>It would have probably remained nothing, but a strange occurrence had it not been for the second bouquet that arrived the next day. This time, it didn’t appear out of nowhere, but instead Mackie brought the delivery man downstairs with her.</p><p>“And you really don’t know who ordered them?”, Rio asked him, opening the second card.</p><p>
<em>you’re the crescendo in my heartbeat </em>
</p><p>“No mam, I don’t have access to that kind of credit card information, and I’m pretty sure the boss won’t be able to tell you either,” he handed her the flowers, pink tulips, camelias, and lavender this time.</p><p>“Maybe they’re from someone else?”, Mackie tried and fiddled with a leaf, “or maybe he’s at the party tonight – Rio just be happy you have a secret admirer, every woman in Boston would be jealous of you!”</p><p>“I’m not used to that kind of attention,” she sighed and thought of the flowers Agatha had sent her the days after she had gotten engaged. Why did it feel like that had been an entire lifetime ago?</p><p>“Are you okay?”, Mackie touched her arm with a concerned voice. She must have looked sadder than she had intended to.</p><p>“Yeah, just thinking of someone that used to send me flowers too,” she smiled and let out a long breath.</p><p>“Aww, perhaps it’s him!”</p><p>“Oh, no, for sure not,” Rio laughed. For a moment she thought about correcting the pronoun, but even that almost felt too painful, “it’s fine, I’ll take a car back tomorrow so I can get them home, I’ll leave them here until then.”</p><p>Mackie nodded before calling Barbara to tell her that Rio was ready for hair and make-up.</p><p>Playing didn’t come easy to her that night. She hit all her notes, that wasn’t it. But right from the start she had to repeatedly roll her shoulders while they were cramping up. It made her focus slip, made her face look stern instead of relaxed. For forty-five minutes she hoped no one was noticing it.</p><p>During intermission, she immediately stormed into her dressing room to massage her muscles. When she saw the flowers, she felt her heart beating faster. <em>No no no no no no</em> she had been doing so good keeping her stage fright under control, why was this happening to her now? Taking a sip of champagne, she tried to focus on her breathing. Just thirty more minutes and then the afterparty, she would be fine, she would be okay. She had done this before. She knew the music, she didn’t even need the sheets, she just had to imagine she was playing to an empty void.</p><p>Going back on stage, sitting down on the bench, she closed her eyes and hummed a quiet tune. She could feel their glances on her, two-thousand people waiting for her to begin again. Somewhere, someone cleared their throat. She could hear a door swing shut and looked up. Suddenly, she was right there, sitting in the very first row, mahogany hair over a lilac dress and nobody else in the audience, just the two of them. She leant forward and raised her eyebrows, <em>c’mon Rio, get over yourself and stop with the humblebrag, just go slow</em>.</p><p>She was a beautiful vision, her incessant, grumbly, stubborn, confident girl.</p><p>Rio nodded and placed her hands on the keys and began. Slow and steady, different than she had opened until now, but it worked. She didn’t think of anything else than her <em>audience of one</em> for thirty straight minutes and it carried her through until the applause erupted around her. She swiped the single tear that rolled down her left cheek from her face before she rose to bow and start her encore.</p><p> </p><p>“You should play more ABBA,” Mackie told her when she met her at the afterparty, “they ate it right up,” she chuckled.</p><p>“Oh let’s see,” Rio smiled and looked at the crowd. She was ready to go home, ready to crawl into her bed and properly cry it out and when she finally turned the key to her apartment and hour later, she did just that, not paying a single mind to removing her make-up or clothes.</p><p>She knew that grief came in waves, that heartbreak didn’t heal in a linear way, that this would keep happening for a while, but it felt so unfair, so lonely – like she was the only ship on an empty, black ocean with nothing but the moon illuminating her path into the unknown. She wanted to hold her so much, she wanted to feel Agatha’s hands on her skin, telling her she’d done good, that she’d played well and that all of them had loved it. But there was nothing but cold air, a damp pillow, and empty sheets.</p><p> </p><p>She spent Sunday alone in her apartment, sulking on the small couch and eating ice-cream until it was finally time to walk over to Symphony Hall. On her way there, she thought about perhaps renting a car to go up to Salem the next day, just to look around, just to get out for a day. The seaside there was supposed to be nice this time of year. Perhaps it would be good. Perhaps Mackie could even get it sorted for her if she asked.</p><p>Arriving at her dressing room, she got changed and washed her face with cold water. If grief like this came in waves, she just had to wait for it to break. And maybe the next one wouldn’t be as high, wouldn’t swallow her up whole.</p><p>Coming out of the bathroom in her long back dress, Mackie was already waiting for her in the door frame, making a funny, wrinkly face.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”, Rio immediately asked.</p><p>“You’re not gonna like this, but there is another flower delivery,” she bit her lower lip, “they’re saying you have to sign for it because it comes with a gift, do you think I can send him in real quick? I’ll call them tomorrow morning and tell them not to take orders for you anymore if it really bothers you.”</p><p>Rio moaned and massaged her temples.</p><p>“Send him through,” rolling her shoulders she watched Mackie disappear in the hallway as she looked for a water bottle and turned around. She heard footsteps approach until someone knocked on the already open door.</p><p>“Delivery for Miss Vidal?”</p><p>Well that was a weirdly high voice for a man.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio turned back around, taking another sip only to almost spit it out into her mirror.</p><p>“Fuck you look hot in that!”, she blurted out, all of her hair underneath a newsboy cap, a humongous bouquet of red roses in her right hand, “oh – shit uhm, I meant: SUR-PRIIIIIIISE!”</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?</em>
</p><p>Rio coughed and clutched at her chest until she breathed normally again. <em>She wasn’t imagining this, was she? </em></p><p>“How are you here?”, she got out in utter disbelief.</p><p>Agatha took off the cap and let her hair spring free, lush strands coming down over her black suit, “ouff that was hot,” she mumbled to herself.</p><p>“Agatha what the fuck?”, Rio repeated, and Agatha finally looked at her.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders in discomfort and swallowed before she spoke, “well, I guess practically… I’d like to ask you for a second date,” she nodded, “but more fundamentally speaking, it’s probably a second chance I need.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t stop staring at her. She had never seen Agatha in anything else than hyper-feminine, colorful, tight clothes and here she was in a dark, oversized suit. And that wasn’t even the confusing bit. The confusing bit was how the twenty-two-year-old, that was supposed be to getting married, had somehow sneaked her way into Rio’s dressing room on the other side of the continent, holding a ginormous bouquet of red Baccara roses. Rio looked at the other two bouquets when it hit her that they must have come from Agatha as well then.</p><p>“So the flowers were from you?”, she asked.</p><p>“Yes…” Agatha pouted, “who else did you think they were from? Are you seeing-”</p><p>“<em>You’re the crescendo in my heartbeat</em>?”, Rio interrupted her, not ready to bring Agatha’s jealousy into this conversation, holding up the card.</p><p>“It’s supposed to be romantic, duh,” she shrugged and carefully placed the roses she was still holding on to on the table.</p><p>“It’s a bit much, don’t you think? Considering everything.” Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Well <em>I </em>thought it was fitting,” she rolled her eyes and looked at her nails. Pink, but short again.</p><p>
<em>God she was really here, was she? Flesh and blood, not just another vision. </em>
</p><p>“You still haven’t answered my question by the way. How you are here?”, Rio probed once more, still processing.</p><p>“Took a plane, silly,” Agatha shrugged.</p><p>Rio looked at her long and hard. It’d not even been five minutes, and she was nothing more than a few inches away from losing her patience.</p><p>“You’re being evasive again. I didn’t think you had driven here,” she deadpanned and crossed her arms, “how are you here when you’re supposed to be planning a wedding at home?”</p><p>“I’m not planning that wedding anyway,” she mumbled and let herself sink into the armchair by the door.</p><p>“Sorry what was that?”</p><p>“My mother is planning the wedding, I’m… not really involved in that,” Agatha raised her eyebrows absentmindedly and something twisted inside Rio’s stomach. If she hadn’t called off the wedding, what was she even doing here?</p><p>“So you’re here for fun,” it wasn’t a question, it was more an assessment.</p><p>“No I’m not, okay?” Agatha raised her voice, looking into the hallway and lowering it again, “can I shut the door please?”</p><p>Rio nodded and sat down in her own chair.</p><p>“I got your letter,” she started when she had sat down again, the door closed now, “I almost know it by heart now, actually,” she confessed, “and it meant something to me, okay? It’s a <em>really</em> nice letter… nobody’s ever written me a letter like that, like a lo-,” she paused and shook her head, “so I came here to be with you.”</p><p>“Agatha, it’s a simple question, did you call off the engagement yes or no?”</p><p>“Okay can you… can you cut me some slack here please Rio?”, she sighed, and her tone was almost desperate, “I’m trying to figure out <em>how</em>, could you just give me the benefit of the doubt while I gather enough courage to do it? My whole life is potentially about to turn upside down and I don’t even know yet what to do in a world where I don’t just swipe a credit card to get… <em>almost</em>… whatever I want…”, she surged, but her voice was still shaky.</p><p>“So you’re here for and extended weekend then?”</p><p>“No, no I have a flexible flight ticket. If you want me to leave, I can. But I’d rather stay and… show you that you matter to me too.”</p><p>For the first time since Agatha had walked through the door, Rio relaxed her shoulders and just looked at the younger woman, really took her in. A day ago she had cried herself to sleep over the absence of her body next to hers, had fantasized about her sitting in the audience. And now she was here, trying to make amends with flowers and poetic messages. There was a part of Rio that wanted to forgive her on the spot, a part of her that was itching to have her back in her arms at the earliest convenience, right now if possible. That part of her was primal, an instinct that had come alive when Agatha had stumbled into her life and would always, always come running when Agatha called. But Rio couldn’t rely on it alone if there was so much else standing between them.</p><p>She was just about to say just that when there was a knock on the door and a moment later Mackie stuck her head in, “oh I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were-”, looking at Agatha, now no longer in disguise, she frowned and glanced over to Rio, “are you alright?”</p><p>“We’re good,” she nodded.</p><p>“Barb would like to get started, if that’s alright with you?” Mackie asked, still looking at Agatha.</p><p>“Yes, of course, send her in,” Rio rose and waited for Mackie to close the door before she addressed Agatha once more, “I need to get ready; can we continue this later?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Do you need a ticket for the show?”, Rio asked, rising from her chair and scratching her forehead.</p><p>Getting up as well, Agatha shook her head, “oh I’ve got one.”</p><p>Rio huffed at that. Of course she already had a ticket.</p><p>“I’ll let Mackie know to let you back down here afterwards.”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha nodded, “thank you.” She was almost out the door, when she turned around one more time, “you played <em>the winner takes it all</em> last night.”</p><p>“I did,” Rio nodded.</p><p>“You once played that for me.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s why I played it yesterday,” she admitted, trying not to let too much emotion seep into her voice.</p><p>Still, a tiny, loving smile formed on Agatha’s lips and Rio could see that she that she was biting the insides of her lower lip. Her features merged into something hopeful.</p><p>“I’ll see you later,” she said in a soft voice and for a moment Rio didn’t want her to leave out of fear she might run off again, when she had only just arrived.</p><p> </p><p>Going on stage, she let her eyes wander over her audience as it applauded, hoping that by chance she would spot Agatha sitting somewhere close, somewhere she could look at if her stage fright overwhelmed her again, but she didn’t see her. Still, knowing she was there, with her eyes on Rio, nothing else on her mind, instilled a quiet sense of content within her. Somewhere in that crowd of people, there was one person that was here for her, not for her music.</p><p>Mackie made some suggestive comments when Rio asked for glass of champagne for the first time ever during her intermission and hummed about while she was massaging her hands.</p><p>“So that <em>someone</em> who used to send you flowers…”</p><p>Rio gently nudged her into the side and stifled a chuckle.</p><p>She thankfully didn’t mention it again when she escorted Agatha back into the dressing room right after the concert had ended and Barbara was still trying to get all of her bobby pins out of Rio’s hair.</p><p>“You played <em>super trouper</em> as an encore,” Agatha grinned cheekily, when they were finally alone.</p><p>“I like to pretend I am versatile with my music,” Rio shrugged, avoiding Agatha’s glance.</p><p>“So it had nothing to do with me then?”</p><p>“Nothing, I’ve been playing ABBA encores every night,” she lied.</p><p>“I know for a fact you didn’t. On Friday you played Coldplay. Which was really nice by the way, you should do that more often.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow at that.</p><p>
<em>So she’d been here for that show as well. </em>
</p><p>Agatha must’ve seen Rio’s face change and realized that she had given herself away, so she immediately waved it off as if it was nothing. She looked around a little bit instead, letting her fingers glide over Rio’s woolen coat, looking at the sheet music on the vanity.</p><p>“Did you like tonight?”, Rio asked, observing her from where she was sitting. It hadn’t escaped her that Agatha was stalling, was just a tiny bit anxious to pick up from where they had left off before the concert.</p><p>“I like it better when you play modern stuff… sounds more like you,” she summarized, and Rio grinned with half of her mouth at the non-answer that was so like Agatha, evasive yet sweet and full of profound familiarity.</p><p>“And I take it you liked my dress?”, she tried again, just to tickle her and coax some kind of reaction out of her. And oh she had landed on the right thing. She saw Agatha’s hand tremble for just the fraction of a second, saw her eyes dart over to where Rio was comfortably lounging in her chair.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she looked back at the sheet music, “yeah looks pretty good on you. Tight things look good on you,” she waved her hand up and down Rio’s form, suddenly so much less sure of herself than she had been earlier in the evening. Oh and Rio enjoyed it so much to hold the reigns for once, to have Agatha wrapped around her little finger, knowing she was no longer at <em>her</em> mercy, but that they had somewhat leveled the playing field.</p><p>“So what’s it to be?”, Agatha suddenly looked at her, trying to hide the tremble in her voice, “are you gonna give your lying, cheating, looser student a second shot at this or not?”.</p><p>
<em>Submission truly looked good on her sometimes.</em>
</p><p>Rio took in a long breath. She'd had the entire evening to think about this, but somehow it still felt as if she was leaping into ice-cold water. It tore at her, the way she wanted it all so much, but was frightened of it more than anything else.</p><p>“We can go and have coffee tomorrow, and then we’ll see,” Rio started, though when Agatha’s face lit up, she raised her finger, “but Agatha, I swear if I get the impression that I’m being used, that this is your,” she air-quoted, “last ‘<em>sapphic hurrah’</em> before you marry a man, I’m calling it all off. You need to make up your mind until I go home. And if you feel like you’re no longer here to see if you and I can be anything else beyond… <em>casual</em>, I need you to leave too. And when you do it’s over, and I don’t ever want to hear from you again.”</p><p>She could see Agatha swallow. Her glance fell back to the sheet music while she carefully nodded.</p><p>“Sounds fairer than what I deserve,” she mumbled, “there’s one thing I would like to ask though, if it’s alright?”</p><p><em>Back at making demands, was she now?</em> Rio still let her.</p><p>“I know this is rich, coming from me…”, she scratched her forehead and avoided looking at Rio again, “but can we… can we be exclusive while… we’re doing this?”</p><p>“You’re right, it’s a little rich, you still being engaged and all,” Rio frowned.</p><p>“I’m not texting him, I swear the day I got your letter was the last day I let him within three feet of me, but the mere thought of you being with someone else makes me <em>so</em> sick, Rio, please,” her voice was small and desperate. Rio had difficulties to not immediately cave. Of course there was nobody else. She had barely been able to kiss her date on her cheek a week ago, who the fuck was she kidding?</p><p>“Alright, just me and you, no one else,” Rio agreed and saw Agatha’s face light up with relief, “will you help me get these home?”, she pointed to the flowers.</p><p>“Of course!”, Agatha shot up out of her chair, probably eager to start making amends now that the ground rules had been laid out.</p><p>“There won’t be an invite to come in,” Rio added.</p><p>“Oh my god, no, no I didn’t expect one at all!”, Agatha lifted her hands defensively and it made Rio grin.</p><p>She went to change in the bathroom then and left a note for Mackie to get the dress dry-cleaned for Friday before they walked upstairs, Rio carrying the red roses with just a tiny bit of pride while Agatha had somehow managed to gather both of the other bouquets in her right arm.</p><p>The night air outside was fresh and cold, imbued with the scent of early autumn. Waiting for Agatha to come through the revolving doors, Rio lifted her nose up and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath in. She felt how it filled her lungs, cooled her down from within. She heard Agatha stepping next to her and with it the rustle of the flowers. She was here. <em>She was really here. </em>Maybe it wasn’t just Agatha’s heart that was <em>blooming.</em></p><p>They made small talk on the short way home to Rio’s apartment. Agatha was staying at a hotel by the harbor and had eaten nothing but clam chowder since she had arrived on Friday morning. Rio liked listening to her rant about the flight being late, or about the cab she had taken from the airport being smelly, but the longer it went on, the more she wondered about what her family and Ralph were thinking about all of this. She made a mental not to ask, but didn’t feel like that was a can of worms she wanted to open right there and then.</p><p>Agatha helped her carry the flowers up the short flight of stairs and handed one after one to Rio as she was putting them onto her kitchen table. True to Rio’s demand, Agatha patiently waited on the door mat and didn’t set a single foot into the apartment. Rio came out to her one more time when she had put all bouquets into a single bucket with water so she could find vases for them in the morning.</p><p>“Thanks for the help,” Rio nodded to her, “are you gonna be okay going home?”</p><p>Lifting her hand, Agatha showed her her phone, “I’ve called an Uber.”</p><p>“Good, text me when you’re at your hotel okay? And, how about you pick me up here tomorrow, ten thirty?”</p><p>“I’d like that,” Agatha nodded before adding, “sleep well, Rio.”</p><p>Of course it felt strange letting her go like that, without even a hug. Her fingers twitched with eagerness to hold her back to let her in after all, and while the part of her that was always on Agatha’s side wanted nothing more, she also knew she wasn’t ready to blow caution into wind just yet. In a way, she hadn’t even finished licking her wounds – she didn’t want new ones to be torn open already if she could help it.</p><p>So “good night Agatha,” was the only thing she said, watching her walk down the stairs.</p><p>She was almost ready to shut her door, when Agatha turned around one more time.</p><p>“Hey Rio?”, she caught her still standing in the door frame, “I never properly thanked you for picking me up that night. I wasn’t in a good place then, and I think things could have gone South pretty fast if you hadn’t been there.”</p><p>Visions of Agatha appeared behind her eyes, pale and meek. She never wanted to see her like that again.</p><p>“Thank me by never doing it again. It’s no fun dating a drug-addict,” Rio joked, and Agatha chuckled, nodding quietly before she waved goodbye one last time.</p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rang her doorbell not a minute after ten thirty the next morning. And not that she needed to know that, but Rio had already been leaning against the door, impatiently waiting for her to arrive, fumbling with a loose threat on a cardigan she was carrying along.</p><p>She met her downstairs in blue-jeans and a white top with a nice cleavage (which she had hoped would be appreciated) only to be surprised by Agatha in a pastel, long, twirly dress and fluffy, open, un-styled hair. It looked gorgeous, wavy and untamed and it matched her nervous smile when she saw Rio coming down the stairs through the window in the door.</p><p>“Hi,” she said, and it sounded breathless.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio replied, feeling her hand itch to reach out and squeeze hers.</p><p>As they started walking towards Rio’s favorite coffee shop, she felt a strange sense of familiarity pulse through her veins. The last time they had been like this with each other, they had been sitting on the brim of the Harknesses’ pool and talked about going to Nappa. It seemed funny now to think about that night and to think about how she had imagined the two of them sitting at a table for a dinner in a vineyard, even though she had turned Agatha down almost immediately. What felt even stranger now was that afterwards, after they had held hands and made mooneyes at each other, Agatha had gone back in and gotten engaged. And even though since that night there had been so much grief and heartbreak between them, it was as if they were picking up right from where they had left off. As if someone had cut the sad scenes out of a movie and stitched the happier parts back together. She loved listening to Agatha yap about how Billy had threatened her with an umbrella when she had visited Señor Scratchy, loved observing how little dimples formed in the corner of her mouth when she was laughing. And she loved how the skin on her arm rubbed against Agatha’s ever so often while they were walking, almost bumping into each other now and again.</p><p>It gave her goosebumps she was hoping Agatha wouldn’t see.</p><p>When they arrived at the café, she showed Agatha the backyard, a little walled garden with small white tables, before she got them both iced lattes, one with oat milk for herself and one with whipped cream and lavender syrup for Agatha.</p><p>The air was crisp, it would have been cold without the sun shining down on them, but the sky was bright blue with not a cloud in sight. It spoke of a delicate balance, not yet cool but no longer warm, like a tune played just a touch slower as the symphony of the season had shifted from summer’s lively allegro to autumn’s tender adagio. There were only a few more other people, all engulfed in their own conversations, enjoying the quaint Monday morning.</p><p>“So, how have you been?”, Agatha asked her when they had both taken their first sips.</p><p>“Good, mostly,” Rio nodded, using her straw to mix milk and espresso, “it’s been a lot.”</p><p>“I can imagine…”, Agatha copied her motions, but didn’t immediately follow it up with another question. For a moment, she wondered if Agatha was waiting for her to say something, to start a conversation, but then she looked over to where Agatha was still using the metal straw to stir the purple syrup into her drink and saw her jaw clench and her teeth grind. She looked jumpy, as if she was carefully contemplating her next move. Fuck, was Agatha Harkness really nervous to be on a date? Rio let out a silent chuckle, but was immediately caught.</p><p>“Are you laughing about me?”, her face looked distraught.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have. It’s just strange to be here with you,” Rio confessed.</p><p>“Tell you what, I felt so much surer of myself the last time I took you out, there is so much pressure now,” she pouted and avoided looking up.</p><p>“Pressure?”</p><p>“Well if I fuck up, will you just send me home?”</p><p>“How are you gonna fuck up? It’s just coffee,” Rio laughed and tried to make it sound kind.</p><p>“No it’s not just coffee! This is my one shot at convincing you I’m not an asshole, and here I am, and I don’t even know what to talk about,” she whined in true <em>Agatha-dramatic</em> fashion.</p><p>“How did you get Señor Scratchy?”, Rio asked, and it was really her genuine interest, but Agatha grimaced at it.</p><p>“No, I’m supposed to ask you something interesting, and then you answer and I’m going to make a smart contribution to the conversation, so you see I’m not an idiot!”</p><p>“Agatha,” she reached over the table and caught the tips of Agatha’s fingers with her own, “I really want to know, please tell me,” she encouraged her. Agatha looked at their fingers long and hard before she nodded and finally leaned back in her chair.</p><p>“He’s three. I saw a woman on TikTok who had bought him for her daughter for Easter, but the daughter had lost interest in him and the mom was looking for someone to take him. Normally these kinds of videos have hundreds of replies, but they didn’t have any… so I messaged her and picked him up two hours later.”</p><p>“I had my money on you buying him on a whim,” Rio tilted her head and had another sip of coffee.</p><p>“Oh boy is that the impression you have of me?”, Agatha looked dismayed and furrowed her pretty brow.</p><p>Rio scrunched up her nose apologetically.</p><p>“Fair enough I guess…”, she sighed, “anyway my mother threw a huge fit, she got so pissy she didn’t want me to take him into the house at first, but she eventually gave in.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I promised I wasn’t gonna <em>party</em> anymore.”</p><p>“Oh…”, Rio slumped her shoulders, vaguely aware that ‘not partying anymore’ was most likely a proxy for ‘fooling around with other girls’. But then she remembered, “but you were at a party the night before you brought him to me, right?”</p><p>Agatha gestured with one hand, “which is how he ended up with you”, she let out another sigh, “and to round it all up, he’s actually the reason we met at all. I came home late one night drunk and with lipstick on my collar and neck and the deal was that I take piano lessons again so I would get to keep him,” she shrugged.</p><p>The casual summary of how Agatha had gotten to show up at her door hit Rio like a baseball bat at full speed. She still remembered the words in Mrs Harknesses’ email: <em>my daughter has been spending time around the wrong kind of people, and I was hoping that rediscovering her childhood hobby would keep her from trouble</em>. Only Rio had thought ‘the wrong kind of people’ were drug dealers or criminals, not partying college lesbians.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she muttered, looking down into her glass.</p><p>“It’s alright… I guess I would have never met you had it gone any other way,” Agatha shrugged. Her voice as sweet and it brought a smile to Rio’s lips. When she looked up again, into Agatha’s face, her expression was warm and grateful.</p><p>“Is your relationship with your parents better?”, she asked.</p><p>“They’re both not here anymore. My father died when I was little, and my mother went back to Puerto Rico when I was done with college. She died a few years ago.”</p><p>“Oh I’m so sorry I-”</p><p>“It’s fine don’t worry,” Rio stopped her with a wave of her hand, “it was a heart attack while she was working in her garden, she never saw it coming. If I was death, that’s how I’d take people.”</p><p>“I’m still sorry. Here I am moaning about my mother when yours is gone already…”, Agatha sighed and let herself sink back into the cushion of her lounge chair.</p><p>“To be fair, you mother sounds like a handful…”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath in and looked into the garden where two little birds were chasing each other.</p><p>After a while, she turned her head back to Rio and began to speak about how she had never known her father, but knew she was the outcome of a short affair her mother was regretting to this day. How her stepfather seemed to be the sanest person in her family, but basically only lived to be ordered around by her mother. She also told her how her mother had never gone to church when Agatha had been little, but suddenly found faith when Agatha had been in middle school.</p><p>“I think it’s a way for her to feel better about herself, like she has been forgiven, and she has repented… there’s a lot of self-hatred there, but at least she is ‘better’ than other single mothers”, she shook her head and took a long breath in, “but the main thing is that she told me that the family fortune wouldn’t go to someone who wasn’t ‘walking the righteous path’,” Agatha air-quoted and grimaced. Rio hated it, but understood where it came from, telling Agatha about her own Catholic upspringing, about how sin and confession had always been a big thing for her abuela, who had helped raise her. She told Agatha about how her grandmother had once, after her father had already been dead for several years, chased and whipped her mother’s new boyfriend out of the house with a kitchen towel, shouting about purity and the sanctity of marriage.</p><p>“So you’ve never had a girlfriend then?”, Agatha asked, when the sun was already past its highest point in the sky and they were on their third round of flavored coffees.</p><p>“No… I mean, I think I was always very scared to think about what I wanted in that regard… specifically when it turned out men weren’t an option,” Rio scratched the patch of skin beneath her ear thinking back to her younger self, confused and full of shame.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha’s eyes blew open, “was<em> I </em>your first time? Were you a virgin when we met?”, she shot forward in her chair.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure whether the thought of that excited or deterred her.</p><p>“Jesus Agatha no, I went to college,” she laughed, and Agatha crossed her arms malcontentedly.</p><p>
<em>Excitement then. What a little perv she was.</em>
</p><p>She looked cute like that, almost annoyed and grumbling at the thought that she <em>hadn’t</em> deflowered Rio.</p><p>“Although it’s always been very special being with you,” Rio decided to add quietly, because she knew it would mean something to Agatha too and because it was the truth. There had never been anyone else that had turned her head quite like this. Nobody that had made her feel like she was both interesting and desirable. In a way, that probably meant Agatha had kept her promise about <em>ruining</em> her for everyone else. But then, perhaps Agatha had ruined everybody else for Rio. Even with all that stood between them, she had raised the bar so high no other woman would ever reach it.</p><p>“For me too,” Agatha answered even more quietly.</p><p>Her cheeks were rosy, and Rio was certain she was rolling something over in her head, contemplating something. It seemed to have gotten all the way to the tip of her tongue when she swallowed it back down and sipped on her coffee instead.</p><p>Rio wanted to reach out again, hold her hand and ask her what she was thinking about, whether any of it was giving her grief. God, it had only been a few hours and all she wanted was to beg her again to end the engagement so she could take her home and forget about the entire ordeal once and for all. Get it behind them so they could look ahead. It was funny how her perspective on these things had changed so profoundly. Up until the very moment she <em>couldn’t have</em> Agatha anymore, she had come up with so many (seemingly good) reasons why she <em>shouldn’t have</em> her. They all felt so irrelevant and minor now – finally like the laughable excuses they had been.</p><p>It was Agatha who picked the conversation back up from where it had rested for a moment. She steered it into a more upbeat direction, asking Rio how she had discovered music as a child and teasing her about her still non-existent social media presence. It didn’t feel like time was passing at all, but it must have, because just before four, the barista sheepishly told them he was closing up and they needed to leave.</p><p>Agatha walked her back home, arms crossed in front other chest, while they were both laughing about something Rio would not remember by the time they reached the door of the brownstone she was staying in.</p><p>“Thank you for coffee,” Rio told her, when she was looking for her keys.</p><p>“My pleasure. Can I text you tomorrow? In case you’d like to… hang?”</p><p>The keys in her hand Rio looked up form her bag and into Agatha’s eyes. It had been a while that she had observed them this closely. They were still as brilliantly blue as she remembered them. In the afternoon light, they sparkled.</p><p>“Are you busy?”, came out of her mouth before she could give it a thought.</p><p>“What do you mean?”, Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Do you have any plans right now? Do you need to be anywhere?”</p><p>“Oh, I was just gonna go back to my hotel and watch <em>Bachelorette</em>, so no…”, she smiled and shrugged, leisurely pointing into the direction she was headed.</p><p>Rio took another look at her. <em>Urgh, you know what? Fuck it.</em></p><p>“Uhm, I know this little Italian place a few blocks down, would you… would you like to go?”</p><p>Agatha’s face lit up momentarily.</p><p>“Yes! Yes I would love that!”, there was something squeaky in her voice. Upon noticing it, she seemed to try to tone it down a little, “I mean I’m getting hungry anyway.”</p><p>The restaurant wouldn’t open until five so Rio made them take a detour through some of the streets she had sometimes wandered when she had needed to get some fresh air. The sun had stretched low now, painting the red and russet brick of the brownstones with a golden hue, as though the buildings themselves were basking in the final warmth of summer. A soft breeze was picking up down the tree-lined streets, perhaps summer’s farewell letter written in shades of amber and crimson. She saw how Agatha shivered and took off the cardigan that she had wrapped around her waist a while ago, gently placing it over Agatha’s shoulders. Her hand brushed Agatha’s when she reached for the fabric to adjust it and even in the setting sun, she saw her cheeks flush again and her eyes get glassy. She managed to suppress any thoughts about a life where she got to take care of Agatha the way she wanted to, listening to the younger woman reminiscing about how she had once played <em>Like a Prayer</em> on the organ at her church when she was supposed to play <em>What A Friend We Have In Jesus. </em></p><p><em>Fuck</em>, she loved listening to Agatha’s deep voice, loved how she gestured dramatically with every point she was making.</p><p>Shortly before five they turned into the street with the restaurant at its other end and asked for a table in a quiet corner. Over <em>ragu, focaccia,</em> and <em>gnocchi alla panna</em> they shared family style, Agatha made Rio tell her about Puerto Rico and the few childhood memories she had from there. She insisted Rio speak Spanish with her and tried to reply with what little she still remembered from school. Still, Rio reveled in listening to how she was rolling her <em>rrrrr</em>-s and Agatha couldn’t get enough of it either.</p><p>“It’s just <em>so</em> sexy when you speak Spanish,” she bit her lower lip, and Rio felt the need to cover her eyes with her palm as she smiled along timidly.</p><p>There is was again, that strange sense of familiarity, of belonging. As if there was no other place she was meant to be, as if all of this was by design, predetermined. She felt like a magnet that had been displaced somewhere but was now sensing its mate and being drawn in its direction, bit by bit, inch by inch. Once more, she thought of how much she had worried about all the things that made them different: the age gap, their characters, how they had lived completely diverging lives - but if magnets could be polar opposites and still were meant to be conjoined, who was to say her and Agatha could not have a shot at happiness in this life?</p><p>Looking at her wiping up the rest of the ragu with the last bit of focaccia, Rio didn’t want the night to ever end. They only left when the waiters finally asked them to, and they both laughed about how they had now been thrown out of a place twice in one day.</p><p> </p><p>Walking back to her apartment, Rio wondered whether there was any way to stretch it all out further, whether there was a bar close by where they could go, just for one more drink and a little bowl of peanuts, but they arrived at her apartment sooner than she had expected.</p><p>She was barely able to stop Agatha from taking off her cardigan, telling her to keep it for her way home, when it hit her: She didn’t want Agatha to go home. Well, truth be told, she also didn’t want to be <em>the other one</em> anymore, but here they were, on a pavement in the middle of Boston. A thousand miles from home. Deep inside, Rio wondered how much it all really mattered. Whether it might just be her <em>fate</em> to give into the temptation even if it meant she was practically offering Agatha to rip her heart straight out of her chest again.</p><p>She was glad when Agatha spoke, taking the decision out of her hands.</p><p>“I know it’s been a very nice day, and as much as I want to, I don’t have sex on the second date, no matter how pretty the woman is,” she grinned suggestively and Rio chuckled before Agatha continued, “but I would really like hug you, if you’d like that too?”</p><p>Rio bit her lower lip and nodded. <em>That actually sounded like heaven.</em></p><p>Warm, slender arms wrapped around her shoulders, and she felt how Agatha was carefully burying her face into the crook of her neck, scraping her nose on the skin she found there. She reached for Agatha’s middle and slowly dragged her right hand upwards, coming to rest on her shoulder blade while the other held on the Agatha’s tiny waist. Rio’s nose was pressed into Agatha’s hair, and she smelled her shampoo, lavender and sandalwood. The scent tore her back to that very first day she had met her, when she had leaned over her sitting at the piano. It made Rio pull her in closer, tighter.</p><p>
<em>Say that you’re mine, say that you’re mine alone, say that you only belong to me.</em>
</p><p>She heard Agatha’s breathy voice somewhere far away, remembering every word from when they had last slept together. She let her hand stroke Agatha’s hair and felt how Agatha’s fingers were caressing her spine, sending soft tingles down the sides of her body. She felt how her heartbeat slowed down, how every part of her nervous system was powering down until only her base instincts remained. Those that she knew were tied to Agatha’s fingers with thin, invisible strings. It was clear as day then, that if Agatha wanted to change her mind and come upstairs, Rio wouldn’t even have considered<em> no </em>as a possible answer.</p><p>“Can I call you tomorrow?”, she heard her ask quietly then, carefully leaning back again, her face inches from Rio’s and Rio nodded. The ability to speak had not yet come back to her. She could see how Agatha’s eyes were darting to her lips and back up again several times, but in the end, she took a step back, her fingers slowly gliding over Rio’s body as she was creating a distance between them.</p><p>“Sleep well then,” she muttered and squeezed Rio’s side one more time before she turned around and walked off into the direction of the next T station.</p><p>Rio watched her until she turned around the next corner. Only then did she snap out of it and squeezed her own face with both of her hands. The way this woman turned her brain into mush was downright criminal.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>When Rio woke up just after nine the next day, Agatha had already texted her. In the bright morning light, she had to crawl under the blanket to read the message that had come through not even twenty minutes earlier.</p><p><strong>AH: Good morning</strong>🌞<strong>, I hope you slept well</strong> 😍<strong> I didn’t want to call and wake you up!</strong></p><p>Rio immediately replied.</p><p align="right">
<strong>I just woke up, hope you had a good start of your day?</strong>
</p><p>She had to smile when it took Agatha less than fifteen seconds to text back.</p><p><strong>AH: It would have been a better start if you had been next to me</strong> 💜</p><p>Granted, Rio had thought the same thing, after all, she had still not had the chance to wake up next to Agatha. She’d wondered about that last night, what it would be like. Whether Agatha snored and whether she was one of those people that claimed the entire duvet for themselves. Whether she slept naked or in PJs. Whether she would cuddle up to her throughout the night. Whether it would feel like heaven waking up with Agatha’s hair in her face.</p><p>Her phone dinged.</p><p>
<strong>AH: Too much?</strong>
</p><p>Urgh fuck, she’d taken too long.</p><p align="right">
<strong>No! Not at all! I was just making coffee!</strong>
</p><p>She lied and finally turned the brightness up on her phone. Looking at the messages again, she wondered if asking her out for frozen yogurt was too soon. Wasn’t she meant to be angry still? Wasn’t she meant to be more withholding while that rock still sat on her finger? Looking at her phone she blinked twice. Had Agatha worn the engagement ring the previous day?</p><p>Her phone chimed again.</p><p><strong>AH: Are you doing anything today?</strong> 😊 <strong>It’s so nice outside!</strong></p><p>That was a back-handed invitation to do something together wasn’t it? A traitorous smile crept onto her lips.</p><p align="right">
<strong>I was thinking about getting frozen yogurt</strong>
</p><p>she typed and after a second she added</p><p align="right">
<strong>… would you like to come?</strong>
</p><p>And of course Agatha couldn’t simply say “yes I’d like that” or “no, I’m actually busy” – she had to reply in code again.</p><p><strong>AH: </strong>🥺🍨🍦🍓🥰</p><p>Although Rio assumed it was more in the direction of “yes I’d like that” because a moment later Agatha’s caller ID showed up as her phone gently vibrated.</p><p>“Hi,” she chimed sweetly and Rio bit her lip when she heard it.</p><p> </p><p>They met up at the Common an hour later and devoured three servings between them, sharing and going back for more until Rio felt sick and almost light-headed from the sugar rush. At least that was what she told herself. The way Agatha’s jeans rode down just enough so Rio could see the purple lace beneath when Agatha was sitting and leaning forward, could have been an alternative explanation. Or the fact that there were no rings on her fingers, when she was licking ice cream off of them.</p><p>She ended up taking Agatha to the harbor and then all the way over to Fan Pier Park and before she knew it, the later afternoon sun flooded the horizon with yellow light as the sea gulls sang around them. Agatha bought her fish ‘n chips at a small food truck and they shared it until it got so cold she started to shiver.</p><p>They spent the week like that.</p><p>Every morning Rio would wake up to a short, sweet text from Agatha, and every day she would cave and meet her. She took her along to her lecture on Wednesday and met her for breakfast at her hotel on Thursday.</p><p>There were chaste touches, sometimes she would find her hand on the small of Agatha’s back when they were walking through a door. There were sweet goodbye hugs every time they parted. And then there was the brief moment after they left the lecture together when Agatha had weaved their fingers together to lift up her arm and point an ink stain on her sleeve out to Rio.</p><p>And at the end of every day, she patiently watched Agatha walk away alone while she wondered whether there would ever be a day when she would be spared the sight.</p><p>The way all of it consumed her every waking minute would have fooled anyone else into believing they had never kissed before, let alone slept together. But then, she was probably just falling in love all over again. At least that was what she surmised late Thursday night, one hand between her legs, all of the lights already out, her fingers sticky with herself, when thinking of Agatha in those jeans was the only thing that would make her sensitive enough to come.</p><p>It was already long past midnight when she found herself hovering over their chat window. She’d go back to work tomorrow, there would be no space to spontaneously get together. But there thought of not seeing Agatha for only just a day when she had just gotten her back felt blatantly wrong.</p><p align="right">
<strong>I was thinking I could show you around Symphony Hall tomorrow? I can get you tickets and you could keep me company when I get my hair and make-up done?</strong>
</p><p>She sent it before she could contemplate it too much. Agatha wouldn’t see it until tomorrow morning anyway. She could always call it back, she thought, rinsing her hands in the bathroom sink. However, when she closed the bathroom door, she saw that her phone had switched on again, alerting her of a message that had come in.</p><p><strong>AH: Oh I would love that!</strong> 💜💜💜 <strong>When and where do I meet you?</strong></p><p>Rio bit her lower lip and sent her the time and place. If she flapped her legs while lying on her stomach, nobody would ever know.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already waiting for her when she walked over to Symphony Hall just before three. She was on her phone when Rio spotted her and waved. She immediately felt that something was off. Where Agatha’s features had been relaxed and easy this past week, they now were rigid and grey. She tried to hide it when she ended the call and walked over to where Rio was waiting, but at first, her smile did not actually manage to reach her eyes.</p><p>“Everything okay?”, Rio asked timidly.</p><p>“Oh, no don’t worry, it’s all fine!”, she tilted her head to the side and reached for Rio’s ponytail, “this looks so cute on you!”</p><p>Rio let her toy with it for moment, eying her curiously while Agatha’s glance was on her hair. She felt that urge again to crack her head open and look for anything that was giving her grief to spoon it out.</p><p>“So do I get the VIP treatment tonight then?”, Agatha chuckled as she let go of Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Y-yeah sure,” she replied, her thoughts still far away for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio led her inside through the stage door and over into Mackie’s little office. She got a few suggestive glances, but the theater assistant quickly printed a VIP pass for Agatha which dangled from her neck when Rio walked her up onto the stage.</p><p>Standing at the center of it, bathed in the soft glow of the overhead lights that seemed to dance across her skin like warm threads of moonlight, her eyes moved slowly, tracing the gilded details of the hall’s balconies. Rio saw her draw a deep breath, saw her chest rise and fall with it. There was something luminous about her, as though she was about to dissolve into the light that was making her edges shimmer. For a moment, Rio pretended that this was the one-hundredth time she had taken her on a stage. That this was their usual, pre-concert ritual. Just a pianist and her muse.</p><p>“Woah this is so much bigger than it looks from the seats!”, Agatha exclaimed, her heels clacking on the hardwood flooring when she walked to the very front of the stage, “how do you not get the heebie-jeebies when you have to play to them?”</p><p>Rio let out a hollow laugh and scratched the side of her neck, “oh believe me I do,” she confessed.</p><p>“Even after all this time?”, Agatha turned back to her.</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Rio chuckled and held onto her elbows. There was something sweet and intimate about having Agatha here, all the way in a space that normally only she inhabited. It felt less lonely like this, the young woman strolling around, touching the curtains and looking at the lights – just the two of them in this massive, empty space that would be filled with noise in just a few hours.</p><p>“Uhm, do you wanna try the <em>Steinway</em> maybe?” she asked, suddenly filled with pride that for once she was the one offering a unique experience. Agatha’s eyes blew open wide when Rio lifted the fall board and offered her a seat.</p><p>“You’ll let me play it?”, she pointed at herself.</p><p>“Yeah sure,” Rio laughed and sat down on the bench, “c’mon sit, it’s wide enough for both of us!”</p><p>It took Agatha a moment to come over and take a seat next to her. Sheepishly, she let her fingers glide over the ivory-white keys, pushing them down ever so slightly, that none of them were making a sound.</p><p>“I thought your piano was amazing,” she mumbled and shifted closer so that their thighs were aligned and touching.</p><p>“It’s good, but this is a proper concert grand, mine doesn’t even come close to this,” Rio smiled, goosebumps on her arms from the sudden proximity.</p><p>“I don’t know what to play,” Agatha scrunched her knows and crossed her arms, hiding her hands under them.</p><p>Bobbing her head, Rio put her hands on the keys instead and began to hammer down on them. She had had ample time to come up with new transcriptions, some of them a little faster, harder, meant to make her breathless <em>(because it was harder to miss Agatha when her body was preoccupied with making sure she wasn’t suffocating).</em> Agatha marveled at the speed with which she dragged her fingers over the keys, with how she stomped on the pedals. As soon as she recognized the song, she hummed with it, moving her shoulders as if she was dancing in her seat. Only at the very end did Rio join her, humming the very last lines along with her.</p><p>
<em>I've been dreaming 'bout the West Coast, I need the sun for just a year, I'll kiss the sky and disappear.</em>
</p><p>“That was <em>so</em> good!”, Agatha applauded when she had played the last notes, “now me!”</p><p>She shooed Rio’s fingers off the piano and straightened her back. It made Rio marvel at the sudden confidence.</p><p>The notes she played were slow and chaste. It was an easier rendition, there wasn’t a whole lot of complexity to it, the chords she struck with her left hand remained similar. But Agatha's face reflected a tender intensity, as if she wasn’t just playing the song but poured all of her soul into each and every note. Rio loved seeing her like this, wrapped up in her art, she looked so much more confident than the last time she had seen her play at her mother’s birthday party.</p><p>Suddenly the air felt thick with emotion. She knew that song, and she knew it’s lyrics.</p><p>
<em>'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get, the things I want the most.</em>
</p><p>Her heart hurt. Watching her like this, it seemed as if the world had tilted slightly. She didn’t often get a glimpse into Agatha’s mind, but it seemed that whenever she did, it was always devastatingly profound.</p><p>She wanted to kiss Agatha so bad when she came to a close, putting her own little spin on the harmony, playing it an octave higher than would have been appropriate. She was so proud of her, and Rio was sure she would have fallen to her knees right there and then had she not been alerted by the stage door opening behind them, the piano technician waiting to speak to her.</p><p>Maybe it was for the better, she was at a complete loss for words anyway.</p><p>If the papers wrote that on her third Friday, she played with a <em>deeper sense of belonging</em> and <em>gripping tenderness</em>, she alone knew where it had come from.</p><p>
<em>Who had caused it.</em>
</p><p>She loved that Agatha snuck into her dressing room during the intermission, yapping to her about the local politicians she was sitting next to and their controversially young companions (male and female), pouring her a glass of sparkling water before Mackie had the chance to. She loved how Agatha stayed until the very end of the break and brushed through Rio's hair one more time before she had to go back to her seat. But what she loved most was that she could tell her cheers apart from everyone else’s during the applause. And this time she could see her too, clapping her hands over her head while the woman next to her in the VIP seating rolled her eyes.</p><p>Rio played no encore that night.</p><p>She wasn’t going to spend anymore time on something that was keeping her away from Agatha. Not even on a five-minute encore.</p><p>Agatha swooned the entire way back to her apartment, gesturing wildly about each and every symphony she had liked best. She raved about the acoustic, about the artistic choices Rio had knowingly and unknowingly made until she got so flustered it seemed she was going to start sweating in the cold autumn air. One wouldn’t have thought she had already heard the same concert three times not even a week ago.</p><p>“Urgh why are you so good at this?”, she sighed and gripped onto Rio’s arm, making her shiver underneath her coat. They were already in front of her building. And while Agatha was babbling on, Rio knew that this had meant good-bye on every day they had spent together during the past week. And she could see that Agatha was already absentmindedly searching for her phone in her bag.</p><p>She was going to call an Uber and then she was going to go back to her hotel room. And Rio would spend yet another morning waking up without Agatha next to her.</p><p>So she did the only thing she thought might save her from that fate. She pulled Agatha in by her arm and shut her up. She couldn’t watch her walk off yet another time. Her heart wouldn’t take it. Not after she had found hope in the fact that there had been no rings on Agatha’s hands when she had played for her. And wasn’t <em>hope </em>enough for now? Couldn’t<em> hope </em>buy her at least a little bit of leeway in this matter?</p><p>Immediately, she felt Agatha press close to her, felt her hands on the back of her neck, nails burying themselves into the loose strands of hair she found there. How long had it been since she had kissed her? <em>Had she ever really kissed her like this?</em> With all of this fierce, soul-crushing <em>want</em> between them?</p><p>“Please don’t go,” she mumbled, her nose still pressed to Agatha’s, eyes still closed in case none of this was real, “please don’t leave.”</p><p>And Agatha nodded.</p><p>Upstairs, she felt how Agatha was eager to undress her, to tear every bit of clothing from her body when they had barely even crossed the doorstep. But Rio didn’t let her. She pushed her onto the bed instead and knelt at its foot. Propping herself up on her arms, Agatha watched as Rio tugged four fingers under each side of her skirt’s waistband and pulled until it came off, leaving her in just her back tights. She caught her gaze and didn’t let it go as she gently freed her from those as well, white skin shiny in the moonlight coming in through the big windows that made up almost the entire eastern wall.</p><p>She smelled her, as soon as she crawled closer. Musky and familiar and wonderful. In her chest, her heart beat so fast, Rio thought she was going to faint.</p><p>Agatha’s slip was the last thing that hit the floor, discarded and forgotten in a corner, entirely unimportant. Even in the black-and-white of the night, Rio could see the blush on Agatha’s cheeks just before she hooked her legs over her shoulders and pulled her closer with one strong tug until her lips – for the first time – were on Agatha’s folds, soft and swollen. It almost felt like an instant addiction, exploring every inch with her tongue, listening to Agatha’s gasps, feeling her hand in her hair. She felt her arch her back up from the bed with every lap, pressing herself against Rio’s face.</p><p>And then she began to whisper.</p><p>“Please baby, please I’ve been waiting so long.”</p><p>It was almost toneless, but it made Rio dig her fingers into the full flesh of her thighs, eliciting a long moan. She hoped there would be tiny remnants of it still left over in the morning. Small crescents where her nails had been.</p><p>“You feel so good like this, Rio, please-<em>please</em> I’ve missed this so much,” came another whimper.</p><p>It was making her wild, hearing her like this, almost chanting. Somewhere in a tiny chamber inside her mind a small voice snarled triumphantly.</p><p>
<em>I bet he doesn’t make her beg like this. I bet he doesn’t make her say these things.</em>
</p><p>She shut its door and focused back on Agatha, on the feeling of her hand in her hair, switching gentle pats with harsh tugs and brought tears to Rio’s eyes as she kissed and licked and gently bit her, rolling the tender flesh between her lips as if she was about to die from thirst, and this was the only thing keeping her alive.</p><p>Opening her eyes, she looked ahead and saw that Agatha was staring at her while she panted, open mouthed and glassy-eyed. Even with her eyeliner smudged and her face contorting in response to her ministrations, she was still the prettiest woman Rio knew. <em>Would ever know.</em></p><p>She pushed Rio off then only to tug her onto the bed until she could sit in her lap again.</p><p>“I need you to kiss me while you fuck me,” she breathed, and all Rio could do was nod, utterly and completely enthralled by her. She helped Agatha out of her pullover and bra until her breasts sprung free. She eagerly took each one into her mouth, listening to Agatha’s mewls, until she noticed how she was stroking herself and Rio slapped her hand away, suddenly greedy to feel what she was feeling, greedy to bring her fingers to the place her mouth had just been.</p><p>“Let <em>me</em> take care of you,” she reprimanded her, when Agatha looked at her with uncertainty in her eyes.</p><p>She let Agatha ride them then, first two then three, as she pressed her forehead to Rio’s, her hair cascading around them, wild and wonderful. They were so impossibly close with both of Agatha’s arms wrapped around her shoulders. Every nerve in Rio’s body felt as if it was on fire. She wanted to scream and she wanted to make certain nobody else would ever lay even a finger on what was hers.</p><p>And quite possibly, she had said all of that out loud.</p><p>Rolling herself against Rio’s hand, moving herself up and down Rio’s fingers, Agatha took her head in both of her hands. “Take all of me, chain me to you, I beg you,” Agatha whined into the silence of the room and all Rio could respond with was a kiss, deep and long. She knew she would make it her life’s purpose if Agatha still wanted it in the morning.</p><p>“Never let me go,” was the last thing Agatha said before she came, shuddering around Rio’s fingers, a single tear rolling down her face.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never slept worse in her entire life. And that included her sophomore-year camping trip where she had suffered sixty-nine mosquito bites in one night and her drunk classmates had relieved themselves behind her tent when they had been too lazy to walk to the restrooms late at night.</p><p>According to the clock on her nightstand, she woke up at 2.32 then 3.05 then 3.58 then 4.20 and then on and on all throughout the morning hours. And every time, she had reached across the bed to check if Agatha was still there, still soundly sleeping next to her with her head under the cushions, stretched out like a starfish. Her pulse only began to steady again when her hand found the comforting warmth of Agatha’s body, finally allowing her to drift back into sleep.</p><p>The last time she woke up, it was already past nine and an arm was loosely wrapped around her middle, the comforter only barely draped around her shins. She felt Agatha’s warm breath on the baby-hairs of her neck and opened her eyes. The room was filled with a soft, golden light seeping through the white curtains, hinting at the day’s late start. Her fingers absentmindedly traced the edge of the pillow as she listened to the steady rhythm of Agatha’s breathing. She was here. She hadn’t run off. She had stayed to wake up next to her.</p><p>
<em>It could always be like this. </em>
</p><p><em>Maybe it </em>would<em> actually always be like this.</em></p><p>For a fleeting moment, she wondered if she had done right by both of them, when she had allowed this. Whether waiting would have been wiser, letting Agatha come to her decision unclouded by the comfort of their closeness.</p><p>She turned around then, holding onto Agatha’s hand until their noses were touching. She stirred from the movement, disturbed her in her sleep and squinted with one of her eyes, immediately yawning, but tilting her head in a smile.</p><p>“Hey you,” she whispered with a raspy voice. Her hand found Rio’s butt, squeezing it gently.</p><p>It didn’t stay there long. It quickly found another angle, feeling the night’s wetness between her legs, and Rio’s eyes rolled back when Agatha barely fondled her before pushing two of her fingers in, angling them, stroking her walls from the inside until Rio buried her face in the nape of Agatha’s neck. She bit her there, rolled the thin flesh between her lips almost as if she needed something to hold onto while Agatha continued to pump into her lazily.</p><p>“So good for me, so wet,” Agatha muttered into her ear, her other hand in Rio’s hair, tugging on it with more and more strength until it stung deliciously. God, she loved it. <em>She loved it so fucking much.</em></p><p>Focusing on the feeling of Agatha inside of her, Rio sucked harder, feeling herself drawing impossibly tight at the sound of Agatha’s unsteady breath.</p><p>“I want you so bad, mi amor” she mumbled, using her teeth to reach for Agatha’s earlobe, taking it between them and sucking on it. Agatha let out a breathless gasp and only pumped harder, more fervently.</p><p>“Say that again!”, she whispered, commanding and almost as if there was a sob in her voice, “say it again!”</p><p>“Mi amor,” rolled over Rio’s lips, and it seemed to spur Agatha on. She moved so that they were face to face and kissed her, tongue and teeth, while her hand move fast and quick, her nails hitting Rio’s clit with every thrust, but never in a way that felt <em>enough</em>.</p><p>As if anything concerning Agatha would ever feel <em>enough</em>, would ever truly be <em>enough</em>. Even if she held her like this for the remainder of her life, none of it would make up for the thirty-seven years she had to spend without her. Or for the past weeks she had had to endure without her.</p><p>“I want to hear it again,” Agatha broke the kiss and almost grunted, pressing their foreheads together so intensely it hurt and finally stopping her thrusts and instead using four fingers to rub small circles over the little knot where she must have noticed most of Rio’s nerve endings sat. And Rio would have love to comply, would have loved to give her want she wanted. But Agatha was too good at what she was doing. So instead she whined, her hands cramping, full of the soft skin on Agatha’s hips as she came.</p><p>When her breathing had finally slowed and she had settled back into the mattress, Agatha climbed on top of her, snuggling into her arms like a kitten waiting to be petted. Her hands came up to Rio’s sides, as she laid on her chest, kissing the round of Rio’s left breast.</p><p>“I’ve never been that to anybody,” she silently confessed, and Rio’s heart skipped a full beat.</p><p>How foolish of every other person that had ever had the pleasure of holding Agatha Harkness in their arms. How foolish of them for not treating her like she deserved. How foolish of them to let her go.</p><p>
<em>How foolish of them not to love her well enough.</em>
</p><p>“I would take care of you, you know? I could support the both of us, if I needed to,” Rio carefully let her fingers glide over the smooth skin on Agatha’s shoulders. She didn’t reply anything for a while. Rio listened to the lazy drops of rain on the window instead.</p><p>“I always thought ‘I am independent’. ‘I have my own money’ and I can do with it what I want. And then I realized I’m a donkey, just following a carrot tied to a stick and dangling in front of my nose,” Agatha mused, drawing small circles on Rio’s chest.</p><p>“I told you; you could study. Or you could do something you don’t need a degree for, but I think that would be a waste of your talent.”</p><p>“My talent?”</p><p>She nudged her gently, “the music.”</p><p>“Oh I thought you meant this,” she bit her lip and moved her knee against Rio’s clit once more.</p><p>“Fucking-”, Rio moaned and pressed her eyes shut, “stop distracting!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and cuddled up with her again.</p><p>“I meant it. All of it,” was the last thing Rio said on the matter.</p><p>And it would be for the next few days.</p><p>She got them pastries for lunch, and they ate them between the sheets, butt-naked again, until there were crumbs of leafy filo-dough everywhere, even all over Agatha’s thighs. Rio used her tongue to clean them off of her and Agatha giggled, raspberry jam still smeared on the corner of her mouth. She stopped giggling when Rio moved her lips further up, kissing the small stubbles of pubic hair before stroking Agatha’s folds delicately with the tip of her tongue, teasing her until Agatha wrapped her hand around Rio’s hair once more, pushing her face against herself until Rio was gasping for air and thinking about dying exactly like this.</p><p>She had to wash her face afterwards (<em>reluctantly</em>) and decided it was time for the both of them to get out of bed (<em>even more reluctantly</em>).</p><p>Agatha joined her for her Saturday concert and snuck into the after party, where she quietly blended in, enjoying drinks at the bar while Rio was entertaining her guests. Whenever Rio’s glance found her, she smiled widely and waved. She wanted to sit with her so badly, make up for lost time. They were barely sixty feet apart, but it felt like it was too far.</p><p>
<em>How pathetic was she, that now that all the pieces were finally falling into place, it felt unnatural not to have her skin against Agatha’s?</em>
</p><p>“Wonderful rendition of <em>Slipping Through My Fingers</em>, by the way, I was told you like to play something modern at your encore, but I wasn’t expecting ABBA,” and elderly gentleman pulled her back from her thoughts.</p><p>“Oh yes, I like to leave the audience with something unexpected, if I can,” Rio nodded and took a sip from her champagne, her eyes drifting past him again, to where Agatha was now on her phone, typing, and frowning.</p><p>“Do you already know what you will play tomorrow? I promise we won’t tell,” his wife added, distracting her once more.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “I was thinking something more contemporary, maybe some One Republic, maybe some Chappell Roan,” Rio nodded, trying to keep herself from focusing on Agatha again.</p><p>“Oh that is very modern then!”, the man laughed, and Rio struggled to give him her full attention.</p><p>She was glad when the night finally ended, and the last of the guests were leaving, wrapping themselves up in their thicker autumn coats before the exited into the night. She had been told it would be fine to leave earlier if the night was dragging on, if some of them wanted to stay and mingle, but they had wrapped her up in conversations all night, it would have been rude to go in the middle of a chat.</p><p>At least Agatha waited for her next to the cloak room with both of their jackets already in hand. She even helped Rio into hers, but that wasn’t the thing that gave her pause - it was the unapologetic way she seized Rio’s hand, binding them together against the night's breath, as soon as they stepped out onto the street. Rio squeezed it gently. She couldn’t remember if she had ever held Agatha’s hand like this.</p><p>They walked on quietly for a while, cars passing them, and a small gust gently picking up. It was quiet for an early Saturday night, but perhaps they were just in the wrong corner of the city. It felt good though, walking like this – <em>oh so good</em>. She listened to the almost musical sound of Agatha’s shoes again, lilac stilettos that made her just as tall as Rio. She almost didn’t dare to ask. She was afraid she knew the answers. She did it anyway.</p><p>“Everything alright with your phone?”</p><p>Agatha waved it off with one of her grand gestures, “oh my god, yes, don’t worry, I’m just getting a lot of spam calls and texts, it’s ridiculous. I might go to Verizon tomorrow to get a new card,” she rolled her eyes and smiled with a smile that Rio wasn’t sure actually reached her eyes.</p><p>“Stop worrying, it’s all good!”, she stopped suddenly and pulled Rio close, “I mean it.”</p><p>Rio nodded and promised herself she would try.</p><p>“Thank you so much for yesterday and today,” Agatha squeezed her hand.</p><p>“What do you mean?”, Rio asked and furrowed her brow.</p><p>“I need to take this,” she pointed with her finger at the T sign above them, “train to get to my hotel.”</p><p>
<em>Of course. Her hotel. The place she was staying. When she had all her things. Where she slept although she clearly belonged in Rio’s bed.</em>
</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her confused. “I have all my things there and I’ve been squatting with you for a day and a half now, don’t you want to be rid of my for a bit?”</p><p>
<em>Abso-fucking-lutely not. </em>
</p><p>She might have been an introvert, but it did generally exclude cute twenty-somethings that fucked her into oblivion and ate Belgian pastries with her between the sheets. Besides, now that she’d woken up to Agatha’s gentle presence beside her, she couldn’t imagine returning to nights without her warmth. The memory of soft breaths and tangled limbs had already carved itself into her. She didn’t long for solitude and quiet anymore. She longed for Agatha.</p><p>“Uhm,” Rio scratched the back of her head where Barb had constructed her hair into a braided topknot, “could we not get them tomorrow?”, she focused on the bright red hydrant to her right, avoiding Agatha’s eyes, “I can give you one of my pajamas, if you want?”</p><p>Agatha suddenly smirked and bit her lower lip, tilting her had teasingly, “Rio Vidal, are you asking me to stay over one more night?”</p><p>Rio gulped and suddenly felt like a six-year-old again, asking her crush to sit next to her in class. <em>Why the fuck was she behaving like this when Agatha had had several fingers inside of her not even fifteen hours ago?</em></p><p>“Well… so technically I guess why pay for the hotel room when there is enough space in my apartment?”</p><p>It was dark, but she could still see the tint of red beneath the freckles on Agatha’s cheeks. All Rio could do was shrug. Because what else was there to say? Hadn’t they been apart long enough?</p><p>“Oh… uhm…I guess we could go and check me out in the morning then?”, was Agatha’s shaky reply.</p><p>And for all that sudden, Agatha-untypical uncertainty, she <em>certainly</em> did seem to find her conviction again when she pressed Rio into the mattress later, face first, with her ass up and fucked her so hard Rio almost forgot her last name. But then, maybe she was making up for something. Maybe she had to overcorrect. <em>Not that Rio wasn’t here for that.</em></p><p>It was already late – probably more early really – and she was sure Agatha was already asleep, when a quiet, tentative voice asked into the silence of the room: “Did you just ask me to move in with you?”</p><p>“I guess,” Rio replied, Agatha squished into her side.</p><p>“Can you hold me for a bit until I fall asleep?”, the quiet voice that didn’t sound like Agatha at all asked again.</p><p>And Rio did.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER NINETEEN</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>All of Agatha’s things fit into a large Rimova suitcase and a black Saint Laurent tote bag. Rio rolled it out of the hotel for her, all the way to the T station and then into her apartment while Agatha happily trailed behind her, snapping pictures of the gloomy fall day.</p><p>There was barely any space in the small closet left, so Agatha pushed the opened suitcase under the bed and threw all of her dirty clothes into the laundry machine while Rio got them iced lattes and croissants. They ate in bed again, and Rio washed the sheets too, as soon as the first load was done. When she came back and saw Agatha lounging in the big wing chair, she wondered (for just a moment) if this was what domesticity felt like.</p><p>“I hope you know we’re a lesbian cliché now, right?” Agatha grinned, sipping on the remainder of her coffee and Rio rolled her eyes at it, taking a seat on the piano.</p><p>She didn’t care. She had wanted this for them, she had craved this so much – she was no longer alone. Neither of them was alone anymore. Her heart fluttered eagerly in her chest every time she saw Agatha smile - be it when she sent her onto the stage later that night or when she woke up to her the next morning. There was nothing compared to the warm traces her fingers left on Rio’s skin, nothing compared to the way her breathing hitched when Rio touched her in just the right place, nothing compared to the rhythm of her voice when she yapped to Rio about a silly video, she had seen on one of her social media apps.</p><p>The ring wasn’t sitting on her finger anymore, but Rio didn’t need it as a reminder that she was still about to marry someone else. She knew that intimately. So intimately, that she buried it somewhere deep inside of her. Somewhere it couldn’t hurt her anymore. Agatha would come around to it. Any day now. Any day now would she come out of the bathroom or home from one of her quick walks and tell Rio it was all over.</p><p>
<em>Any day now.</em>
</p><p>Rio might have wondered about it more, might have spent more time anticipating, if her mind hadn’t been all foggy with the joy of spending every day next to Agatha.</p><p>With that same foggy mind, she rented a car for them to go north after her lecture on Tuesday. It was nothing compared to the red old-timer cabriolet Agatha had taken her on their first day with, but it had a small sunroof, large enough for Agatha to look up through the marvel at the orange leaves that that adorned every treetop between Boston and Kennebunkport at this time of year.</p><p>Agatha was giddy with joy, reading the Wikipedia pages of every sight they passed to her while Rio drove. At some point, Rio leisurely placed her right hand on Agatha’s thigh, and nothing had ever felt quite like it.</p><p>When she parked to get Agatha her first New England lobster roll, she felt like the proudest woman on Earth. The small seaside town was busy with tourists even now, on a random Tuesday in September. While she ordered and reserved them one of the green, wooden picnic tables by the water, Agatha had spotted a small souvenir shop and only came back when Rio had already picked up their food. She held a new phone and sim card pack in her hands.</p><p>“Still issues with the spam calls?” Rio asked, when she nibbled on her lobster, licking the mayo off.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m so over them,” Agatha fussed but set it aside to eat, closing her eyes and moaning at the first bite she took, “Rio this is amazing, what the fuck,” she cursed, eagerly stuffing her mouth with the soft roll, devouring it as if she was starving.</p><p>All the way outside the hustle and bustle of central Boston, here by the beach, Rio listened to the rush of the waves, wondering which note on the musical scale they came closest to as the setting sun shone on her face and Agatha quietly installed her new phone. They got ice-cream afterwards and walked along a row of small shops. At some point, Agatha reached out for her hand and wove them together. They must have looked like any other couple on a casual evening stroll and Rio reveled in the feeling.</p><p>They checked into their small hotel just after the sun had set and Agatha immediately let herself fall onto the wide bed opposite a large window overlooking the sea. The last thought Rio had that night, as sleep was gently nudging her closer to Agatha’s warm and naked body, was that it felt illegal how <em>fucking</em> happy she was.</p><p>The air was cold and fresh the next morning, but the sun blazed down from the sky after it had hidden its face during their quiet breakfast in the huge sun room of the Bed and Breakfast. With the ocean so close and rain predicted for the next day, it was an easy decision to make for the beach with blankets, books, and nibbles packed under their arms. Agatha wore a thick jacket but took off her shoes as soon as she stepped onto the warmed sand. Sunglasses on the tip of her nose, her hair blowing free in the soft breeze, she snuggled into Rio’s side on a large blanket, looking out over the sea, listening to symphony of seagull calls and waves.</p><p>“When do you have your last concert again?”, she asked, completely out of the blue, when Rio had almost begun to assume she had fallen asleep.</p><p>“Uhm, I don’t have the exact date in mind right now, but it’s mid-October.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, but didn’t add anything.</p><p>Rio looked back at her novel and reached for a walnut before Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“I’m not sure where I would go.”</p><p>Rio sensed it was worded in a way that demanded an inquiry, that perhaps Agatha was trying not to be too forward, but hoping Rio would be the braver one of them.</p><p>“Go?”, she encouraged.</p><p>“I don’t think I would be very welcome at home, seeing that I ran off to the East Coast with my piano teacher when I’m supposed to be getting married to my high-school sweetheart.”</p><p>“So they know you’re here with me?”</p><p>“Uhm, no,” Agatha confessed, still not looking up at her. Rio put the novel away and took off her sunglasses.</p><p>
<em>Jesus Christ.</em>
</p><p>“Where do they think you are?”</p><p>“In New York, looking for bridal dresses with a friend.” </p><p>
<em>The fuck.</em>
</p><p>“Agatha, it’s been weeks!”</p><p>“I know!”, she finally looked at her, “I said it’s been tough finding something in my size.”</p><p>“In your size? You’re a thirty-six at most, don’t dresses come in thirty-six anymore? Because of the obesity pandemic?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her and a grin formed on her lips.</p><p>“Something like that,” she mumbled and took Rio’s hand in hers, kissing it with dry lips.</p><p>At first, Rio didn’t know what to reply. She just watched Agatha’s profile, noticed how her eyelashes fluttered like the wings of a butterfly. In the midday sun, the freckles on her cheeks looked pink.</p><p>“I already told you I’d take care of you,” she mumbled.</p><p>“Aww, so would take me in?”, Agatha replied with a sugary voice, “let me be your controversially young housewife?”</p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>“Mi amor, you couldn’t be a housewife if your life depended on it, you don’t even know how to use a laundry machine,” she argued dryly.</p><p>“Hey! I used <em>your</em> laundry machine alright!”, Agatha protested and slapped her arm.</p><p>“You didn’t even switch it on Agatha, I had to do that when I came back,” Rio laughed.</p><p>Agatha joined her and shook her head, breathing out slowly.</p><p>Rio noticed two seagulls that were gliding in the air above them, circling each other, far away in the sky, soaring with the pulse of the wind. No strings attaching them to the ground.</p><p>“I’ll tell them when we’re back,” she hummed, “I’ll call my mother and tell her I’m not getting married.”</p><p>When Rio looked back down to her, Agatha had reached out to her cheek and caressed it with her thumb.</p><p><em>Anyday </em>had come. And it had come on the perfect day, really.</p><p>She kissed her then, noses carefully rubbing against each other, lips even softer than Rio remembered them from the night before. Her brain filled with sunshine. She wondered if this was a good moment, if this was <em>the</em> moment. The moment to speak up and lay herself bare, blow the last card she had left in her hand, so the game was over. No bluffs left to make.</p><p>She was about to when something hard a sharp hit her leg, “ouch,” she broke the kiss and looked down into the sand.</p><p>A neon green frisbee had hit her. It had come from a small group of people, two women, a child, and a teenager, that stood about sixty yards away from them. They seemed to be arguing who was to pick it up and Rio was about to just throw it back to them, when the child began to run towards them. She was no older than five and had curly, brown hair.</p><p>“’m sawry,” she muttered when Rio handed her the frisbee.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Agatha smiled, “you have a nice scarf on!”</p><p>“It’s my mother’s,” she smiled and took the frisbee in both hands, “bye now!”</p><p>She turned around and was gone in the blink of an eye, running back to the others. One of the women raised an arm to them, probably apologetically. and Rio waved it off.</p><p>“What a cutie,” Agatha chuckled and picked up her phone.</p><p>Rio kept the card in her hand. For now at least.</p><p>They stayed on the beach for the remainder of the day, watching it stretch out before them, pale blue skies in tow. Agatha got them fries just after noon and emptied two packages of truffle mayo on top of them, smothering them so that she kept sucking on her fingers every time she ate one. Rio wanted to drag over her hand and clean them up herself.</p><p>Even so, she put her tongue to better use later when they were back in their room, and she slipped into the shower behind Agatha licking droplets of water from her shoulders until she shuddered underneath the touch of her tongue. She shuddered even more when Rio sank to her knees, holding Agatha in place by her butt-cheeks and began to put her tongue in other places, burying it so deep in Agatha’s cunt that she groaned with every stoke, every bite, pressing Rio’s face into herself. She made a mental note of having Agatha sit on her face the next time she could get her on a bed, but for now, she was content to take her over the edge like this.</p><p>“Fuck you’re so good at this baby, I should have let you do this to me sooner,” Agatha babbled on, holding on to the shower wall, one knee over Rio’s shoulder, her back pressed into the glass. She nearly screamed when she came, almost pulling Rio’s hair out by its’ roots. It felt glorious.</p><p>She still had a self-satisfied smirk on her face when she walked Agatha down to dinner and Agatha rolled her eyes at her, nudging her in the side before she sat down at their table in the small restaurant the B&amp;B served breakfast and dinner in.</p><p>It seemed as if they had come down at the busiest moment with most of the tables filled already, some guests already eating while others were still looking at their menus. Something felt strange though. Agatha must have noticed it too, she was looking around the room at the same time as Rio, searching for the source of the discomfort. She must have found out before Rio though, when the waiter came and lit the candle on their table, she asked him about it.</p><p>“No music tonight?”</p><p>
<em>Oh, yes, that was it.</em>
</p><p>“No mam, our sound system doesn’t seem to be working, I’m so sorry, we’re trying to get it fixed as soon as possible,” he apologized.</p><p>Agatha leaned back past him, “is that piano properly tuned?”</p><p>That waiter looked to where she was pointing before turning back to her.</p><p>“Yes mam,” he nodded.</p><p>“Would you mind if I played? Just for a bit?”</p><p>He looked at her with a frown for a second, “I mean I could always ask-”</p><p>She cut him off by rising from her chair and winking at Rio.</p><p>“Get this lady and Bellini please.”</p><p>Rio grinned and shook her head as Agatha strode over to the black piano that stood against a wall next to a large bookshelf. Some of the other occupants turned as well when she opened the fall board and angled her feet at the pedals.</p><p>Rio knew the tune immediately. It had burned itself into the strings of every nerve on her body when she had transcribed it for her. And Agatha played it well, with intent and beautiful pacing, not too loud to disturb the other guest, subliminal to the atmosphere. She intercepted faster scores with slower ones, emphasizing notes with confidence, all while Rio had fantastic views of her naked back. She stretched the song out, played the chorus twice more before she came to a slow, drawn-out end. It earned her a round of applause from the room. When she looked back, Rio raised her glass to her, and Agatha threw her a kiss, before she played another song.</p><p>Later, when they were already under the covers of their warm comforter, Rio looked over to her, as Agatha was reading until she got her full attention.</p><p>“So you practiced.”</p><p>“I did,” Agatha smiled, then closed her book, “I noticed that it wasn’t as difficult as the scores you usually play?”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure how long it would sit in a drawer somewhere until you maybe felt like playing it,” Rio admitted, her head on the pillow while Agatha still sat upright.</p><p>“Yes, I wondered about that… you wrote it so<em> I</em> could play it. You matched it to my capabilities… not yours.”</p><p>“I didn’t want you to get frustrated. I thought I wasn’t gonna be there to tell you that you just needed to practice a little more.”</p><p>“Well now you are,” Agatha leaned over and pressed a kiss to Rio’s forehead.</p><p>She suddenly seemed so much older, so much more mature. As if she had aged years in the span of a few days. Rio hoped it wasn’t just a façade. As sleep dragged on her consciousness, overtaking and subduing her, she wondered if there was something else, Agatha could be hiding behind it. But Rio was too tired to finish her thought. She fell asleep with her hand reached out, draped loosely over Agatha’s thigh. When she awoke the next morning, Agatha was already in the shower.</p><p> </p><p>They left right after a late breakfast. Thick clouds had come in from the ocean, relieving themselves of all their watery weight as soon as Rio had loaded their bags into the car. Agatha’s hair curled even more in the damp air and Rio loved how it looked on her. Undone and wild. Free and daring. She fought the urge to dig her fingers into it.</p><p>The weather in Boston wasn’t any better, so they spent the afternoon indoors after they had returned the car. Agatha made her teach her how to play together on the e-piano and as day turned into evening turned into night, Rio felt like it must have been one of the shortest days of her life. In hindsight, it felt even more unfair how the hours had blended into each other, her arm rubbing against Agatha’s, sitting together on the piano bench, just another happy moment turning into a memory.</p><p> </p><p>She had to leave early the next morning. A local news channel was scheduled to film her giving the host a tour through Symphony Hall and Barbara had wanted her to be there at eight so she could fix her hair and makeup. Agatha held onto her still, complained about her leaving, used her sweetest voice, opened the top buttons on her pajama top to lure Rio back to bed, before finally letting her leave with the promise to join her at the hall around three.</p><p>“Be safe,” she yelled from around the corner when Rio let the door fall shut without another look back.</p><p>Rio smiled the entire walk over. She smiled when Barbara did her hair, and she smiled on camera when she walked the film crew around her temporary place of work. Secretly, she wondered if Agatha was watching it on the Boston Morning Show.</p><p>Mackie ordered lunch for them, pizza and kebab and between that and a longer session with the piano technician regarding one of the pedals on the Steinway that had gotten marginally harder to keep down, Rio barely looked at the clock. It was already half past three when she finally did and frowned.</p><p>Checking her phone, there were neither missed calls nor any texts. So she sent one herself.</p><p align="right">
<strong> (3:36) Mi amor, are you coming over?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>There was no answer. Not immediately and not an hour later, when Barb was touching up her make-up.</p><p align="right">
<strong>(4:39) Agatha are you still coming?</strong>
</p><p align="right">
<strong>(4:47) I’m getting worried, are you alright?</strong>
</p><p>This time, her phone pinged, and she eagerly reached for it, anticipating an answer from Agatha. Instead, another message appeared below her texts.</p><p align="right">
<strong>
<em>Message not delivered.</em>
</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck, of course! </em>
</p><p>Agatha had a new phone with a new number she didn’t know.</p><p>She called for Mackie then, asking her if she could check with the ticketing counter if Agatha had come in through the main doors instead of the back entry Rio usually took her in through. But she hadn’t.</p><p>“You could probably go back home and check if she’s still there,” Mackie looked at her wristwatch and shrugged. Looking down on herself, already dressed up in one of her tighter dresses, Rio rolled her shoulders uncomfortably. Sour bile was coming up her esophagus. There was no way she would make it in time. Not when her hair and make-up would have to be redone.</p><p>“Maybe she just took an afternoon nap and overslept? I’m sure she’s fine,” Mackie suggested.</p><p>No Agatha wasn’t fine. Agatha would have called if she was fine, she would have looked Rio’s number up on her old phone and sent a text with the new one.</p><p>If she was fine, she would be here. If she was fine, she would be draping herself over the armchair in the corner, making inappropriate comments about Rio’s cleavage.</p><p>“Yes, she’s probably just forgotten,” Rio lied.</p><p>Playing had never felt more torturous to her than that night. <br/>Walking on stage, she scanned over the VIP section where she had found Agatha a space to sit each night, but couldn’t spot her. With cold hands, she began and had to catch herself to slow down, to stop playing the entire score at <em>fortissimo</em>, with hard, desperate keystrokes. It felt like she was being stared at, as if there was an evil entity in her audience that had terrible things in mind for her. Her lips went dry halfway through it, so dry that they cracked and tore open. They hurt terribly. She smeared lip balm on them during her break, anxiously waiting at her door for Agatha to appear. She had Mackie check with security if Agatha had ever picked up her ticket.</p><p>She had not.</p><p>Stage fright normally kept Rio from noticing the heat of the floodlights on her stage. That night, she felt like she was going to freeze right on the spot. Her fingers turned stiff, slipped, didn’t strike the chords the way she wanted them to. She began to loath Schumann that night. All of a sudden, his notes felt too tight for her, to narrow to even begin to fit all she felt inside of them. She obediently waited for curtain call, she bowed, she smiled, and hoped they would all read it as a more forceful, more aggressive interpretation of the source material.</p><p>She skipped the encore.</p><p>Downstairs, she tore off her dress and put her hair in a messy bun so fast that she was ready to go before Mackie could even come in to see her off. She stormed out the back door with one of her shoelaces still untied, stumbled, and bent down to fasten them. As she ran, her throat began to burn, and she tasted sharp copper on her tongue.</p><p>What if something had happened? What if she had had an accident on her way to the hall? What if someone had taken her?</p><p>Rio yelled her name as soon as she came through the front door, she didn’t care about the neighbors. The key slipped from her hand twice, hitting the floor with an ugly, off-tune sound before she finally, finally opened the door to the studio.</p><p>Stale air hit her, still smelling of coffee and the clothes they hadn’t washed after their trip. Inside the apartment, it was quiet. An ambulance drove by her window, howling through the night.</p><p>“Mi amor?”, she whispered, her Spanish accent more audible than usual.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>“Mi amor, are you home?”, her voice trembled. Still no answer.</p><p>She stepped in and walked around the corner to look at the bed. It was still unmade. Agatha’s new phone sat on the sheets, by the foot of the bed. There was no other trace of her. Rio got on her knees and reached under the bed, moving her hand forward, tapping on the floor.</p><p>There was no suitcase.</p><p>She stormed into the bathroom where Agatha’s beauty products had taken over ninety percent of the narrow shelf under the mirror. The only thing left on it now was Rio’s toothpaste and sunscreen. She stumbled back at the sight, searing tears boiling in her eyes.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>She was no longer there.</p><p>She had left.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER TWENTY</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>There was a fly somewhere in the apartment.</p><p>She heard it buzzing now and then when it flew from one place to another. It never landed long enough for her to see it, just an invisible nuisance filling the silence. When it finally found the window, it bumped against it several times, not understanding the solidity of the glass. Rio watched it with empty eyes until it let itself sink down to the windowsill, no longer willing to hit its head against something that had promised freedom.</p><p>She turned around to face the wall. It was just after seven. Too early for her to get up, too late to attempt to go back to her dreamless sleep. Her mouth was dry, and her pillow was wet. She reached for a bottle of stale water that had rolled under her nightstand and emptied it into her mouth. Her chest physically hurt. Probably muscle ache from all the crying.</p><p>During the night, Rio had heard the door move with the draft from downstairs on several occasions, giving the illusion that someone was about to open it. The first few times she had jumped up and scrambled to the edge of her bed from where she could see the apartment door. It hadn’t opened. No one had ever entered. She had just heard steps in the hallway, someone walking to open another door. Someone else coming home. But not Agatha. Not her Agatha.</p><p>She ignored it now.</p><p>There had been no texts, no calls, no signs of life. She had wondered about going to the police. But then who abducted someone and allowed them to take all their belongings except a burner phone?  She could lie to herself, she could keep telling herself that Agatha’s hadn’t gone willingly… but then she had, hadn’t she? Rio hadn’t given her a spare key yet, the only person that could have packed her things up would have been Agatha herself before she had closed the door behind her and walked out.</p><p>Had she lied when she had said she wanted to tell her family she was breaking off the engagement? Probably. Most likely now.</p><p>Rio felt how despair was slowly merging into anger.</p><p>After all of this? After all these days together? After all they had spoken about? It all felt like empty words and promises now, cursed sweetness and false tenderness. Rio sobbed into the cushion again, but no tears came. What had come over her to let Agatha back into her life, why had she even agreed to do any of this?</p><p>
<em>She thought of that smile, that sweet, sweet smile and those blue eyes and wild hair and self-assured voice.</em>
</p><p>If felt so much worse now. She had barely gotten over it – over Agatha – the first time, but at least then she had been able to tell herself she couldn’t have known, she had given it all a chance and had been right to do so. Now she had fallen for the same ploy twice, even when she had known better. What a fool she was. How <em>laughable</em>.</p><p>That was why there we no messages, that was why there were no calls. Agatha had not seen a need for them. After all, hadn’t that been the agreement? Had she not simply done what Rio had asked of her?</p><p>
<em>‘And if you feel like you’re no longer here to see if you and I can be anything else beyond… casual, I need you to leave too. And when you do it’s over, and I don’t ever want to hear from you again.’</em>
</p><p>She’d gotten cold feet. Simple as that. And then she had done what Rio had told her to do and not reached out.</p><p>She screamed into her pillow until her throat hurt, felt like ripping it apart.</p><p>She should have sent her home without another class scheduled that very first time Agatha had walked through her door. Or at least after they had first slept together, after that first time Agatha had swum naked in her pool. All of this was premeditated. This was her own fault, her own doing. She had let herself be wrapped around Agatha’s little finger willingly, gratefully. And this was where it had gotten her.</p><p>She stayed in bed for the remainder of the morning. At some point she let the fly out, only to immediately hide underneath the sheets again. She slipped in and out of sleep, reassuring herself every time she woke, that she still had time until she had to go to work. She texted Mackie and Barb that she would come in later today and pushed the thought of the after party far away from her.</p><p>Mackie knew as soon as she saw her and gave her a big, long hug, caressing her back and telling her the world would be okay. But Rio knew it wouldn’t. Not for a while.</p><p>Playing was comforting, but she knew her feelings were audible, turned into sound, carrying all the way through the room. They would ask her about it later, and she would say that it was the anniversary of her mother’s death. There was a lot of sympathy, and in a way, even though it was for something completely different, it felt good. After all, heartbreak was only once removed from grief.</p><p>Apathy followed sadness and anger. When she wasn’t working, she would stare at the wallpaper, her mind blank and lonely. Some days, she barely left the apartment. Fred, the pizza delivery guy, became her only human contact as the city moved from Indian summer to full blown autumn, with rainstorms, a freak day of early snow that had all melted the next morning, and yellow leaves on every tree. And every morning she would wake up and her treacherous heart would make her check her phone for a message, a sign of life, anything. She disabled the spam-filter, hoping if an unknown number called, and it was Agatha on a new phone, it would come through. But there was nothing.</p><p>“You cannot live like this, milichka,” Milena sighed when she came to visit in early October, after Rio had finally had the guts to call her, “I know you are heartbroken, but this is no life!”, she reprimanded, lifting the blinds and letting proper sunlight in.</p><p>She cleaned for an entire day and sent Rio grocery shopping, so she had to leave the house. But what helped most was that she also came to Symphony Hall and played with her, giving her something new to focus on for a bit.</p><p>“I know you liked her very much, but that girl was trouble right from start,” she said one evening, when the were perched into the corner booth of a local bar.</p><p>“I just don’t understand how she just vanished like that, no message, nothing,” Rio sulked and sipped on her beer.</p><p>“She is just a girl, Rio, at that age they will change mind every day, this was easy way out for her,” Milena shrugged.</p><p>“So you don’t think I should go to the police about it?” Rio ventured. She had been mulling it over more seriously lately, but she couldn’t decide if it was genuine concern or just a desperate part of her refusing to accept the harsh reality of being abandoned.</p><p>“What? No!”, Milena exclaimed and slapped her cheek lightly, “Rio you have to accept that she left because she didn’t want to be here anymore. She wasn’t abducted off the street, she took everything she owned because she was going home!”</p><p>When Rio barely moved, she added, “leave it now, you can’t continue running and running and running after this spoiled little brat!”</p><p>“She isn’t a brat.”</p><p>Milena sighed. There was a lot of pity in her glance.</p><p>“Milichka, she is not coming back,” she said in a low voice and squeezed Rio’s hand across the table.</p><p>And she didn’t.</p><p>Rio’s last days in Boston breezed by like the gusts of wind that were howling through the streets every night now. Her closing night was sold out and she got so many flowers she sent Barb and Mackie home with three bouquets each. She checked all of them for cards. Each one. None of them came from Agatha.</p><p>After her last lecture at Boston University, Lilia, the chair of the department of music, took her out for lunch and offered her a permanent position. In any other life, she would have at least considered it, but now Boston felt tainted with happier memories of Agatha and her. There was no way she could come back here any time soon.</p><p>It didn’t even take her half a day to pack up all of her things. She had gotten rid of a lot of it, clothes she hadn’t worn, half-empty toiletries, a pair of sandals that had broken. The one thing she couldn’t find was her Oregon Coast sleep shirt. But then it would have been the first thing she would have finally donated to Goodwill anyway.</p><p>The Boston Globe printed one last story about her on the Monday morning after her last performance.</p><p>
<em>Schumann’s angel Rio Vidal gives sentimental last performance at Symphony Hall</em>
</p><p>Sappy, but the review was good at least. Rio read it on the taxi ride to the airport and left the newspaper in the cab. There was a grainy picture of her underneath it, sitting at the Steinway, eyes closed, probably holding back tears.</p><p>She touched down in Los Angeles just before midnight. The city underneath her was brimming with lights as the plane started to descend. She wondered if one of the lights came from Agatha’s bedroom window. There was no way she would ever know.</p><p>The air at her home was stale and dry when she unlocked the door just after one in the morning. Her piano sat in the middle of the room, still and quiet, only illuminated by the moonlight coming in through the windows.</p><p>The first thing she checked was her office. Somewhere deep inside herself, she had hoped her furry guest would still be there and put his little paws on the bars of his enclosure to greet her. But where his cage had sat for weeks and weeks there was now a gaping void on the office console. No smell of straw, no smell of bunny.</p><p>Billy told her the cage had been gone from one day to the other. The only thing he had found in the kitchen was a cleaning bucket that was still wet. From his recollection, it couldn’t have been more than three days after she had kissed Agatha goodbye.</p><p>For a few days, she watched for traces of her, those subtle signs she’d picked up the first time, when Agatha had slipped in and out of the house, thinking Rio wouldn’t notice. But one week after she had returned home, she found the spare key in her basement; in exactly the same spot she had taken it from to give it to Agatha. It was, as if she had never even been there.</p><p>She settled back into her life with a hollow chest and little vigor for conversation. She barely even talked to Milena. She used part of the money she had made in Boston for an unscheduled mortgage repayment and then some more to book a flight to Puerto Rico over Christmas to visit her mother’s grave and maybe some extended family.</p><p>Life went on. Somehow. It felt less vibrant, but at least she didn’t hide between her sheets anymore for days on end. Just like the first time, the heartbreak came and left in waves, sudden, and always unannounced. And then the end of October came, with Halloween knocking on her door. The mornings were crisp and colder now, even for LA.</p><p>It was on one of those mornings that she heard her phone buzz on the nightstand next to her, and reached for it, still drowsy with sleep. It was an update message from Instagram, telling her the newest version needed to be installed. She hadn’t even remembered that it was still installed on her phone. She hadn’t used it in months. Rio tabbed on the message and the app opened. Growling, she immediately wanted to close it again to uninstall it, when she noticed a colorful, circular picture on the top of the news feed. She recognized it immediately: It was McKayla’s, one of Agatha’s friends.</p><p>
<em>Fucking hell, she had thought she’s unfollowed all of them.</em>
</p><p>Rio huffed and tapped on the image, hoping it would take her to her profile page so she could unfollow McKayla, but instead a video began to play. She immediately wanted to close it, but then something caught her attention.</p><p>
<em>“Look at the blushing bride playing for her fiancée…”</em>
</p><p>The person holding the camera seemed to get up from her seat at a table, the video was shaking. There were numerous people in the room with her, all dressed up in pastel gowns, all of them sitting at round tables, looking to the center of the room where someone sat at the piano.</p><p><em>“Be quiet, she’s gonna start!” </em>someone Rio couldn’t see murmured<em>, “McKayla sit your ass down now!”</em></p><p>
<em>“Shhh I’m gonna record it!”</em>
</p><p>McKayla, apparently filming, moved even closer and then zoomed in. At the piano sat Agatha, hair shorter, maybe a little longer than her shoulders now. Rio could only see the upper part of her body, but she was wearing a white dress. Ralph stood next to the piano, looking down at her, smiling.</p><p>And Agatha played.</p><p>It was soft and frail, and slow. She didn’t look up; she had her eyes closed.</p><p>Rio recognized the sound immediately. At first her heart stopped, and then her blood began to boil. Rage crept into her fingertips. She felt the urge to rip something apart.</p><p>
<em>How dare she.</em>
</p><p>The video ended and a new one started. There was no sound this time. Just a few girls sitting around another table, all of them in more comfortable clothing. Among them sat Agatha, looking at her phone, then into the camera, tiredly waiving. It seemed like they were having breakfast.</p><p>It had been posted less than ten minutes ago.</p><p>And there was a location tagged: The Four Seasons Beverly Hills.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Where Rio had her concert hall, Agatha had Rio’s apartment shower. The room steam filled, the tiled walls vibrating with her off-key but enthusiastic renditions of <em>pocketful of sunshine</em>, Agatha truly felt as if she owned the world, all of it at her feet. She scrubbed her arms and legs with Rio’s shower puff, humming and thinking about what to wear later when she would walk over to Symphony Hall. She had a nice black dress Rio hadn’t seen yet, one that was all flappy around her hips, but tight along her tits. Imaging Rio’s face was nothing short of delicious, she loved giving her pause, making her ever-spinning mind go still for a moment.</p><p>She reached out of the shower to check her old phone. Her text to her mother was still unanswered.</p><p align="right">
<strong>Need to talk to you, I will call you at 9.00 sharp your time.</strong>
</p><p>She had about fifteen minutes left for that and dismissed the 20% battery warning before turning the volume further up.</p><p>She had thought she would be more nervous. More anxious to finally pull the trigger without any options to stuff the bullet back into the gun again. But now it almost felt like a business transaction she just wanted to be done with, so it was no longer in the way. She was almost looking forward to it.</p><p>
<em>Mother, I am a fucking lesbian, I won’t marry Ralph Bohner, if you want to cut me off from the money, I shall accept that, kindly fucking never contact me again then. Have a nice life.</em>
</p><p>There would be no more sleepless nights, no more fights over who she was spending time with and how, no more raised eyebrows and no more dismissive glances. But most importantly, there would be no more Ralph. No more Ralph making her pray before eating, no more Ralph wanting to cozy up with her, no more Ralph smelling like a wet mountain lion that was weaseling itself into her bed. She shuddered at the thought. No more of any of that. More of Rio, more of her tender hands and her soft lips and marvelous mind instead.</p><p>She needed to hide her strap underneath the pillow, so she had easy access to it later. There was no way she wouldn’t celebrate this day six inches deep inside of Rio. The mere thought of it made her wet like an ink pad.</p><p>Getting out of the shower, Agatha shut off the music and wrapped herself in Rio’s plush, green bathrobe, different from the silky dressing gowns she had stolen from her in LA. She got herself a glass of water in case her mother felt the need to make this a longer discussion than it had to be and let herself fall into one of the lounge chairs opposite the bed. <em>Their bed.</em> Agatha smirked at the thought. If it was up to her, every bed she would sleep in from here on out would be<em> their bed</em>. Never hers alone anymore.</p><p>Sitting right there, she was quite proud of herself. She had stored a few of her more expensive belongings in a safety-deposit box at a bank in Nevada and about fifteen thousand dollars were still sitting in her Loewe. She could probably pawn her engagement ring too, but then the thought of dropping it into Ralph’s post box sounded even more delightful. The only credit card she was using was in her name, tied to her own bank account, and she had even taken her passport with her to Boston. If she didn’t want to, she’d never have to set foot into her mother’s house ever again. So when it finally turned twelve, she dialed her mother’s number and waited for her to pick up. It rang once, twice, and then continued to ring, but nobody picked up. Strange for a woman that had tried to get a hold of her ever since her second day here, when she had still answered and come up with lies about how disappointed she was with New York bridal boutiques.</p><p>Well, if the old hag didn’t want to talk, she sure wasn’t going to sit around and wait, she could pack all she needed to say into a text message.</p><p>
<em>Dear mother,<br/>
fucking fuck you for wanting me to be a fucking straight twat-</em>
</p><p>Okay maybe that was a bit much. She cussed and deleted all of it.</p><p>
<em>Dear mother,<br/>
I am not getting-</em>
</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Agatha looked up and over at it.</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>Maybe if she stayed perfectly still, they would go away? She didn’t move until there was a third knock.</p><p>“Amazon delivery for Vidal! Anybody home? I need to get going!”</p><p>
<em>Weird voice.</em>
</p><p>Agatha sighed and got up, her phone vibrated, she only had about 10% of her battery left, <em>fuck</em>, she needed to charge it. Still looking at her phone she opened the door. In hindsight, asking them to drop it on the door mat would have probably been a better option. In hindsight, not opening the door would have been smarter.</p><p>Because of course there was no Amazon delivery. Rio didn’t even use Amazon, Rio hated stuffing more and more money into billionaires’ asses, she didn’t even order clothes home.</p><p>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t out little Miss runaway bride.”</p><p>Agatha froze where she stood. There, on the other side of the door, towering over her with dark eyes and flashy why teeth, stood the very person she had been trying to call. Agatha’s eyes went wide.</p><p>In an instant, she tried to close the door again, leaned against it with all of her weight, but her mother had already squeezed through.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”, she blabbered in shock. There was no tone in her voice.</p><p>“Thought you wanted to talk?”, her mother chuckled and closed the door behind herself.</p><p>Agatha stumbled back into the apartment, desperate to bring distance between them.</p><p>“How did you find-”</p><p>“Agatha, it’s the twenty-first century, your phone is still on our plan and just because the Amex is in your name that doesn’t mean I don’t have access to it.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p>“But then you were never the brightest bulb in the box, my dear, were you?”</p><p>She was about to set her Birkin down on the kitchenette, then stopped and grimaced, only to take a paper towel to separate the surface from her bag’s leather. On her stilettos, she walked through the apartment and looked at the unmade bed, the armchair, and at last the piano. She scrunched her nose in visible disgust.</p><p> “So this is how you chose to live now? Is that a lesbian thing?”</p><p>“It’s just-”</p><p>Her mother waved it off, “it’s my mistake that I didn’t see through all of this any sooner,” she shrugged, “but then you really got creative with your excuses, I’ll give you that,” she raised her eyebrows and sighed, “so, let’s cut to the chase, the piano teacher? Really?”</p><p>There was cruelty in her voice.</p><p>“I’m not even going to try to explain it you, mother,” Agatha pressed out, her hands cramping into fists, cold sweat forming on her neck. Her mother’s gaze swept over her from head to toe, sharp and unyielding. Agatha couldn’t decipher the emotions behind it – disgust, perhaps, or a trace of disappointment lurking in its shadows.</p><p>“Why are you like this? I didn’t raise you like that,” she breathed out again and looked towards the bed.</p><p>“I don’t know if you keep up with scientific research, but homosexuality is something you’re born with,” Agatha put the phone on the kitchenette and crossed her arms. She wished it had come out stronger, louder. But then her mother had always managed to disarm her at a moment’s notice.</p><p>“Well you sure as hell got it from your father then,” she huffed and let her index finger glide over the piano, picking up dust.</p><p>“What does she see in you, I wonder,” she pretended to think about it for a moment, “I mean you’re clearly smitten with her – you were from the first day you came back from her. I shoulda’ probably caught it right then and there. My daughter? Coming home from music lessons with a smile, whistling? Unheard of. If you were a man, I would say you just can’t keep it in your pants, can you Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha looked to her feet and tried not to answer.  Shame hit her like a slap, sending heat rushing to her face and neck. Her stomach churned, heavy and sour, as if her body itself was rejecting the moment.</p><p>“I asked you something, Agatha,” she stepped closer again, “what on Earth do you think she could see in you?”</p><p>“We’re just… we’re good for each other,” Agatha tried, knowing that there was no arguing, not really.</p><p>Her mother let out a hollow laugh. It was meant to sting. It was meant to hurt. And it did.</p><p>“Agatha, she is a very successful woman. People like that are singular in a generation. They don’t stay with people like you. You are an incessant, little child to her. What have <em>you</em> got to offer if it’s not your money?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Deep down, she had been wondering the same thing. She had successfully pushed it away so many times, but if you looked at it from her angle, she was homeless, unemployed, uneducated, with zero prospects in life. She had a mediocre high-school degree and hundreds of excuses for why she had started and then subsequently dropped one course after the other. There was really only one thing she brought to the table.</p><p>“I- I love her,” she muttered. Because it was true. If nothing in her life was right and truthful, this was.</p><p>Her mother laughed again, it was vicious and belittling.  <br/>
“How cute, and does she love you too?”, she mocked.</p><p>
<em>Does she love me then? </em>
</p><p>She had squandered every change at telling her, wasted every precious, happy moment she could have said it. Because what if not? What would she have been if Rio didn’t love her, didn’t want a life with her? If she didn’t have at least that to show for herself, did she have any worth left at all?</p><p>“I-I think so.”</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Agatha will you wise up? Love doesn’t pay any bills; love fades quicker than old photographs in the sun. And then you’ll just be an inconvenience that she has to feed and take care of.”</p><p>“Stop saying that!”, Agatha tried. Hearing her own voice, whiny and little. The weight in their chest felt crushing, she felt her shoulders slump forward, instinctively making herself smaller.</p><p>“You don’t even know how to turn on a stove, you have never mopped a floor, or done laundry yourself. What are you going to contribute to this little fantasy of yours, huh? You are nothing, Agatha. You are worth nothing. And one day she’ll realize that – that you are nothing but a chubby, childish burden she has to carry. And then she will drop you. And you will fall hard. There will be no one to catch you, no one to take care of you.”</p><p>The words came like poisoned arrows, all of them hitting their mark. The pain seared not with the heat of fire, but with the cold precision of acid, dissolving every scrap of joy into oblivion. Agatha felt tears well in her eyes. There was no use for her façade anymore – no use for her brave face. Her mother knew she was winning, knew she was hitting Agatha right where it hurt.</p><p>
<em>She hadn’t even known how to turn on the laundry machine. Rio had had to turn it on. Rio had to take care of it. Rio had to take care of everything. Rio would always have to take care of everything, because she couldn’t even stand up to her own mother.</em>
</p><p>“And what will people say huh? That she coerced one of her students into having sex with her. Someone young and dumb enough to groom?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot up.</p><p>“But that’s not how-”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, Agatha, none of it matters,” she shook her head and pouted.</p><p>“He is such a sweet boy Agatha. He is so happy. And he worries for you so much. Nobody will care if down the line you find … other people to satisfy those devious urges with. But the difference is going to be that you will have a nice house, a caring husband, a comfortable life, and beautiful babies to kiss goodnight. Isn’t that something?”, she stepped even closer and put a tentative hand on Agatha’s arm. She fought it once, twice, but then she let it happen, let her mother step into her personal space as her arm crept around Agatha, icy fingers rubbing her back.</p><p>Hot tears spilled into her eyes, running down her cheeks, her lip trembled, and she looked to the bed they had shared.</p><p>“It’s all good sweety, you have such a nice life to look forward to. This will all be a funny story for the grand kids, we’ll all laugh about it someday. And it’s better for her as well, give her the chance to find someone in her league.”</p><p>She put her chin on Agatha’s head while she sobbed and caressed her with pretend gentleness.</p><p>“I know this all feels so terrible now. But we can be out of here in fifteen minutes. I have a car waiting downstairs, it’ll take us to Logan and we’ll be on our way before you know it.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled, shaking like a wet dog.</p><p>
<em>It would be better for her as well. It would be better for her as well. She was nothing. She was useless, she couldn’t even do fucking laundry on her own.</em>
</p><p>“C’mon pack up your things, you can call her from the airport,” her mother encouraged and reached for Agatha’s black tote bag.</p><p>Like a zombie, still sobbing, Agatha pulled her suitcase out from under the bed and filled it with the few of her things that were strewn around the apartment. Her mother carried her toiletries in and seemed to make a call from the bathroom, who to Agatha wasn’t sure, but it was hushed and quiet. She felt how the skin on her face was starting to dry off, leaving salty trails that itched and burned whenever a fresh tear rolled over them.</p><p>Between the sheets, she found Rio’s Oregon sleep-shirt, the one Agatha had kept after she had walked out on her the first time. She had sort of given it back to her, brought it to Boston, and Rio had worn it in Maine. Agatha pressed it to her face. It smelled like her. There was simply no way she could leave it behind.</p><p>She could feel that her mother was in a rush, in hindsight probably so that Agatha didn’t even have a chance to see through all the manipulation, all the crafty deceitfulness.</p><p>In the end, it took them less than ten minutes to pack all of Agatha’s life up. The driver came upstairs and carried it all down as Agatha stood in the door frame, her mother already on the stairs.</p><p>“Are you coming, sweety?”, she asked, tilting her head with pretend care.</p><p>Agatha stared into the apartment. Soft light came in through the windows, making dust dance in the sheen. She heard Rio’s laughter. Heard her moan.</p><p>
<em>Why did she always falter? How did her mother always manage to make her dance like a puppet on a string?</em>
</p><p>“C’mon Agatha, off we go!”</p><p>She knew it was an order, rather than a kind request. And if there was one truth etched into her more deeply than any other, <em>it was that her mother’s orders were to be obeyed.</em></p><p>She got into the car without looking up at their window one last time. She didn’t see the streets pass them by as they drove. She looked at the foot-room carpet instead and listened to her mother typing away on her phone.</p><p>Her phone. Maybe she could at least leave Rio a message, tell her how sorry she was, tell her it was for the better.</p><p>“Can I have my phone please?”, she asked and wiped her face on her sleeve. <em>What 22-year-old still asked their mother for their phone?</em></p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea Agatha,” her mother casually stated without turning her head.</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, but nodded.</p><p>Later, when they were already sitting in the United lounge, waiting for their flight to be called, her mother left her bag with Agatha, heading for the restrooms. As soon as she was out of sight, Agatha rummaged through it until she finally held in in her hands. It wouldn’t turn on. The battery had died. Agatha felt another swell of tears pouring into her eyes. There was no way she could charge it before her mother was back, let alone before they had to go on the plane. She still put it into her own bag, hoping her mother wouldn’t notice.</p><p>They boarded when the first-class passengers were called and she took a seat next to her mother, who was humming along as she looked through the selection of movies. The chime of clinking glasses caught her attention, and the moment she spotted a flight attendant balancing a tray of champagne, all she could think about was drinking them dry. Her hand shot up, and he came over.</p><p>“Excuse me Miss, if you put on your seat belt, I can hand you one right away”, he purred in a sweet voice and gave one of his glasses to her mother.</p><p>Obediently, Agatha fastened her seat belt, looked at it, and then up again to the glass he had in his hand.</p><p>
<em>She was back in her golden cage, and she herself had closed the door.</em>
</p><p>“I think I’m good now,” she mumbled, suddenly no longer in the mood for it.</p><p> </p><p>The tears only came when she walked back into her room, the blinds half closed, the last sunlight of the day threading its way through. As she began unpacking, she found Rio’s stupid Oregon shirt in her suitcase, buried beneath unused<em> La Perla </em>underwear and dirty socks. Eyes blurry with tears, she looked at her wristwatch and added three hours. Rio would be on stage right now, almost done with her concert. The thought of her coming back into the empty apartment, without any explanation at all, made her weep. She cried as her phone charged, and when it finally turned on, she saw numerous messages coming through, all of them from Rio. All of them worried. Staring at them, Agatha realized she had no words that could even begin to explain or justify what she had done. That she had gone willingly, that she had left without saying goodbye.</p><p>
<em>‘If you leave, it’s over, and I don’t ever want to hear from you again.’</em>
</p><p>As the words echoed in her mind, Agatha felt a fresh wave of anguish crash over her. She gripped onto the edge of the bed, her nails digging into the fabric. What could she even say? That she was sorry? <em>Sorry</em> wasn’t enough, it felt small and hollow against the enormity of what she had done. The phone screen dimmed, the messages still there, still loud and full of worry. She let it drop onto the mattress and knew, that rather than playing her final cards, she had abandoned the game on the table. She had no right to break the one rule Rio had establish for her.</p><p>And maybe it was really for the better. Maybe it really was for the best.</p><p>She continued to tell herself that all through the night and the next day. She listened to her mother telling lies about how difficult it had been to get appointments at bridal studios in New York, and how terrible the assortment had been.</p><p>There was only ever one win: She got Scratchy back. When she had mentioned over lunch that he was still at Rio’s house, her mother had graced her with a disgusted look, but allowed her to get him and return the spare key, probably hoping that it would be the last she would ever hear of Rio.</p><p>Agatha had gone there late at night in order to avoid the teenager. When she had finally pressed her little ball of fur close to her chest again, some weight had fallen off of her. She had cleaned around the cage and put the key back into the basement. On her way back to the office, she had walked by the piano one last time and let her hands glide over the keys. She didn’t dare playing it. She didn’t deserve it. When she turned around one more time, standing in the door and ready to leave with Scratchy’ s cage in her hands, she saw herself sitting there with Rio, giggling and making music as ray of summer sun danced around them.</p><p>
<em>Oh what a life that could have been.</em>
</p><p>Days passed. Then a week, then two.</p><p>She thought about telling one of her friends. Anybody really, so she finally had someone to talk to this about. She almost came close to telling McKayla one evening, when they were sitting by her pool, listening to music and watching the sky go dark.</p><p>“That woman that came to pick you up that night you got so drunk…”, she had tested, carefully, as if she had nothing more than a hunch that something more was going on, “…is she coming to the wedding?”</p><p>Agatha had looked at her and seriously contemplated to finally come out to someone for the first time in her entire life.</p><p>
<em>No, she isn’t.<br/>
I cheated on Ralph with her, or maybe I actually cheated with him on her. She asked me to end my engagement and to be with her. And for a few weeks I was, and tell you what? Those were the best fucking weeks of my life. The way I feel when she kisses me, when she touches me, when I sleep with her? Unmatched. Magical. Like she knows me better than I know myself. I fucking love her, but I am useless, and maybe she would have been okay with that somehow, but before I could find you, my mother dragged me back here and now I’ll never see her again in my life. I’m a looser, and a lesbian.</em>
</p><p>Instead she said, “no, I don’t really know what she’s up to at the moment to be honest.”</p><p>“I see…,” McKayla let out a long breath, looking to where her legs were in the water, “well do you already know if you’ll play something for Ralph at your engagement party?”</p><p>No, she hadn’t wanted to. She had specifically told both her mother and Lorie that she wasn’t going to play anything at all that night. But they hadn’t cared, after all, this was their party, not really Agatha’s or Ralph’s for that matter. So after desert, the staff at the hotel her parents were hosting the night at rolled a white piano onto the dance floor and the entire room burst into cheers, chanting her name, taking her indignation for diffidence.</p><p>She almost slapped Ralph’s hand away when he reached out to walk her to the piano and sat her down on the bench.</p><p>
<em>Fucking idiot in his fucking white suit playing the well-mannered gentleman. </em>
</p><p>Almost as if he hadn’t already groped her over her dress twice that night.</p><p>She choked back tears that suddenly welled in her eyes at the sight of the keys, white and daunting underneath her fingers.</p><p>There was only one song she knew how to play by heart. And if it would take her away from all of this for a moment, even better. He would never know. No one would ever know she wasn’t playing it for him, that she was playing it for the woman she loved. She felt powerful like that, that only she held that knowledge, that she was fooling all of them, even if she was fooling herself as well. It took her back straight to Maine, to the beach, to the little family she had seen and dared to dream for just a moment that her life could look like that, happy mamas and happy children. All of that was far away now and she had no one to blame for it but herself. She had listened to her mother’s lies and fallen for the same tricks she had used on her since she had been little. And she did it so well, that Agatha still wasn’t sure, if not some of it was true.</p><p>She ended the song with a silent sigh as her applause erupted around her and she looked up to Ralph – weary, with eyes asking <em>are you happy now? are you glad now that I am doing this to myself?</em> And maybe for the first time, she saw his face twitch, saw that he must have noticed something at last. She paid it no mind, got up and walked off. He didn’t stumble into her room until past four, drunk and unable to undress himself. Agatha took his key card and walked him back over to his own room. She couldn’t stand the thought of sleeping next to him.</p><p>
<em>How would she ever sleep next to anyone again that wasn’t Rio?</em>
</p><p>The next morning arrived with blue skies and not a cloud in sight. Agatha hated it. She barely spoke to her friends over breakfast, she couldn’t wait to get home, cuddle Scratchy and maybe head for the beach, drive by Rio’s house just to see her car parked in front of it. She knew she was home again from Boston; she had gone by there twice already and seen the shutters open on the top floor.</p><p>Deep in thoughts, fumbling with the seam of the shirt she had slept in, it took her a moment to notice Teegan pointing her phone at her.</p><p>“Teegan, can you put that down please?”, she grumbled and looked at her coffee, hot, no milk, no lavender syrup.</p><p>“You’ve become such a bore,” Teegan muttered, but at least she took her phone down and stopped recording.</p><p>“Is Ralph up yet?”, McKayla asked from the other end of the table, peeling an egg.</p><p>“Jeez no, the boys filled him up to the brim last night, I don’t think he’ll make check-out,” Agatha huffed and sipped on her orange juice instead. She felt a headache knocking on the inside of her forehead. Perhaps she had to pick up some Advil before she left. Maybe one of the waiters could get her some, she rolled her shoulders and scratched her chin when she was suddenly addressed again.</p><p>“Uhm Agatha-”, she felt Teegan’s hand on her arm and was about ready to tackle her.</p><p>“Teegan for Christ’s sake, if you ask me one more time if you can record another reel I will-”</p><p>“No, Agatha, I-”, she kept tapping on her arm, but Agatha didn’t look up until she heard it: loud steps, something falling to the ground, clattering, commotion on the other end of the room.</p><p>“How dare you?!”, a familiar voice shouted, “how dare you play that for him! That wasn’t meant for him, I wrote that for you!”</p><p>Looking up she saw her walking towards their table, black hair all up in a messy bun, wearing an oversized, dark sweater and leggings, a bag slung over her shoulder, tennis shoes, eyes slightly red. Some other heads were turning towards them, people looking over.</p><p>But all Agatha saw was Rio. Sweet, beautiful, caring Rio.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>CHAPTER TEWNTY-TWO</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She was fuming.</p><p>Here they were - Agatha’s girlfriends - gathered around a table laden with freshly squeezed orange juice, caviar, and poached eggs, indulging in luxury while she had spent days holed up in her apartment, putting her entire life on pause. They all looked so carefree, as if they had been living their best lives while she had drowned in hers. The only one with messy hair, dark circles under her eyes, and without make-up was Agatha. She looked more beautiful than any of them, like a deer in headlights.</p><p>It threw her off for a second, but then she found her voice again.</p><p>“You leave without a word, you don’t call me for weeks, and then you have to audacity-”</p><p>“Rio how are you here?”, Agatha interrupted her, slowly getting out of her chair, eyes wide open in shock. The morning light coming from the window behind her illuminated her silhouette.</p><p>“That doesn’t even matter – you had no right to play that for him!”, Rio repeated.</p><p>She had tried to put the words together while she had driven here, she had tried to come up with the most hurtful things to say, had hoped it would feel like uncorking a bottle under pressure. Her heart was beating so fast and hard she was afraid someone could hear it. But something felt strange about all of this now. Something wasn’t quite right.</p><p>“I didn’t play it for him!”, Agatha clutched at her chest as if she was trying to protect what was behind it, “it was the only thing that kept me-”</p><p>Rio saw one of the girls’ hands reaching out for Agatha, the one that had once called her when Agatha had gotten so drunk that one night before she had walked out of Rio’s life.</p><p>“Agatha I-I don’t wanna interrupt, but I think it would better if you took this outside,” she gently whispered, and Agatha looked up, around the room to where almost all eyes had turned to them, staring, gawking.</p><p>Rio huffed and crossed her arms. Agatha nodded and pushed her chair back, pointing at two big glass doors that were leading outside. She stormed through them ahead of Agatha and into a quite courtyard that was decorated with flowers and a small fountain that was rippling along without a care in the world. Turned away from Agatha like this, she felt little desire to face her again, arms protectively over her chest, eyes fixed on small sign that read <em>please don’t step on the grass</em>.</p><p>“Rio please.”</p><p>She felt a small hand on her shoulder, the tone in Agatha’s voice soft and sad.</p><p>
<em>Sad?</em>
</p><p>“I didn’t play it for him. I didn’t want to play anything at all. I just wanted them all to leave me alone, drink myself dizzy, and go to bed. They rolled it out and made a big show of it and I couldn’t say <em>no</em>. It was the only song I knew how to play by heart.”</p><p>“It wasn’t meant for anyone but you,” she still hissed.</p><p>Agatha went quiet for a second. Rio still wasn’t looking at her.</p><p>Then it came, even more silent than before.</p><p>“Baby, will you please turn around? Can I please look at you?”</p><p>The pet-name made something in her snap like a wooden stick that was being bent out of shape. She felt as if someone had embedded a knife into her shoulder. The pain made her spin.</p><p>“Don’t call me that!”, she shouted, “you have no right to call me that anymore!”</p><p>Agatha looked at her with eyes full of sorrow and cheeks red as cherries.</p><p>“You have no right,” Rio said a little softer, gesturing with her right hand, feeling how her eyes were getting wet.</p><p>“No I don’t, I’m sorry,” Agatha lowered her gaze down to where her feet were in old, brown loafers.</p><p>Rio looked past her, to the windows where all of the girls from Agatha’s table had turned around to look at them. <em>So much for privacy. She better got this over with quick.</em></p><p>“Can you be honest with me, for once in your life?”, she begged, “did you just use me?”, Rio whispered and suppressed any tears that were threatening to spill out of her. She wasn’t going to let Agatha see any of it, “was it always calculate to end like this? I just wanna know.”</p><p>“NO!”, Agatha’s glance shot up to her, her hands reaching out, but restraining themselves at the last second as if touching Rio would burn her palms, “no, I never used you, I wanted you all to myself from the moment you first touched me, Rio, please you have to believe me!”</p><p>Instead of relief, instead of joy, she felt anger and frustration rise in her chest. It simmered and boiled, threatening to burst out of her. Why did it have to be like this? The sorrow of it all clawed at her, tightening around her ribs like a vice. Her fingers curled into fists at her sides, nails pressing into her palms, the pressure almost grounding but not enough. She wanted to break something, to force Agatha to acknowledge the storm churning inside her. But all Rio could do was to stand there, swallowing it down, because in the end – after all of it, Agatha still meant everything to her, still held a place so deep inside her it hurt.</p><p>“Then how did we get here?”, she asked, trying to control the level of disappointment in her voice.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, I-I didn’t-”, Agatha stuttered, and Rio didn’t let her finish, if there was one thing she was done with, now and forever, it was Agatha’s excuses.</p><p>“Why did you leave then, why did you go?”, she raised her voice.</p><p>“No no no, Rio I didn’t want to go, I never wanted to leave,” a single tear started to run down Agatha’s face, leaving a glittering path on her cheek, “I wanted to call you the first chance I had but she-she said I had nothing to offer you, and she’s right, isn’t she? I have nothing to offer without my money, I can’t even turn on the fucking laundry machine by myself!”</p><p>
<em>The laundry machine?</em>
</p><p>“Agatha, what the actual fuck are you talking about? Who said that?”</p><p>Agatha ignored her and babbled on, “I don’t have a degree, I’ve never worked a day in my life,” she sobbed, tears now running over her lips and into her mouth, “I’m just a, just a major fuck-up, I’m selfish, and I can’t even do the sma-smallest things right, I can’t even-”, she was gesturing like a madwoman, voice all whiny and distraught, and it triggered something in Rio so she grabbed her by her wrists, holding her fast, forcing her out of her frenzy.</p><p>“Jesus, can you breathe for just a second, are you even listening to yourself right now?”, she yelled.</p><p>“B-but it’s…it’s a-all true,” Agatha still cried, snot coming out of her nose now, running down her mouth.</p><p>“Why would you even think that?”, Rio breathed carefully, tightening her grip as Agatha was fighting it, “why would you think any of that? And even if any of it was true, I would still love you, I would still want to be with you; for fuck’s sake Agatha why are we even here if <em>you</em> don’t want to be?”</p><p>There was a stillness to the cries. Agatha sniffled twice, licking salty tears off her lips, eyes wide with wonder, staring at Rio as if she had just told her the sky was green.</p><p>“Y-you love me?”</p><p>Yes she did. Of course she did. With her entire heart, with every breath that she took. Every day’s morning, and every day’s night. It had never wavered, never once even flinched. It had planted itself and taken roots that had long wrapped around every fiber of her being.</p><p>“Of course I love you, do you think I would be here, shouting at you, if I didn’t?”</p><p>She watched Agatha wipe her face on the collar of her T-shirt, and Rio realized it wasn’t just any shirt – it was the one she last worn on their trip to Maine. The fabric was worn thin, its once bold illustration of the Oregon coastline faded and cracked, unraveling at the seams like something struggling to hold itself together.</p><p>She let go of Agatha’s left hand then and touched her face, pushing strands of hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Rio I’m not sure I can wiggle myself out of this, I’m not sure I can figure this one out, I know I said I would, but I don’t think I can,” she sobbed once more, leaning into the touch and then into Rio’s chest, letting herself be held, letting herself be hugged. And for the first time since she had looked at her phone that morning, Rio felt her nerves calm, her shoulders sack, and her heartbeat slowing as occasional tears soaked her sweater.</p><p>Focused on whispering tiny little encouragements to Agatha, she paid no attention to the doors to the breakfast hall opening and falling shut again or to the loud, fast steps steadily approaching over the pebbled walkway until she heard frantic shouting.</p><p>“What on earth is the meaning of this?”</p><p>At the first word, Agatha’s eyes shot up and as if out of reflex she brought space between them. Enough that they were no longer flush against each other, but still close enough that she must have still felt the comforting warmth of Rio’s body next to her.</p><p>“Mother I-”, she stammered again, reduced to something small.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing here? Huh? With everyone watching?”</p><p>It took Rio a full ten seconds to remember where she had last seen the woman that had stormed out of the building and towards them. That <em>was</em> Agatha’s mother, wasn’t it? She had seen her at her birthday party – only then she had been in full make-up, wearing a form fitting dress. Back then Rio would have described her as arrogant and odd – now she looked like a fury, every word coming out like seething acid.</p><p>“What has gotten into you, Agatha? Get back inside – NOW!”</p><p>She saw Agatha wince, her arms jerking closer to her body, almost protectively.</p><p>“Hey, stop howling at her like that!”, Rio raised her palms, making a step towards Mrs Harkness.</p><p>“I’m not talking to you, this is between me and my daughter,” she turned back to Agatha, “how many times do you think you need to embarrass this family? Embarrass yourself you useless little blighter?”</p><p>Rio looked over to where Agatha was fumbling with her fingers, her glance fixed on her mother, her mouth slightly agape. She could almost hear her little heart thumb from where she was standing next to her. She looked like a scared fawn, looking for shelter, looking for protection. It was then that Rio felt how the last missing pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, finally making the picture whole. Agatha hadn’t left because she had wanted to, hadn’t she? She had been made to leave, forced to leave. Rio didn’t even want to think of all the terrible things her mother must have told her, all the vile conceptions Agatha had of herself, all the lies that had made her feel small.</p><p>She turned her shoulder forward so that half of her right side was in front of Agatha and no longer just next to her.</p><p>“Did you make her come back here?”, Rio asked, and there was a bitterness in her voice she hadn’t heard from herself before.</p><p>“Stay out of this, this is none of your business!”, Mrs Harkness spewed.</p><p>“How is this none of my business? I-”, Rio replied, but wasn’t allowed to finish.</p><p>“Agatha let’s go, stop making a scene for everyone,” Mrs Harkness pointed her left index finger at Agatha and beckoned her, drawing closer.</p><p>“Stop talking to her like that, what kind of-”, Rio was interrupted again.</p><p>“AGATHA!”</p><p>And that was enough.</p><p>That was enough of the poison, enough orders, enough empty accusations. Rio couldn’t listen to it any longer. She wasn’t going to let Agatha hear another word of this. She deserved better. Should she have simply taken Agatha’s hand and dragged her away? Probably. Would that have been satisfactory? Most likely not.</p><p>So, instead, she made two sure steps forward, lunged, and slapped the evil hag right across her face with her bare, open hand. It was loud, like a balloon busting, and it hurt like a bitch – but it was worth it. Because by her life, by everything she had, that woman wasn’t going to continue treating Agatha like that. No one would ever treat Agatha like that again.</p><p>
<em>Fuck this shit. This was ending here and now.</em>
</p><p>“Stop disrespecting her, stop disrespecting me when I’m talking, what kind of person are you?”, she yelled, and she knew the people inside would hear it, but she didn’t care, “what kind of mother<em> forces</em> their own daughter into a marriage?”</p><p>“How dare you-”</p><p>“No, no you are done talking! You have talked enough!”, somewhere in the periphery of her perception she felt Agatha’s hand on her upper arm, holding on to it, “people like you are a disease, you talk about ministry and then make your own flesh and blood fear you because you can’t understand the love somebody else feels,” she took a deep breath in, calmed down by an inch and added with a colder voice, “because evidently you have none in you.”</p><p>Something must have struck a nerve. She wasn’t sure what, but Rio caught the faint twitch in her eye – proof that something had landed. Not enough to silence her, though.</p><p>“Let go of my daughter or I will report you for grooming your students – think about what that would do to your career!”, she spat.</p><p>Rio snorted. Oh this would have thrown her off the rails just a little while ago. Just a few months ago this would have made her spin and falter and back down. It barely fazed her now that she knew what her prize was.</p><p>“Rio you don’t have to-”, Agatha whispered, but Rio simply reached for her hand on her arm and squeezed it gently without even looking.</p><p>Then she smiled.</p><p>And then she ran with it.</p><p>"Sure, go ahead, report me, sue me – turn it into a full-blown spectacle. Haul me in front of a lawyer so the entire world can hear how your daughter had a secret affair with her piano teacher while still engaged to her high school sweetheart. Is that what you want? Is that what you want splashed across every search result the moment someone types the first four letters of your last name?"</p><p>She felt little satisfaction at the way Agatha’s mother gaped at her. She didn’t even feel hatred. She felt pity. Pity at a mother who had birthed the most caring, quirkiest, gentlest daughter and yet could feel seemingly no love for her. What a shame. But then, some people were best left alone to stew in their own juices.</p><p>She turned to Agatha with a sigh, “do you wanna go home?”</p><p>She was nodding before Rio could even finish the sentence. With one last glance at her mother, Rio took Agatha’s hand walked her back across the courtyard and through the large swing doors where the crowd that had formed and watched them quickly dispersed. She did not make eye-contact with any of them. To her, they had all been complicit in this, every single one of them had kept them apart long enough. She heard them whisper behind her, someone addressed Agatha with a raspy voice, but Rio simply dragged her along, out of the breakfast room and into the lobby, and for what felt like the first time, Agatha let herself be led.</p><p>They were almost already out the door, when she heard a vaguely familiar voice calling after them and turned around.</p><p>“Agatha? Where are you going?”</p><p>It was that twat, Ralph, the fiancée.</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a moment, shook her head, and let go of Rio’s hand turning into his direction.</p><p>“Ralph, I’m a lesbian,” she sighed, “I know I said I just kiss girls for the attention, but I don’t,” she fumbled with her fingers, then Rio saw the ring come off, “I can’t marry you, go find someone else to do the vanilla missionary with.”</p><p>She reached of his hand and dropped the ring into his open palm.</p><p>“What’s gotten into you?”, he looked at it, eyes wide.</p><p>“Dude, don’t even – I’m so done with this shit,” she cut him off and shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had barely sat down behind the wheel of her car when Agatha jumped her, leaning over from the passenger seat and kissed her hard, almost climbing over the middle console, both hands on either side of Rio’s face.</p><p>“You slapped my mother across her face,” she croaked between kisses.</p><p>“Uhm-”</p><p>“That was the hottest thing anyone’s ever done for me. You’re <em>so</em> getting head when we’re back home.”</p><p>And that she did.</p><p>The only stop they made on their ride back to Rio’s house was to pick up a certain fluffy someone in his cage. Agatha held him the entire way back and put him back into Rio’s office, where he contently began to chew on a carrot Rio got for him from her fridge.</p><p>After that, it seemed nothing was gonna hold Agatha back from dragging her into her bedroom, shoving Rio onto the mattress and eating her out until she came with a cry, digging her nails into the sheets as Agatha was using both tongue and lips to milk the ungodliest sounds out of her.</p><p>She became more gentle afterwards, demanded tenderness, laid down on her back and let Rio use her fingers on her while clinging to her arms, whining every time Rio moved their foreheads too far apart and pulling her back down immediately.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio mouthed, gently moving her fingers, letting her thumb brush over her clit, reveling in the feeling of Agatha wrapped around her, finally hers and hers alone.</p><p>Below her, Agatha shivered and closed her eyes, cheeks red again, but not from crying.</p><p>“Just making sure,” she whimpered and chewed on her lower lip, moving with Rio, her nipples bare and hard, brushing against Rio’s upper arm with every movement she made.</p><p>“P-promise I never have to be without you again!”, she mewled then, opening her eyes to look at Rio, “because I-I love you too, you know? I love you so much I don’t think I could stand it.”</p><p>Rio had no words to answer. Anything she would have said would have fallen short of what she actually felt. So she simply nodded and watched as Agatha came beneath her, gasping for air, tilting back her head.</p><p> </p><p>It was so late it was already early when she woke up again later that night, naked and still sweaty, only to find the bed empty next to her. For a moment she panicked, but then realized what had woken her: The faint sound of music that was travelling up the stairs. Getting out of bed, she followed it to the balcony and looked down to where Agatha was sitting at the grand piano, wrapped in nothing but a bed sheet, tinkling with the keys.</p><p>“It’s past four in the morning,” she chuckled, wrapped in a silk robe, and walked down the stairs, Agatha already looking at her, sitting on the bench. The air was cold against her skin.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep anymore,” she confessed and scootched over to that Rio could take a seat next to her.</p><p>“So you decided to try some Schumann?”, she pointed to the sheet music on the rack. It still sat there from when she had practiced for her concerts.</p><p>“You like him well enough,” Agatha shrugged and leaned into her, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“You know I could teach you?”, Rio offered, “just like I could teach you how to do laundry… or I could hire someone to do it, you know?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and let a few keys chime and Rio realized that the combination of both was the sweetest sound she would ever hear.</p><p>“Yeah, I think I’d like that,” Agatha kissed her sweetly just below her ear. Lips dry and fond.</p><p>Rio nodded and stretched her hands.</p><p>“Well first of all, you gotta play it all in crescendo, even if it doesn’t say you should,” she smiled and put her hands on the keys.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>EPILOGUE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved all of it.</p><p> </p><p>The frost that covered the windows of her 2011 Toyota Corolla on cold Massachusetts mornings.</p><p>The way the sun had bleached some of the decades old wooden floorboards in the living room.</p><p>The tiny spider in the corner of the kitchenette, that always came back no matter how often she relocated it.</p><p>The way one of the keys on the piano Rio had bought her always seemed to be out of tune.</p><p>The sound of the wind howling around the roof of the house at night.</p><p>The two loose bricks at the train station that always bopped under her feet.</p><p>The goose bumps that formed on the skin on Rio’s shoulders whenever Agatha let her fingers glide over them.</p><p> </p><p>If anyone had told her in May, that by February of the next year she would get excited about budgeting and cutting coupons out of cardboard boxes, she would have flipped them off. But here she was, doing her own groceries, overthinking whether Rio would like cinnamon granola better than chocolate cornflakes. Chewing on her nails, she remembered that Rio had liked it when she made cinnamon rolls a few week prior, so she loaded the granola into her shopping cart before she checked out.</p><p>She left the groceries in her trunk when she locked her car to go to class. It had taken her a while to get accustomed to that – that it was cold enough here in winter for her to leave her shopping bags in her car for a few hours. That she needed to wear a scarf and beanie when she went out and that her lips now screamed for Carmex on a daily basis.</p><p>The class sizes at Roxbury Community College were small, there were only nine other students in the room with her. Surprisingly, she was the youngest – everyone else was at least thirty or older, changing their career to become a teacher. She liked it all so much she was almost sad she would transfer to BU come September, but then that meant she could commute with Rio, have lunch with her daily, and ride home with her in the evenings.</p><p>And all of that sounded like heaven.</p><p>
<em>“You know you don’t have to go to BU, if you like the course so much, I’m not making you,” Rio had told her one evening when Agatha had watched her play, a warm fire going in the small black oven in their living room, Scratchy comfortably sitting in Rio’s lap (a connoisseur now of her music).</em>
</p><p>
<em>They had these conversations now. Boring, daily, mundane discussions about which courses to take at which college. What was for dinner the next day. When the plumber would come to look after the shower drain of their rental home.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“No I want to go to BU, it’s the better program and I get to see you more,” Agatha had answered and watched how Rio has absentmindedly stroked Scratchy’s fur to a degree that made him close his little eyes and doze off.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’ll let Lilia know then,” Rio had nodded and annotated her music, her right hand ghosting over the keys.</em>
</p><p>The streets were covered in a fresh, crisp layer of snow when Agatha drove home after class and finally unloaded her groceries into the fridge. Smacking her lips, she called for her bunny until he happily came hopping out of their bedroom. She fed him some of the lettuce she had brought home and unloaded the laundry machine into the dryer before she changed into more comfortable shoes, made sure the heating was on so he would be comfortable and gave him a goodbye cuddle before she left and walked to the train station to go into Boston.</p><p>She was already halfway to the city when she realized she had barely checked her phone that morning. It buzzed in her bag when she took it out, a single message from Rio on her lockscreen, hiding a blurry selfie of the two of them back in LA.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rio: See you later</strong> 💚</p><p>Agatha smiled and unlocked the phone to text back.</p><p align="right">💜 💋 😘 😘</p><p> </p><p>Leaning her head against the window, she closed her eyes and thought about the previous night when Rio had been between her legs, digging her nails into Agatha’s thighs, shins over her shoulders. She remembered the way she had sighed and pushed Rio’s face snug against herself, moving with her as she was getting close.</p><p>“Fuck Baby you’re being so good to me,” she had moaned, and it still gave her chills thinking about it now. Thinking about sleeping with Rio generally gave her chills, truth be told.</p><p>And how close she had come to throwing it all away? Rio’s love, all of her devotion, their life together. She sometime wondered about another Agatha, in another life, that was sitting by the kitchen window of her mother’s house, looking out into the trees thinking of Rio while someone was making her chose which violinist would play at her wedding.</p><p>She was glad she was not <em>that</em> Agatha. No amount of money would ever make her trade places with <em>that</em> Agatha.</p><p>Once in a while, she got calls from an unknown number and sometimes she wondered whether it was her mother reaching out, or Ralph, or her stepfather. There were never any voice messages, and for all it was worth, they could have just been spam calls as well. She sent a postcard home once, right before Thanksgiving, just to let them know she was moving across the country. She had not written much, simply that she was happier than she had ever been in her entire life and that she hoped they would respect it someday. Rio hadn’t liked it, but Agatha had not included their new address – and besides, a simple Google search would have told them she was now teaching in Boston anyway.</p><p>Even so, the fear of Agatha disappearing again seemed to linger still, rising and falling in Rio’s mind like an unsteady tide. One time Agatha had left her car around the corner so Rio could park in their driveway instead. At the sight of the empty parking space, Rio had yelled, almost screamed for her when she had run into the house – snow boots and winter coat still on, leaving wet dirt all over their floor. She had tears in her eyes when she found Agatha in the kitchen, two failed attempts into making the aforementioned cinnamon rolls.</p><p>It happened less now.</p><p>Only sometimes, late into the night, Agatha would feel her moving closer on the bed, wrapping both her arms around Agatha’s waist a little tighter than usual, burying her face in the crook of her neck, breathing heavily.</p><p>One day, she hoped, there would no longer be any fear left. One day, she hoped, Rio would believe that she was not going anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was already well on her way back towards the horizon when Agatha stepped out of the train, walking the last half mile to the coffee shop she worked at now. It had gotten colder again, so she wrapped her scarf around her nose and buried her hands deep in her pockets, adjusting her backpack so it sat more comfortably over her coat.</p><p>The fresh snow cracked underneath her boots as she walked along the street, cars passing her slowly as rush hour began. When she walked by the campus building Rio worked at, she looked up to where her office window was and imagined her sitting at her desk, preparing another lecture. Looking straight ahead again, she turned the last corner until she reached the crossing and waited for the light to switch to green.</p><p>On the opposite side, <em>The Small Bean</em>’s windows were illuminated with strings of fairy lights. Agatha had helped to put them up on her first day there, right before Christmas. She let her eyes glide over the white font of the name, down to where someone unexpected was sitting at the window bar, hand raised to wave at her, brown hair in a messy bun. At the sight, Agatha’s heart did not skip a beat, it added an additional one.</p><p>
<em>She would never get used to this, would she? </em>
</p><p>Agatha raised a hand in return, fingers curling in a wave that felt almost automatic. A warmth spread in her chest, familiar and steady, like the glow of the evening sun overhead.</p><p>She still remembered what loving Rio had felt like at first: a wave that was pulling her under against her will – her heart pounding in her fingertips late at night, sweaty in her bed, when she thought of no one else but Rio. Yet it was different now, less scary – more familiar. She knew that even with temperatures nearing freezing, Rio would still be sipping on a cookie butter latte – never one to let the season dictate her cravings. There would be <em>Coldplay</em> sheet music spread open across her notebook, familiar notes she was amending to make them her own version. And if she checked Rio’s phone, the last app open would undoubtedly be their pet cam, from when she spoiled Scratchy with far too many treats, just to watch him hop into the living room, tail flicking in lazy satisfaction.</p><p>Love wasn’t the flutter of a heartbeat or some overwhelming swell of feeling, it was this. The simple, steady accumulation of knowing her in a way that felt absolute.</p><p>And yet, the way Rio smiled at her and got up to walk to the door when the traffic lights changed to green, Agatha felt it hit her once more – sheer, unadulterated longing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I missed my girls very much this week so it finally seemed fitting to finish this epilogue. Thank you all for coming on this journey with me!</p><p>I am so proud of this that I've actually decided to make a few edits before I'll get it printed so I can put it on my shelf and breeze through it whenever I want! It's such a dream come true for me!!</p><p>In the meantime I have actually started working on two other stories - a Pirate AU and a Southern Gothic AU that will both have two chapters - but I don't think I can write something longer at the moment. My life is going to be a bit crazy until October - we shall see then 💜</p></blockquote>
