<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Initially, this story was completely focused on Agatha and Rio. The idea for it was sparked by them, but it has grown into something much more beautiful. This work, much like Agatha All Along, is first and foremost about a coven. It tells the tales of powerful female friendships and bonds that transcend magic. The characters in it deal with loss, grief, trauma, and pain. They are flawed and imperfect but they also experience tremendous love. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness hates the holidays. </p><p>She refuses to put up a tree in her apartment and <em> never </em>opens the door for carolers. She despises the bone-chilling snowfall and festive decor adorning the city, treating the happiest season of the year with complete disinterest. </p><p>When she opens her email one morning to reveal a holiday-themed invite from the head of the history department, she curses and immediately deletes it, even though he <em>is </em>her boss.</p><p>Agatha later discovers, thanks to some dreadful small talk with a colleague, that all of the department heads are working with the president to put on an elaborate holiday party <em> and </em>every professor is encouraged to at least make an appearance. The event doubles as an end of semester farewell, where the staff are meant to share their current research plans and most memorable stories from the past year. Agatha can’t imagine anything worse.</p><p>The administration likely wants them to bond over stubborn students and badly made eggnog<em>, </em> but Agatha is busy, grading essays and overseeing her graduate students’ research before the year ends. She tries to get out of the event, claiming that she has presents to wrap and songs to sing, but her colleagues see right through her. </p><p>Agatha Harkness is never busy during the holidays. </p><p>Unless, as her students sometimes joke, she sneaks out at night to deliver lumps of coal and eat misbehaving children. When she overhears that particular rumor, she always smirks.</p><p>Unable to lie her way out of it, Agatha begrudgingly drags herself to the event. She curses small talk and Christmas joy under her breath as she goes, flicking on her turn signal when she spots the president’s house, visible just through the trees. She pulls up to the entrance and her mouth nearly falls open. </p><p>The impressive house is, of course, professionally decorated for the upcoming season. Agatha shouldn’t even be shocked, really, but her eyes are overwhelmed by the lights and icicles and piles of fake snow. She briefly wonders why they need fake snow when the real thing will likely fall soon. The sky is already brimming with it, the potential for violent winter weather. </p><p>Agatha makes a mental note to find her snow boots; they’re buried somewhere deep in her closet. The elaborate, twinkling lights hanging around the property nearly blind her and she blinks rapidly, swerving to avoid a math professor who seems blissfully unaware of his surroundings.</p><p>When Agatha steps out of her car, her gaze dances up the side of the house. She can see people talking and laughing just inside the windows. Their silhouettes are slightly obscured by the fake icicles that hang from each edge of the roof, glittering in the colorful outdoor lights. The sharp acrylic daggers dangle precariously above Agatha’s head as she makes her way to the front of the house. She eyes them with distrust before pushing the door open, eying the large holly wreath pinned there, and descending into her worst nightmare.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the entire affair is horrible (aside from the homemade pumpkin cookies). Agatha, squeezed into a corner of the sitting room while the president gives a toast to, “some of the brightest minds in the country,” resolves to escape as soon as possible. </p><p>After the toasts have finally finished, overplayed Christmas music pounds in Agatha’s ears as she engages in yet another conversation about an intriguing class she’s currently teaching. The Early History of Witchcraft, Folklore, and Magical Mythology is a new course she crafted for this semester, an enthralling introduction designed to lure students into the study of witchlore.</p><p>“Yes, all of my students are doing well,” Agatha says, for the millionth time. Her students’ performance is no surprise to her; an early expression of her tough grading style and strict demeanor leaves only the best and most dedicated scholars in her classes. The other professors are wary of her methods, but Agatha knows how to artfully nurture those who are <em> truly </em>willing to learn.</p><p>After a brief conversation with the president, a quick rundown of her research plans and future class listings, Agatha silently grabs another mug of apple cider and heads for the door. Just the <em> idea </em> of stealing one of the president’s mugs makes her chuckle. She’s sure he can afford a replacement; perhaps he could cut back on the fake snow. </p><p>Agatha smirks as she reaches for the door handle. When she glances down, getting a good look at the other side of the light blue mug clutched in her hand, and spots the obnoxiously joyful reindeer painted there, she fights the urge to throw it out the window.</p><p>“Professor Harkness!” Agatha jumps at her name being called, nearly spilling cider down the front of her suit.</p><p>One of her colleagues, an older lady who works in the English department, pokes her head out from around the corner. Agatha tilts her head. She’s only met her a handful of times, exchanging small talk in the library and at research symposiums. She can’t quite remember her name (she thinks it might be something like Mary or Marsha) but she knows the woman is a classic holiday-lover. She wears brightly colored Christmas sweaters with snowflakes and displays an intricately decorated tree in her office.</p><p>Agatha promptly sends a prayer to every god and deity that could possibly exist (thanks to her research, she knows quite a few) and takes a gulp of cider before spinning to face her current obstacle to escape. The cider isn’t intoxicating, unfortunately, but it’s the best she has at the moment. </p><p>It seems like her colleague senses Agatha’s attempt to leave early, moving almost uncomfortably close to her. She smells strongly of cranberries, and a strange look crosses her face as she gazes at her notoriously antisocial colleague.</p><p>“It’s so good to see you!” Mary-or-maybe-Marsha croons, and Agatha smiles tightly. She’s effectively trapped in the entrance now, the woman’s hand on her arm.</p><p>“I’m actually heading home,” Agatha replies, tilting her head towards the front door. She watches in confusion as her colleague’s smile drops from her face suddenly.</p><p>“Why are you like this?” she asks, words slightly slurred. </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows rise. Her gaze falls to the cup clutched in the other woman’s hands (no doubt containing something that inhibits the senses and loosens the tongue) and she fights an exaggerated eyeroll. </p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha replies, thinly veiled anger dripping from her lips. Usually people crack under that tone, her lashing words. That doesn’t happen here.</p><p>“Why do you hate it so much?” the woman asks, undeterred by Agatha’s tone. </p><p>She doesn’t clarify <em> what </em>exactly she is referring to, but Agatha knows. </p><p>She whispers a barely-audible goodbye and pushes open the door, her colleague’s hand falling away from her arm with a thud. The gravel crunches beneath her feet as she heads for her car, lifting an arm to shield her eyes from the obnoxiously festive lights. </p><p>The entire way home, Agatha fights the urge to scream. </p><p>Her colleague’s words won’t leave her mind. They swirl in her brain like the snow that will soon fall outside, chilly and uncomfortable. She finds it odd that defensiveness is rising up in her with such a vengeance; it’s a feeling she seldom experiences. Most years, she’s content to spend the winter season alone, locked in her apartment with a good book to read or a complex research paper to write. </p><p>She doesn’t explain herself to others; she doesn't care to.</p><p>Some incredibly dramatic and villain-esque part of her yearns to turn the car around, slam the door of the president’s house open, and regale that barely-familiar woman with awful tales from her childhood because, really, she hasn’t <em> always </em>hated the holidays. </p><p>As a child, her view had been completely different. At that point in her life, still young and innocent, she hadn’t yet disappointed her mother. The bright red and green adorning every inch of their home had filled Agatha with pure joy; she would’ve loved fake snow back then.</p><p>She used to sit in the kitchen, legs dangling off a chair that was too big for her, just to smell the incredible holiday dishes baking as her grandmother prepared dinner. She had looked forward to seeing her aunts and cousins at family reunions and Christmas parties. All of her friends had believed in magic, in the power of holiday joy and laughter, and Agatha was no exception.</p><p>The world, covered in snow, had sparkled in the way that it only does for children and the incredibly naive.</p><p>Then, everything had changed. Agatha grew up, the rose-gold lens she once viewed life through falling away and shattering at her feet. Once the weighty expectations of her family settled upon her shoulders, she found she could not stand under them. The holidays were miserable for her after that; a stark reminder of how different she was from the rest of the Harknesses. </p><p>To her mother, every move Agatha made was wrong. Everything she said was obscene. She could do nothing right and, during the holidays, there was an entire room of people present to jeer and laugh at her. Agatha wasn’t like them. She didn’t have the same uptight poise. She wasn’t concerned with her appearance or promising future; she just wanted to survive her mother’s home.</p><p>Occasionally, Evanora looked at her daughter with something much more complex than simple disappointment lurking behind her eyes, but Agatha could never quite figure out what it was. How was Agatha expected to celebrate and be merry when she was so incredibly hated? </p><p>She moved away from her hometown as soon as she could, slamming the door on her old life with the force of a daughter exiled by her own mother. The day she left still haunts her dreams, a dark mark on the home she vows never to return to. </p><p>Years later, celebrating and decorating feel pointless, only reminding Agatha of the hateful family she left behind, worlds away in Salem.</p><p>She has a few friends and colleagues she can tolerate in the city she now calls home, but no one she <em> really </em>cares about. Occasionally, one of her coworkers forces her to try dating again, but nothing sticks. Agatha tells herself she is completely fine with that; she works better alone anyways. The relationships she holds most dear are with the doctoral students she mentors, each one of them digging deep into the narratives and histories of witches in hidden places across the globe; places that have thus far been ignored by academia.</p><p>Often, Agatha’s students don’t celebrate the holiday season either. They’re too busy unraveling loose threads of history, guided by the steady hand of one of the most notable and, coincidentally, Salem-born witchlore professors in the country (who adamantly refuses to study Salem, much to her students’ confusion). </p><p>When it gets cold outside, many of them spend time in Agatha’s office, which is hidden away in a quiet corner of the History department. The bookshelves lining the walls are missing the most popular reading material in the study of witchlore. Instead, they hold dramatic recollections of myth and legend, first-hand experiences and stories passed down through generations. Some of them are written in other languages, their covers old and frayed. Agatha has spent years curating her collection, striving to have the most inclusive and nuanced view in her field. </p><p>Her office door, never adorned with a wreath, is propped open even on Christmas, which her most devoted students appreciate. Their other professors take time off during the holiday season. Agatha imagines they revel in holiday cheer, spend time with family members, and reunite with old friends. Professor Harkness does not, instead opting to face the season alone, aside from the occasional student who comes to her for advice. </p><p>Finally pushing the door to her apartment open, Agatha rubs her hands together and basks in the glow of her fireplace. The warmth seems to chase away her previous anger. Shadows dance up and down the walls as she unties her boots and slips her jacket off.</p><p>Agatha prefers it this way, far from insufferable office holiday parties and family dinners. </p><p>Anything else would be intolerable.</p><p>
<em> Or so she thinks.</em>
</p><hr/><p>The past that Agatha has spent <em> years </em>trying to bury comes gasping back to life just a few weeks before Christmas, when a crisp white envelope appears in her mailbox. </p><p>She stares at it for an impossibly long moment, the door of her apartment slipping closed behind her. It’s sent from a company she doesn't recognize, but the return address is in Salem. That alone is enough to make her nervous and she hates it, hates the constant reminders of her hometown found even miles away, even though she knows much of it is her own fault. </p><p>Following some unexplainable desire, Agatha had chosen to study witchlore at nineteen years old, which meant she could never quite escape Salem. The two hundred individuals accused of witchcraft in her hometown, their trials known far and wide, lurk dangerously in every corner of her life.</p><p>They hover just on the margins of her work and she encounters them, constantly, in the literature she reads and the research she conducts. She hears whispers of them in the halls of the History department, in new journals that have been uncovered or sites that are being investigated. They never leave her.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look any closer, though.</p><p>She often wonders why she couldn’t have picked something else to dedicate her life to, like marine biology (or even regular biology would do). </p><p>She tentatively runs her finger over the word <em>Salem</em>, which is written in loopy cursive on the front of the envelope, before dropping the letter unceremoniously into one of her desk drawers. </p><p>After that, she tries very hard to ignore it, slipping her shoes off and pouring herself a glass of wine. She has work to do. Her eyes drift across her apartment, where articles and thick tomes on witchcraft and its history dominate every surface—including the walls. Her own diplomas and research awards are framed in the living room. </p><p>She pulls a stack of papers out of her bag, flipping through until she finds what she’s looking for. Several of her introductory students are taking advantage of her offer to review their final essay drafts before the end of the semester. The next one on her list, which she places in front of her with a flourish, is on the 1581 witch trials in Germany. It’s an intriguing topic but in just a few minutes, Agatha notices six slight spelling and grammatical errors and clicks her tongue. She grabs her red pen from behind her ear and circles the offending words. </p><p>She pushes the essay away for a moment and lifts her glass to her mouth. A quick glance at the window reveals that it’s starting to snow outside, little flecks of white sticking to the windows. She rolls her eyes at that, dreading the freezing air and cold feet she’ll be forced to endure for the foreseeable future.</p><p>After finishing her revision for the night, and exhausting her last excuse, Agatha finally retrieves the strange envelope from her desk drawer. </p><p>She moves to the couch, wine glass and letter opener in hand. She doesn’t get much mail these days, aside from the occasional bill or pamphlet encouraging her to purchase some fancy new credit card. The universe also thinks she needs a new couch, if the junk mail she receives is anything to go on. </p><p>She slices the envelope open and lets the letter opener fall from her grip and clatter into the glass dish perched on the side table. Flipping the envelope over for the first time, Agatha’s gaze is drawn to the deep blue wax seal, stark and obvious against the light cardstock. The slightly melted symbol impressed on it looks a bit runic; certainly an interesting choice. She drops the envelope onto the coffee table and unfolds the letter. </p><p>Her eyes drift down the piece of paper clutched in her hand. </p><p>Agatha's mouth falls open when her mother’s name appears, imposing and unexpected. She reads the entire thing quickly, her hand beginning to shake as she nears the end of the unnecessarily long final paragraph. Blindly reaching out, eyes still on the cream-colored paper, she slides her wine glass onto the coffee table. She barely notices when it tips over and shatters against the hardwood. </p><p>The letter is signed by the executor of Evanora Harkness’s estate.</p><p>
<em> Her mother is dead.  </em>
</p><p>The words roll around in Agatha’s mind like rocks, slamming and pounding painfully against her skull. </p><p>The letter says she is the sole beneficiary; everything is left to her. She rereads that part a few times, eyes flitting back and forth quickly. Agatha hasn’t spoken to her mother since she left Salem at eighteen and she has absolutely no idea why she would be included in her will. After she left, Evanora cut her off from the family and refused to acknowledge she had ever existed. </p><p>Agatha imagines that the moment she left, all photos of her that once hung in the hallways of their home were ripped down. Her childhood bedroom was probably an office now, presentable and boring and everything Agatha <em> wasn’t</em>; everything her mother had wanted her to be.</p><p>She flips the page.</p><p>Stapled to the back of the cover letter is a list of Harkness properties and assets that now belong to her. Her childhood home is the most notable bullet point. At the sight of the address, Agatha groans and throws the letter across the room. She nearly knocks over a vase. </p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t make her feel any better.</p><p>Tears gather in the corners of her eyes but she blinks them away, climbing to her feet and grabbing her phone. Denial rises inside of her like a tidal wave, fast and violent. This must be a mistake. It has to be a mistake. That, or she’s fallen into some alternate timeline in which she had been a perfect child, obedient and proper and <em> not </em>a lesbian.</p><p>Agatha retrieves the offending letter from the floor, glaring at it like her gaze can set it afire if she tries hard enough. She dials the numbers printed at the top of the page quickly, desperation building in her. She will not allow this to happen. She has worked too hard to distance herself from her family, to leave it all behind. </p><p>In her frenzied state, she only briefly notices the strange date at the top of the page. Where the year should be printed, there’s only a string of odd characters; certainly not numbers. Agatha shakes her head. It’s probably just a printing error. </p><p>This firm, which she has never heard of, is certainly incompetent.</p><p>The phone rings twice before a bright voice filters into Agatha’s ear. The woman on the other side of the phone quickly introduces herself as the executor’s assistant, but her voice is far too cheery for Agatha’s mood. She imagines her sitting in one of those horribly decorated office buildings, fir trees in every corner and silver snowflakes dangling from the ceiling. She shakes her head at the image.</p><p>Agatha rattles off the information she knows. Her mother is dead and she’s the sole beneficiary of her will, despite a lack of contact in decades. Some intern must have shredded an important document or overlooked an addendum somewhere. Her mother must have chosen someone else; someone who isn’t her<em>.  </em></p><p>She tells the assistant exactly this. The poor woman listens in silence until Agatha ceases her angry rant.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness—” she begins.</p><p>“It’s Dr. Harkness, actually,” Agatha snaps, cutting her off. She may despise her last name, and the family it ties her to, but she worked hard for her title; it’s the one part of her name she chose for herself.</p><p>“Oh! Of course, so sorry about that,” the assistant apologizes, her voice traveling an octave higher. She takes a deep breath and starts again. “Dr. Harkness, just one moment.” </p><p>Agatha hears pages turning on the other side of the phone. She drops her head onto the back of the couch, phone still pressed against her ear. She stares at the boring ceiling above her, plain and solid and uninteresting. She thinks about the textured ceiling of her childhood bedroom, tall and covered in slats of dark wood. If she really tries, she can hear her neighbors laughing next door. They’re always laughing. She hates it.</p><p>“Ah, here!” the assistant exclaims, apparently finding what she was searching for. “You are correct. Your mother named only you.” </p><p>
<em> Only her.  </em>
</p><p>“What do I—” Agatha starts, her voice suddenly strained. “Do I have to do anything?”</p><p>“Nope! You are free to do as you see fit,” she answers cheerily.</p><p>“As I see fit?” Agatha questions, her heart pounding.</p><p>“With the estate,” the young assistant says, her voice still high and positive. Agatha isn’t sure if it’s real, or a figment of her own insane imagination, but she swears she hears Christmas music start up in the background.</p><p>She hangs up, tossing her phone down on the couch. </p><p>Her fingers shake as she reaches for her wine glass, trying to drown the feelings swelling inside of her, but it’s in pieces on the floor. Of course it is. The wind howls outside, loud and intrusive, as Agatha kneels down next to the couch, her knees colliding with cold wood. </p><p>She doesn’t care about her mother dying; she’s always hated her.</p><p>She doesn’t care about her stupid, elaborate, miserable childhood home either. </p><p>Agatha carefully picks up the shards of glass, each one a strange shape, and fights the tears burning in her eyes.</p><hr/><p>Later, restless and unable to succumb to sleep, Agatha stands at the window of her apartment and watches the snow fall. A glass of hot chocolate warms her fingers, the rich smell filling her senses. Despite being a self-proclaimed hater of the holiday season and the adjacent desserts that come with it, Agatha has an incredible sweet tooth; she always has. </p><p>She furrows her brows as tiny snowflakes melt against the thin barrier between her and the cold, intricate designs ceasing to exist as they collide with something sturdy. She observes each of them, their edges and swirls and shapes so unique; a phenomenon of nature. Water trickles down the outside of her brick building, thousands of tiny snowflakes returning to the ground; back to their beginning.</p><p>They seem drawn to the glass, despite it promising their end.</p><p>Agatha knows then, hot chocolate burning on her lips and snowflakes melting just inches from her face, that she will return to Salem.</p>

<p>This is, quite possibly, the worst idea Agatha has ever dreamed up.</p><p>She’s back in Salem, hand trembling as she points out another road to her driver. She still remembers how to navigate the area; she isn’t sure she could ever forget. She watches, heart pounding, as the forest slowly thins outside her window. </p><p>
<em> As they get closer. </em>
</p><p>When she was younger, the forest outside town was the only place she could escape her mother’s burning, judging gaze. She never lost her way; not out there.</p><p>Her driver turns and Agatha’s eyes widen as she gets a glimpse of the town she hasn’t seen in so long. Colors flash by her window quickly and she raises a hand to rest against the cold glass. There are cafes and stores she doesn’t recognize lining the streets, brick buildings with brightly colored doors that span the entire rainbow.</p><p>Glowing lights dangle overhead in an array of festive colors, leaping from one streetlight to the next. They’re not particularly visible against the bright sky, but Agatha notices them nonetheless. One wooden sign, hanging above the entrance to a cafe, advertises witch-themed desserts and coffee creations. Agatha scoffs, but she’s secretly curious.</p><p>She also sees a particularly jolly man dressed as Santa, children gathered around him as he dances in a shop window. The town is busy, countless tourists milling through the streets. They step out of the museums in coordinated tour groups, hats pulled low over their ears. </p><p>Most of them are easy to spot, walking slowly and aiming their cameras at everything in sight. Agatha watches someone take a photo of the Starbucks across the street and fights a laugh; that certainly wasn’t there in the 1600s. </p><p>She’s quietly glad she didn’t end up back here in October. Even as a kid, she had dreaded the thousands of people who descend on the town every fall; Halloween enthusiasts begging to hear stories of “real life” witches, to press their hands against brick buildings and chipped memorials.</p><p>Occasionally, a daring tourist had knocked on the front door of the Harkness house; its dark, antique exterior making it a target. The unwelcome visitors often asked questions about their family history and wondered “if they knew any witches.” Evanora always slammed the door on them, her face full of rage. Agatha never asked why it made her so upset.</p><p>Perhaps it's that experience which drove Agatha to become a historian, some deep curiosity urging her to speak <em> to </em> the dead instead of just <em> at </em>them. Living in Salem, she learned that sometimes, if you listen close enough, they speak back.</p><p>Agatha tears her eyes away from one particularly busy museum and spots a hotel down the street. She fights a groan when she recognizes the name. Desperate to not stay overnight in her childhood home, she had tried to book a room there. </p><p>She had tried to book a room at <em>any</em> hotel in Salem, actually, but it was no use. She couldn’t find a single one available on such short notice. Perhaps it has something to do with the impending holiday season or maybe it’s always like this.</p><p>Either way, Agatha is annoyed.</p><p>“Home for the holidays, are you?” her Uber driver asks with a smile, and Agatha wonders if he can sense the tension radiating from her clenched fists and stoic expression.</p><p>He glances at her in the rearview mirror, slowing down to let a family cross the street in front of them. Agatha contemplates him quietly. His name is Devon and he has five stars on the Uber app. He seems like a decently nice person. </p><p>Agatha’s only complaint is that he asks too many questions. Anyone else would likely appreciate that but, shockingly, Agatha isn’t the chattiest of passengers. Especially now, finding herself back in the town she swore she would never return to. Devon’s small talk interrupts her silent contemplation of her awful choices. </p><p>“Something like that.” Agatha dodges the question, pressing her thumb against the condensation on her window. </p><p>She watches, eyes wide, as they leave the center of town and draw closer to the home her family has owned for generations; the land she grew up on. Dark trees with miniscule foliage fly past them and Agatha blinks rapidly to keep them in focus.</p><p>“The holidays can be a real hard time,” Devon replies knowingly, his eyes scanning across the road. </p><p>Agatha hums noncommittally; perhaps her distress is evident. They drive past one of witch hunt memorials and Agatha observes the tourists holding cameras and trinkets, flowers and letters. She turns her head to watch the scene grow smaller behind them. </p><p>They drive on, the car quiet aside from the gentle hum of the engine and the low music playing in the background.</p><p>Suddenly, painful familiarity barrels straight into Agatha’s chest. The land in front of her seems to shift and reappear in her mind like an old, faded photograph. She recognizes the trees, the subtle dips in the road, the ditch that’s always been slightly deeper on the right side.</p><p>“This one here,” she directs, pointing out a brick driveway on the left. It’s almost completely hidden by trees and bushes, vines climbing up through the iron gate which is, oddly, open. </p><p>The car jerks to a stop in front of Agatha’s childhood home, the ancient wood paneling nearly black after centuries of weathering. The windows are just as dark, curtains drawn. Agatha can’t see inside; can’t anticipate what might be waiting for her. She steps out of the car and thanks Devon, dark purple suitcase in hand. </p><p>“Happy holidays!” Devon calls from the front of the car. Agatha smiles weakly at him and pushes the door shut.</p><p>She turns, her eyes finally settling on the house in front of her. It looks older, drooping under the impossible weight of so many memories. The front garden looks like it hasn’t been tended to in years. Vines spiral around the columns, overgrown and reaching for something. </p><p>In some twisted way, Agatha knows they’re reaching for her.</p><p>Dozens of dead or soon-to-be dead flowers dot the landscape. Agatha kneels down next to one of them, still on the edge of the property. She wrinkles her nose in confusion when the delicate petals break apart and slip through her fingers. When she was younger, the front garden was her mother’s pride and joy, a bright and manicured statement to the neighborhood that the Harkness family was one to respect.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen as she takes in the formerly vibrant grass, patches of it now brown and trampled under her feet. It’s so devoid of life, so different from how she remembers it. She expected the property to be in pristine condition, upheld and managed by her mother the same way it had been in the past. Apparently, the opposite is true. </p><p>When Agatha goes to step forward, lifting a boot from one decorative stone to the next, it feels like her feet are rooted to the ground. She imagines that the earth recognizes her, the wayward Harkness daughter, and is trying to pull her back into the fold. </p><p>Salem has always felt like that to her; as if some deeper force is constantly trying to suck her back in. At eighteen years old she had physically fled to get away from it. Perhaps it’s her flair for the dramatic or her constant study of witches, magic, and fate, but Agatha tends to err on the side of caution when it comes to feelings like that. </p><p>She makes a conscious effort to resist the pull of whatever divine force is tugging on her strings. History tells her that blindly following a path like that can be dangerous. Awful, catastrophic choices have been made by those who think fate is urging them forward.</p><p>At the heart of it, though, the idea of not being <em> truly </em>in control is what terrifies Agatha the most. For that reason alone, she’s seriously debating calling another Uber and fleeing back to the airport. Perhaps Devon is just down the street, taking a break at one of Salem’s many coffee shops before he picks up another passenger. </p><p>Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, trying to center herself. The wind burns the back of her throat as she forces air into her lungs. She reminds herself why she’s doing this: she wants answers. </p><p>After the initial shock and denial had dissipated, after she had reread the executor’s letter dozens of times, Agatha was left completely clueless about her mother’s death. Unsure what else to do, she had locked her feelings away in some far-away corner of her mind and tried desperately to view the situation through an entirely academic lens. </p><p>She’s comfortable in that position, sorting through bits and pieces of history to understand what transpired and why, and it really <em> doesn’t </em>make sense that she was included in Evanora’s will. Agatha spent a few days investigating, shut behind her office door, but she could find no answers from miles away. </p><p>Every official she called in Salem refused to speak with her over the phone; they were weirdly paranoid. She even contacted the local mortician and received no answer. She left a rambling, dramatic voicemail instead (or maybe four, but she would never admit to that). </p><p>It seemed that Evanora had simply disappeared, no mention of her death appearing online or in the local paper. Agatha wasn’t satisfied with that; her entire career as a historian was built on the stories of the long dead. People didn’t just disappear. Her <em> mother </em>wouldn’t just disappear.</p><p>Despite Agatha’s urge to sell her childhood home and never return to Salem again, her academic curiosity got the best of her. </p><p>It so often did.</p><p>She booked a plane ticket, deciding that she would return to her hometown <em> just </em>long enough to discover what happened to her mother. In the absolute best case scenario, it would only take a few days. Then, after everything was settled, Agatha would sell the property and close this chapter of her life for good. After that, she would never have to come back; never have to step foot in Salem again. </p><p>It would be easier to arrange everything from her hometown anyways, she reasoned. She imagined managing an entire estate over the phone—and from hundreds of miles away—wasn’t easy. </p><p>It certainly would be less emotionally taxing, though. </p><p>Agatha is reminded of the advice she often gives her students, gently pushing them towards excellence. The research topics that scare them the most, the mysteries that keep them up at night, are exactly what they need to explore. Forgotten pieces of history are typically unstable and unpredictable but they hold great potential; they’re often full of magic.</p><p>Agatha is finally taking her own advice, jumping headfirst into the thing that terrifies her most in the world: resurrecting the past she killed long ago. </p><p>The invisible tendrils rooting her to the ground seem to loosen with every step she takes.</p><p>Her childhood home grows taller and more threatening the closer she gets, looming over her tauntingly. The large brick chimneys seem bigger than they do in her memories. Agatha pauses outside the double doors, her hand gripping the familiar metal of her obnoxiously large key. After nearly three decades, she still recognizes the grooves and dips in its shape. </p><p>Before she flew to Salem, she tossed her apartment looking for it, upturning boxes and sifting through her unorganized closet. She finally found it shoved at the bottom of a drawer, long forgotten. She hadn’t imagined she would ever use it again.</p><p>Working up the courage to cross the threshold, Agatha hauls open the impressively sized doors. She steps inside tentatively, her suitcase rolling noisily behind her. </p><p>She flicks the light on thoughtlessly, her hand finding the switch out of habit. Tall ceilings are suddenly illuminated, dangling lights sparking to life. </p><p>Immediately, something feels off. </p><p>Standing frozen in the doorway, Agatha quickly notes that the place is covered in dust. She takes a couple steps forward, urging her body away from the cold wind outside, and jumps when the door slams shut behind her.</p><p>Then, everything is completely still. The silence is suffocating, ringing in Agatha’s ears. The howl of the wind outside is barely audible, thanks to the thick walls and wooden slats adorning the house. Agatha’s eyes dance across the parlor, long-forgotten memories jumping to the forefront of her mind. Most of the time, she avoids thinking about this place entirely. </p><p>Large pieces of fabric are draped across the paintings on the walls, hiding the expensive art from view. The entryway alone looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years, faint white lines crisscrossing across the dark hardwood. </p><p>Even subtle movements upset the delicate stasis of the place, Agatha’s shoes kicking up tiny clouds of dust as she walks. She runs her hand along the top of the fireplace, her fingerprints marking the wood.</p><p>The place looks abandoned, as if it hasn’t been touched in years.</p><p>That doesn’t make any sense.</p><hr/><p>Agatha leaves her noisy suitcase in the living room, choosing to move through the house in complete silence. It feels more appropriate. Every creak of the floorboards sends shivers up her spine. In childhood, she knew exactly which spots made noise and which stairs to avoid. Now, she has absolutely no idea. Occasionally, a tree limb bangs against one of the windows and Agatha nearly jumps out of her skin. </p><p>She rubs her hand across her face, wondering why every muscle in her body feels tense.</p><p>With each flip of a light switch, each gentle opening of a door, light spills in and the shadows are chased away. Only the memories remain. Occasionally, a lightbulb sparks and pops when Agatha turns it on, returning the room to complete darkness. She’s resorted to carrying a tall white candle around with her, stolen from a pile she found under the coffee table; certainly a strange place to store candles. </p><p>The tiny flame burns between her hands as she moves from room to room, pointedly avoiding her former bedroom. Some of the furniture in the living room is different, more neutral and modern. Agatha’s favorite rug is also gone, she notices with a laugh. </p><p>The ugly sculpture under the window remains. It is, surprisingly, still in one piece after nearly thirty years. </p><p>When she gets to the kitchen, Agatha pauses in her survey of the empty house, eyes immediately drawn to the window. </p><p>There’s someone outside.</p><p>
<em> A woman. </em>
</p><p>Agatha moves closer, blinking rapidly to clear her vision. Her breath, just inches away from the small kitchen window, fogs up the dirty glass. She rubs at it with the sleeve of her sweater, wondering briefly if she’s hallucinating. Perhaps Salem has already twisted her mind away from reality. </p><p>She looks very real, though; the woman does. Agatha can see the blood under her skin, the faint pink tint of her cheeks. For a moment, she watches the slight rise and fall of her chest. She doesn’t <em> seem </em>to be a figment of Agatha’s imagination.</p><p>She’s sprawled on one of the old benches, her arm resting effortlessly against the back like she was <em> created </em>for the sole purpose of sitting in that exact spot. </p><p>Any clueless passerby would surely believe that she was sitting on her own property, in her own yard, next to her own house. The antique bench she’s lounging on is certainly older than Agatha, and she’s quietly shocked it hasn’t come crashing to the ground under the weight. She doubts anyone has sat on it in decades; not since she left.</p><p>A flower is twirling carelessly in her hand. She spins it backwards and forwards. Agatha’s eyes follow the mindless, swirling movements. She must have plucked it from one of the bushes next to the house, stealing foliage like she owns the place. Agatha scoffs, but when she looks closer, the flower isn’t familiar to her at all. It’s a deep pink, oddly spiky and sharp at the edges.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha isn’t sure what to do, arms crossed as she peers out the window. She certainly hadn’t expected this. Tilting her head, she stares at the woman for a few moments, trying to determine if she knows her from somewhere; from the past. Childhood memories flash through her mind but she finds nothing.</p><p>Agatha could call the police. She could report a strange individual lurking on her private property. That’s the reasonable, responsible choice; the one that anyone else would surely make. </p><p>Agatha does not. </p><p>She quickly vetoes the most logical option. Interacting with the Salem Police Department would likely involve uncomfortable reunions with old friends and she can’t deal with that right now (or ever).</p><p>Plus, she's itching for a fight. Just stepping foot in Salem has her buzzing with anxious energy and she’s dying for a release. She was civil to Devon, her dreadfully cheerful Uber driver, but she’s under no such obligation of civility when it comes to someone on <em> her </em> property; at <em> her </em>mercy.</p><p>Making up her mind, Agatha pushes the back door open. The hinges creak from disuse and the trespasser's head snaps up. The strange flower in her hand drops lightly onto the bench; its vibrant color seems to dull as it collides with the dark, antique metal.</p><p>Goosebumps dance across Agatha’s arms as brown eyes land on her.</p><p>Crimson lips part gently.</p><p>“Has the age of teenage delinquents increased since I left?” Agatha asks, her voice laced with her signature sarcasm. She steps forward carefully, assessing the woman like a predator tracking its prey. She lets her appraising gaze float up and down obviously. </p><p><em> She </em>is probably ten years younger than Agatha, eyes narrowed and mischievous. Her outfit isn’t suitable for the current weather, jeans dark and ripped at the knees, but she doesn’t seem cold.</p><p>“Not on average. Just me,” she replies with a wink. Her voice is deeper than Agatha had expected, every word uttered with the same confidence that her body language displays. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth nearly falls open, a jolt of unwelcome heat shooting through her despite the frigid air pressing against her skin. </p><p>The woman leans back and smirks like she’s amused by her own joke; like she belongs there. Agatha can’t believe her audacity. She scoffs and throws her hands up, dragging her eyes away. It’s too cold outside for this nonsense.<em>   </em></p><p>“This is my house,” Agatha shoots back, her words clipped. “What are you even doing here?” Calling the house <em> hers </em>feels incredibly wrong, but Agatha tries not to think about that.</p><p>The woman stills, her mischievous expression melting away. She tits her head slightly.</p><p>“You live here?” she asks, pushing off the bench she was comfortably lounging on. She waves her hand out, sunlight flashing against silver rings. They adorn her fingers like crystals erupting from her skin, each one antique and interesting. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t noticed them before but suddenly, they’re all she can see. One is a skull. It strikes her as incredibly morbid, seeing as she’s only in Salem, only in this yard, only <em> here,</em> to investigate her mother’s death. </p><p>As the woman steps forward, their height difference becomes more obvious. She’s only a couple inches taller than Agatha, but the <em> principle </em> of it makes her even angrier. She wishes she was wearing heels instead of her typical black boots.</p><p>“No, but it’s mine now,” Agatha replies shortly. </p><p>“Rumor has it”—the woman’s dark eyes flick to the house—“this place is haunted.” Agatha raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“Haunted? How can it be haunted if someone <em> lives </em>here?” She leans forward slightly, the abandoned state of the house floating to the front of her mind. </p><p>“No one lives here. It’s been empty for years,” the woman responds, a curious expression drifting across her features. “Shouldn’t you know that? If it’s…yours now?” </p><p>Agatha wants to scream. It was foolish of her to expect any actual answers from this strange woman. She obviously has no idea what she’s talking about.</p><p>She turns on her heel to leave.</p><p>“You should go. If not, I’ll call the police,” Agatha quips over her shoulder. Dead leaves crunch underneath her feet and she tucks her hands into her pockets. </p><p>It’s an empty threat, but <em> she </em>doesn’t know that.</p><p>“I came to meet you.” The woman’s voice is low, barely audible against the howl of the wind. Agatha pauses. She could ignore her, pretend not to hear her odd confession. She could shut the door behind her and return to the task at hand, the reason for all of this: understanding her mother’s death.</p><p>She doesn’t, though. <em> Agatha never passes up a good challenge. </em></p><p>“Excuse me?” She whirls back around.</p><p>“You asked me why I was here,” the woman answers quickly, hand coming up to card through her hair. “I walk by this house every day and it’s always empty. Until today…”</p><p>As she moves her hand up further, her sleeve slides down her arm. Agatha presses a hand against her mouth to silence her gasp. She tries to be discreet, but the woman purses her lips slightly and Agatha knows she’s caught.</p><p>Tattoos, dark and gorgeous, spiral up her exposed wrist. They were hidden before, shielded from the cold by dark fabric. Agatha tracks them with her vision; flowers and vines decorating pale skin. She wonders how far they go.</p><p>“Today, there was <em> you</em>,” the woman continues, either unaware of or undeterred by Agatha’s internal turmoil. Her words take on a deeper quality that Agatha can’t name or describe. It rips her eyes away from the tattoos, back to impossibly dark irises.</p><p>Her voice pulls Agatha in, like the words spoken by a fortune teller as she cradles the hands of a child and foresees their future; the tone used by preachers and prophets as they predict the end of the world.</p><p>
<em> Like a prayer and an incantation all at once.  </em>
</p><p>It makes Agatha uncomfortable. She inches towards the door, hand reaching out behind her. The woman most certainly sees her, eyes tracking her every move.</p><p>“So you decided to come lounge around in my yard?” Agatha gestures with her free hand, trying to discreetly shake the tension from her limbs. She feels like a rope is tied around her waist, tugging on her body and urging her forward. She pointedly ignores the feeling.</p><p>The woman in front of her simply smirks, reaching down to pull a dead flower from the ground.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha slams the door behind her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha has been in Salem for approximately four hours when a familiar, rhythmic knocking echoes through her childhood home. It’s barely snowing outside and the sun is about to set; not the most convenient time for a visitor. She groans from her position in the living room, knees protesting against the hardwood as she kneels in front of the fireplace. </p><p>Her hands are lifted to the flames, the warmth nudging some life back into her aching fingers. The house is freezing and it only seems to get colder the longer she’s in it. </p><p>
<span>Agatha is convinced the heating system is broken. She called before she left for Salem, arguing with countless secretaries and ensuring that all of the utilities would be turned back on in preparation of her arrival. Despite this, she is certain that something had gone wrong with the heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As much as she hates the temperature, though, she does acknowledge that it mirrors her mood. </span>
<em>
<span>Cold.</span>
</em>
</p><p>At least it smells good, the homey scent of recently baked blueberry muffins filling the house. Agatha had eventually given into the persistent growling of her stomach, digging through the cabinets for something edible. </p><p>She found a bag of not-quite-expired muffin mix. </p><p>After eating half of them, Agatha was forced to accept that she would have to venture outside the silent Harkness house at some point. She had to go to a grocery store, at least. </p><p>It was that, or eat entirely take-out Chinese for the next week. Agatha was tempted, wincing at even the idea of going somewhere <em> public </em>in Salem, somewhere with other people; people that she maybe knew, once upon a time. </p><p>In comparison, takeout seems like a wonderful idea.</p><p>Agatha climbs to her feet, brushing off her pants, and moves towards the door. She leaves a discarded mug on the ground next to the fireplace. It contains remnants of coffee, her last ditch attempt to revive her brain and hopefully shock it back into adulthood. This place makes her feel like a teenager again, anxious and unsure of her next steps. </p><p>That’s exactly how Agatha feels now. </p><p>She feels like the world is tilting underneath her because she knows exactly who is waiting for her on the other side of the door. Only one person had knocked that rhythm on her front door every day during the summer before middle school; she would know the pattern anywhere. </p><p>Twisting the lock and turning the doorknob, Agatha takes a deep breath.</p><p>“Oh my god,” a low voice whispers before the door has opened completely. “It <em> is </em>you.” </p><p>The familiar voice shoots through Agatha with more force than she anticipated. Her breath catches in her throat.</p><p>The door is pushed open by a ringed hand. </p><p>Jennifer Kale stands in the doorway, immediately drawing Agatha’s attention the same way she had when they were children. Almost thirty years later and she’s still just as captivating, dazzling and wrapped in layers of flowy pink silk. </p><p>Wind blows past her, catching her shirt sleeves and circling her in a flurry of snow. Her hair is different, completely shaved. Agatha thinks briefly of the curls she wore proudly in childhood, the spirals that had created a halo around her bright face.</p><p>Jen’s hair may be different but her earrings, dangly and dramatic, are exactly the same. </p><p>“I thought I would die before I saw Agatha Harkness back in Salem,” Jen teases, dropping her voice and planting her hands on her hips. “Am I dead?” she asks, a smirk dancing on her lips. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, heart lurching painfully. It’s been so long. She moves backwards, allowing her former friend entrance without question.</p><p>Jen steps forward. Her eyes dance up and down Agatha’s body, taking in her hair and clothes and face; everything that’s changed. When she lifts her hand from her side, Agatha briefly expects a hug. She expects warm arms to snake around her waist, the smell of herbs and florals that always seemed to hang around Jen to fill her nostrils.</p><p>They didn’t hug much when they were kids, both preferring annoying banter as a show of affection, but perhaps an end to three decades of radio silence is cause for physical contact. </p><p>Agatha is incredibly wrong. </p><p>A palm connects hard and fast with her cheek.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha yelps, stepping back. Her hand comes up to cradle her face, which is now hot and stinging. Jen has certainly gotten better at slapping people in the last couple decades. ”What was that for?”</p><p>“For leaving! For never calling!” Jen’s voice is suddenly loud and Agatha winces. She should have expected this. </p><p>“For completely dropping off the face of the earth!” Jen yells. Each sentence is punctuated by the slam of her heels as she ventures further into the house, kicking the door closed with her foot. Agatha thinks she would be impressed if Jen hadn’t just slapped her.</p><p>Jen is already a couple inches taller than Agatha and her heels separate them even further. Agatha kicked off her shoes a while ago, padding around the house in embarrassingly fluffy socks instead. A student gifted them to her a couple years ago, giggling as they presented their most intimidating professor with fuzzy Christmas socks. </p><p>Now, Agatha <em> really </em> wishes she had kept her shoes on.</p><p>“You could have googled me!” she shoots back, hands gesturing wildly. She’s a respected professor at a respected institution. “I have my own Wikipedia page, for God’s sake!” </p><p>Jen doesn’t reply to Agatha’s quip, shooting a fiery glare in her direction instead. Agatha clamps her mouth shut. She remembers that look from their teenage years, when Jen could silence anyone with a single look. Apparently, she still has it. If Agatha’s memory is correct, there’s little use fighting it. Instead, she studies the sky outside, dark and dotted with rapidly falling clumps of snow.</p><p>Then Jen pauses, eyes moving rapidly around the entryway. She seems to really take in her surroundings for the first time since she arrived. Her brow furrows and she turns back to Agatha.</p><p>“Why does this place look horrible?” The complete tone shift surprises Agatha, and she holds her hands up in surrender. She opens and closes her mouth a couple times, unsure if she should respond or not. Jen raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Don’t ask me. It was like this when I got here.” Agatha replies. She’d been spiraling over that very question for nearly two hours before Jen arrived, murmuring to herself as she dusted the living room and washed the countertops.</p><p>In times of great uncertainty, Agatha cleans; or does some other mindless, endless activity. Just after her strange interaction with the backyard trespasser, she had gone to work on the Harkness house, pulling a portable speaker out of her suitcase and leaning it against the wall. Occasionally she had to skip a Christmas song or two, but the music made the eerie silence less suffocating. If Agatha was going to stay overnight in her childhood home, her attempts at getting a hotel room failing miserably, it might as well be clean.</p><p>Or clean-<em>ish, </em>at least.</p><p>The desperate cleaning had also served as a welcome distraction from the dark gaze that still greeted Agatha when she pressed her eyes closed, confident and dangerously curious. Unfortunately, she hadn’t made it to the entryway in her cleaning frenzy. She was distracted by the immediate need to feel heat before she turned into a human ice cube. Thankfully, the fireplace had helped with that. </p><p>As Jen inspects every inch of the still-dusty entryway, Agatha studies her hands, which are dry and irritated from scrubbing the countertops and baseboards. She’s also pretty sure she pulled a muscle in her back trying to clean the upper row of cabinets in the kitchen. Jen’s critical gaze sweeps across the room again and she scoffs, nails tapping rhythmically against the purse slung low over her arm. </p><p>Even Agatha has to admit that it doesn’t look great.</p><p>Apparently done scrutinizing the first room of the house, Jen blows past Agatha and walks into the kitchen, pink silk flowing behind her. Thankfully, Agatha <em> had </em>cleaned that room and it looks slightly more acceptable. She follows Jen, muting the speaker to silence her melancholy music. </p><p>Agatha leans back against the counter, crossing her arms across her chest. </p><p>Four hours in Salem and she’s already had a strange meeting with a (dangerously flirty) trespasser, deep cleaned several rooms, and reunited with her childhood best friend who, upon said reunion, <em> slapped </em>her. </p><p>Agatha can feel another storm brewing and if Jen’s initial reaction to seeing her again is anything to go by, this is not going to be a fun conversation. </p><p>“Agatha? Not that I’m complaining but…” Jen trails off, hands landing on her hips again. Her voice is softer than Agatha anticipated; she was prepared for more yelling. “Why are you here?” she asks. </p><p>Agatha freezes. Her fingers, which were anxiously tapping against her arm, still. Her former best friend knows everything that goes on in Salem; surely she knows why Agatha is back. </p><p>She imagines that her mother’s death is public knowledge, especially to someone as omniscient as Jen. When they were in high school, she somehow managed to have acquaintances and sources in every niche group, every strange collective. People naturally flocked to her at lunch or after school, spilling their secrets and airing their grievances. It was always that way; Agatha was consistently baffled by it.</p><p>“Don’t you know?” Agatha asks, her eyes drifting to the floor to avoid Jen’s criticizing gaze. She notices that she missed a spot when mopping earlier. That’s annoying. She also notices a spider dangling from the countertop. </p><p>It spins on a single string, hanging inches from the hardwood; inches away from death.</p><p>“No, I don’t,” Jen whispers, her voice genuine. She takes a half step forward, eyes never leaving Agatha. She is completely still now, a contrast to her earlier energy. </p><p>“Why do you think, Jen? <em> She’s </em>dead,” Agatha tries, her attempt at humor falling flat in the uncomfortable silence. Jen has always been able to see right through her and she hates it. “It’s mine now.”</p><p>Agatha finally looks up from her survey of the kitchen floor. She steps to the center of the room and gestures to the walls around her; the home that she unwillingly inherited from her mother. The shadows in the corners of the room seem to slink forward, the dangling light above them flickering. Agatha briefly hopes the bulb will crackle and burn out, sending them into darkness so she can <em> stop </em>having this conversation.</p><p>“Agatha, <em> what </em>are you talking about?” Jen’s eyebrows are drawn together, all traces of her previous anger gone and replaced wholly by confusion. </p><p>Agatha’s heart sinks. </p><p>“My mother is dead, Jen,” Agatha repeats, her voice breaking. For some reason, she desperately needs to know that Jen understands; that someone does. “Now I’m here, in this… haunted house.” </p><p>”Agatha…” Jen stares at her, hands open and gesturing at her sides, as if she’s trying to find the right words somewhere in the air around her. She gives up, her hands falling away.</p><p>“Evanora died years ago.” </p><p>It is not a question. There is no confusion in Jen’s voice, no unsure lilt. The words are a statement, uttered with the disbelief of a person explaining something very obvious; something which should require no explanation. </p><p>There is a moment of silence, a brief pause in which time seems to hover, unsure whether to cease or continue. For a singular heartbeat, everything is blissfully normal and unconfusing and simple. </p><p>
<em> Just one moment. </em>
</p><p>And then Agatha sees her body from above.</p><p>She is full of tension and anticipation as she takes a step into her childhood home for the first time in years. She sees her eyes, wide and shocked, as she finds it completely abandoned. </p><p>Images of dusty floors and covered paintings and dead flowers shoot through her mind. </p><p>She is reminded of the gorgeous trespasser in her lifeless yard, gazing at her with eyes full of curiosity as she informs Agatha that the house is empty. Pink lips part as she says that it’s been abandoned for <em> years</em>.</p><p>Images fly through Agatha’s brain at the speed of light, like a recap montage at the beginning of a television episode, making her feel dizzy. Everything she thinks she knows about her mother and her death is being crossed out, words slashed from an invisible draft that only she can see.</p><p>Agatha recoils from Jen’s proximity, the small of her back colliding hard with the countertop. The mental onslaught of memories and contradictions continues. Agatha presses her fingers against her temples.</p><p>“No”—she shakes her head—“that can’t be right.” It isn’t true; it can’t be. If her mother had been dead for years, someone would have told her. She would <em> know.</em> </p><p>Agatha feels like she’s standing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, rocking and dipping and threatening to flip at any moment, plunging her into the icy water below.</p><p>“Agatha…” Jen whispers her name, face full of confusion and concern. Her hands, dripping with gold jewelry, hover uselessly at her sides. Jen has no reason to lie to her. Despite her hatred of pretty much everyone and everything in Salem, Agatha knows that. </p><p>She must be missing something. Everything she’s seen so far—the abandoned house, the words of the infuriating trespasser, the lack of information on her mother’s death—supports what Jen is telling her.</p><p>The realization is almost too much to bear.</p><p>“I got a letter, Jen,” Agatha snaps, her mind finally fixating on a solid point; finding an anchor in the churning water.</p><p><em> The letter: </em>proof she didn’t make it all up.</p><p>Agatha moves towards her suitcase, hands shaking as she unzips it and tips it over onto the hardwood. </p><p>“I got a letter in the mail telling me she died.” </p><p>Clothes and books spill out of the purple case. The deep, jewel tones of Agatha’s wardrobe are a stark contrast against the drab neutrals of her childhood home.</p><p>“It’s in here somewhere…” she trails off, knees hitting the ground as she sifts through papers and folders. Agatha is certain that she packed the strange letter informing her of her mother’s death, sliding it in between two pages of a book so it wouldn’t get crushed or bent. The problem is, she can’t recall exactly which book. </p><p>She tosses a stack of paper over her shoulder. The pages, not yet stapled together and organized, fly apart as they hit the floor; dozens of them, bright white and marked with red pen. They’re her student’s drafts, outlines of broad ideas and rough starts recently given to her for editing and feedback.</p><p>“Agatha?” Jen takes a step closer to her, eyes wide.</p><p>Agatha lifts her backpack, flipping it over and watching as stapled packets and half a dozen red pens crash onto the ground. Her heart pounds in her ears, drowning out Jen’s words. Or, at least, that’s what Agatha thinks is happening. </p><p>Jen’s mouth is certainly moving.</p><p>Agatha hears nothing.</p><hr/><p>“Agatha! Can you hear me?” </p><p>Agatha isn’t sure how long she’s been there on the floor, knees sore and feet tucked underneath her, when Jen’s yelling finally breaks through her frantic daze. </p><p>Strong hands grip her elbows, dragging her fingers away from where they flip through books and sort through research papers. Agatha feels the cold press of metal against her skin, hears the clinking of bracelets sliding together.</p><p>Her heart is still pounding and, with every beat, Jen’s whispered words echo in her mind. They crash into the structure of her life like stones thrown against a glass house, shattering and upending and destroying.</p><p>
<em> Evanora. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Died. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Years. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ago. </em>
</p><p>Agatha has checked every book twice, or perhaps three times. She lost count. She also got a paper cut at some point, an unfortunately common occurrence  in her profession. Thin, razor-sharp paper sliding against the top layer of skin, sensitive and smooth. </p><p>Blood drips down her thumb and stains each page she touches; an insane artwork of crimson covering the floor around her. Agatha barely notices, the sting hardly registering in her chaotic mind. Jen is crouched down next to her, pink silk spilling out around her like a majestic waterfall.</p><p>Agatha would appreciate the beauty of it all, the tragic poetry that could be written about this very moment, if she could think about anything aside from the letter; the single piece of correspondence that certifies her mother’s death and brought her to Salem in the first place. </p><p>The letter that completely upended her life.</p><p>Agatha blinks at her former best friend slowly, her hands falling uselessly into her lap.</p><p>The pages flying through her mind, the memories and recollections dancing behind her eyelids, fall away with a crash. The dark, all-consuming tunnel that had formed around her vision seems to lessen as her name rings out in the empty house again and again.</p><p>
<em> “Agatha!” </em>
</p><p>Jen’s face is closer than she expected, furrowed and unsure and <em> devastated. </em>This close, Agatha can see the wrinkles etched on her forehead and hiding in the corners of her eyes. They make her look so much older, so much more experienced; signs of age that have appeared in the decades since Agatha left. She wonders about her own face, about the faint lines there. </p><p>Crouched on the tile floor, her heart ripped out and shattered at her feet, Agatha certainly doesn’t feel old or experienced. She feels like she’s eight years old again, changing and molding herself to please her mother.</p><p>She silently climbs to her feet, ignoring the loss of warmth as Jen’s hands drop away from her. Her limbs ache in protest as she steps over the mess she created; countless papers and articles of clothing strewn about the kitchen. Her suitcase is turned upside down and shoved to the side.</p><p>She practically runs up the wooden stairs to the second floor; somewhere she had pointedly avoided venturing before. It was too terrifying.</p><p>Now, there are worse things.</p><p>Her feet pound against the steps, a shower of dust falling down from the staircase and covering the floor she had mopped earlier. Agatha wonders if the stairs will give out under her, crashing to the ground and burying her under ancient wood. She certainly expects them too; everything else has gone terribly wrong today.</p><p>They don’t.</p><p>Agatha slams the door shut behind her before she has even processed where she’s going. The crack echoes through the house, roaring in her sensitive ears and resounding off the walls. </p><p>Her hands feel weak, like they’ll barely lift from her sides, but she finds the familiar shape of the metal lock and twists it out of pure instinct. It clicks into place.</p><p>Her knees give out underneath her and Agatha sinks to the ground, gasping for air that suddenly seems thinner only one floor up. Logically, she knows that isn’t possible, but it doesn’t matter. She still <em> can’t </em> breathe.</p><p>Blood trails down from her thumb, tiny droplets sinking into the carpet of her childhood bedroom. </p><p>Leaning back against the door and slamming her eyes shut, Agatha hopes to avoid the visual assault that would certainly come from seeing her old room for the first time in decades. Her breath comes in sharp gasps. </p><p>She presses the palms of her hands against her eyes and wills it to slow down.</p><p>Most of her panic attacks occurred when she still lived with her mother, walking on eggshells and holding her breath at every moment. Agatha still remembers the first one. She had just arrived home from middle school, in tears after a boy accused her of cursing him. It was a common tease in Salem. Agatha knew that, but it had still upset her. </p><p>She hadn’t done anything wrong. She told her mother exactly that, but Evanora wasn’t interested in her <em> excuses</em>.</p><p>In moments, she was screaming at Agatha to do better in school, to make more respectable friends, to be more of a lady. Crying was not ladylike. Agatha couldn’t stop. Suddenly, her chest was tight and her hands were shaking; she was unable to breathe. </p><p>Agatha had been certain she was dying. She locked herself in the bathroom, wrapping her thin arms around her body and squeezing her eyes shut until it passed. The only person she ever told was Alice, in vague language and ready to bolt at any moment. </p><p>Just the memory of her old friend, her closest childhood companion next to Jen, makes Agatha’s heart constrict further, if that’s even possible.</p><p>Alice had squeezed her hand and taken several deep breaths, holding them for a few seconds and counting each one aloud. They never discussed it again but the next time it happened, the next time Agatha couldn’t breathe, she did exactly what her friend had taught her. </p><p>Once she left Salem, the suffocating weight on her chest had lessened greatly. </p><p>Agatha hasn’t coached herself back into breathing in quite a while. She digs her fingers into the wooden doorframe, sliding her feet against the rough carpet and breathing in the dusty smell that permeates long-abandoned rooms. </p><p>Her senses react and spark to life like tiny explosions of color and sound in her brain. She counts slow, even breaths, ignoring the tears that stream down her cheeks and darken the fabric of her shirt. </p><p>Distantly, Agatha notes that someone is knocking on the door against her back, brief raps sending waves of motion down the wood and into her body. She thinks she hears someone calling her name, but it feels very far away.</p><p>She pushes the confusing sensations out of her mind, instead focusing on her body and the awareness that is gradually returning to her frantic brain.</p><p>The earth-shattering, foundation-cracking realizations of the past hour have left Agatha feeling hollow and exhausted. To coax her frenzied brain down from the edge, she relies upon the same reasoning that drives her career forward; the same logic that calms her graduate students when they get stuck unravelling a story or hit a dead end in their research.</p><p>She may be a Christmas-hating scrooge who despises healthy expressions of emotion, but Agatha is smart. </p><p>With every breath she takes, she reassures herself that she <em> will </em> figure it out. She has never met a mystery she couldn’t solve and this one will be no different. She will survive, once again, despite all the odds stacked against her. </p><p>In spite of them, actually.</p><p>Agatha could almost laugh at the insanity of it all, if she wasn’t fighting to draw breath. She’s a history professor who metaphorically <em>digs up graves </em>and resurrects the dead, being forced to research and investigate her <em>own </em>dead family member; her own ghosts.</p><p>It’s ironic.</p><p>When she feels confident in her body’s ability to <em> not panic</em>, Agatha gradually opens her eyes. She first notices her hand, smeared lightly with blood from the paper cut she had acquired during her crazed searching. She hopes there are some bandaids in the bathroom downstairs (if she ever goes downstairs again). </p><p>Knowing her mother, she wouldn’t be surprised if they were made of some fancy material like linen or silk.</p><p>Just the thought of her mother sends Agatha’s mind spinning again, and she’s suddenly tempted to crawl out the window and flee into the night. She imagines herself donning a hooded black cloak, pulling it low over her face and slinking down the side of the building like a snake. </p><p>The plan is inherently flawed, she realizes, considering it’s the middle of the afternoon and not completely dark outside yet.</p><p>It’s also quite cold, the temperature dipping lower with each hour. </p><p>Definitely not ideal conditions for an unseen escape. </p><p>Finally lifting her head, Agatha winces as bright light hits her sore eyes. Sunlight streams in through the sheer curtains, reflecting off the mirror in the corner and illuminating the familiar purple tones adorning the room.</p><p>
<em> The room is still purple. </em>
</p><p>Agatha groans, dropping her head back into her hands. She isn’t sure she can deal with another emotional revelation today.</p><p>As much as she wants to flee, though, the facts seemed to discourage her plan. Her bedroom is on the second story and scaling the side of her childhood home is not a challenge she’s currently equipped to face. </p><p>Perhaps another day. </p><p>Agatha smirks at her own thoughts, some humor finally seeping back into her mind. She rubs a hand over her face and rolls her shoulders back, trying to alleviate some of the tension there. Her back still hurts from her earlier cleaning. She briefly wishes she was back in her apartment with her expensive wine and giant bathtub. </p><p>Hand tightly gripping the wooden frame of her old bed, Agatha stands on shaky legs. </p><p>Her childhood bedroom looks almost exactly the same as it had nearly thirty years ago, with the addition of quite a lot of dust. It’s like a crime scene or memorial, eerily preserved. </p><p>Agatha turns her back on it, on the volatile emotional grenade that is her childhood. She’ll pull the pin another time.</p><p>She slides the lock out of place and pushes the familiar wooden door open. She takes a couple steps forward. Before she even crosses the threshold into the hallway, whispered words float to meet her ears. </p><p>They are easily audible in the otherwise silent house. </p><p>“I know, Jen. I know.” The speaker is basically crooning, tone soft and low. The words are coming from somewhere under the staircase, just below Agatha’s unsteady feet. Likely the living room. </p><p>
<em> That voice. </em>
</p><p>Those gentle words, spoken with such care and reverence, are painfully familiar.</p><p>Agatha gasps.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is seventeen years old, cheeks full and hair bouncing at her shoulders, wavy and wild. She hasn’t yet mastered the art of taming it, despite her mother’s constant criticism. She sits on her dark purple bedspread, tracing the tiny embroidered flowers there with her finger. </p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver sits cross-legged next to her, eyes narrowed and hair swaying at her chin.  </p><p>Agatha cut it for her a few days ago, hands trembling as she drew dull scissors across long black strands. They did it before Evanora got home for the afternoon, giggly and excited and nervous. Agatha was terrified she would mess it up, but Alice trusted her.</p><p>Alice always trusts her. </p><p>
<em> Well, most of the time. </em>
</p><p>Her next goal is fiery red streaks.</p><p>Jen, who lives just a few doors down the street, is Agatha’s best friend. They grew up together and now spend their days annoying one another, bantering and playing brutal pranks. Jen is Agatha’s right hand, her natural second. If Agatha needed to hide a body, she would call Jen.</p><p>They gravitate to one another like planets in the same orbit, occasionally crashing together and sticking. At times, they seem to meld into the same person. Their words are synced, their tastes are the same, sometimes they even swap clothes or match outfits to confuse the boys at school.</p><p>Alice is different.</p><p>She understands Agatha’s feelings in a way her best friend doesn’t—can’t. Jen has wonderful parents, caring and kind. They bake her sugar cookies and tuck her in at night, telling elaborate stories of dragons and wyverns until she falls asleep. Agatha knows this because Jen used to tell her the stories, too. </p><p>Alice’s mother isn’t like Jen’s, not bright and comforting. Instead, she’s secretive and quiet. She often spends days hidden away in her room, humming and singing. She records music late into the night, slaving away in the studio while her daughter sits alone in an empty house. When Alice gets too lonely, when she can’t bear the silence, she calls Agatha. </p><p>Agatha always seems to know exactly what she’s feeling and how to cheer her up because she feels the loneliness, too. It’s not something Jen can fathom, being unsure which step will set off explosives in her home, but it’s not her fault. Agatha envies her if anything. </p><p>Alice and Agatha are each other's lighthouse in the dark. They are anchors through a heartbreak only the two of them seem to understand.</p><p>Alice is strong, too; stronger than anyone else Agatha knows, both physically and emotionally. She defends her friends with a dedication that shocks even the adults around her. She has a way with the truth, her brutally honest words cutting sharper than knives ever could. Agatha is sure she could convince anyone of anything if she tried hard enough. </p><p>Agatha imagines her, decades in the future, coaxing weapons from the hands of criminals. She sees her friend, one day, talking desperate teenagers off ledges and out of dangerous decisions.</p><p>Just like she’s trying to do now.</p><p>“Please don’t do this,” Alice cries, that brutal honesty she so often speaks slicing through Agatha’s heart. Her hands are tight around Agatha, her eyes wide and desperate. She speaks low and carefully, not wanting Evanora to hear from downstairs as she begs Agatha to stay in Salem. She reasons and pleads, tears gathering in her eyes. </p><p>Agatha rarely sees her cry, the image sparking panic inside of her. Alice is always stoic, always the defender. Even in elementary school, Alice had yelled and kicked at the boys that pulled Agatha’s unruly hair.</p><p>“If you leave, I can’t protect you or keep you safe”—Alice blinks rapidly—“I can’t do anything.”</p><p>“I can’t survive this place.” Agatha takes a deep breath. “You know that. It’ll eat me alive.” </p><p>She shakes her head despite the ache in her chest. She hates doing this to Alice, but the words slip from her tongue with ease. It’s a practiced speech, one she has rehearsed in her bathroom mirror dozens of times. “We can leave together,” Agatha adds hopefully, already knowing what her friend’s answer will be.</p><p>Alice shakes her head, lip trembling.</p><p>“I’ve already told you, Agatha. I can’t leave.”</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha stands then, hands falling to her sides. Her tone is sharp, tongue slicing in a way it usually doesn’t with Alice. She’s exhausted. They have the same fight every couple days. Alice’s desperation seems to increase as her friend’s birthday draws closer.</p><p>Agatha hates it. She despises that she is torn between one of her closest friends and her <em> need </em> to leave. She knows, beyond a doubt, that the moment she turns eighteen she will bolt. She’ll run and never look back but <em> Alice</em>, the person who seems to understand her most in the entire world, refuses to leave.</p><p>Agatha can't understand why and Alice won’t tell. </p><p>Her lips pressed tightly together, she shakes her head slowly. It’s the only secret the duo hasn’t shared: whatever horrible, awful thing is keeping Agatha’s friend tied to Salem.</p><p>“Fine, then.” Alice’s words are distant but her voice cracks on the last syllable, giving away just how desperately she is trying <em> not </em>to care. She fiddles with Agatha’s bedspread, running her hands over the flowers. </p><p>Agatha knows she’s just trying to spare herself the pain of losing her friend, something she can, painfully, relate to. That makes it hurt even more. </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha echoes, her voice barely audible. They sit there, together, their breathing synced, for several minutes. Agatha’s eyes drift across her room. Her friends’ touches are on every inch of it. A photo of the three of them at a sleepover hangs directly above her bed. </p><p>They’re all grinning, features covered in a dark green face mask that Jen had promised would make their skin glow<em>. </em>Similar photos adorn all of the walls, hanging above countless plants and posters. Agatha knows that missing things, missing her friends, will make leaving even more painful but she can’t help it. They mean too much to her.</p><p>“Just promise me something,” Alice finally grinds out, breaking the unsteady silence. She speaks the words like she’s forcing herself to say something she dreads, as if uttering the syllables physically pains her. Agatha blinks up at her, willing to do anything for her friend. </p><p>
<em> Except stay. </em>
</p><p>“One day”—Alice takes a breath, her eyes slipping closed as if she can’t bear to look into Agatha’s eyes—<em> ”come back.”  </em></p><p>The words are laced with a feeling deeper than hope, something more like conviction. It’s as if Alice believes she can simply speak them into reality, that they <em> will </em>come true because she wills it so. Agatha reaches for her friend’s hand, squeezing just above her wrist. She doesn’t respond with words, certain that returning to Salem is a promise she can’t make. </p><p>Alice’s pulse jumps under her fingers, strong and resilient. </p><p>Then Agatha lets her go, clamping a hand over her mouth to hide her sobs as the door of her bedroom clicks shut.</p><p>It’s the last time she sees her.</p><hr/><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, stairs creaking under her feet. The speaking below her suddenly ceases, the house falling silent once again. She turns the corner at the bottom of the staircase, head spinning at what she sees.</p><p>Alice, for the first time in <em> years</em>. </p><p>Alice, who has haunted her dreams for <em> decades</em>.</p><p>“Hey.” Her voice is so much deeper than it had been when they were children, hair falling in waves around her shoulders. Red streaks twirl through it and Agatha’s breath hitches in her throat at the sight; at seventeen-year-old Alice’s dream finally made a reality. </p><p>Alice’s confidence is palpable, radiating through the room. There is a leather jacket pulled tight around her broad shoulders, with a rainbow pin tacked on the left side. Even through her shock, Agatha smirks at that.</p><p>Jen is standing right next to her. She still looks like a goddess encapsulated in a Renaissance painting even after being hit with countless flying books. Agatha winces when she remembers that particular detail. She should probably apologize at some point.</p><p>Their hands are intertwined and they stare wide-eyed at Agatha; their lost childhood best friend, the third member of their formally tight-knit trio. The three of them were inseparable at one point, trusting one another with their secrets and their lives. </p><p>Their friendships are the closest thing to family Agatha has ever known. Her actual mother certainly didn’t radiate familial warmth.</p><p>Alice steps forward, her fingers falling away from Jen’s. She reaches for her former friend, the broken daughter of Evanora Harkness. Agatha steps forward, too, her feet moving of their own accord. She briefly wonders if Alice will slap her too, but it’s not a serious thought. It’s comedic and ridiculous.</p><p>Alice, her breath coming in shocked gasps, wraps her hands around Agatha’s the same way she did on that horrible night—the night when everything fell apart. </p><p>Agatha glances down when cold metal grazes her hand. </p><p>The only difference, decades later, is the silver band wrapping around Alice’s fourth finger.</p><p>“You came back,” Alice whispers, pulling Agatha’s attention back to her eyes. She squeezes her hands hard, her strong grip soothing some of Agatha’s inner turmoil. Jen’s eyebrows furrow in Agatha’s peripheral vision at the vague but clearly emotional statement. She doesn’t seem to understand, but Agatha does. </p><p>She nods.</p><p>“You knew I would,” she replies, voice still disbelieving. Before Agatha can say anything else, make a quip at Alice’s now fiery red hair or what appears to be a wedding ring on her finger, arms are around her. Alice is strong and sure and so different from the past—so different from the unsure young girl who pleaded with Agatha to stay.</p><p>In that moment, Agatha is certain that not even an army could pull Alice away.</p><p>“We’ll figure it out,” she whispers into Agatha’s hair. Her words are full of certainty that Agatha does not feel or understand herself but somehow, miraculously, thirty years later, still trusts.</p><p>The press of arms against Agatha’s back silences some of the screaming inside of her, some of the roaring pain. She squeezes her eyes shut and fights against the stinging there, the tears that threaten to mark her skin and clog her throat.</p><p>She <em> can’t. </em></p><p>When Agatha is unable to take the softness anymore<em>, </em>the gentle words of comfort that Alice is whispering in her ear, she finally pulls away. She presses gently against Alice’s arms, her cheeks hot with embarrassment. Jen ignores her blushing and flustering, stepping up to join their huddle. Her hands are on her hips as she looks Agatha up and down, eyes hovering for a moment on her blood-stained palm.</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt, but we have stuff to do,” she says, a finger dancing between the two of them, and Agatha snorts. </p><p>Alice laughs, her eyes glittering as she smiles over at Jen. </p><p>It seems to Agatha that no matter how much time passes, some things never change. Jen’s down-to-business attitude is one of them. Even when they were teenagers, she kept them on schedule.</p><p>The three of them move to the dining room table. Alice quickly disappears into the kitchen and Agatha hears the sounds of the microwave door opening and closing. The hum of the appliance fills the room and Agatha pointedly avoids Jen’s gaze, rubbing at the chipped wood of the table with her finger instead.</p><p>After the microwave timer goes off, Alice returns with three steaming mugs of hot chocolate. Agatha isn’t sure where she even got the mix from; she didn’t notice any in the pantry earlier. Maybe Alice keeps some stored in her backpack—an emergency stash. Agatha wouldn’t be shocked if that was the case.</p><p>When Alice presses a mug into Agatha’s hands, the amount of whipped cream swirling at the top makes her roll her eyes. Alice has even added tiny candy cane sprinkles, their bright colors bleeding into the white cream. Agatha also notices, eyes finally flitting across the room, that her suitcase is upright again. Her clothes are gone from the tile floor and her marked papers are now neatly stacked on the kitchen island. </p><p>“Thanks for that,” Agatha murmurs against the rim of her mug. She hopes that Jen won’t even hear her, hopes she won’t take too much joy in receiving Agatha’s rare thanks.</p><p>“What was that?” Jen whispers back dramatically, a smirk dancing on her lips. She cups her hands around her ear and turns it towards Agatha. Agatha doesn’t dignify her with an answer, seriously contemplating sticking her tongue out at her. That feels a little too childish, though.</p><p>Pressing the mug to her lips again, Agatha finds that the warmth makes the presence of her two old friends much more tolerable than she imagined. Or maybe she had just forgotten how much she really liked them. It’s a strange feeling. </p><p>Liking people isn’t something she does often.</p><p>“Jen called me”—Alice starts, taking a seat, and Agatha fights the urge to roll her eyes again at the obvious statement—”to ask about Evanora.”</p><p>Agatha’s head jerks up, eyes no longer studying the horribly festive sprinkles in her mug.</p><p>“Why would you know anything?” Agatha feigns confusion but she has her suspicions. It's the reason she didn’t call the police after spotting <em> that woman </em>outside.</p><p>Alice reaches to her side, just as Agatha expected she would, and unclips a badge from her belt.</p><p>“You always said I should fight people for a living, right Agatha?” Alice waves her badge in the air with a smirk. The words <em> Salem Police Department are </em>printed against dark blue. Jen smiles brilliantly.</p><p>“Is that why you’re so good at slapping people, Jen?” Agatha’s eyes move to the other woman at the table, hands still curled around a mug, and she can’t help but smirk at what she’s going to say next. “Married to an officer?”</p><p>Jen’s mouth falls open, a comical expression flitting across her face. Agatha wishes she had a camera to preserve it forever. It’s hard to outsmart Jennifer Kale. She turns, playfully shoving Alice’s arm. Alice groans when she makes contact, grabbing her shoulder dramatically.</p><p>“I told you she would figure it out!” Jen yells, earrings swinging as she shakes her head. </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes at Jen’s left hand and spots one ring that looks much nicer than the rest, a diamond erupting from the center. It’s bordered by two light pink stones, a simpler gold band resting just below it. Agatha didn’t notice them before, the golden metals and bright gemstones blending in with the rest of Jen’s jewelry, but it seems shockingly obvious now.</p><p>“Of course I figured it out, Jen”—Agatha smirks—“Nearly thirty years later and you’re still utterly obvious. Maybe take your wedding rings off next time.” </p><p>Jen shoots a glare in Agatha’s direction and she stares right back, familiar fire dancing on her lips. When they were teenagers, Agatha and Jen had some incredibly loud arguments, both reveling in quick comebacks and snarky insults. Their friendship always bounced back from it, though, even stronger than before.</p><p>To them, arguing was a twisted love language of sorts.</p><p>Alice rolls her eyes dramatically and holds her hands up between them, like she’s separating two teenage boys about to descend into a fistfight. Agatha supposes she has experience with that.</p><p>“Guys!” Her voice is sharp, but Agatha sees the smirk dancing on her lips.</p><p>“I see Jen’s rubbed off on you, too, Alice. Guess it goes both ways,” Agatha shoots in her direction. </p><p>Alice ignores her, pulling a manila folder out of the backpack at her feet. As a teenager, she never joined in during her friends’ verbal sparring matches, preferring to roll her eyes and groan at their immaturity. Alice was always the referee.</p><p>“When Jen called, I was just finishing up at work. That kid…” Alice trails off, exchanging a knowing look with Jen. Agatha wrinkles her nose at the appearance of an inside joke she is <em>not </em>privy to.</p><p>“At the witches museum <em> again</em>?” Jen asks. Alice nods, red-streaked bangs falling low over her eyebrows. The mention of a witch museum piques Agatha’s interest, even though she knows there are several in town. They tend to be tourist hotspots, though, and she has no idea why the police would be needed at one. </p><p>Before she can ask, though, Alice is flipping the folder open.</p><p>“After we finished at the museum, I stopped by the clerk’s office and came straight here.” She slides a piece of paper from one of the folders. It’s dark at the edges and creased down the middle, obviously old and previously shoved in a drawer somewhere. Alice spins it around and Agatha’s eyes focus on the bold words printed at the top.</p><p><em> Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Standard Certificate of Death. </em> </p><p>Apparently, Alice knew Agatha would need proof, some solid evidence if she was going to believe this. She was right.</p><p>“How long?” Agatha asks, wondering if she even wants to know.</p><p>“Nearly 10 years,” Alice replies, shaking her head. Agatha traces her finger over the faded date written at the top of the form.</p><p>“We went to her <em> funeral</em>, Agatha.” Jen’s voice is shaky. Alice reaches for her hand.</p><p>“How?” <em> How did she die? </em></p><p>Her two friends look at each other then, eyes full of unspoken words and hidden emotions. Agatha swallows, steadying herself for some awful cause of death. Some unthinkable, devastating revelation. Tonight seems to be the night for them.</p><p>“We’re not sure,” Jen whispers after what feels like an eternity of anticipatory silence. “No one would tell us. They would only speak to a family member and…” </p><p><em> You weren’t here. </em>Agatha hears the unspoken words and they steal the breath from her lungs.</p><p>“It was weirdly hush-hush and the casket was closed. We tried to find out more, but they wouldn’t tell us anything.” Alice clenches her hands together, like she’s recalling the anger of the past. “It was more a memorial, actually, than a funeral but—” she chatters on until Jen taps her hand. </p><p>“I couldn’t find the letter but I swear it was real.” Agatha’s voice is almost pleading, imploring the two women across from her to believe her. “I even called a company here.”</p><p>Alice nods. “We believe you. Why would you make something like this up?” She shoots a sad smile at Agatha. </p><p>“Text me the name and I’ll look into it.” </p><p>For a few moments, the three of them sit in silence, Evanora’s death certificate on the table between them. Agatha is too tired to have another breakdown. She rubs her hands up and down her arms, cursing the freezing house she finds herself in; cursing the entire situation.</p><p>Jen seems to sense Agatha’s need for solitude and stands, dragging Alice up with her. She slides their chairs back under the table. Agatha winces as they scrape across the wooden floor.</p><p>“We’ll come back tomorrow morning,” Jen says, sliding the death certificate back into Alice’s backpack. Agatha briefly wonders how exactly Alice got a hold of it in the first place. Maybe she called in a favor or two.</p><p>“To investigate,” Alice adds, attempting to clip her badge back to her belt. When they were younger, Agatha always suspected Alice might enter law enforcement. It felt like the obvious choice for someone who was always protecting the people around her. “We’ll figure it out. We have to,” she says. </p><p>Agatha walks behind the pair of them to the door, sliding her sock feet against the endlessly dusty floorboards. Her mopping had done little to help.</p><p>She pauses, not quite sure how to say goodbye—she seldom does it. Jen pulls the door open, Alice pressed against her wife’s side with a begrudging expression on her face.</p><p>“Sleep well, Agatha,” Jen says, shooting a small smile at her former best friend over her shoulder. Agatha knows she will absolutely not sleep well. She’ll likely be up all night trying to solve this newest mystery. With what she’s learned in the past couple hours, Agatha is half-convinced she’ll meet her mother’s ghost in the attic. She doesn’t even believe in ghosts, but she’ll be avoiding the dark and untouched top floor of the house anyway. </p><p>Better safe than sorry.</p><p>The sky is dark behind Jen and Alice, stars glittering against the deep blue. Gusts of cold air blow through the open door, extinguishing the fire Agatha worked so hard to start. She groans miserably. It will take her hours to fix it. Unfortunately, her Girl Scout days are long in the past. Alice giggles at her despair and Jen clamps a hand playfully over her mouth. </p><p>When Agatha finally turns her gaze back to the door, something strange occurs to her. She had been too frantic and shocked to consider it earlier but, suddenly, it seems like the most important question she’s had all evening. </p><p>The image of Jen standing in that large doorway again, for the second time in just a few hours, sparks a question in her mind. Her mouth is moving before she can stop it. </p><p>“Hey, Jen?” </p><p>“Yeah?” she replies, turning to face Agatha fully. Alice buries herself deeper in her wool coat and rolls her eyes once again. It’s a familiar sight, reminding Agatha of the many sleepovers they had in childhood, when she and Jen would gossip and laugh long into the night. Alice would jokingly cover her face with her pillow and scream.</p><p>“How did you even know I was here”—she gestures to the house around her and to the road outside, covered in snow—”In Salem?” Jen’s arrival had been too quick to be coincidental.</p><p>“Oh, that”—Jen smirks—“Rio Vidal told me.”</p><hr/><p>Names hold power. </p><p>Agatha knows that more than most. Her last name ties her to a family that despises her, something she tries to escape at every turn. Her first name, ironically, is derived from a Greek word.</p><p><em> Agathos</em>. </p><p>It means <em> good</em>. Agatha remembers the day she discovered the origin of her name, during a brief stint working at the library in college. An upperclassman at the desk needed to check out a book for his Greek history class. When she slid the book over the counter, though, he didn’t just thank her and leave. Instead, his eyes lit up at the sight of her name tag.</p><p>“Hey, your name.” He nodded towards the white rectangle on her chest. </p><p>“What about it?” Agatha had asked, pushing her glasses up to rest on the top of her head. She fixed him with a glare. Apparently, it didn’t work.</p><p>“It means <em> good</em>. Agathos. It’s Greek.” He slid the book off the counter and left, skipping away to study with a group of friends. Agatha watched him go, heart pounding in her chest. She felt sick. She opened a tab on her computer, typing in her name with a gulp. She was so enthralled by what she found that she didn’t notice when another student came up to check out a book. </p><p>Agatha learned something that day: the meaning of a name, the history brought forth at its intonement, is significant. Obviously, Evanora had a very specific type of child in mind when she named her daughter; a very clear picture of who Agatha would be.</p><p>Giving a name to something means defining it—prophesizing what it will become.</p><p>When Jennifer casually utters <em> the </em>name, the identity of her source on Agatha’s recent arrival in Salem, the world ceases spinning for a moment. Aside from her Uber driver, Agatha has only spoken to one other person since arriving in town: the enragingly flirty trespasser, the infuriating woman that still hasn’t left her mind hours after their dramatic encounter.</p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p>The words erupt in Agatha’s brain with the force of fireworks, the syllables crashing together like cymbals. Books she read years ago, in her undergraduate days, seem to fly open in her mind, dragging her back to her days working at the college library. Pages flip and turn until she finds what she’s looking for. </p><p>“River of life,” Agatha whispers, grateful she left her mug at the table. If she was still holding it, it would most certainly be in pieces on the floor by now.</p><p>“What was that?” Jen’s head tilts up from where she was smiling at Alice.</p><p>“Oh, nothing,” Agatha chokes out, waving them off. She’s too distracted to ask for more information, her mouth opening and closing uselessly. The door clangs shut behind her visitors and Agatha distantly hears a car start in the driveway. </p><p>Her mind is elsewhere, though, lost in images of warm eyes and tattooed wrists.</p>

<p>“Damn it.” Agatha grumbles, burying her hands in the soft pockets of her robe. She stands on the front porch of her family’s abandoned house, obnoxiously large sunglasses shielding her eyes from the glare of an entirely white yard.</p><p>
<em> Snow.  </em>
</p><p>She should’ve anticipated this. Salem knew she was back and decided to unleash a snowstorm on its most spiteful occupant. </p><p>Agatha saw it this morning, knew it was there from the moment she opened her eyes and squinted at the window from her uncomfortable position on the lumpy couch. Her mother bought it decades ago, when Agatha was still a teenager, because she thought it had a nice pattern, dark brown and flowery. </p><p>Agatha thinks it’s horrid.</p><p>She had concluded that there was snow outside from her fuzzy observation of the world beyond the window and promptly shut her eyes, pulling one of the blankets over her head and plunging her eyes into darkness once again. Then, she remembered that Alice and Jen were supposed to show up at some point and decided she needed to be semi-presentable for their arrival. </p><p>A cup of coffee later and she was a little more prepared to face the winter wonderland outside the front door. </p><p>Agatha steps back inside, running her hands through her unruly hair and pulling her sunglasses off. The fireplace is still burning low in the center of the room and she sighs at the growing warmth of the house. Perhaps it just needed time to warm up. She settles into one of the armchairs by the fire and draws her computer into her lap. </p><p>Last night, after her former-friends-turned-married-couple left, Agatha did some research. She opens her laptop and clicks into the tabs she was looking at before she gave up, deciding she was too exhausted to keep working. She eventually gave into fitful sleep in the eerie living room, her dreams full of dark lips and teasing eyes. </p><p>Before that, though, Agatha had googled Rio. She can hear Jen’s knowing laughter already, can see the smirk on Alice’s face when Agatha inevitably badgers them with more questions.</p><p>Of <em> course </em>she had googled Rio.</p><p>That was certainly a logical reaction to discovering the name of the person who had so rudely barged onto her property and sat on <em> her </em> bench. Agatha doesn’t even particularly like the bench but it’s the <em> principle </em>of the thing. </p><p>If she happens to feel some strange, unexplained pull towards the obnoxious woman (Rio, she reminds herself), it’s unrelated.</p><p>Agatha clicks on the first tab. An address and phone number dance in front of her eyes and she recalls how she felt late last night, her stomach flipping when she <em> recognized </em>the phone number listed on Rio’s professional but strangely empty Google profile. </p><p>Rio Vidal is the local mortician, the one she called before she left for Salem and demanded information about her deceased mother; the one who didn’t respond to her insistent inquiries. Agatha scrolls past a bright blue link to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Rio has a blurb there, too, a short paragraph about her education and skills. Apparently she moonlights as a coroner—of course she does. Agatha rolls her eyes and looks further, blog posts about local flora and fauna flying past her eyes.</p><p>Rio certainly hadn’t <em> seemed </em>like a mortician when they met in her back garden yesterday, all floral tattoos and ripped jeans. Then again, Agatha isn’t sure she knows what a mortician is even supposed to look like. A vibrant memory featuring a skull ring perched on one of Rio’s fingers jolts into Agatha’s mind and she fights a morbid chuckle. </p><p>Perhaps it was obvious.</p><p>From what Agatha found during her midnight scrolling, Rio didn’t exist on the internet until recently. She started working in Salem a couple years ago and began posting a blog about obscure plants found in the area and then…</p><p>That’s it. </p><p>Agatha shuts her computer with a sigh and drops her head onto the back of the plush chair. Rio’s lack of online presence isn’t weird, but it is annoying. Many individuals don’t have large digital footprints, herself included. </p><p>Agatha actively avoided having an online presence for years, fearful that her mother or some other angry family member would track her down and drag her back to Salem, back to her shattered life. She had done her best to be untraceable but in recent years she had mostly given up her efforts, certain that she was secure in her position and job. Articles began popping up online regarding her most interesting classes and research papers. She started allowing research journals to use her full name, finally claiming her success with pride.</p><p>At that point, with her classes filling up and her name gaining recognition, Agatha was hopeful that not even the wrath of Evanora Harkness could drag her back to Salem. </p><p>Apparently her death could, though.</p><p>Of course, her mother has actually been dead for a decade and Agatha could’ve safely appeared on the internet much sooner. That knowledge makes her unreasonably angry. Agatha sighs, climbing to her feet and sliding her laptop away. She has bigger problems to deal with than her former lack of online presence. She slips into the bathroom, desperate to steer her thoughts <em> away </em>from her dead mother. </p><p>Her robe falls to the ground behind her and she tests the faucet, turning it both ways until warm water rushes over her fingertips. As a kid, she could never remember which direction was for the hot water and which would startle her with freezing cold spray.</p><p>The scalding rivulets bead down her arms and shoulders as she rests her head against the tile. </p><p>Agatha just can’t wrap her head around her. </p><p><em> Rio</em>.</p><p>She knows there are more important things to be thinking about: dead mothers and abandoned homes, but she wants <em> something </em>else, a distraction from the insanity that is now her upturned life. </p><p>She wishes Jen and Alice would hurry up so she could interrogate them about her newest distraction instead of just scrolling for hours through unrelated Google results and dead ends.</p><p>Agatha would call Jen and badger her to drive faster but she no longer has her phone number. She has her self-imposed thirty years of solitude to thank for that. All of her contacts from Salem are gone, lost when she wiped her phone and bought a new one in a different city. She didn’t want to speak to any of them again.</p><p>Well, she <em> did, </em>but she knew staying in contact would make everything harder. Some small part of Agatha, a tiny fragment of her heart that is just now beginning to breathe again, wishes she had done it all differently. </p><p>Maybe if she had, her mother wouldn’t be dead and she wouldn’t be here, alone in an empty house, wondering what a plant-loving mortician does for fun.</p><hr/><p>“Agatha!” Alice’s voice is far too bright and cheery for the weather outside but Agatha is still surprisingly glad to see her. </p><p>She stands on the front steps with a huge smile plastered on her face. She’s bundled in a large coat emblazoned with the Salem Police Department logo. An orange scarf is tight around her neck.</p><p>Agatha spots the snowball in her hand just in time to swing the door back in front of her and dodge. Her stomach growls from her hiding spot and she desperately hopes the duo made breakfast plans. The blueberry muffins she consumed yesterday had been a rare find in the empty Harkness house.</p><p>“Alice! Hurry up!” Jen’s voice travels from the car and Agatha is suddenly grateful for her impatient nature. </p><p>Agatha peeks around the door and Alice holds her gloved hands up in mock surrender.</p><p>She slides into the back seat of Jen’s fancy car and is overwhelmed by long-forgotten memories—a summer full of chaos. Jen’s father taught her to drive as soon as she turned sixteen, but Alice and Agatha weren’t as lucky. </p><p>Evanora said she had better things to do than teach an annoyed and stubborn teenager to navigate and steer, so she hired Agatha a tutor. He was a horrid man from Boston, uptight and rude. Unsurprisingly, Agatha despised him. She imagined Evanora had called in some favor with him because he certainly didn’t seem to enjoy teaching. Alice’s mom, on the other hand, didn’t realize that she even <em> needed </em>to be taught, too caught up in an upcoming album release to think about anything else. </p><p>And so naturally, Jen taught both of them, relaying the knowledge that her parents had passed along. She screamed and laughed maniacally as Agatha swerved down back roads and got lost in the woods. Alice even ran into a ditch once, yelling that they were all going to die as the car rolled to a stop. </p><p>As Alice opens the door and slides into the driver’s seat, Agatha hopes that her skills have improved since then.</p><p>“So, where do we start?” Agatha asks carefully, hands fiddling in her lap. </p><p>“I made a list of people who might know something,” Jen says, and Agatha fights the urge to roll her eyes. Jen always makes a list. “Since we have you with us, a legal relative of Evanora, you can probably find out more than we ever could before.” </p><p>Agatha ignores the unwelcome guilt that settles over her.<em> She wasn’t here. </em>The words jolt through her.</p><p>Alice turns off Agatha’s street, flicking the turn signal with her hand. “I already tried the police station, obviously. They don’t have any record of her death.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Agatha asks quietly, even though she’s pretty sure she knows the answer.</p><p>“I have no idea” Alice grumbles, her fingers tight on the steering wheel. “Most of the time, if someone dies at their home, the police are called, but we have no record of it.”</p><p>“Who pronounced her dead, then?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Someone in the coroner’s office,” Jen replies, and Agatha's stomach drops. She quickly reminds herself that Rio didn’t work in Salem back then, even if she does coronary work now.</p><p>“That’s our first stop,” Alice quips. “I did a little digging and found out that Rio’s predecessor organized Evanora’s memorial. He would’ve processed her body, too.”</p><p>Agatha rests her head against the glass and tries to talk herself out of booking the first flight home.</p><p>“I’m sure she still has the files,” Jen adds.</p><p>“Who is she to you?” Agatha asks, her voice loud. She winces at her tone. Alice peers at her in the rearview mirror, a confused expression on her face.</p><p>“A friend,” Jen replies with a smirk. Agatha squeezes her hands together. Jen always enjoyed this when they were teenagers, riling her best friend up. Particularly when it came to Agatha’s (uneventful) love life. Not that Rio has anything to do with that. It’s not like her strange appearance on Agatha’s lawn, <em> on her bench, </em>has been stuck in her brain since yesterday.</p><p>“I met her through the police department,” Alice offers, when the silence grows tense and heavy. “She does coronary work for us, sometimes. Murder investigations and the like.”</p><p>Agatha supposes that makes sense. It lessens the rapid pounding of her heart, at least. Salem is a small town, after all. Of course they would all know each other.</p><p>“How did she know you were even here, Agatha?” Jen asks. “I mean, usually I don’t question her weird knowledge but this was strange, even for her.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “She was at my <em> house, </em> Jen<em>. </em>Just showed up”—she waves her hands, a bundle of emotions flaring up in her chest—“and sat on my bench.” She crosses her arms across her chest with a huff. </p><p>“Your bench?” Alice inquires, obviously fighting a laugh as her eyes flick to the mirror and take in Agatha’s expression. “Does it have your name inscribed on it or something?”</p><p>Jen draws her hands through the air in front of her. “I can see it now: <em> Property of Agatha Harkness. </em>”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha grumbles. </p><p>“Can we get breakfast?” she asks after a moment, swiftly changing the subject to distract from her flushed cheeks. Jen definitely notices but, thankfully, keeps her mouth shut. </p><p>She totally smirks, though.</p><hr/><p>Eventually, Alice pulls into the parking lot of the funeral home. Agatha drops her head against the back of her seat and wants to scream, instead balling up the green and red paper that had once held her breakfast burrito. </p><p>Thankfully, Alice and Jen had introduced her to a diner she didn’t recognize from her childhood, all wood tones and warm lighting. They had grabbed their food in styrofoam takeout boxes, eager to get to Rio’s office. The owner, a charming lady in a Christmas sweater named Sharon, had shoved peppermint milkshakes into their waiting hands as well.</p><p>“Best thing on the menu, a tiny slice of joy.” She had assured them when three questioning looks were directed at her. Agatha briefly wondered if it was insane to drink a milkshake in December. </p><p>“Every day has joy in it, if you know where to look.” Sharon had also said, winking in the trio's direction as they rushed back to the car. Alice and Jen thanked her with familiar smiles.</p><p>Agatha had scarfed down her food despite the uneasy churning of her stomach. She had rolled her eyes at it at first but milkshake is good; she can’t deny it. The bright flavors burst across her tongue and she silently thanks Sharon. </p><p>She still isn’t sure about the joy thing, though. Agatha has a hard enough time finding the joy on a normal day, one that’s not spent searching her haunted hometown for scraps of information regarding her mother’s strange and mysterious death. </p><p>Plus, she really doesn’t want to be <em> here</em>—not with her.</p><p>Rio. </p><p>Agatha spots her through the window before Alice even pushes the front door open. She downs the last of her milkshake, tossing the Christmas-themed cup in the trash with perhaps more force than necessary and steals another glance in the window. </p><p>Rio’s hair is pulled up, tight around her ears. A few strands of dark hair have fallen loose and now frame her face. Her brow is furrowed, like she’s concentrating on something. </p><p>The scene is a stark contrast from their first meeting and it has Agatha reeling. Rio looks so <em> normal, </em>like an average person doing their job in an average office. This Rio looks like she hadn’t burst into Agatha’s life—and property—and proceeded to help turn her life upside down.</p><p>She’s dressed differently, too. Her long sleeves and ripped jeans have been swapped for black scrubs, except, when Agatha squints a little she notices something that the scrubs aren’t black.</p><p>They’re green, impossibly dark green.</p><p>To make matters even worse for Agatha’s blood pressure, Rio’s arms are on display. The long sleeve shirt she has on underneath her scrubs is pushed up past her elbows. She twirls a pen in her hand and Agatha fights to pull her eyes away from the tattoos that climb up her pale arms, now completely visible as the door flies open in front of her. </p><p>Agatha is awful at keeping plants alive and as a result, she can’t name a single plant or flower dancing across Rio’s wrists in dark ink but suddenly, she wishes to know all of them; to roll their names around in her mouth and trace the fine lines of their leaves. She rips her eyes away.</p><p>The office is devoid of holiday decorations aside from a tiny ceramic Christmas tree perched on the front desk. It looks older than Agatha, the colors faded and dim. The lights still burn bright, though, their light casting half of Rio’s face in warm hues.</p><p>There’s someone else there, too, who Agatha only notices once she steps fully inside. She thinks he’s a kid for a moment, before she notices his smudged eyeliner and long limbs. He leans back in a chair at the front desk, dressed in similar dark colors to Rio. His ears drip with silver jewelry and a blue notebook is held tight in his hands. </p><p>He continues doodling as the three of them enter, not bothering to look up as he drags his pen sharply against paper. A name tag pinned to his chest reveals his name is Billy. <em> Intern </em>is scribbled underneath in a teenage scrawl that is all too familiar to Agatha. </p><p>She often sees it in her introductory classes. Once, a few years ago, when she still had her students handwrite their essays, an entire class of clueless first years with awful handwriting was enough to make her regret her career choices.</p><p>“Alice!” Rio’s voice fills Agatha’s ears with a rush and her gaze is drawn away from the distracted intern. Rio tosses the clipboard she was holding aside and steps forward. She sounds so friendly and casual, albeit confused at their sudden arrival. </p><p>When Agatha first interacted with her, Rio was teasing and guarded, flirty and mischievous. Now, that’s all missing, replaced with a warm and friendly smile that Rio directs at Alice as she pushes her way inside and moves towards the front counter. </p><p>“What are you doing here? Jen and—“ Rio continues, her voice dying in her throat when her eyes flick to Agatha. </p><p>Rio’s eyes silently consume her; darkness swallowing light without a sound.</p><p>Agatha can’t think of anything to do, anything to say. It seems foolish to offer her hand to a woman who might not know her name but still seems to see right through her. Agatha’s mouth opens but no words come out. She's normally not this bad at flirting, but she’s not quite sure why that would matter because she’s certainly not—</p><p>Then, she feels it again: that pull. </p><p>“I’m Agatha. We’re here to arrest you,” she deadpans before she can stop herself, dropping her name just in case Rio doesn’t know it yet. She moves forward without a second thought, before her brain can catch up and stop her from doing something reckless.</p><p>The teenager in the corner looks up now, his notebook snapping shut, but Agatha barely notices his confused gaze on her.</p><p>“For trespassing on my property,” Agatha finishes in a dramatic whisper. She wishes she had a set of handcuffs to twirl in the air, but she smirks anyway.</p><p>Rio smirks back.</p><p>“Are you now?” Her mood shifts, the blaze that Agatha had been expecting to find in Rio’s eyes returning as quickly as fire catches. Her gaze seems warmer than before, Agatha notices, and then quickly banishes the thought.</p><p>Alice jumps in between them, waving a hand. “No, we’re not here to arrest you, Rio. Besides, Agatha doesn’t have the authority.” Alice shoots a glare in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>“We just have some questions about a case your predecessor caught nearly a decade ago,” Jen finishes for her wife, shooting another glare at Agatha. She rolls her eyes.</p><p>The strange tension quickly diffuses and Agatha lets out a breath she hadn’t known she was holding, a rush of air that Rio seems to notice. Her eyes linger on Agatha for a moment, narrowing slightly before she turns to face Alice and Jen. </p><p>“Who?” Rio asks shortly.</p><p>“Her mom.” Alice points a finger towards Agatha, and Rio’s eyebrows twitch, just a bit, but she doesn’t turn her head. Agatha wouldn’t have noticed if she hadn’t been staring. </p><p>She hates herself just a little, for noticing.</p><p>Rio doesn’t ask any other questions and Agatha reasons that Alice must show up with strange requests like this all the time, acting on secret police business and solving complicated mysteries. Alice waves a hard at the teenager lounging in the corner, Billy, before they can leave the room. </p><p>“Staying out of trouble, kid?” she asks.</p><p>Alice’s words spark something in the back of Agatha’s mind, bits of a whispered conversation floating into her brain, but she’s too preoccupied by Rio to follow the train of thought any further.</p><p>Billy smirks up at Alice, long eyelashes fanning across his cheek.</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>He ducks his head, flipping his notebook open on his lap. Agatha briefly glimpses sharp blue lines, the shapes they form oddly runic and familiar, before turning back to Rio.</p><p>She leads the three of them through the office quietly, stepping down a dark corridor and into a small room. It smells <em> old, </em>not dissimilar to Agatha’s now-abandoned childhood home. Filing cabinets line the walls, handwritten and alphabetized labels plastered above each metal handle.</p><p>“Why so old school, Rio?” Jen asks with a laugh, pointing to one of the peeling labels. Alice leans against the doorframe next to her. She seems unsurprised by the ancient state of the mortuary‘s recordkeeping.</p><p>Agatha runs a finger over one of the labels, pressing her hand against the cold metal and the weathered paper. She fights a smile, casting her gaze around the room. A single lightbulb fizzes and buzzes above their heads.</p><p>The room is stuck decades in the past.</p><p>
<em> Just like Agatha.  </em>
</p><p>Each box is meticulously labeled and Agatha’s heart sings at the recordkeeping, the easy access to years of information. She wants to keep her nerdy pleasure to herself but the words slide out of her mouth as if some barrier—which usually keeps her thoughts inside—has been removed.</p><p>Agatha pretends she doesn’t know why.</p><p>“I get it. There’s comfort in the physical,” She says, moving in front of the cabinet labelled <em> G-H </em> in spidery cursive. She wonders briefly if it’s Rio's handwriting.</p><p>“The physical, huh?” Rio appears next to her and Agatha fights the urge to jump out of her skin at her sudden appearance, even though she <em> knew </em>she was there. Agatha slides the drawer open with a creak. </p><p>“History professor,” Agatha replies quietly, waving a hand towards herself. Agatha’s fingers dance across the organized folders with practiced ease. She flips through them quickly and waits for her mother’s name to appear.</p><p>”Really?” Rio’s eyebrows lift in Agatha’s peripheral vision and she watches her expression change from teasing to curious. “What do you study? Teach?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the way her heart stutters in her chest when she glimpses Evanora’s name just inches away. She opens her mouth to answer Rio but hesitates. She wonders if she even should. Perhaps she should take her folder and leave, slamming the door behind her like she had after their first meeting.</p><p>This time, though, she isn’t in her own yard. She’s standing inside a dark mortuary office, no longer in control. She’s holding a folder labeled <em> Evanora Harkness, </em> desperate for <em> someone </em>in Salem to understand her. Suddenly, Agatha finds that there are worse things than telling Rio, a virtual stranger, more of her personal information. She already has her address, after all. If she was a serial killer, Agatha would probably be dead by now. </p><p>“Witches.”</p><p>She pulls the folder of information out and turns to face Rio, stopping when she sees the expression on her face. She looks surprised. It’s a new look, a new expression that Agatha catalogs and slides into the back of her mind. She slips it into her own mental system of filing cabinets, not unlike the ancient ones around her.</p><p>“You study… witches?” Rio asks, a single dark eyebrow raised.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha slams the cabinet drawer shut with too much force. It rattles the ground under her feet. Rio doesn’t jump.</p><p>“Billy is obsessed with witches.” The statement is so unexpected, so soft and knowing, that Agatha's mouth nearly falls open. </p><p>Silence stretches between the two of them, and Agatha lets her eyes dance to the doorway.  Alice and Jen are noticeably absent.</p><p>When it’s clear Agatha is not going to respond, Rio speaks again.</p><p>“Why?” </p><p>The simple question catches Agatha off guard. She doesn’t think anyone has ever asked her <em> why </em>before. Researchers have flocked to her presentations, have bought her books and endorsed her findings, but no one has ever bothered to inquire at her motivations or wonder why she’s the only professor in their department who researches witches, such an obscure and often discarded part of history.</p><p>“I was born here.” Agatha turns, meeting Rio’s eyes again. She waves her hands around like merely being in Salem is an explanation all on its own. “I left as soon as I could but…” </p><p>Agatha steps close to the sole window in the room and watches the snow fall outside, each fleck home to infinite patterns and repeating crystals. The folder with her mother’s name on it feels heavy in Agatha’s hand but she can’t be bothered to try and stop herself from speaking. Something deep in her chest makes it feel pointless.</p><p>“It always calls me back.”</p><p>The words spill from Agatha’s mouth like a never-ending fountain. Her explanation rushes to fill the space between her and Rio, the two of them standing tensely in the barely-illuminated room, trapped between endless records of death. </p><p>“Have you ever thought that maybe it’s you?” Rio asks from behind Agatha. Her voice is low and cautious but it’s genuine. It’s the only thing that keeps Agatha from running, that hint of sincerity.</p><p>“What?” Agatha shoots back, her tone beginning to sharpen. She doesn’t turn around, though, keeping her eyes firmly planted on the dirty glass in front of her, on the land beyond. The sun burns her eyes and leaves spots in her vision. </p><p>“Maybe it’s you calling out to Salem,” Rio says. “Not the other way around.”</p><p>Agatha exhales. Gasps, really.</p><p>She turns to face Rio then, leaving behind the specks of snow that seem to fall faster the longer she watches them. </p><p>“You think so?” she asks, her voice betraying a rare uncertainty. The wind bangs against the thin wall behind her, demanding to be heard.</p><p>“I think that you wouldn’t be back here unless you wanted to be.” Rio seems certain in this knowledge but Agatha isn’t sure how. They don’t know each other.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Rio speaks again. </p><p>”You don’t seem like the type of person who <em>is</em> <em>called—</em>more like someone who does the calling.” </p><p><em> I came to meet you. </em>Her words from yesterday suddenly seem much more important.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to say something witty, something that will make Rio’s mouth twist and her eyes blaze, but she has nothing. She glances down at the file in her hands, turning it over against her palms. Memories seem hidden in its surface, dancing in the dark shadows of the room and nestled in the quiet breaths of Rio next to her. </p><p>Agatha recalls the day she walked into a lecture on the Salem witches and felt her blood heat up in her veins. </p><p>Is it possible that the tendrils rooting her to the front yard of her childhood home didn’t belong to some foreign entity determined to suck her back in, but to her? </p><p>Something seems to wake up inside of her, something terrifying and freeing. She brushes past Rio and into the hallway, gasping for breath that seems suddenly stolen from her lungs. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Turns out, Alice and Jen had escaped the ancient files, layers of dust, and Agatha and Rio’s strange tension to have a hushed conversation in a room down the hall. Agatha assumes it’s used for meetings and consultations, dimly lit with a wooden table in the center. She casts her eyes up and down the walls, noting the oil paintings of plants and flowers adorning the space. They’re all antique, with yellowed paper and dates going back decades. </p><p>Rio likes plants, Agatha already knows. She also seems to have an affinity for the antique. Agatha may not understand Rio’s fascination with the natural (she famously kills everything lush and living that she touches), but she does understand her appreciation of the old—the often forgotten.</p><p>Billy is sprawled in one of the chairs, his feet draped over the side in a display of effortless teenage athleticism. It makes Agatha think of a younger Alice, who was always vaulting over the backs of couches and kicking her socked feet up on tables. Alice and Jen sit opposite him at the table, their hands twined together.</p><p>Agatha finds the three of them there moments after she leaves Rio. Her heart is still thudding dramatically in her chest, Rio’s words reverberating painfully in her skull. She extends a hand to Billy without giving much thought to it, but something changes in his body, in his expression, the moment he sees her. </p><p>He jumps from his relaxed position and shakes her hand with far too much enthusiasm for the way she feels on the inside, like a fire has just started burning in her chest. </p><p>“I’m Billy!” he chirps. “Sorry I didn’t introduce myself earlier. I didn't realize you were, well, you.” Agatha doesn’t understand what he’s rambling about but she writes it off as nothing and moves on. She’s never quite understood teenagers, not even when she <em> was </em> one.</p><p>“Agatha.” She offers her name up as well, already tired of introducing herself even though she’s only done it twice today. </p><p>“I know. Jen and Alice told me all about you,” Billy nods. </p><p>“Did they?” Agatha raises an eyebrow in their direction, tossing the folder into the center of the table. “Found it.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes light up and she reaches out to grab it, but as Agatha sinks into the chair at the head of the table, she has a sneaking suspicion they won’t be finding much in the suspiciously thin file.</p><p>“Rio!” Jen snaps after a few tense moments of silence. Her voice is loud from where she’s peering over Alice’s shoulder. It carries down the hallway, certainly reaching Rio.</p><p>
<em> Speak of the devil.  </em>
</p><p>She appears in the doorway and Agatha steals the folder away from her friends to avoid looking at her. She scans the little information available there. Her breath catches as she notices the exact date of Evanora’s death, the forever immortalized moment in which she ceased to exist. The date isn’t familiar to Agatha; why would it be? </p><p>She didn’t feel a great pain in her chest or experience the painful severing of a once-cherished bond. She probably spent hours immersed in a book or reading essays that day, completely unaware that her mother was dying.</p><p>“Did she have an autopsy?” Jen asks, her voice sharp.</p><p>Rio settles into the chair next to Agatha, much to her dismay, and pushes right into her personal space. She tucks her legs up underneath her and leans over the pages, sliding her finger down lines of text.</p><p>Agatha tries to ignore their closeness, dragging her index finger over the bold letters of her mother’s name instead—in Latin it means <em> light giver. </em> Agatha thinks that this is painfully ironic.</p><p>Rio leans closer.</p><p>“No.” Rio shakes her head. “I mean, the mortician wouldn’t have done one anyway, that’s the coroner’s job, but it would still be indicated on the report here.” She slides her finger over an unchecked box and taps twice. </p><p>“Why not? Why didn’t she have one?” Agatha whispers, her voice tight. </p><p>“If there was nothing to indicate foul play and no family to push for one, they probably just didn’t do it.” Rio shakes her head and Alice’s face gets redder, her fists curling tighter on the table. </p><p>“Why was the casket closed, then? At the memorial?” Alice eventually asks, just as Agatha flips the final page of notes over and finds a few more lines of scribbled information.</p><p>Her eyes flick over them and her stomach churns uncomfortably. </p><p>“Strange, unexplainable discoloration on the body,” she reads aloud even as her voice threatens to crack and shatter. “No family present, community advised to proceed with no viewing.”</p><p>
<em> No family present.  </em>
</p><p>The words are another nail in Agatha’s coffin. They push her further underground, deeper into soil saturated with guilt and pain.</p><p>“What does that even <em> mean?” </em> Billy asks suddenly and Agatha’s head shoots up. She had nearly forgotten he was there. “Unexplainable discoloration?”</p><p>“Billy,” Rio says almost placatingly. “Note-taking wasn’t as rigorous or detailed as it is now and my predecessor wasn’t exactly the most meticulous.” Rio’s tone, that of a mentor imparting useful wisdom, makes Agatha want to scream.</p><p>She wonders briefly why her mother’s file has to be the subject of Rio’s depressing teaching moment. She wonders morbidly if Billy, who seems to be some sort of mortician-in-training, will learn from this; from her mother’s cold case. The despair of it all feels astoundingly similar to that of the endless dead ends Agatha and her students often face in their research of long-forgotten individuals. </p><p>They sometimes encounter dozens of obstacles before finally landing on something concrete, something they can build upon. Typically, Agatha can handle it; she can face the disappointment head on and channel it into something useful, like determination.</p><p>Now though, she doesn’t feel that way at all. Perhaps because it’s not just a mysterious historical figure she’s investigating but her own mother. Perhaps it’s the Salem air around her, thick with old memories and crushed dreams.</p><p>”That’s it?” she asks, a roaring anger starting up behind her eyes. It dances at the edges of her mind, just waiting to be let in. She shoves her chair backwards so she can stand, flipping through the pages again. The edges are frayed with age and dipped in a thin layer of dust. Rio’s warmth next to her disappears in a rush.</p><p>Her mother’s cause of death, listed as simply natural causes, makes Agatha feel sick. She barely notices as Alice points Billy out of the room with a shake of her head. He quietly slips out, eyes wide and curious.</p><p>“Where is the mortician? The one who wrote this?” Agatha lifts the folder and turns to Rio, her eyes blazing.</p><p>“He’s dead.” The words leave Rio’s lips quickly and easily, like she hadn’t considered they would be devastating to Agatha’s ears.</p><p>They are.</p><p>Agatha slumps back in her chair, the roaring in her head fighting to absorb any coherent thought. She knows logically that this isn’t the end, that there are more leads to follow and stones to turn over, but she feels suddenly, absurdly, like the world is ending. </p><p>She blames Salem, the place she grew up. </p><p>She blames Alice and Jen, the closest friends she has ever known. </p><p>She even blames Evanora, her own (dead) mother. </p><p>Anything to keep from blaming herself.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” Rio’s voice is low enough that Jen and Alice don’t notice, too preoccupied rereading the report and debating their next steps. They are as devastated by this lack of information as Rio—presumably because they gave up hope long ago.</p><p>“Look at me.” Rio speaks and Agatha’s eyes fly open. She is commanded by her and it is glorious; to give up control, to defer to someone else for the first time in her life. Agatha thinks, briefly and dangerously, that she would do anything Rio asked her to. The roaring anger in her mind quiets a bit.</p><p>
<em> Distraction. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s ringless hand hovers just inches from her arm, like she yearns to touch but thinks better of it. Agatha wonders if her touch would set them both afire, consuming and burning and <em> ending</em>. The snow outside would melt away like a mere annoyance<em>. </em> The thought is not as terrifying as it should be.</p><p>It certainly feels like Rio could do something like that with her hands, something grand and unfathomable. Agatha wonders if their slight collision would burn the building down—the entire town.</p><p>Rio tilts her head, a smirk dancing on her lips and Agatha only briefly thinks that it’s absurd, to be smirking in a situation like this, to be wondering about Rio’s electric touch as she gazes at the record of her mother’s death, but then Alice stands abruptly. </p><p>She slams her palms against the wooden table.</p><p>“We’re not done just yet.” </p><p>Jen nods, Rio withdraws her hand, and Agatha sighs.</p><hr/><p>The three of them do eventually leave Rio’s small office, the mortician not-so-subtly kicking them out because <em> she has work to do</em>. It’s not like their visit was much help, anyway. Regardless, Alice had pulled her phone out and scanned the mortician’s report quickly before they left, ensuring they had a copy if they needed it. </p><p>“We should talk to Lilia,” Jen says, her heels clicking against the pavement. “She’s the next person on my list.” </p><p>“Lunch first?” Alice asks, her eyes going comically wide. Agatha nearly laughs at the sight. Jen just nods indulgently and climbs into the driver’s seat.</p><p>Agatha turns, watching Rio shake the hand of an older man, his eyes red and his face splotchy. She gently pats his arm and leads him down the hallway, her eyes briefly flicking up to meet Agatha’s through the window, apologetic and searching. She can’t even bring herself to be mad at Rio. It’s not her fault the person who worked here before her kept awful notes and then died.</p><p>“Who is Lilia?” Agatha asks, when her brain finally moves on from Rio. Her form disappears down the dark hallway and Agatha reluctantly pulls the car door open, dragging herself away from Rio’s magnetic pull.</p><p>“She runs a business across town. She’s sort of a multitalented psychic: palm readings, tarot, fortune telling, that kind of stuff. She’s very popular with the tourists.” Alice supplies, a grimace crossing her face when she speaks the last part. Agatha isn’t surprised by it. </p><p>Growing up in Salem, particularly during the fall months, the three of them often felt like unwilling participants in an insatiable circus. They were ogled at and photographed by crowds of tourists who wondered if they were secretly witches, seconds away from cursing everyone in a ten mile radius. Agatha sometimes wished she could have. </p><p>“Did Evanora know her?” Agatha asks, wondering why her mother would associate with a tourist-loving psychic.</p><p>“Neither of us really spoke to your mother after you left, but we did see her at Lilia’s from time to time,” Jen says. </p><p>“Maybe she was having a reading done,” Alice adds with a snort.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. The image of her mother, never one to believe in fate or destiny, having her palm read sparks a bubble of laughter in her chest. It seems extremely out of character but, then again, Evanora had lived for many years after Agatha left—perhaps she changed. The idea is an insane one.</p><p>“Lilia is great,” Jen says fondly. “She’s one of my best customers.” She smiles brightly, perfectly white teeth contrasting against flawless warm skin.</p><p>Agatha knows from a quick internet search she did upon her arrival in Salem that Jen pursued the natural skincare business she’d always dreamed of as a teenager. Decades ago, Alice and Agatha were her test subjects for new—and certainly flawed—products. Once, Alice’s skin had been accidentally dyed purple for a week after Jen’s newest ingredient proved <em> too </em>pigmented.</p><p>“She helped the police out with a case once, a criminal who confessed everything to her under the guise of a fortune telling. She had just moved here and didn’t know anyone. We’ve been friends ever since,” Alice says with a soft smile.</p><p>“She’s like your pseudo-mom,” Jen adds with a chuckle. “She’s even done tarot readings for the both of us.”</p><p>“She predicted our wedding before we even started dating!” Alice smiles over at Jen and Agatha’s heart twists in her chest. </p><p>She feels like she’s stepped into something that she no longer has any claim to. Salem may have belonged to her once, when she was young and as joyful as anyone could expect her to be, but it no longer does. Alice and Jen have moved on, contact with each other and their new friends. They’re <em> happy</em>, which is more than Agatha can say for where she ended up. For a moment, she allows herself the freedom to imagine what could have been. </p><p>In another world, in an alternate timeline, she would have met Rio the moment she moved to Salem. They would’ve danced around each other for weeks or months, teasing and flirting and eventually crashing together. </p><p>She would have met Lilia and Billy, learning to love the fortune teller and the strange kid that interns with Rio. She would have become familiar with Jen’s endless facial serums and stood at the front of the venue during her two best friends’ wedding, maid of honor for whichever friend claimed her first.</p><p>She would have been here for her mother’s funeral, to investigate her death and lay her to rest, even if Evanora didn’t quite deserve it.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, pushing the depressing thoughts away as they arrive at a brick building. White letters above the door advertise its name as <em> Witchside Tavern. </em>Agatha rolls her eyes and Alice sticks her tongue out in response.</p><p>“Trust us, Agatha. It’s good.” Jen says, ending the fight before it can begin. </p><p>Agatha, as much as she would like to disagree, can’t. The food is quite good, despite the overdone and obviously witchy references. The place is warm and cozy and Agatha finds herself charmed and a bit more at ease than she was earlier.</p><p>Nearly an hour later and their trio has resumed their mission. Turns out, Lilia’s business is in an old strip mall. Between a nail salon and pool supply store, <em> Madame Calderu's Psychic Readings </em>is printed on a bright yellow sign.</p><p>Most of the mall is dull, all brick and neutral tones, but Lilia’s storefront has been painted light blue. Bits of color jump out all across the facade and small plants are stacked up outside. Multicolored garland, made of vibrant paper and fabric, hangs just below the sign. It advertises tarot, palm readings, and a crystal ball.</p><p>One of the older shops, near the end of the strip, catches Agatha’s attention. It’s obviously abandoned, the door boarded shut and one of the windows shattered, but that’s not what catches her eye. Someone has <em> graffitied </em>the side, dark blue lines shaping into elaborate runes and pentagrams.</p><p>The drawings cover nearly the entire wall, a map of looping and interweaving circles and triangles. They’re artfully drawn, precise and practiced. Some of them are familiar to Agatha, but when she tries to chase the threads of memory into the throes of her brain they disappear, dissolving into formless feeling. It’s an odd feeling, like something is trying to push her thoughts in the opposite direction. Agatha fights it.</p><p>“Hey, Alice?” Agatha asks, waiting for her friend to climb out of the car before she points a finger into the distance. “What’s up with that?”</p><p>Alice groans, rubbing a hand down her face. “Probably Billy.” She mumbles something about having to call someone and report the incident. </p><p>“Why is Rio’s intern drawing symbols associated with witchcraft on the side of an abandoned building?” Agatha asks, her years of education pressing into the forefront of her mind.</p><p>“He's been in some trouble”—Jen frowns, a crease appearing between her eyebrows—“since his parents died. Rio offered to mentor him.”</p><p>“He’s a good kid, he’s just having a hard time.” Alice replies sadly, and Agatha wonders briefly, with a huff of laughter, what kind of kid uses witchcraft as a coping mechanism. An annoying voice in the back of her head reminds her that she <em>does </em>in fact study witchcraft for a living.</p><p>Alice pulls the glass door to Madame Calderu’s open and Agatha once again recalls the hushed conversation the couple had at her dining table yesterday. Alice mentioned a call she had to the witches’ museum. Agatha wonders if it’s related; if it was Billy then, too. </p><p>“Alice! Jen!”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t see Lilia until she steps in front of them. She seems to radiate sunlight, her arms reaching out to pull Alice and Jen into a hug at the same time. She smiles brightly at them.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” She inquires. “And who is your friend?” Her gaze turns to Agatha, who lets her eyes drift over the older woman’s outfit. She notes her Sicilian top and the traditional runes sewn there. </p><p>Her necklace is large and ornate, the tarot card for the sun hung around her neck like a golden medallion. Agatha hates that she has any knowledge of tarot but, unfortunately for her, her college roommate had been obsessed.</p><p><em> Success, happiness, radiance</em>, her brain supplies. </p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Agatha introduces herself, extending her hand. If she wants information from Lilia, she may as well <em> try </em>to be civil.</p><p>Lilia does not take her offered hand. </p><p>She stares at Agatha instead. </p><p>Her eyes go briefly unfocused, face flushing red. It makes the hair on the back of Agatha’s neck stand up, stirring a familiar feeling of dangerous premonition deep in her stomach. It is the calm before the storm; the terrifying silence before the Earth shifts and cracks and collapses.</p><p>Suddenly, the quietest sounds around Agatha seem magnified: the buzzing of the lights overheard, Alice’s footsteps as she paces the room, and the chatter of teenagers just outside the glass door. The clock starts ticking rapidly and a tea kettle from somewhere down the hall starts whistling and hissing. </p><p>“The World reversed!” </p><p>Lilia’s words are whispers but they are powerful, her voice harsh and full of unexpected strength. Agatha fights the urge to turn away, to rip her eyes from Lilia’s knowing gaze but she forces herself to stare back, silently challenging her to pull a tarot card from behind her back or grip her palm. </p><p>Agatha isn’t a big fan of fate. She typically refuses to believe that anyone or anything holds that much power over her, but she can still hear the faint echoes of Lilia’s words, as if they’re sinking into the walls around her and the wood beneath her feet. </p><p>The two of them are completely still. Any movement would break whatever strange staring contest Agatha has begun. Alice and Jen watch curiously as the lights in the room begin to flicker and flash—Agatha thinks one of them explodes but she barely notices.</p><p>Then, there’s a sudden rush of freezing air, like the pressure is sucked out of the room and returned. The lights stop flashing and the kettle stops whistling. Lilia’s hand closes around Agatha’s as if mere seconds have passed. Her eyes are again clear and focused, a soft smile returned to her face.</p><p>“I know,” she responds simply, her gold rings cold against Agatha’s skin. She pulls away and Agatha exhales, glancing in Alice’s direction.</p><p>“That’s normal,” Alice answers, shrugging and following Lilia’s already retreating steps down the hallway. Jen places a comforting hand on Agatha’s shoulder. The two of them seem remarkably calm.</p><p>“We told you, she’s multitalented,” Jen says with a chuckle. Agatha, finally beginning to recover from what may have been one of the strangest experiences of her life, scoffs.</p><p>“She just glared at me, that’s all. Nothing else,” Agatha denies, shaking her head. She’ll need more than flickering lights and a whistling kettle to believe Lilia Calderu really saw her future. She isn’t even sure what <em> the World reversed </em>means. She’s never heard of it (if it even exists).</p><p>Agatha follows Jen further into Lilia’s shop, unable to stop her eyes from flickering up and down the walls. There’s a collage of artwork surrounding them in the narrow hallway, ancient paintings of witches, magic, rituals, and sacrifices. They’re all done in vibrant colors and hung in ornate frames. Each one stands out amongst dangling strings of beads and flowy fabric.</p><p>“You believe her?” Agatha gestures to the ornate decor. “You believe that she’s a…psychic?”</p><p>“Why not? There are <em> much </em>weirder things in Salem.” Jen shrugs. Lilia and Alice’s voices get louder as they turn a corner. “Like you,” Jen quips after a moment. She smirks gleefully at Agatha, who punches her arm in response.</p><p>“Hey! I’m not that—” When the hallway finally ends, revealing a bigger room, Agatha abruptly loses her train of thought. </p><p>Suddenly, she understands why people believe it—Lilia’s charade. It’s all very convincing. Her table is covered in crystal balls and stacks of tarot cards. The lighting, all warm and shadowy, casts her face in various hues of orange. Lilia’s large golden jewelry glows and she seems perfectly content when she rests her hands on a crystal ball and glances directly up at Agatha. </p><p>Agatha, never one to back down from a challenge, steps forward. Alice and Jen hang back, settling into two plush chairs in the corner of the room and eyeing Agatha cautiously, like they aren’t sure what she’s going to do. </p><p>“I’m here because—”</p><p>“I know.” Lilia cuts her off quickly, waving her hand. “I know why you’re here.”</p><p>“<em>Great</em>, then we can cut to the chase,” Agatha snaps, doing her best to pretend she isn’t irked by Lilia’s words. She shoves her hands into her pockets and braces herself for more useless information. “Did you know my mother?”</p><p>“I did.” Her words nearly take the wind out of Agatha, squeezing her lungs and heart like a vice. Lilia <em> did </em>know Evanora. </p><p>Alice and Jen were right—but why? What use would Evanora Harkness have for a maybe-psychic? Agatha’s mother didn’t befriend people without reason. She didn’t even speak to anyone who couldn’t be of some use to her, including her own daughter.</p><p>When Agatha glares at her in response, Lilia continues. “Your mother occasionally sought my advice.”</p><p>“What advice could you have possibly given her?” Agatha throws her hands up. “My mother wouldn’t have been caught dead with a psychic!” Her voice rises and rises, her attempt at a calm and unflappable facade obviously fruitless. The hanging glass garlands above her clack together noisily. Together, they make a cacophony of sound.</p><p>Lilia suddenly looks much older, the wrinkles in the corners of her eyes more pronounced. Her shoulders dip and when she looks back up at Agatha there is no malice there—there is something more akin to pity haunting her expression.</p><p>“Perhaps, my dear, you did not know her as well as you thought,” Lilia whispers. Agatha’s mouth drops open with a click. </p><p>She hears Alice stand up, but she never sees what she does. </p><p>She’s already gone.</p><hr/><p>The moment she steps out of Lilia’s shop, the thin glass door nearly shattering with the force of her hand, Agatha knows that she’s being unreasonable. She knows that her anger is misplaced but, miraculously, it rages inside of her anyway.</p><p>She saw a therapist once, right after she left Salem, who said she had problems with transference. As much as she had hated him and his infuriating opinions, she knows he was probably right. She’s angry at her mother for being awful and, quite frankly, for dying, and she’s taking it out on everyone else. That doesn’t make any of it less real, though, or less painful. Agatha digs her heels into the snow outside and sets off down the street.</p><p>Regardless of her own issues, she does think Lilia really <em> is </em>quite infuriating. </p><p>Why couldn’t she just be helpful? Why did she have to imply that Agatha, who lived with Evanora for eighteen years, who bore the brunt of her hatred and her <em> love, </em> didn’t truly know her? Agatha thinks that perhaps she knew her better than anyone. A daughter who knew the real her, the woman who appeared when the doors were locked and the prying eyes of their neighbors were gone.</p><p>Agatha breathes harder, barely noticing the familiar buildings she passes as she walks: the bookstore she used to curl up in on the weekends, the Chinese restaurant where she would pile into a tiny booth with Alice and Jen after school, and the large stone church that her mother dragged her to every Sunday. The sky isn’t dark yet, the sun hovering still above the horizon, and Agatha briefly wishes it would drop lower and plunge everything into darkness. </p><p>She glances up and down the street. The center of Salem is almost eerily quiet, the only noise coming from a few teenagers standing outside a coffee shop. Large takeout cups are clutched in their hands as they laugh and gossip. Agatha also sees a couple pressed together on a bench, their cold hands intertwined. She supposes most people are bundled up indoors, enjoying a weekend inside with their families. </p><p>When Agatha slips past the iron gate, ducking under the large metal chain, she’s reminded of dozens of late nights growing up when she did exactly the same thing. She would sneak back from Jen’s house in the middle of the night, creeping up the stairs to avoid waking her mother. Evanora couldn’t care less where she had been but would certainly yell at her anyway.</p><p>Now, though, Agatha doesn’t have to be careful or quiet or moderated. She lets her feet slam against the driveway, each step sending pieces of her rage into the earth. It takes her a moment to get the key in the lock, her hands shaking from either the cold or anger—Agatha isn’t sure which. She yanks the front door open, letting it slam against the wall as she steps into the house, and then she freezes.</p><p>
<em> Rio.  </em>
</p><p>For a moment, Agatha isn’t sure what to say, but then Rio raises her eyebrows slightly and the words are there as if they always have been, tumbling out to land at her feet. It doesn’t feel like her walls are being lowered or her armor is being pierced, but more like there was never a wall to begin with—like there never has been.</p><p>“She said that I…” Agatha swallows. “That I didn’t know her.” </p><p>Rio nods. It seems like she knows this information already but she doesn’t say anything. She just nods, stepping forward to close the door behind Agatha and slip her coat from her shoulders. Then, she draws Agatha’s hands into her own. </p><p>Agatha feels their warmth spreading from her palms and fingertips up her arms, warming her to her core. The touch sends sparks up Agatha’s entire body, her anger burning away with each rub of Rio’s thumb against her wrist. It cracks something open inside of her, something frozen and jagged and painful. </p><p>“I did,” Agatha says, her lip trembling dangerously. </p><p>She wishes the anger would come back. She misses the violent rage that has kept her upright and determined for so much of her life, is suddenly desperate for it. No one has ever taken it away before, not like this.</p><p>Rio is quiet for a long time, standing still and silent as Agatha’s rage leeches from her slowly and the tears in her eyes are blinked back. It all melts away, unable to exist in the presence of Rio’s gentle touch, of her warm breathing so close to Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I believe you,” she eventually says, once Agatha’s breathing has reduced to gentle puffs instead of great, labored gasps. “That you knew her.”</p><p><em> That </em> is something. Agatha looks up at her, tilting her head just enough so their eyes are level. </p><p>“Did you break in?” She asks suddenly, never withdrawing her hands from Rio’s grasp. She continues to run her fingertips along Agatha’s skin, even though they’re no longer cold.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio smirks, her eyes crinkling in the corners and Agatha nearly gasps at that revelation, at the tiny details of Rio’s face that she can see from this close. “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha laughs then, really laughs. She forgets about the stupid mortician’s report and Lilia’s infuriating words and Alice’s pleading gaze. Her head drops forward, landing on Rio’s shoulder. If anyone ever asks, she will <em> swear </em>it’s an accident.</p><p>It’s not.</p>

<p>Agatha Harkness loves a good distraction. </p><p>She isn’t sure she could’ve survived this long without them, honestly. When she left Salem, the only thing that kept her sane was burying herself in her research, spending hours scouring over niche documents and digging through forgotten archives.</p><p>Every year when the holidays roll around, when Agatha’s old-school calendar tragically flips to December, she continues this pattern. She distracts herself with her students and her work, shutting out the unwelcome world around her.</p><p>She hates and hates and <em> hates</em>, drawing it over herself like a protective shield. Then, she proceeds to distract herself from the subject of her hatred. </p><p>Unfortunately, there’s a problem with distractions: they don’t work forever. Eventually—inevitably—they fall away, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.</p><hr/><p>Agatha wakes slowly. </p><p>Sounds reach her first: the dull humming of the heater that she grew familiar with in childhood and the sharp click of the clock down the hall. She had hated that thing when she was younger, tossing and turning restlessly at night as it ticked away and taunted her.</p><p>Memories of the previous day begin to float back to her, pulling through the fog of sleep. Agatha recalls the failed searching for clues regarding her mothers death, her angry trek through the aftermath of Salem’s most recent snow, and—</p><p>

</p><p>Gradually, Agatha realizes where exactly she is and, more importantly, who she’s with. Her hair is falling over her eyes, her chest pressed against something warm and solid and… <em> breathing? </em></p><p>The memories she’s searching for return to her in a rush, slightly fuzzy and magnified.</p><p>
<em> Rio, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shaking form. Drawing her in and whispering in her ear, pressing warm lips against her temple. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio, guiding her to the couch and shoving a takeout box in her hands, turning on some mindless Christmas movie that Agatha had despised. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio, lips stained with red wine, falling asleep against her side. </em>
</p><p>Agatha cracks her eyes open and comes face to face with the subject of her memories, fast asleep and snoring lightly. Her eyelashes flutter as Agatha exhales. She’s gorgeous. That’s all Agatha can think, all her brain can manage. She fights the urge to lift her hand and trace Rio’s face, run her fingertips along her sharp jaw and soft lips. </p><p>She wonders what they would feel like.</p><p>That would certainly be inappropriate and so Agatha ignores the urge, glancing at the clock on the mantle—it’s nearly nine. She should probably get up, have a shower, and call Alice and Jen. Apologizing for leaving them at Lilia’s would be a nice thing to do, even if Agatha hates the idea of it. An apology to Lilia is likely in order as well, but Agatha hates the idea of that one even more. Apologizing isn’t exactly her forte.</p><p>All of that is nearly impossible, though, because she’s practically on top of Rio. The two of them are twined together on the couch with Agatha’s head planted on Rio’s chest. Agatha briefly contemplates trying to get up, extricating herself from Rio’s warm arms which circle her completely, but it only takes a few seconds for her to give up. </p><p>She resigns herself to her fate and does her best to ignore the sharp panic that burns in her stomach as she comes to that realization. The last calming effects of sleep melt away. Agatha isn’t sure how they ended up like this and the proximity is enough to make her nervous, even though she has no real reason to be.</p><p>The last thing she remembers is watching Rio fall asleep and then turning the movie off. Apparently, she fell asleep too, and the two of them somehow gravitated together in their sleep. Empty wine glasses are balanced on the coffee table along with discarded takeout boxes that Rio had brought with her.</p><p>Agatha didn't ask Rio why she showed up at her house, too pleased with the outcome to question it, but she’s smart enough to know that it was Jen, or Alice, or perhaps both of them. They always looked out for her when they were younger. It seems that even decades later, this hasn’t changed. </p><p>This time, though, it was Rio they sent to coax Agatha away from the darkness. </p><p>Rio, who is currently waking up. Her eyelids flutter softly and then fly open. She seems alarmed for a moment, her body tensing, until she meets Agatha’s gaze and smiles sleepily.</p><p>“Morning,” she murmurs, her voice low and raspy. Agatha bites her lip, waiting for Rio to realize what’s happening and push her away, to reject her proximity.</p><p>She doesn’t. </p><p>Her eyes flicker shut and, if possible, she seems to pull Agatha closer, her hands reaching out to run up and down her back. Agatha <em> shivers, </em>actually trembles at the contact and then immediately wishes she hadn’t, pressing her burning cheeks against Rio’s chest. </p><p>Agatha has been alone for years; she’s used to it. Occasionally, she gives into her coworkers’ lousy attempts at peer pressure and goes on a blind date or two, but she’s never felt anything like this, a need that could burn her from the inside out with its intensity. </p><p>Her ex-girlfriend Wanda is the closest she’s ever gotten to the fairy tale and although Agatha thinks that anyone else would have been content with what they had, she just wasn’t. They met in college, all cautious looks and breathless firsts, and stayed together for years. </p><p>Wanda was comfortable and safe and after a while, Agatha wasn’t in love with her anymore. She honestly isn’t sure if she <em> ever </em>was. Sometimes (oftentimes) the thought keeps her up at night. </p><p>Perhaps she’s just cursed to abandon everyone she loves.</p><p>But Rio is different—she’s full of racing pulses and challenging smirks. She feels like standing at the edge of a cliff and staring at the bottom, like hovering your hand inches from a raging fire. </p><p>Agatha is <em> terrified </em> and Rio is, unhelpfully, doing awful things to her blood pressure.</p><p>“Relax, Agatha.” Rio’s voice is lighter now and Agatha internally curses herself for being so obvious, for letting her anxiety show so clearly. “I’m not gonna stab you.”</p><p>Rio chuckles when she says it, which sends a rush of relief through Agatha’s mind—Rio isn’t freaked out. Agatha forces herself to smile back despite the mention of stabbing. She finds it charming, actually, that Rio knows exactly what to say to soothe her racing mind.</p><p>Agatha Harkness is <em> charmed. </em>Isn’t that something?</p><p>“Do you like plants?” Agatha asks abruptly. She tilts her head up, admiring the wooden paneled ceiling above her and trying desperately to think about perfectly mundane things. </p><p>She would very much like to avoid thinking about how charmed she is by Rio whilst <em> on top </em>of Rio.</p><p>“I do.” Rio smiles brilliantly. Being the subject of that joy, that perfection, makes Agatha’s head spin and she has to abandon her study of the ceiling. “I have a garden.” Her fingers move up Agatha’s back, sliding into her hair unannounced.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha gasps. She rushes to push her thoughts <em> away </em>from Rio’s touch, from the soft movement of her hand as it cards through her hair and the feeling of her legs wrapped around hers. “What kind of… what do you grow?” She stumbles over the words.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to reply, a smirk already ghosting across her lips, but she’s rudely interrupted. Agatha immediately recognizes her ringtone and wants to scream. The ringing is coming from somewhere below the two of them, slightly muffled but still annoying.</p><p>Agatha shoots Rio a grimace and climbs off her gently, goosebumps dancing along her skin at the loss of Rio’s warmth. She practically collapses onto the rug, pressing her stomach against the ground as she sticks her hand out under the couch. Her quick movements blow up a layer of previously undisturbed dust that leaves her, unfortunately, a sneezing mess. She can’t hear much from her position half underneath the couch, but she’s pretty sure Rio is laughing.</p><p>Her fingertips suddenly skim over something hard and thin. Agatha closes her hand around it and pulls her arm back. She blinks a couple times, trying to clear the dust from her vision, and is left staring at an obviously used piece of white chalk. One end is worn down from use, cracked and unevenly shaved. She rolls it between her fingers, soft powder falling on her palm. </p><p>Weird.</p><p>She tosses it up on the table. </p><p>“What is this?” She hears Rio ask, along with the shuffle of movement above her. </p><p>“Chalk,” Agatha replies. She pushes her arm back under the couch, sweeping it out in an arc as her phone ceases its ringing and then restarts anew. Finally, her fingers close around its familiar shape.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha asks, annoyance seeping into her tone as she lifts the phone to her ear. Her knees hurt, her hands are covered in chalk, and she thinks she just inhaled ten years worth of dust. </p><p>“We’re on our way!” Alice’s voice is loud in her ear and Agatha winces.</p><p>Rio laughs from her position on the couch, obviously able to hear Alice through the phone. She rolls the piece of chalk back and forth in her palms. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“We gave you a night to mope,” Jen says, and her voice is quieter than Alice’s, like she’s farther away from the phone. Agatha guesses that she’s in the driver’s seat.</p><p>“Hey, I do not mope!” She shoots back. Rio mouths <em> you totally do </em> with a smirk. Agatha grabs a throw pillow and lobs it at her head. Rio catches it effortlessly and then winks at her. Agatha curses every god she’s ever known and every deity that’s ever been worshipped and <em> Salem </em>itself for throwing her into the orbit of Rio Vidal.</p><p>“You do, but I have a solution. It’s time to inject some holiday cheer into your life!” Alice states, Her voice getting louder and more enthusiastic with every word. “Christmas is in <em> five </em>days and you don’t even have a tree!” </p><p>Agatha gives up on keeping the phone near her ear and holds it out in front of her instead. Alice’s tone is disappointing and appalled, as if Agatha has committed a capital offense by not having a Christmas tree.</p><p>“Alice, I don't <em> need </em>a tree,” Agatha corrects sternly. “I don’t even really celebrate Christmas.” She pinches the bridge of her nose as she contemplates how exactly she’ll get out of this. </p><p>“I can hear you thinking!” Alice yells. When Agatha abruptly drops her hand away from her face Rio begins laughing again, her hand clutched against her chest. Agatha rolls her eyes but secretly, joy blooms in her chest like a forbidden and precious flower. “Stop thinking! You can’t get out of it.”</p><p>“You really can’t,” Jen adds. At least she sounds somewhat sorry for dragging Agatha away from the content bubble of her couch. Alice certainly does not.</p><p>“It could be fun,” Rio whispers, a small smile pulling at the corners of her lips. “I’ve never been to a Christmas tree farm before.” </p><p>Agatha hates Christmas tree farms, naturally. She despises the children that run rampant with their sticky fingers and cups of cider. She’s annoyed by the endless couples that visit, holding hands and walking up and down the rows to find the perfect tree. </p><p>Once, when she was a kid, she got lost in the maze of impossibly tall firs and screamed for what felt like hours until a poor employee discovered her. Her mother was probably off somewhere charming an employee and securing the most picturesque tree in the entire lot.  </p><p>Evanora hadn’t put a lot of stock in the “childish value” of Christmas, presents and joy and miracles, but she did care about making sure their house was the most elaborately decorated one in all of Salem. Agatha is, therefore, <em> not </em>a huge fan of Christmas tree farms, but she finds that Rio’s smile, and the promise of making her smile even more, is enough to make her want to visit one anyways.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha barks, hanging up before she can talk herself out of it. Before the call cuts off, though, she does hear Alice’s overjoyed squeal. She scoffs fondly and flops back down on the couch. “This is going to be a nightmare.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asks. Her tone is completely genuine, like she really wants to know.</p><p>“I’m not really a… big fan of the holidays,” Agatha admits softly, the words difficult to say. She struggles to put her feelings into tangible words, struggles to say that when she goes to a Christmas party or sees the first hints of snow falling outside, she feels thirteen again, unable to please her mother when <em> all </em>she wanted was her love. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t like to think about the holidays, about happy families and ornate trees and snow angels—all of the things she never had. It’s too painful and so she hates it all instead. She wears her hatred much like her anger, armor standing between her and the emotions she most fears.</p><p>“Why not?” Rio asks again, a frown appearing on her lips. It makes Agatha’s heart ache and she wants to fix it but she <em> can’t. </em>There’s nothing to do, nothing that can heal eighteen years worth of scars. Agatha knows she could refuse to answer Rio, could turn away and leave but perhaps that would hurt even worse than this. </p><p>“My mother wasn’t exactly the most festive”—Agatha bites her lip and rubs her palms against her pants—”I don’t have many happy memories of this time of year.” The words are like knives to her heart, each once a lance of sharp grief that burns her eyes and clogs her throat, but she speaks them anyway.</p><p>“We can fix that.” Rio immediately replies. She sounds certain, nodding her head and blinking rapidly as if she’s already coming up with a plan. </p><p>The memories are there without intention, they are breaking through the surface despite Agatha’s insistence they stay buried. Evanora, changing her hair and clothes and teaching her to hate herself all in the name of <em> fixing </em>her.</p><p>“We can—what?” Agatha’s heart skips a beat in her chest.</p><p>“Make happy memories.” Rio clarifies, like it’s the easiest thing in the world. Before Agatha can respond, can do anything aside from open her mouth and gape, Rio jumps off the couch and heads for the bathroom. “Do you have an extra toothbrush?”</p><p>“Do I…” Agatha shakes her head, still trying to process what Rio said. “What?”</p><p>“Toothbrush?” Rio asks again, trying and failing to smooth down her hair in the mirror above the sink.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. In the cabinet.” Agatha mumbles, pressing a hand against her eyes as the bathroom door clicks shut. She hears the shower start.</p><p>Agatha knows she should appreciate what Rio is trying to do but, suddenly, the room seems much smaller. She isn’t built for this—for holiday joy and festive cheer. Those things are for people who had happy, normal childhoods. She can pretend all she wants, wake up with Rio and throw pillows at her and laugh with her friends, but it will never be real.</p><p>She hears Evanora’s familiar voice in her head, always lurking in the depths of her darkest thoughts. It wraps around her insides and squeezes; it sits on her chest and weighs her down like a ton of bricks. </p><p>
<em> You don’t deserve it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>You were born evil—cursed.  </em>
</p><hr/><p>When Jen and Alice show up, they’re not alone. Billy is with them, a shy smile on his face as he hoists a bag over his shoulder and takes the front steps two at a time.</p><p>“What is this?” Agatha asks, her eyebrows getting higher with every box or bag one of them drags out of the car. Normally she would smirk, but her earlier interactions with Rio have fixed her face in a permanent grimace.</p><p>“Looks like cleaning supplies,” Rio supplies unhelpfully from her position at Agatha’s shoulder. “That’s a box of tinsel, I think.” She points the toothbrush in her hand towards Alice, who is balancing a clear bin against her hip like it's an Olympic sport.</p><p>“Exactly!” Alice replies cheerily. She drops the box on the porch with a thump. At Agatha’s continued glare she sighs. “Come on Agatha, this place isn’t exactly the most hospitable.” </p><p>She waves a hand behind Agatha and Rio, gesturing to the still-covered paintings and layers of dust that Agatha hasn’t gotten around to cleaning yet. In her defense, she’s been quite busy. Alice turns around and heads back to the car, stomping her feet into the snow.</p><p>Jen steps up next to Agatha, a blue bag with painted snowflakes slung over her arm. “You two,” she points a finger at Agatha and Rio. “Are going to leave and buy a Christmas tree. Have some fun.” She smirks knowingly. “We’re going to make this house look less-abandoned.” </p><p>Rio laughs, looping an arm through Billy’s as she leads him through the doorway.</p><p>“So Billy, what brings you to <em>Operation Make Agatha’s House Less Sad</em>?” she whispers conspiratorially, their sounds of their footsteps slowly receding as they enter the kitchen. </p><p>Jen turns to face Agatha, certainly waiting for something. Her eyebrows lift flawlessly and Agatha notices that Alice immediately turns to walk back to the car.</p><p>“About yesterday…” Agatha casts her eyes downward. “With Lilia.”</p><p>“It’s fine, Agatha.” Jen smiles at her sadly. “She tends to have that effect on people. I don’t blame you for leaving—I know what she said was probably difficult to hear.”</p><p>Agatha’s head jerks up, her gaze immediately narrowing at Jen’s words. Her stomach drops out with a swoop.</p><p>
<em> Difficult.  </em>
</p><p>“It wasn’t difficult, Jen, it was false.” Agatha’s voice is sharp, years of experience as a professor straightening her posture and strengthening her voice. Jen doesn’t seem intimidated by it, though, only stepping closer. She shakes her head, like she knows this is a fight she won’t win.</p><p>“Alice and I”—she waves a hand to the car, where Alice has suspiciously disappeared—”went to a few other places yesterday and spoke to some of Evanora’s old friends. We learned that she stopped speaking to most of them after you left. It seems that out of everyone in Salem, she was closest to Lilia.”</p><p>“Why won’t Lilia just tell us what she knows?” Agatha asks, doing her best to project a facade of anger despite the roaring pain inside her. She balls her hands into fists at her sides.</p><p>“Lilia has a… way about these things,” Jen says carefully. “She doesn't tell you anything until you’re ready to hear it.”</p><p>“And I’m not ready?” Agatha asks. She tries to sound angry, she really does.</p><p>“Apparently not,” Jen whispers, and Agatha swears she looks upset by that, too. “But that doesn’t mean we’ll stop trying. We will find out what happened to her.” Jen looks up, her eyes suddenly full of fire.</p><p>Agatha nods, unsure what to say, and then Jen is pushing past her. Her heels clack against the wooden floor, Just as the sound begins to recede, Alice’s head appears from around the side of the car.</p><p>“Is it safe?” she asks with a laugh, balancing several boxes and bags in her arms. When Agatha nods, unable to force herself to smile, Alice lets out a comical sigh of relief. She starts to follow Jen into the house but pauses when she sees the look on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Are you alright?” she asks tentatively, pulling her scarf closer to her neck as a gust of wind hits her. Agatha debates not answering, pushing the emotion out of her eyes and pretending to be fine, but she knows Alice will keep pushing.</p><p>“Do you think that I’m…” Agatha takes a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. Images flash through her mind. Rio, laughing and assuring her that she can <em> rewrite </em> her memories and Jen, telling her that Lilia’s words must have been <em> difficult </em>to hear. They push down on her like a slab of ice, cutting and freezing and suffocating. “Cursed?” </p><p>Agatha expects Alice to laugh fondly, to tell her that she’s being irrational and that <em> of course </em>she’s not cursed, but Alice doesn’t. Her eyes seem to darken, like someone has sucked the life out of them. It suddenly seems much colder outside despite the already low temperature.</p><p>“No, Agatha.” Alice’s voice is suddenly thick with unshed tears and Agatha’s breath catches in her throat. “Why would you think that?” Alice looks up at her and her expression, so devastated, compels Agatha to speak.</p><p>“I’ve spent so long running from happiness, Alice.” She gulps. “Because I didn’t…”</p><p>“You didn’t think you deserved it,” Alice finishes and Agatha nods, thankful for the words that she doesn’t have to say.</p><p>“But now I think that I could have it. With you and Jen, with….” Agatha just barely stops herself from saying Rio’s name. “I’m terrified to give myself back up to this place. It feels like defeat.”</p><p>Alice shakes her head firmly. “It wasn’t Salem that hurt you, Agatha. You never did understand that.” </p><p>Something seems to change in her expression, a resolution appearing that Agatha doesn’t yet understand. Alice clenches her jaw and reaches around Agatha, pulling the door shut. She drops the boxes she was carrying and with a deep breath, keeps talking.</p><p>“I remember that day, the week before you left. You told me that this town would eat you alive but you were wrong—it wasn’t this place<em>. </em>It was never the soil or the trees or the sun that caused you pain.” The trees seem to shake around them, the wind howling against their ears. Agatha swears the ground moves beneath her feet.</p><p>It's as if Salem can <em> hear </em>Alice’s words.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to respond, anger flaring in her chest, but Alice keeps going, plowing ahead with a rush of hurriedly spoken words.</p><p>“I understand why you thought that, I really do. It’s easier to run from a place than a person. You thought that you could leave all of your problems behind in Salem, turn your back on them and move on but, <em> Agatha</em>, that’s not how it works.” </p><p>Agatha collapses into one of the porch chairs. She reaches out with a cold hand to one of the bushes beside the porch. There were flowers here, once, when she was a child. They’re all dead now. She closes her hand around one.</p><p>“When you left, you just took your ghosts with you,” Alice continues. Her words are harsh but somehow also kind and Agatha knows, suddenly, that she’s imagined this conversation before. “Do you know how scared I was last night? That you left <em> again.</em>” </p><p>Agatha squeezes her eyes shut and wishes that Alice would stop talking, would stop her quick and violent examination of her most desperate actions.</p><p>“I didn’t know, Alice,” she chokes out. She gasps for air even though Alice is the one panting and raving, her hands gesturing wildly around them. Alice had been scared, terrified that her friend would abandon her again, and the thought nearly splits Agatha open. </p><p>“I know that if you want to leave, I can’t stop you, but don’t leave under the assumption that your pain will stay here,” Alice says as she stops pacing. Her hands close tight against the railing of the porch. “You think that if you solve your mother’s death, if you find out what happened, it’ll hurt less but it won’t. You can’t love people, or even hate them, and then expect to erase them from your life.”</p><p>Alice starts speaking faster, her breath fogging up the cold air in front of her.</p><p>“You can lie and tell me that you forgot us, that you never thought about me, or Jen, but I won’t believe you. Because I thought about you <em> every day</em>.” She’s nearly crying now, tears brimming in her eyes. Agatha can’t bring herself to meet them, staring at her boots instead.</p><p>Alice kneels in front of her, forcing her to make eye contact. </p><p>“Agatha, we love you,” Alice whispers reverently. There is no room in her tone for disbelief or disagreement, but Agatha shakes her head anyway, fighting against the burning in her eyes. “You’re allowed to be happy—even here. Evanora is <em> dead.” </em>Agatha hears the unspoken words, the silent implication that if Salem wasn’t what hurt her, Evanora was, and Evanora is gone.</p><p>“This place,” Alice continues, glancing up at the house. ”It’s not hers anymore. It can be yours, if you want it.”</p><p>Agatha wants to argue, to yell that Salem is cursed and awful but she can’t. She remembers Rio’s words from yesterday, her suggestion that perhaps Agatha has been yearning to return to Salem all this time and she knows, with a rush of clarity that makes her dizzy, that they’re right. </p><p>She’s been running for years in the name of freedom, fleeing from her mother and her family and her worst mistakes, except she wasn’t really free at all. They were there still, in broken glass on the floor and in snowflakes falling outside. They lived in the shadows of her apartment and the flames of her fireplace. </p><p>Alice is right. She took her ghosts with her. </p><p>The two of them sit together, shivering on the porch as Alice’s breathing slows. Agatha stares at the dead flower still clutched in her hand, so tight her knuckles are white. She twirls it around and jerks back when the wind catches it, ripping it from her grasp and tossing it across the melting snow. Finally, she speaks.</p><p>“I don’t know how.” </p><p>“To be happy? To not let the past destroy you?” Alice asks, sounding even more heartbroken than she had before. Agatha nods. “Just try. Stay and face your demons—don’t run from them, from <em> us</em>.” </p><p>“I can try,” Agatha replies, and the effort of speaking moves her even closer to tears. She rubs a hand over her chest and finds that it physically hurts, like someone is trying to rip her heart out. “I’m sorry, Alice.” </p><p>They are words Agatha never imagined she would say, never thought she would have the opportunity to speak, and they threaten to slice open her tongue. She forces them out anyway. Abruptly looking away from Alice, she brushes the tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand. She is sorry—that she left, that she came back, and that she wants to leave again. </p><p>Before she can turn back and gauge Alice’s reaction, there are arms around her, strong and sure and trembling.</p><p>“I know,” Alice says, her voice muffled in Agatha’s hair. “I don’t blame you, I really don’t. I know it was awful for you here, but it doesn’t have to be anymore.”</p><p>Agatha tries to believe her. Against all evidence and better judgement, she wraps her arms tighter around her friend and tries to believe that she might be happy, that she <em> can </em>be. When Alice pulls away, her eyes are red and her face is splotchy. </p><p>Agatha turns her head, avoiding the strong, persistent sun looming over them (and the bright spots it will inevitably leave against the back of her eyelids). She spots the flower lying amongst the snow, the one the wind took from her hand just moments before.</p><p>It’s blooming.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio drives a truck. </p><p>This shouldn’t be shocking news, really, but Agatha is fresh off the most gut-wrenching conversation she’s had since Jen slapped her and told her that Evanora was dead, so she thinks she’s allowed a little shock.</p><p>Absurdly, she wants to laugh; wants to throw herself down upon the snow and freeze away the ache in her chest at the revelation. That’s not quite possible, though, because Rio is looking at her with this expression on her face. Her eyebrows are drawn and her mouth is tilted down—like she’s sad. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t understand it and wouldn’t even know where to start, so she just pulls open the passenger door of Rio’s dark green pickup truck and climbs in.</p><p>They get about five minutes into the drive when Rio, who’s been tapping her hands nervously against the steering wheel, finally speaks.</p><p>“What did you and Alice talk about?” She doesn’t look at Agatha, like she’s afraid of her reaction.</p><p>“Salem,” Agatha responds simply. She’s so used to giving one word answers, to concealing her true feelings, that it comes naturally. She traces circles in the condensation on the window, watching as the familiar buildings and shops fly past. </p><p>Only when Rio doesn’t say anything else, just continuing her anxious drumming, does Agatha realize she’s waiting for <em> her </em> to say more. It goes against all of her self preservation instincts and raises her heart rate just a bit, but Agatha thinks about Alice, pleading with her to trust them, trust <em> someone</em>, and she continues.</p><p>“When I grew up, I thought that everything bad in my life was because of this place,” she whispers. “That it was fundamentally evil, or bad, or something.” The words hurt less than they would have an hour ago. Agatha is already scraped raw, all of her worst words drawn out and exposed.</p><p>“That’s why you left?” Rio asks, eyebrows dancing higher even as her eyes stay glued to the road. Agatha cringes internally; of course Rio knows about that. She’s certainly been close with Alice and Jen long enough to hear about their legendary friend who fled the state at eighteen and never looked back. Agatha imagines it’s quite a story—she’d probably like to hear it if it wasn’t about her.</p><p>“It’s why I did a lot of things.” It feels like an understatement, but it’s certainly true. “And now it’s coming back to bite me…” Agatha scrubs a hand over her face, remembering her earlier conversation with Jen. She had assured her that they <em> would </em>find out what happened to Evanora, but Agatha isn’t feeling confident. </p><p>“You do the calling, remember?” Rio quips, and it takes Agatha a moment to realize what she’s referring to, what conversation she’s referencing.</p><p>
<em> You don’t seem like the type of person who is called—more like someone who does the calling. </em>
</p><p>“I can <em> call </em>all I want, Rio.” Agatha jokes unconvincingly. “I can scream into an empty void for hours but what if there’s nothing? Nothing else to find? What if I can’t—” </p><p>Agatha dips her head, dangerously shielded insecurities bursting to life on her tongue, flowing from her lips unobstructed: that she will leave Salem with fewer answers than she arrived with, that all of her training will fail her here, that even in her mother’s death, she is not enough for her.</p><p>“Agatha, do you truly fear what will happen if you find nothing?” Rio’s words are soft, but they are still deadly. “You’ll go back to your old life, professorship and legacy in tow. You’ll forget about all of this.” </p><p>Rio waves a ringless hand in the air, the other tight on the steering wheel. Agatha stares. The mysterious woman in front of her, the infuriatingly attractive mortician who implied that she was <em> called </em> to meet Agatha, may be right about a lot of things but she is wrong about one: Agatha could never forget this.</p><p>“I wonder”—Rio smirks, and Agatha nearly dies—“what will happen if you <em> do </em> find something?” Agatha considers with a jolt that there are things here, buried six feet deep in the haunted soil of Salem, that she might not <em> want </em>to find. </p><p>The dead don’t often tell you what you want to hear, after all. </p><p>“If it’s worth anything, I think this place is magical,” Rio continues.</p><p>Agatha fights the sudden urge to laugh, stomps it down inside of her when Alice’s tearful voice resounds in her head: <em> it wasn’t Salem that hurt you. </em>She wonders about Rio’s word choice; magical isn’t a word used lightly in Salem, not with its history.</p><p>“Tell me, then.” Agatha turns to face Rio, even though she can’t look back. She admires her side profile distractedly. “Tell me why it’s magical.” </p><p>It’s a plea, of sorts. Agatha wants to understand—she wants to see Salem as something other than what Evanora made it. Rio slows for a stop light and turns to face Agatha.</p><p>“It’s where I met you,” she says lightly, that smirk that Agatha has grown so familiar with twisting on her mouth. Her eyes seem to glow, all warm and hazel and Agatha swears she can see a bit of green pooling at the edges of her irises. Rio looks away after a few seconds, turning onto a sidestreet as the light switches.</p><p>They don’t speak for the rest of the drive. Every time Agatha attempts to say something, opens her mouth and tries to form syllables, she thinks better of it and bites her tongue. There is no response, really, not to that; being told that <em> you </em>make a place magical, a place you’ve hated and despised for decades. </p><p>Agatha jolts out of her thoughts as the truck slows. She peers out the window at a large side, wooden and decorated with dozens of tiny trees. It reads: <em> Seven Sisters Christmas Tree Farm. </em>There’s a little stand outside serving cocoa and cookies and the entire place looks like it appeared straight out of a holiday rom-com. As Agatha climbs out of the truck, Rio appearing at her side, she notices that the cookies are decorated as witch hats adorned with wreaths. </p><p>She rolls her eyes and drags Rio in the opposite direction, not even realizing that she’s grabbed her hand until they’re disappearing into the rows of tall trees. She tries to pull away, to flush with embarrassment and pretend it didn’t happen, but Rio holds tight. </p><p>When Agatha turns to glare at her, Rio doesn’t meet her eyes, only smirking and making a bee-line for the hot cocoa stand that Agatha had just attempted to avoid. Agatha groans and pulls against her hand, but she doesn’t put any real force into it. </p><p>Moments later, a beaming Rio shoves a stack of cookies and a cup of hot chocolate into her hands.</p><p>“Okay, stick with me here,” Rio says once they’ve secured their snacks. She excitedly points between two different display trees. “<em>Abies fraseri </em> or <em> Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>?” </p><p>Agatha shakes her head and can’t even be shocked. Of course Rio knows the scientific names of Christmas tree species.</p><p>“They look the same to me,” Agatha deadpans, clutching her cup of cocoa like a lifeline. </p><p>Rio tosses the reminder of her cookie in her mouth and snatches Agatha’s hand. She then proceeds to excitedly drag them around the entire farm, stopping and considering each impressive tree they stumble across. </p><p>Agatha gives up on trying to keep track of their location about twenty minutes in, when Rio leads them through a row of trees because she thought she saw a bunny. Agatha thinks there are still needles in her hair. She also gave up on trying to get her hand back a while ago, secretly happy to let Rio keep it.</p><p>“How can I help the happy couple today?” An employee appears out of nowhere, his red polo displaying the name <em> Eddie. </em>He smiles at them, his eyes seemingly stuck on their joined hands.</p><p>“Oh we’re not—” Agatha starts.</p><p>“Looking for help!” Rio interjects. She smiles and pulls Agatha closer, wrapping an arm around her waist. “I have it handled. I’m an expert.”</p><p>Eddie seems skeptical but he nods anyway, leaving them alone and heading towards a family with two small children.</p><p>Agatha steps out of Rio’s arms with a scowl, ignoring the twinge of loss when she does. “You’re an expert?”</p><p>“Mortician by day, plant enthusiast by night,” Rio answers quickly, and Agatha just knows she says that often. </p><p>Agatha bites her lip to keep from laughing. She decides then to take their forced proximity as an opportunity to do some information gathering of her own; level the playing field after Rio so carefully extracted all of her worst fears. It’s not like she has much else to do as she follows Rio’s zigzagging pattern through rows of fir trees. </p><p>“What’s the connection there? Between dead people”—Agatha winches at her own crass language, which only evokes reminders of her dead mother—”and plants.”</p><p>“Life, Agatha,” Rio says, like it’s obvious. “They both live and die and breathe.” </p><p>She steps forward, running a hand over one of the trees like she can <em> feel </em>it breathing, like she can sense it living under her fingers. Her eyes slip closed, and Agatha rushes to change the subject.</p><p>“So, why did you move here? To Salem?” she asks casually, trying to ignore the strange, transfixed look on Rio’s face.</p><p>“I don’t know, really.” Lines appear across Rio’s forehead as she scrunches her face up as if she’s trying to solve a particularly difficult puzzle. “I went to graduate school a couple hours from here and always loved it. The eerie vibe really entranced me.” Rio waves a hand like she’s casting a spell, fingers fluttering on the wind, and Agatha smirks. “One day, I showed up and never left. It just…”</p><p>“Felt right?” Agatha blurts, unable to keep the words to herself. </p><p>“Yeah, exactly.” Rio’s head bobs up and down excitedly. “You get it?” </p><p>“I do,” Agatha replies, dipping her head so Rio can’t see the blush that spreads across her face like wildlife. “I’m familiar with the feeling.”</p><p>Rio pauses and then lifts a hand, her palm brushing lightly against the side of Agatha’s face. She feels like a raging fire, every inch of her skin burning and warming all at once, even in the cold. Agatha’s eyes slip closed of their own accord, and as much as she curses internally and screams at her body to recoil, it <em> leans into </em> the contact. </p><p>“Yeah, you would be,” Rio whispers. She shakes her head slightly and lets her hand drop away. The sudden loss of warmth forces Agatha’s eyes open but Rio is already gone, staring up at another tree. “It’s this one.”</p><p>“Whatever you say, sweetheart,” Agatha quips before she can stop herself. She falls into it easily, the banter they’ve been developing and reveling in for the past few days. </p><p>As soon as the words leave her, she presses a hand against her mouth and wishes a sinkhole would emerge beneath her feet and swallow her up. She hadn’t <em> meant </em>to say it, too caught up in the moment to bite her tongue. Rio’s touch and Rio’s words always seem to unsettle her. She makes the walls that Agatha so lovingly maintains willingly lower. Rio turns slowly, her eyes bright. </p><p>“<em>Sweetheart</em>?” she muses, stepping forward and smirking like she’s won some impossible prize. </p><p>“I was just teasing,” Agatha corrects sternly, trying to put her best professor face on. Rio tosses her head back and laughs, light and perfect.</p><p>“I don’t believe you”—Rio steps forward and leans in slightly, tipping forward until her face is inches from Agatha’s—“Professor.” </p><p>Agatha gasps, Rio’s lips so close to hers that she could simply lift her face and press them together. Then, Rio abruptly pulls away, Agatha’s hand once again tight in hers. She heads straight for Eddie, the young boy they spoke to earlier.</p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha grumbles, as Rio drags them away. </p><p>“You could never,” Rio whispers in her ear. She sounds completely certain.</p><hr/><p>Agatha drapes her arm out the window of Rio’s truck, tipping her head back and letting the cold air fill her lungs. She glances at the tree in the side mirror, an impressively large fir tied to the bed of Rio’s truck. Eddie helped them, making comments about how great of a couple they were the entire time. Agatha had briefly wanted to strangle him.</p><p>She’s desperately trying to convince herself it’s because he was <em> wrong</em>—and not because she wishes he was right.</p><p>“We’re almost there,” Rio informs her, turning the music down. Agatha tilts her head back and forth, squinting out the window at the blurry buildings disappearing behind them. Rio has a surprise for her; she told her so after they left the Christmas tree farm. Despite Agatha’s pleading and prodding, Rio hasn’t budged.</p><p>When the lighthouse comes into view, Agatha’s first thought is to wonder how Rio knows; how she knows that, as a child, Agatha would escape here to this quiet place on the water. She would sit, with a book or her thoughts, and stare at the waves. It comforted her when no one else could.</p><p>Rio pulls right up next to the lighthouse and turns her truck off.</p><p>“This is one of my favorite places in Salem,” she says, and Agatha thinks if it was possible for her to fall any harder for Rio than she already has, this is when that would happen. “I wanted to show you.” </p><p>Agatha’s heart skips a beat. Rio doesn’t know that she loved this place, that it was her sanctuary all those years ago. She just loves it, and wants to share it with her.</p><p>Rio climbs out, opening Agatha’s door and smirking at her—there’s something else, Agatha realizes. Rio has another surprise planned. Agatha doesn’t try to guess, certain that she could never figure it out, only following Rio up the path and rubbing her hands together in anticipation. </p><p>When they get to the base of the lighthouse Agatha’s mind whirls, briefly caught in between decades.</p><p>The time she spent here as a teenager is blending into her consciousness, along with memories of her tears and her laughs. The last time she was here was the night before she left Salem. She is certain of that, but when she pulls at the memory, it falls away like it doesn’t wish to be seen—like it’s hiding. It makes Agatha briefly uneasy but she pushes the feeling away, her eyes drawn to the familiar view.</p><p>She moves to sit on one of the rocks, the one she had always loved as a kid because it was the closest to the water. Birds soar and leap across the surface, twirling and twisting without a care. The sky is dark despite the early hour. Grey clouds are flitting back and forth across the sun, and it’s like a mosaic of light against the rocks, sunrays dancing and disappearing. </p><p>Agatha turns to look at Rio, her eyes widening when she presents Agatha with a picnic basket.</p><p>“Fancy lunch by the water?” Rio smiles shyly, like she’s afraid Agatha will turn her down. Agatha shakes her head; Rio has absolutely no idea, does she?</p><p>“Depends on what you brought,” she shoots back with a smirk, and Rio collapses onto the rock next to her. They sit in comfortable silence, sandwiches in hand, and watch the water. Rio even pulls out one of those battery-powered candles, resting it in between them like a makeshift dinner.</p><p>Agatha stares at Rio, at the soft smile on her face, and knows she can’t deny it anymore. The realization washes through her with a rush of clarity.</p><p>She’s falling in love with Rio Vidal. </p><p>She has been, she thinks, since the moment she first laid eyes on her, all sharp lines and soft skin, lounging in her garden and crashing into her life like she <em> belonged </em>there; Rio unapologetically entered her life with a smirk and a flower and Agatha doesn’t think she’ll ever be the same.</p><p>Eventually Agatha breaks the soft silence, unable to stop herself from requesting clarification, from confirming what she already knows. She’s always done well with more information, after all. </p><p>“Is this a date?”</p><p>Rio’s head shoots up. She returned the picnic basket to the truck a while ago, the two of them continuing to stare at the water like a scene from a cheesy romantic comedy. Agatha would roll her eyes if she wasn’t so captivated.</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio replies slowly. </p><p>She stands, Agatha’s eyes tracking her intently, and walks up to the door of the lighthouse; the one that's always locked to the public. Agatha knows this, because she tried to break into it once. She was young and clueless and had no luck. Rio doesn’t break it, though. She slips a rusty key into the lock. The door clicks and swings open easily.</p><p>She lifts her head to look at Agatha then, a shy smile on her lips. “I know a guy. A girl, actually.” </p><p>Rio leads Agatha up dozens of stairs, sliding the key back in her pocket and holding her phone flashlight out in front of her. Agatha follows silently, certain that any words she could say wouldn’t be enough. </p><p>When they finally reach the top, and Rio pushes the door open, Agatha feels like the world has shifted underneath her, like she’s stepped into an alternate universe—one where someone cares about her enough to give her <em> this.  </em></p><p>The view from the shore is beautiful but from up higher, it’s breathtaking. The water seems so much more alive and kinetic; the swaying of the trees is impossible to ignore. There are lanterns on the side of the lighthouse, warm light spilling from them in the overcast weather. Rio’s face looks dipped in sunlight, each sharp line of her face made that much more intense.</p><p>Agatha can hear their breathing, so much louder and more intrusive this close together. Everything else in the world seems completely silent. The crashing of the waves slows, the howling wind quiets, and the clouds stop moving.</p><p>The calm before the storm.</p><p>“You still don’t believe me, do you?” Rio asks, her eyes dark and narrowed. She tips her head back and closes her eyes, somehow completely unaffected by the cold air that whirls around them. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know what she believes. </p><p>She rubs a hand over her eyes and stares out at the harbor, captivated by the waves that silently and violently crash against the surface.</p><p>“Believe what, Rio?” Agatha whispers. Her voice is quiet. Speaking loudly would feel wrong, like shattering the bubble of serenity that they’ve stumbled upon. </p><p>“That this place is special.” Rio waves a hand out over the water and Agatha briefly notes that her fingertips are trembling. “Magical, even.”</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath. She turns her head, allowing herself to really <em> look </em>at Rio. Her eyes are shut, her eyelashes occasionally fluttering in the wind. She leans against the railing with no fear, like she’s certain it won’t give out and send her flailing to the ground. Agatha doesn’t know how to have that kind of faith—she’s certain she’s never had it before. </p><p>“How do you trust it?” She gestures to the railing, to the flimsy white fence that keeps them safely suspended above the ground, but she means something different entirely. Rio’s eyes open and she shifts, turning to face Agatha. All of her hair blows to one side and it’s incredibly charming, even though it has no reason to be. </p><p>For a moment, Rio seems unsure. She tilts her head side to side, drumming her fingers against the wood she’s no longer resting against.</p><p>“Can I show you?” Her voice has dropped lower than Agatha’s ever heard it and she <em> knows </em>what Rio is asking, like she knows the shade of her eyes and which ring she wears on each finger. Agatha knows, and there is no world, no timeline, no dimension, in which she says no. </p><p>She nods, hears Rio’s startled exhale, and then Rio is all she can see, all she can feel<em>.  </em></p><p>Her hands, somehow burning hot, immediately find their place at the base of Agatha’s skull, pushing and pulling at the same time. She steps closer and closer until there is no room left between them, until Agatha’s back is pressed into the railing of the lighthouse. It creaks and groans under the sudden weight but Agatha doesn’t care. </p><p>Rio’s mouth is chasing hers like she’s drowning and Agatha gives her <em> life. </em></p><p>When their lips meet, crashing together like planets colliding, Agatha understands. She gets it now, how Rio can have such perfect faith, because how could she ever doubt this? Rio grips her hand wildly, never moving her lips away or opening her eyes. She grabs Agatha’s freezing hand and presses it to the center of her chest—Agatha lets her.</p><p>When her fingertips land there, only muscle and bone separating her from Rio’s pounding heart, she gasps. Something inside of her that has been cracking and splintering since she arrived in Salem roars up again, screaming like a caged animal. There is a rushing in her veins, in her head, which has to do with more than just Rio’s fiery touch as she continues to devour Agatha, all teeth and whimpers and desperate movements. </p><p>Rio moves slightly, slotting her legs between Agatha’s, and she can’t stop her head from tossing back against the wind. Her back is pressed so hard against the railing she’s sure she’ll have bruises tomorrow. She gasps at the contact, Rio’s entire body melding into hers.</p><p>Her ribs seem to bend and crack, like they’re making room for something new to grow. They collapse and rebuild and it is not painful—it is dizzying. The sky fractures along with them, freezing snow and rain suddenly pelting down against the two of them. </p><p>For a moment, Rio doesn’t even notice, too busy dragging her lips down Agatha’s neck but then, the lighthouse rattles dangerously around them and her head flies up, pupils blown wide open. Agatha lets Rio pull her inside, the door of the lighthouse slamming shut behind them. Some part of her expects Rio to keep going, to render her gasping and boneless on the floor of the lighthouse, but she doesn’t. </p><p>She just presses a hand against her heart and stares at Agatha, her eyes full of an emotion she can’t name, a humor she doesn’t understand. After a moment, her fingers fall away and she leans back against the wall, a laugh falling from her lips like she can’t quite stop it. </p><p>“Believe me now?” </p><hr/><p>Agatha doesn’t hear the knocking, not at first. </p><p>She’s too busy fighting against the infuriating stinging in her eyes as she stares up at the haphazardly decorated Christmas tree in the living room. The entire house is cleaner, more warm and lived in. Dust no longer coats every surface and hangs in the air. </p><p>There are framed pictures on the mantle that certainly came from Jen and Alice’s house and candles in every corner. Agatha even spotted a few music posters in the hallway along with the now-uncovered art, which she assumes is Billy’s doing. The three of them were still here when Agatha and Rio returned, eager to give them a tour and show them what they had done.</p><p>If Agatha closes her eyes, the sounds of Alice and Jen talking in the corner mixing with Rio’s soft laughs and the classical music Billy insisted on playing, she can almost pretend it’s not her mother’s house. She presses her mug of tea against her lips and breathes through the pressure in her chest, the strange feeling that’s been there ever since Rio kissed her. </p><p>For a moment, she forgets that she despises the holidays, hates Christmas trees, and thinks that ornaments are stupid. The wind continues to howl outside, the insane snowstorm that they had driven home in continuing with a vengeance. It had been quite the job to even get the tree inside, everyone soaking wet and laughing hysterically afterwards.</p><p>It all falls away, lost in the warmth of the fireplace and in the smile pulling at the corners of Rio’s lips as she adds a star to the very top of the tree. Agatha can’t remember the last time she felt like this in the entire month of December. She hesitates to even name the feeling—certainly not jolly or festive.</p><p>Content, perhaps.</p><p>Evanora had made the holiday season a nightmare, pulling and prodding at Agatha’s every move, dragging her to dinner at her grandparents, and forcing her to play hostess for dozens of family friends. Their perfect Christmas tree, full of perfectly plain silver and blue ornaments, had only served as a reminder of what Agatha wasn’t. </p><p>Gazing up at this tree, though, Agatha stares at the countless ornaments of mismatched colors and funky shapes, the ones that Alice and Jen had dragged here from their basement. Billy had helped decorate, trying to make sure that each color was evenly distributed across the tree, but working with Alice meant he hadn’t gotten much balancing done. </p><p>Agatha sinks lower into the couch. Her body suddenly feels impossibly heavy, full of missed chances and complicated grief. She wonders why no one told her the holidays could feel like this, instead of being dominated by fear and pain and sadness. </p><p>Rio grins adorably as she stands back to admire her work, gazing up at the gold star. She’s been just as engaged in decorating the tree as she was in picking it out. Apparently satisfied, she flops onto the couch next to Agatha, like she can’t imagine being anywhere else, and drops her head onto her shoulder.</p><p>“Having fun?” Rio’s voice is low and teasing, nearly fading away in the soft sounds of the burning fireplace. </p><p>“Absolutely not”—Agatha shakes her head—“That tree is atrocious.” She waves a hand at it.  Some of the branches are bent and crooked from their haphazard dragging of it inside. The wind and freezing rain and snow certainly hadn't helped either. </p><p>The words are expected, they are Agatha’s familiar shield, her protective armor made of syllables and jabs but this time, there is no malice behind them. They are teasing and sweet and fond. Rio grins.</p><p>“Hey, you love it.” She throws an arm around Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha can’t even bring herself to scoff or roll her eyes because Rio is <em> right.</em> She leans in closer, revelling in the fact that she can. </p><p>She barely even notices Jen get up, her socked feet padding against the floor as she pulls the front door open. The wind gets louder and Agatha shivers, wondering briefly what insane thing Jen is doing this time. It’s been storming for hours, everyone agreeing to crash in Agatha’s many guest rooms to avoid the worst of it.</p><p>“Lilia?” Jen asks incredulously. </p><p>Agatha’s head swivels around quickly and she nearly drops her mug in her haste to jump to her feet. Rio takes it from her easily. Lilia is standing on the front porch, completely dry despite the storm raging behind her. She looks like a character out of a fantasy novel, her eyes bright and sharp. Her grey hair is raised behind her, full of static energy.</p><p>“I need to speak to Agatha.” </p><p>Her voice is low again, like it had been in her shop before she yelled a tarot card name at Agatha and then continued on as if nothing had happened. Agatha presses her eyes shut and the hatred returns—at her situation, at this <em> damned </em>town, and at Lilia and her apparent psychic abilities for not allowing her a moment of domestic happiness. </p><p>It does strike her as odd that she even <em> wants </em>that sort of thing, but then Lilia is pushing through the doorway and the thought is gone. She walks right up to Agatha, who braces herself for another argument, another impossible conversation with someone who can’t be reasoned with.</p><p>“Why are you here? What else could you possibly have to say to me?” she asks, waving her hand and trying desperately to disguise her unease at Lilia’s sudden appearance as anger. Lilia does not rise to Agatha’s bait. </p><p>She only smiles and reaches a hand into her pocket, pulling out an intricately carved golden locket. It depicts three women carved in white, the bodies silhouetted against dark blue. The moment it’s in front of her, Agatha <em> knows </em>she should recognize it. A spark of memory flames and bursts into her mind, but it is burned away as quickly as it appeared. </p><p>Lilia dangles the chain from her hand and turns the locket slowly, hovering it inches from Agatha’s face as if she’s trying to hypnotize her—a cursive letter <em> A </em>is elaborately burned into the back. </p><p>Agatha distantly hears Rio gasp and Jen exclaim but she doesn’t move. All of her attention is suddenly focused on the spinning locket in front of her, glimmering in the firelight, and Lilia’s eyes, which are so sure and full of prophecy that Agatha can no longer avoid them.</p><p>“Break it.”</p><p>Agatha lifts a hand, her fingers trembling, and wraps them around the locket. There is a sudden cleaving in her mind, a buzzing that starts up behind her eyes with a vengeance. She stares at it for a moment, this thing that somehow seems alive, and then meets Lilia’s gaze.</p><p>“What is it?” she asks tentatively, running a finger over the woman in the center; she has a story to tell, Agatha is certain. </p><p>When she rests her hand against the locket and lets her eyes drift shut, there are quick flashes in her memory: the odd symbols in blue ink, her mother’s strange mortuary report, the flower blooming amongst snow. They are unexplainable occurrences that Agatha had promptly forgotten about after. But they had not simply fallen away or drifted out of her thoughts—they were hidden. Now, they rush back to her.</p><p>“Your cage,” Lilia croaks. “Or, part of it, at least.” </p><p>On any other day, in any other moment, Agatha would surely laugh. She would toss her head back and roll her eyes and smirk at the audacity and insanity of this moment but she finds that this time, she cannot. There is something buried deep in her ribcage, the same thing that was screaming for release under the overcast sky. It is begging her to believe Lilia, just like it forced her into a witchlore class and dragged her back to Salem, kicking and screaming.</p><p>Agatha lifts the locket high above her head and with a deep breath, throws it directly into the fireplace.</p><p>Her aim is perfect. Rio jumps beside her, stumbling back as the room fills with intense heat. Alice and Jen scream; Lilia does not move. The flames leap up violently and quickly, nearly bursting out of the fireplace to meet the offered metal. They are eager to consume and destroy.</p><p>It is fantastical, it is unreal, and it is true.</p><p>It’s the last thing Agatha sees before her world goes dark.</p>

<p>“Would you like to be hunted, Agatha?” Evanora asks casually. She perches on the edge of the kitchen stool and stares down at her daughter, as if this is a perfectly normal topic of conversion.</p><p>To Agatha, it is. </p><p>Her mother is at her most dangerous when she’s like this, sharp words and slow movements. Mentally, Agatha compares her to the big cats that she sometimes sees on the television. Their movements are careful and slow until they finally pounce, prey going limp in their jaws.</p><p>Agatha shifts between two feet, pushing her hands behind her back when they continue to spark, tiny purple lightning bolts sending zaps up her wrists. She shakes her head. She is only five years old and her power is already demanding to be known.</p><p>She knows she is more powerful than she should be at her age, magic overflowing from her hands and chest whenever she feels a particularly strong emotion. She cannot control it and sometimes, Evanora looks at her with something that Agatha thinks might be fear. </p><p>Their family seems to have noticed as well, aunts and cousins no longer showing up for dinner at their house. When they do, they refrain from using magic at all and cast worried expressions in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>“A verbal answer, please.” Evanora twirls her necklace around her finger.</p><p>“No.” Agatha fights the urge to stomp her foot—she knows that would only make her mother more upset.</p><p>“That is what I thought.” Evanora slides off the stool with elegance, her heels clicking against the wooden floor of the kitchen. Blue threads of magic slip from her fingertips, warming the air around them. “Then you must keep your power hidden.” Agatha nods again. She knows this. </p><p>Evanora clenches her first and the wisps of magic disappear, sinking back into her skin.</p><p>Agatha’s ancestors, the great and pure witches that came before her, were hunted and hung and drowned for their power. She is familiar with the stories, the gore and grief that seeps into her mother’s voice when she spits them into the air as if the retelling of them will change something.</p><p>The magic of their blood is sacred and they must always protect it.</p><p>“Yes, mother.”</p><hr/><p>Evanora keeps books in the attic; tomes that are centuries old and guarded behind locks that are no match for Agatha. She lifts a hand and urges the wisps of purple around her fingertips forward. They slip into the lock and twist, gears moving silently.</p><p>She shoves the door open, a rush of cold air trailing goosebumps up and down her arms. The tiny windows at the top of the room barely let any light in. They’re obscured by snow.</p><p>Agatha does this often, sneaking away to drag heavy  books into her room and pore over them. Alice thinks it’s a horrible idea, that Evanora will certainly catch her. Jen, always willing to go along with Agatha’s insane plans, had excitedly announced that she wanted to see the creepy attic too. </p><p>Agatha had placated Alice, assuring that she would be careful and <em> not </em>get caught. Agatha would normally heed her warning, trusting her friend’s judgment, but this is the only way she can learn about herself, about her history and the blood that ebbs and flows just below the surface of her skin.</p><p>Her mother certainly doesn’t teach her. It took Evanora many years to notice the abilities her daughter holds and, when she eventually did, it was much too late—blood had already been spilled.</p><p>Agatha nudges a box across the room and climbs onto it, hands braced against the bookshelf. She slides one off the shelf, a thin dark red tome. Dust floats into the air at her movements, disturbed for the first time in years. The small library Evanora keeps hidden seems completely untouched, frozen in time.</p><p>Agatha looks down at the cover, traces the cover with her fingertips. Her breath catches in her throat.</p><p>
<em> The Taking of Power. </em>
</p><p>She scrambles down from the box and pushes it back to the other side of the room, hands trembling with anticipation. </p><p>Agatha has been searching for weeks, dragging book after book to her room in secret. She reads late into the light, a candle flickering next to her hand; the ache in her back the next morning is worth it.</p><p>She has discovered journals detailing the witch trials that killed the majority of her ancestors, tomes of ancient and dark magic that make her mouth fall open in shock, and spell books so impossibly old that the ink is completely faded.</p><p>She slips the book into her bag and eases the door shut behind her, flicking her fingers to click the lock back into place. She’s never been caught—and she doesn’t plan on changing that. If her mother ever found out…</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, pushing the thought away as she carefully climbs down the rickety stairs. She locks her bedroom door behind her and slides into her desk chair, waving a hand to slam her bedroom window shut. </p><p>Purple threads spill from her palms and pull it closed. She keeps it open most of the time but it’s beginning to snow, winter creeping up on Salem. Tiny flurries dance above her head and land in her hair. </p><p>Although she would never admit it, there is a reason for her newfound fascination with books on witchcraft that goes beyond just education and historical knowledge.</p><p>Evanora believes she is evil.</p><p>Agatha wants proof.</p><p>This is the only way she can begin to understand the power that thrums in her veins.</p><p>She slides the book onto her desk and peers at it, pulling a candle from one of the drawers. She’s unsure <em> what </em>exactly the book is. Agatha clicks her fingers together in a circle until a tiny ball of magic appears.</p><p>The color of her magic is beginning to change, becoming more vibrant. When she was a toddler, first learning how to grasp the power at her fingertips, her magic had been a soft lilac. Now, it is a deeper, more stark purple.</p><p>Agatha mutters simple Latin words under her breath, syllables that she has been memorizing for days leaping to her tongue. The spark grows and catches on the wick, leaping into purple flame. It illuminates the cover and Agatha grins; she learned that one in a spell book last week. </p><p>She stares at the cover for a moment, noting the tiny symbol embossed there. She hadn’t noticed it in the attic, the soft grooves of the carving apparently only visible under harsh light. </p><p>It shows a hand outstretched, crudely drawn threads of magic flowing <em> towards </em>it. </p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth twitches—maybe she will finally find her answers. She takes a deep breath and pries the ancient book open, careful not to rip the fragile pages. The ink is faded and the words are written in loopy cursive. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes immediately dart to the first page. She clears her throat and waves a hand behind her back, shielding her voice.</p><p>“As a rule, the darkest and most evil forms of witchcraft are learned,” Agatha begins softly, tracing the words with her finger. She whispers, despite the fact that Evanora cannot hear her. “They are taught and formed, grown and honed in the absence of light. Many practitioners of dark magic are drawn to it but, despite what many may believe, none of them are born <em> of </em> it.”</p><p>There is a diagram below the words, overlapping lines and shapes that Agatha has become familiar with—runic circles. There are dozens of them scribbled on the page, all corresponding to different types of magic; different affinities, of sort. </p><p>Underneath the runes, there are words hastily written. They are in a different handwriting than the rest of the page, a messier scrawl. </p><p>
<em> Protection magic. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Potions magic. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Divination magic. </em>
</p><p>
<em><strike> Chaos magic?</strike> </em>
</p><p>Agatha has read about these types of magic, even asked her mother excitedly which type <em> she </em>had. Evanora hadn’t answered. Jen and Alice aren’t sure what type they have, either. Apparently these things can take time to reveal themselves. Agatha turns the page.</p><p>”Dark witches are made, not born,” she reads aloud. “This is the way of magic as witches have known it for centuries but, as with all things, there are exceptions.”</p><p>Agatha flips the page, her heart hammering in her chest.</p><p>“The magic that lives within a witch is as necessary to her survival as the pumping of her heart and the expansion of her lungs—it is a life force.” Agatha nods her head as she reads. “The witch who can drain this life force, stealing the power for herself…” </p><p>
<em> She is the exception to the rule. </em>
</p><p>Agatha slams the book shut, the sudden rush of air blowing the candle out and shrouding her in darkness. </p><hr/><p>“I have to tell you something.” Agatha stares at Jen and Alice, the three of them tucked into Jen’s bed in the dead of night. Her parents went to sleep ages ago, happy to let Agatha stay over after she showed up on their doorstep in tears. </p><p>They’re in middle school, the three of them, and it feels like they’ve always been together. They come in a trio, each of their teachers aware that you never see one without the others. Alice and Jen had dragged Agatha to their table at lunch once and soon, they were forcing her to spend nights sleeping in forts on their bedroom floors and doing cartwheels on the school playground.</p><p>Agatha knew Alice and Jen were witches the moment she met them, something deep inside of her chiming happily when Alice glanced her way and smiled. They bonded over their magic, sharing spells and pieces of history they’ve managed to extract from their parents. No one in Salem is eager to discuss witchcraft, it seems. Not even those who have inherited it. </p><p>“Anything.” Alice nods, her hands reaching out to wrap around Agatha’s. Alice is always <em> touching,</em> always seeking and grounding and reassuring. </p><p>“I think I’m evil.”</p><p>“Why would you think that?” Jen asks, her eyebrows raised. Alice looks like she might cry.</p><p>“My mother thinks so.” Agatha leans off the bed and sticks a hand in her backpack, pulling a book out: <em> The Taking of Power. </em>She read it weeks ago and has been working up the courage to show it to her friends ever since.</p><p>Alice and Jen know everything about Agatha—except for this. She has hidden her supposed evil from them since they met, her mother’s sharp words permanently embedded in her heart like the worst kind of scar.</p><p>“Your mother also painted the living room burnt orange,” Jen quips. Agatha snorts and presses a hand over her mouth to muffle the sound. Alice smiles at her and reaches out to take the book. She reads the cover silently, and then jerks her head to look at Agatha.</p><p>“The attic?” Alice asks. Agatha nods and Jen shifts closer, a mischievous look on her face. She nudges Agatha with her shoulder.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, a master criminal.” Jen smirks and throws her hands around her, like she’s speaking to an eager crowd. “Guilty of breaking and entering her mother’s top secret attic.” </p><p>Alice pushes Jen away with both hands, as she always does when Jen tilts the mood from serious to humorous with ease. She shrieks and scrambles to avoid falling off the bed. Alice presses a finger to her lips, eyes narrowed, and gestures to the door. </p><p>“Quiet,” she whispers.</p><p>“Such a rule follower,” Jen mumbles. Agatha rolls her eyes and gestures towards the book again, trying desperately to ignore the way her heart begins to pound in her chest.</p><p>“Read it,” she urges.</p><p>“Aloud?” Agatha shakes her head; she doesn’t need to hear it again. The words are already stuck in her head, playing again and again like a broken record. Alice and Jen huddle together, eyes tracing across the faint words in the pale moonlight. They sit in silence for a few minutes, Alice occasionally turning the page and then Jen turning it back and mumbling that she wasn’t done reading yet.</p><p>Eventually, Alice’s head lifts. Her eyes are wide and shiny. She shoves the book into Jen’s lap. “You can do this? Steal the… lifeforce of other witches?” The words sound unsure on her tongue, like she’s trying to understand each one as she says it.</p><p>Her hands float in front of her, a mirror image of the cover symbol, like she’s trying to understand how it works. She stretches her fingers out towards Jen and winces. Agatha nods, twisting her hands together anxiously. Alice’s expression shifts into once Agatha is familiar with; problem solving. </p><p>She moves her gaze to Jen, who is still reading intently. For a moment, she looks incredibly sad, like she does when Agatha shows up to school with bags under her eyes and bruises around her wrists, but then she looks up and smiles.</p><p>“It’s strange,” she begins, and Agatha’s heart skips a beat. “But not any stranger than you having a crush on Beatrice in fourth grade.” </p><p>Agatha cringes at the reminder, but her heart breaks open all the same. Tears she hadn’t known she was holding back spill from her eyes and darken her shirt. Jen moves closer to her, wrapping an arm around her shoulder.</p><p>“If your attitude in the mornings doesn’t scare us away, <em> nothing will,</em>” Jen jokes, but Agatha sees the emotion in her eyes. “I mean it.”</p><p>Alice seems to remember where she is all of a sudden, eyes brightening as she stares at her two friends.</p><p>“I hate your mother.” Her voice is low and full of anger and Agatha suddenly knows exactly what form her friend’s magic will take. Alice, with her eyes full of fire, would fight endless armies for her friends.</p><p>“I second that,” Jen adds, her arm still warm around Agatha’s back. “Maybe we can brew a potion that will turn her into a worm.” Agatha laughs, her throat tight.</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care what this stupid book says.” Alice tosses the tome on the floor and it lands with a thump. “You’re not evil. You’re our best friend.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leans forward, wrapping her arms around Agatha until she is completely engulfed by limbs and the smell of raspberries. They had used Jen’s newest hair concoction before bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But even if you </span>
<em>
<span>were </span>
</em>
<span>evil, I would still be your friend,” Jen whispers in Agatha’s ear, too quiet for Alice to hear. </span>
</p><hr/><p>Agatha tiptoes down the stairs carefully, a backpack slung over her shoulder. It contains nothing of emotional value; just the things she needs to <em> never </em>return to this house. Her eyes burn, red-rimmed and irritated as she squints against the darkness.</p><p>It is her eighteenth birthday and she is certain she will never see her friends again. </p><p>She is exhausted from packing and planning, waiting for the perfect moment to slip out of the house unnoticed. If all goes well, Evanora won’t notice her absence until the morning and, by then, she’ll be long gone. Agatha has said her goodbyes and she’s as close to peace as she thinks she could be.</p><p>In her rush to make it to the front door, though, she forgets to skip the fourth step. It creaks, the sound echoing down the hallway. </p><p>Agatha knows suddenly, like she knows the rhythm of their garden as it lives and dies, that she’s not leaving without a fight. Standing at the bottom of the stairs, she hates herself for being foolish enough to hope that she could slip away easily and quietly. She’s been fighting her entire life, after all. </p><p>Why would she stop now?</p><p>Her mother is there in seconds, almost impossibly fast. Agatha is too caught up in the moment to consider the strangeness of that—to wonder why her mother is lifting her arms higher and higher as her daughter scrambles towards the exit. </p><p>“You dare try to leave my house?” Evanora questions. Her voice is quieter than usual, low and calm like she’s already won whatever game they’ve just begun. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even have time to raise a hand.</p><p>There are bolts of magic jumping into Evanora’s palms, alive and vibrant, and then Agatha is being thrown backwards. Her body slams against the door. The wood cracks. Her hands fall uselessly to her sides and ropes of magic snake around to immobilize them. </p><p>Agatha thinks a window explodes somewhere further in the house, the sound of glass shattering almost as loud as the screaming in her mind. </p><p>She fights to lift her hand and winces at the pain that cuts into her wrist—not a dream. She stares at Evanora. Her mother is nearly unrecognizable. Her hands are overflowing with vibrant blue threads of dark magic and it makes Agatha feel sick. She hasn’t seen her mother use this much magic in years, not since she discovered that Agatha could steal it from her. </p><p>“I should have killed you the moment you left my body,” Evanora hisses. Agatha’s heart pounds ruthlessly against her ribs. She had been so close to making it out, just feet from the threshold.</p><p>She forces her muscles to relax against the force of her mother’s magic. Adrenaline slips into her veins with a vengeance and it immediately sharpens her senses. She flips her hair out of her face and throws on her most unflappable smirk. </p><p>“Wow”—she scoffs—”that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.” She rolls her eyes as casually as she can, familiar with the anger that action so often evokes in her mother.</p><p>When Evanora glares at her, Agatha quickly tenses and relaxes her hands. She tests the edges of the magic wrapped around her arms and legs, wondering just how much force she would need to break it. </p><p>Her mother may be older than her, but Agatha is willing to bet <em> she’s </em> stronger.</p><p>Evanora starts screaming again, another dramatic monologue about how Agatha is a danger to everyone around her. Her hands fling out at her sides, face red and neck tense. Agatha feels the magic around her loosen just a bit, her mother’s anger seeping into the words she speaks, and uses the distraction to push back. </p><p>She tries to be subtle at first but soon, purple is spilling from her chest and ripping the cords from her limbs. Her magic is full of darkness, eager to burn and end and bury. </p><p>Agatha gave up on avoiding evil long ago.</p><p>The restraints fall away with a snap, crashing to the ground and cracking as if they have physical form. Her power is no longer dull and soft like it was in the past. It is shockingly vibrant, more so than usual and, unlike her mother’s magic, it is not fed by hatred or anger. It has only ever held one directive—survival.</p><p>Agatha raises a hand. She won’t make a mistake this time. </p><p>Predictably, her mother screams. She sends a bolt of deep blue soaring towards Agatha. It crashes into her chest like lightning, sending sparks up her body and setting her hair on end. The room fills with blinding light but Agatha does not only feel pain at the rush of unknown power—she wants more.</p><p>Agatha pulls on the magic, hands outstretched as bolts of power crash into her chest. The instinct is there, just as it has always been. It is as natural as breathing and Agatha wonders briefly, how anything that feels this <em> right </em>could be wrong.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha thinks this is it. Evanora’s face pales and Agatha thinks her mother will soon crash to the ground, her magic ripped from her body but then, something shifts. Memories of Agatha’s early childhood are suddenly at the forefront of her mind, crashing into her with physical force. Magic seeps into her ribs and memories accompanying it, rushing into her mind and making the room around her spin. </p><p>
<em> Evanora, smiling down at her with a face so much younger and shoulders so much lighter. She shakes a toy above Agatha, titling her head as she gazes at the tiny baby in her arms. Agatha shuffles towards her mother as she attempts to walk for the first time, eyes wide and curious. Evanora’s arms are outstretched, displaying warm hands that promise protection, not violence. She coos and exclaims when her daughter gets closer, purple sparks bursting on the surface of her skin. A worried crease appears between Evanora’s eyebrows. </em>
</p><p>Agatha slams her eyes shut as she remembers her mother’s laughter with an impossible clarity, bright and full.</p><p>They are moments that occurred years before Evanora decided Agatha was evil, back when she thought her daughter might still live up to her name—<em>Agathos. </em>They are moments that Agatha does not recall, aside from blurry flashes and distorted sounds.</p><p>They must be coming from Evanora herself.</p><p>Agatha rubs a hand against her chest and blinks rapidly. Her mother screams from just across the room, fighting and pulling back as her power is stolen, but Agatha barely hears her. She feels miles away. </p><p>The feeling of Evanora’s magic is suddenly suffocating; the joy, the laughter, the love. It is everything Agatha <em> should </em>have felt and consequently, everything she did not. Witches were never meant to be solitary, after all. Covens are formed and bonds are woven—that is the way it has always been. </p><p>She convinced herself that Alice and Jen made up for it, that they erased all the pain and isolation she had felt at her mother’s rejection, but nothing can scrub the memories from her mind or the blood from her hands. Hating her mother now, staring up at her and despising her, doesn’t erase the fact that she loved her once.</p><p>Agatha hesitates. </p><p>For just a moment, her resolve dips. The sudden agony she feels for her lost childhood, the bond she should have had with her mother, <em> a coven, </em>is somehow more devastating than the fire searing into her chest. Her grip on her mother’s magic weakens.</p><p>After that, all she feels is pain.</p><p><em> “Malum magicae, inclusum et occultatum!”  </em>Evanora’s face is red. Her hands are shaking from the effort of having so much magic taken from her, but she jumps to her feet quickly. </p><p>Agatha is certain, with a sharp rush of pain that has little to do with the cracked wooden panels scraping up and down her sides, that her mother was waiting for this.</p><p>Evanora waves a hand around her, candles appearing on the ground and bursting into unnaturally high flames. She pushes her palm towards Agatha, intricate patterns swirling in blue from her fingertips. </p><p>
<em> “Semper in corde!”  </em>
</p><p>Agatha crumples to the ground. </p><p>She has never felt agony quite like this. She finds herself thinking of the book she read many years ago, the one she found in the attic.</p><p>
<em> The magic that lives within a witch is as necessary to her survival as the pumping of her heart and the expansion of her lungs. </em>
</p><p>The words are on a loop in Agatha’s mind, banging around her skull and breathing down her neck. The ripped floorboards below her dig into her back and she winces. Pressure builds in her entire body and she worries for a moment that she will shatter, power spilling from her body instead of blood. </p><p>Then, the pressure releases. Magic, for the first time, abandons her. It simply disappears, draining from her hands and making her feel impossibly weak. She grabs at it, hands scrambling, but she cannot wield it and she cannot pull it back. It is not being pulled away from her<em>—</em>quite the opposite, actually.</p><p>It rushes up towards the center of her chest and seeps into her ribcage. Slowly, she begins to feel less of it.</p><p>In her shock, Agatha can’t translate the Latin her mother spoke but somehow, she knows what is happening to her. Her power is being pushed inside of her, so distant that she can no longer feel it. It is like a cage has been erected around her magic, one she cannot even begin to touch. She lifts a trembling hand and squeezes her eyes closed.</p><p>Nothing happens. There is no rush of purple, no familiar warmth to greet her, and Agatha can do nothing but sob. </p><p>“Please,” she begs, barely conscious of her own speech. Her magic is gone—the only thing she can count on, her only way out of Salem—moved just beyond her reach. Inside of her still, but locked away. Her limbs ache and she finds that without any power to defend herself, she does not have the energy to stand. “I can be good.”</p><p>Agatha knows the words are useless but she finds herself saying them anyway.</p><p>“No, you cannot.” Evanora shakes her head. She steps forward carefully, not quite leaving the circle she has drawn around herself, and lifts a hand to the back of her neck. She unclips her necklace, the one she always wears, and holds it up. Agatha used to love it when she was younger, staring at the three women and wondering who they were; what stories they could tell.</p><p>Evanora grabs a pen from somewhere, or perhaps she creates it from thin air. Agatha isn’t quite sure. She can’t see much through the tears that blur her vision, but they are impossible to stop. </p><p>There is a gaping hole in her chest, a cavern where part of her has been obscured and hidden away and for a moment, she cannot fathom how her heart will keep beating without it.</p><p>Evanora raises her gaze, meeting her daughter’s eyes for the last time. She whispers something under her breath, something Agatha can’t quite hear, and then flicks the pen over her necklace. Her movements are precise and careful, tiny loops and sharp lines.</p><p>She drops the necklace in the center of the circle. </p><p>
<em> “Signum.” </em>

<p>Someone is yelling. Multiple people, actually. Agatha tries to shy away from them, the noise that erupts on either side of her overwhelming and loud, but she finds that she can’t. </p><p>“What’s wrong with her?” a frazzled voice echoes from across the room. It is young, just beginning to deepen. It makes Agatha think of candles and graffiti, for whatever reason.</p><p>“She’s unconscious. Are you blind?” Another voice joins the fray. It is full of badly masked anxiety. Agatha hears someone scoff and notices a clacking sound, bracelets sliding up and down. </p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Everyone <em> stop!” </em>This voice is familiar and warm—protection. Agatha wants to reach out towards it, but she can’t move. She tries to open her eyes, flashes of light moving rapidly back and forth under her eyelids, but the motion feels impossible. She is caught somewhere between sleeping and waking, her body unnaturally heavy.</p><p>“Lilia, what happened?” The stressed voice from earlier moves back and forth, passing from Agatha’s left side to her right. Heels click against wood.</p><p>“I regret not being able to tell you, my child, but I was unable to.” This voice is old and perfectly level, the calm at the eye of the storm. It reminds Agatha of the soft turning of pages and the sound of chiming glass.</p><p>“What did the sigil do?” A new voice appears, floating directly above Agatha. It is raspy and low, and makes her heart jump in her chest for reasons she does not understand. Agatha feels hands underneath her head, lifting it onto something soft. Fingers slide through her hair and rest on the sides of her neck, just under her chin.</p><p>“It made her forget, didn’t it?” the warmest voice asks, the one that makes Agatha think of steel and strong hands. “Her <em> mother </em>did this?”</p><p>No one answers.</p><p>The voice starts speaking faster then, like it is eager to fill the silence. “I <em> knew </em> something was wrong when she wasn’t doing any magic! Why didn’t you believe me? She wouldn’t have just—“</p><p>“This is perfectly normal, no need to worry,” the ancient voice cuts in. It gets closer to Agatha, moving above her left ear. “Sigils are tricky bits of magic, after all.” </p><p>
<em> Magic?  </em>
</p><p>Suddenly, there are memories in the chaos. They slip into Agatha’s mind with ease, masking the old ones as if they have always been there. Laughing with Alice and Jen becomes casting spells with Alice and Jen. Evanora screaming at her becomes Evanora waving a hand at her and sending bolts of blue magic towards her chest.</p><p>They rewrite themselves quickly, as if a dam has broken. Memories play and replay in Agatha’s mind like recordings on an old television. </p><p>
<em> Rio reclines in the back garden. The flower in her hand bursts to life, wisps of green magic taking form as she smirks. Jen barges into Agatha’s house just hours after she arrives. Pink sparks dance across her jewelry and jump onto Agatha’s cheek when she slaps her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Alice hugs Agatha for the first time in years, familiar orange shields wrapping tight around her shoulders. Rio’s magic, so full of creation, burns her lips and hands with life. Rio kisses her, power pounding against Agatha’s ribs and begging to be released. </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fly open, but she isn’t really looking out of them. </p><p>Everything feels distant, like she’s watching it happen through faded glass. She is reminded of that night in her apartment, right before she left for Salem. She had stared out her tiny window and watched the crystalline, impossible snowflakes fall while an unsettling certainty took form in her. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t hear Alice anxiously calling her name or register the warmth of Rio’s hand gently closing around her wrist. She doesn't feel the wood of the front door under her palm as she jerks it open, pulling against the relentless, strong wind. </p><p>She doesn’t feel anything. </p><p>Not even when she realizes that it’s snowing—<em> really </em>snowing. It’s something she should probably be aware of. She should remember the frigid air outside and the winter weather warning that blasted across her cell phone just hours earlier, but she does not. </p><p>The storm howls in her ears but she does not hear it. Her body is certainly cold, the temperature dipping to nearly freezing, but she cannot feel it. She is frozen solid, and not just from the cold. Her emotions are suspended somewhere far away; they cannot touch her like this.</p><p>It doesn’t stop the memories, though. Agatha remembers things that she didn’t remember before, rewritten experiences and moments distorting her mental timeline. She is both young and old, terrified and liberated. It takes her time to reorient herself—to remember who and where she is amongst the cacophony in her mind.</p><p>The first eighteen years of her life seem different now, a tapestry of memories sewn together with magic suddenly visible. Agatha remembers her mother with a startling amount of clarity and, if she could feel anything, would probably wince when she recalls the night of her eighteen birthday.</p><p>As the barrage of new information begins to slow, Agatha recalls the sigil her mother cast; the same one she tossed into the fire like a woman possessed. Agatha trembles. Her mind has been playing tricks on her for decades, cursed into ripping all memories of magic away and burying them. </p><p>
<em> They were taken from her. </em>
</p><p>Agatha doesn’t realize that she’s sitting in the snow until she begins to feel a chill in her legs. It works its way up her body slowly, until she can eventually hear her own, gasping breaths. She stares down at her hands, shudders at the lack of power there, and can feel nothing but grief. </p><p>It hadn’t been obvious before, her memories of how it felt to have magic ripped away but now, it is all too much; the silence pressing against her ears, the eternal coldness of her chest, the lack of power bursting from her fingertips when she calls it forth. Agatha finds that even with the vivid memory of her mother’s spell close to the surface of her mind, she is disappointed all the same. </p><p>The chill of snow against burning hot skin is enough to drag Agatha back to the present. The glass falls away, shattered and broken. Grief that has been locked away for decades is now suspended in falling snowflakes. </p><p>The part of Agatha that feels twelve years old and terrified wishes that she could rebuild the divide—so she wouldn’t have to feel it. She can’t, though, because there’s someone in the snow with her. Hands that she hadn't noticed before are pressing warmth into her back. </p><p>Rio’s hands drift to Agatha’s neck. Her thumbs rub up and down, their movement soothing and soft. There is magic there, encouraging her to breathe. Agatha does, but the air is cold and sharp in her throat. </p><p>It is nothing compared to the roaring pain in her chest; the knowledge that her mind was under someone else’s thumb, that her experience was distorted and false, that her own magic was locked away inside of her and she had no memory of it at all. </p><p>When she begins to sob, no one can hear her over the roaring wind.</p><hr/><p>Eventually, Rio guides Agatha back into the house. When she pushes the door open, both of them soaking wet and shivering, the house is quieter than it had been earlier. The lights are low, only a couple lamps flickering.</p><p>Agatha can hear Jen and Alice talking softly in the kitchen. She sighs, rubbing a hand up and down her face. Her eyes burn from crying and her lips feel raw from the cold air. The memories continue to trickle in, flashes appearing behind her eyes and lost words floating to her ears, but she does her best to ignore it.</p><p>“Here.” Agatha pulls her suitcase from the entryway closet and flicks it open, tossing a pair of pajamas in Rio’s direction. Her freezing muscles protest. “These will probably fit you.”</p><p>Rio smirks. Even with her hair tangled and stuck to the side of her face, it makes Agatha’s stomach do a little flip. Her cheeks and the tip of her nose are a bright, chilled red. “You want to see me in your clothes?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha deadpans. </p><p>She feels empty—she doesn’t imagine she will ever be able to cry again. All of her tears are currently becoming part of Salem’s water cycle, after all. The thought makes her laugh, a chuckle bubbling up in the center of her chest. It feels absurd, to laugh at a moment like this, but Agatha finds that it is the only thing she can do.</p><p>Rio stares at her for a moment, a furrow developing between her eyebrows like she’s debating whether or not to say something, before she eventually disappears into the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha slips in after Rio is done, groaning at the ache in her arms as she pulls off her soaking clothes. “What was I thinking? Running off into a snowstorm?” she mumbles, debating just cutting her shirt off with the pair of scissors she knows she keeps under the sink.</p><p>When she finally manages, defrosting her freezing body under warm water and replacing her frozen-solid clothes with soft pajamas, Agatha looks in the mirror. Her eyes are still red and swollen, her skin abnormally pale. </p><p>They hadn’t actually been outside for that long, Rio magically warming the air around them and dragging Agatha indoors before she got frostbite, but not even Rio can stop a snowstorm. At least, Agatha doesn’t <em> think </em>she can. She pulls a wide-tooth comb through her hair with a wince. </p><p>When she leaves the bathroom, Agatha finds Rio reclining on the couch with a cup of hot tea. The steam floats over her face, making her features look distorted, something akin to the unsure surface of moving water. Agatha settles down next to her, taking the other cup from the coffee table. </p><p>She kicks her feet up and stares into the fire. The back of the fireplace, the wall that encloses the roaring flames, has a small nick in the bottom left brick—the only sign that anything happened, that any sigil was ever offered to it. Agatha stares at it, head tilting and eyes squinting as she maps its shape and depth with her eyes. </p><p>Her head snaps up after a moment, a noise drawing her attention. Lilia steps out from the kitchen, a matching mug cradled in her hands. Her tea smells strongly of lavender, the scent dancing across Agatha’s senses quickly and then disappearing.</p><p>She sits across from them and clears her throat. Agatha’s body is suddenly tense, muscles that had just begun to calm suddenly tight again. She stares at Lilia with a sudden, flaring anger. Her hands clench and unclench. She is defensive even in shambles. </p><p>Rio rests a hand on her knee and Agatha exhales at the contact, the soft reassurance. She hadn’t realized she was holding her breath. Rio raises a single eyebrow and Agatha nods, turning to face Lilia.</p><p>“I imagine you have questions,” she says softly, hands clasped together in front of her. Agatha finds her eyes drawn to her rings, the ornate golden charms that adorn Lilia’s fingers. She nods.</p><p>“Why did you not tell me before?” She tries to keep her voice level, just it quivers and threatens to break all the same. </p><p>“Your mother swore me to secrecy.” Lilia’s eyes are unfocused, like she has travelled miles away despite sitting directly in front of them. “She wanted me to help her with the spell she cast.” </p><p>“She wanted to make sure it would hold even when she died.” Rio says, and Agatha swears her eyes glow in the light of the fireplace.</p><p>Lilia nods. “She bound me in the process.”</p><p>“That doesn’t explain why you told me <em> now</em>.” Agatha’s hands begin to shake, and she can’t be sure if it’s due to her brush with hypothermia or simply the rage bubbling up in her chest. Rio squeezes her knee harder, the focused pressure keeping her from drifting away.</p><p>“There was a condition to my silence, dear. There had to be.” Lilia sounds sad now, almost regretful.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to ask why, to demand an explanation, but then bites her tongue because <em> she knows why</em>. Years of studying magical theory and reading ancient spell books taught her that magic is not endless or boundless. It requires end-points and limits. </p><p>Her intense devotion to the study of witchcraft and witchlore imbued her with this knowledge, but she also knows it differently now. It is innate. She remembers what it feels like to cast a finite spell and promise it a resolution.</p><p>“There always is,” is what she says instead.</p><p>“The exact wording was hidden deep in the magic, but I believe my silence was held until you returned to Salem and felt…” she trails off with a sigh, her eyes slipping closed.</p><p>“Something she never imagined I would feel here,” Agatha finishes for her. The storm howls just beyond the windows, a great creaking sound moving up and down the house.</p><p>“I knew as soon as the sigil had broken.” Lilia rubs the center of her chest with a pained wince. Agatha recognizes the motion; the now-familiar ache of restrictive magic. She nods, her anger towards Lilia growing and changing inside of her, morphing into something shaped much more like her mother. </p><p>The three of them sit in silence for a moment, the gravity of what Lilia has said sinking into their skin. </p><p>“I killed her, then,” Agatha rasps, pressing her palms against her eyes to stop their burning.</p><p>
<em>Evanora, flinging her arms out and chanting a spell full of dark magic—the kind that has consequences. Evanora, dead 20 years later. Evanora, who did not have a funeral.</em>
</p><p>Agatha has been searching for days, pleading with gods she doesn’t believe in and grasping at desperate straws for an answer, and now she has one. Hidden in the crash of metal against stone is the truth and sometimes, the truth is worse than any alternative. </p><p>“Agatha, you—” Rio starts, but Agatha raises a hand to stop her. She doesn’t know if she could take Rio defending her right now; she thinks she might shatter all over again.</p><p>“Your mother knew the consequences of using such dark magic,” Lilia says, and Agatha’s eyes squeeze closed at her words. </p><p>“No one can sustain it forever,” Rio adds.</p><p>“Isn’t that ironic?” Agatha jokes desperately. </p><p>No one laughs.</p><p>Lilia stands and presses a hand to Agatha’s shoulder. She flinches but does not move away. “Sleep well, my dear. Do not let it freeze you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrow, but Agatha understands. Lilia leaves then, and the pressure in the rooms seems to lower, tension seeping away into the snow.</p><p>“Everyone else crashed in the guest rooms,” Rio says after a moment. Her voice is serious, like she’s giving an after-action report. ”Snowstorm and all.”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?” Rio asks, hands closed around her cup of tea. She blows on it gently.</p><p>“No,” Agatha scoffs. She doesn’t know what she wants.</p><p>Rio reaches over then, fingers closing tight around hers. Agatha finds that she doesn’t have the strength to resist, letting Rio pull her. Her head lands on Rio’s shoulder and she curls inward without thinking, basking in her constant warmth—which she now recognizes as magic. </p><p>She lets her eyelids slip closed against the growing force of exhaustion. </p><p>“I guess I got my answer,” she whispers, her mouth close to Rio’s ear. “What happened to her, I mean.”</p><p>Rio is silent for a moment.</p><p>“Do you remember what we talked about in the file room?” she asks. “When everyone made fun of my ancient labels but you.” Her voice takes on a fonder quality then, an audible smile on her lips.</p><p>“My <em> calling?” </em>Agatha’s eyes are closed, so she can’t see that Rio nods, but she feels her head move up and down.</p><p>“I think you came back to Salem for something more than just your mother.” Rio speaks fast, the words spilling out of her with ease, and Agatha wonders what invisible timer she’s fighting. “You’re here for yourself. She doesn’t get to decide what you do, not anymore.”</p><p>They sit in silence for a few more minutes, their bodies fused together as if by molten metal. Eventually, Rio slips out from under Agatha and takes her hand again, pulling her towards one of the rooms on the first floor. </p><p>They slip inside and Agatha does not protest. When she finds herself tucked under the covers, Rio resting just inches away, she finds the courage to speak again. She recalls admiring the incredibly ugly Christmas tree just hours earlier, Rio pressed happily against her on the couch. The memory feels years away, but what she had <em> felt </em>is just as real.</p><p>“It was happiness, right? The condition of the spell?”</p><p>Agatha can’t make out Rio’s expression in the darkness but she somehow feels her grief, the wild emotions that radiate from her in waves of palpable magic. Rio inches closer, flicking her hand out. Green light erupts from her fingertips. </p><p>A flower emerges, spotted with vines and soft petals. Agatha reaches out for it immediately, gasping when her hand meets magic. It makes her ache, tears spilling down her cheeks without her permission. It is beautiful, more vibrant and real than any of her new memories.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio whispers. “It could have been love.”</p><hr/><p>
<em> Agatha’s hands are clenched tight around metal bars, palms burning against an immovable cage. She screams and rages, kicking her feet against the sides with seemingly endless energy. Her mother floats just outside, mouth spread in a wicked, eerie kind of grin. She reminds Agatha of the evil witch in nearly all of her favorite childhood movies, the supervillain who steals the princess or takes over the castle. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I thought you were dead,” Agatha spits. Evanora reaches out for her, arm dipping through the metal bars with no effort. Her hand is bigger now, impossibly huge. It wraps around Agatha’s entire torso and squeezes. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Rise and shine!”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The words do not come from Evanora. They are much sweeter, a bright spot in the endless darkness. Agatha turns. She reaches for them, arms pushing against her mother’s grasp. Slowly, the light begins to seep in. </em>
</p><p>The window is open, curtains pushed aside to reveal a barren, empty guest room. Evanora never bothered decorating it, simply painting the walls a boring cream and adorning the bed with whatever plain sheets she found in the attic. Agatha takes it all in for the first time, eyes squinting against sunlight as she waves. She doesn’t think she ever came in here as a child, and she certainly didn’t notice anything last night.</p><p>
<em> Last night. </em>
</p><p>Rio coughs, gently drawing Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“Was it all a dream?” Agatha asks, her voice hoarse from sleep. She knows it wasn’t, that the memories she now holds are true, but she asks anyway.</p><p>“No.” Rio shakes her head. She holds out a plate of pancakes, handing it to Agatha. “I wanted to let you sleep longer, but you seemed…”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha shoves the memory of her nightmare away, trying desperately to forget her mother’s wicked, distorted face. She cuts one of the pancakes and shoves it into her mouth, the slightly sour strawberry sauce a welcome distraction. Rio drops onto the bed next to her, reaching over and stealing a blueberry from her plate.</p><p>When Agatha finally climbs out of bed, stretching her tight body and pushing the door open, she finds herself face to face with Alice, who throws her arms around Agatha with no hesitation. Agatha leans into it with an eye roll.</p><p>“I was so worried! Jen wouldn’t let me see you last night. She said”—Alice pulls away and shapes her fingers into imaginary air quotes—“<em>you needed rest.” </em>She laughs when she says it, but Agatha sees the tightness around her eyes and feels the presence of protective magic at her back.</p><p>Agatha lets herself smile, even though it feels wrong and foreign. She drags a hand through her hair and meets Jen’s eyes from across the room. </p><p>“You really forgot?” Jen asks. Her mouth is twisted, like she’s holding some words back. Agatha is grateful that she doesn’t have to explain everything, at least. It seems Rio did that for her.</p><p>“I remember a lot of things, now,” Agatha says slowly, trying to pick the best words. “I think there are still some things buried, though. Memories waiting to be triggered.”</p><p>Jen nods like this makes sense; like she is suddenly an expert on the magical suppression of memories. Agatha wouldn’t be surprised if she’s read an entire book on it since last night, actually. Perhaps she magically summoned one. That possibly still seems insane to Agatha.</p><p>Alice drapes an arm over her shoulder. “We’ll just have to remind you, then.”</p><p>Agatha looks between her friends, at Alice’s strong shoulders and Jen’s slender hands. There is magic there, breathing life into their bodies, and Agatha had been completely clueless; her mind always ripping the memories away, cursed into rewriting them. They are there now, and she has to stop herself from staring.</p><p>With Alice’s arm warm around her back, Agatha has the courage to ask a question that has been bouncing around her head since she woke up on the living room floor with a killer headache and full of grief. </p><p>“Do you think it’s possible?” she asks quietly, so softly that Jen can’t hear. She seems to take the hint, heading into the dining room where Rio is humming a song that Agatha doesn’t recognize. “For me to get my magic back?”</p><p>Agatha watches her expression shift and change. She imagines that Alice is deciding whether she should tell her the truth or not, making a silent assessment of Agatha’s mental state. </p><p>“I haven’t heard of anything like this, Agatha.” Alice shakes her head<em>. </em>“But I’m not an expert on dark magic.”</p><p>“I remember.” Agatha smirks despite the sinking dread in her stomach. She remembers Alice’s fear of dark magic when they were younger, her terrified expression when Agatha first showed them a dark spell she had learned. </p><p>“Hey, aren’t you a professor of magic?” Alice asks playfully, nudging Agatha with her elbow.</p><p>“Not <em> magic, </em>Alice—witchlore.” Agatha rolls her eyes but silently, she does wonder if any of her research could be of help. Perhaps the answer she needs is hidden in her office, written in a journal or scrawled in an ancient tome.</p><p>“Well, if anyone can figure it out, it’s you,” Alice says. Agatha shakes her head and tries to ignore the compliment.</p><p>“Alice, I didn’t know magic <em> existed </em>until last night.” Agatha pushes away from her with a scoff and heads to the dining table.</p><p>“It’s just like riding a bike!” Alice smiles, sliding into one of the dining room chairs next to Rio. </p><p>Jen raises her eyebrows. “I don’t even want to know.”</p><p>“We should play a board game!” Alice exclaims suddenly. “We can’t exactly go anywhere.” She absentmindedly waves a hand toward the front door and pulls out her phone.</p><p>Agatha imagines her typing <em> best board game to play when your best friend realizes her entire life has been a lie </em>and smirks. Rio quickly seconds her plea and Jen objects, obviously. The three of them descend into familiar banter.</p><p>“Where’s Lilia?” Agatha asks suddenly, noticing her absence at the table. She assumed Lilia had also stayed over last night. Alice pauses mid rant.</p><p>“Oh, she left last night,” Jen says. “Not a big fan of sleeping at other people’s houses. She has her routine, you know?”</p><p>“Wait.” Agatha points at the window, eyeing the multiple feet of snow outside. “How did she ever get home in the storm?”</p><p>Rio smirks, leaning over to whisper in her ear. “Magic, Agatha.”</p><p>Her breath is hot on Agatha’s neck and it sends a buzz up her spine. Her face burns, cheeks certainly turning red, and she playfully shoves Rio away before she does something insane like bite at her earlobe. It isn’t effective at all, Rio’s chair ending up even closer than it had been before. </p><p>Jen and Alice share a knowing look.</p><p>Agatha wants to bury her face in her hands and disappear. She realizes with a jolt that she actually<em> shared a bed </em>with Rio last night, although she had been too drained and frazzled to feel anything about it. She certainly makes up for that now, a roaring desire in the back of her mind sparking to life. </p><p>A door down the hallway creaks open slowly, drawing everyone’s attention. Agatha is confused for a moment, unsure who else could possibly be here. </p><p>“Billy!” Rio smiles at him as he shuffles into the kitchen and drops into a seat across from her, his hair all messed up from sleep. </p><p>Agatha’s stomach drops. She had forgotten he was even here. </p><p>
<em> Lines on the floorboards, faint and white. Careful steps. Laughter. Chalk under the couch; a dusting of powder. Burnt candles, too many. The letter in Agatha’s hands, trembling and sealed with blue—runes spray-pained on buildings and scrawled in notebooks, elegant and practiced.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Billy, the young and troubled witch. </em>
</p><p>None of it made sense before, when Agatha’s mind was thinking itself in circles that always led to dead ends but now, she can’t believe she missed it. She leans forward slowly, wishing more than anything that purple sparks would erupt from her hand, and lifts a finger. She points it at Billy.</p><p>It is the last missing piece of the insane puzzle that Agatha has found herself in and, against all the odds, she’s willing to bet she’s right.</p><p>“It was you.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha doesn’t hunt—but if she did, she imagines she would be captivated by one moment in particular: the instant in which prey realizes they have been caught.</p><p>She is familiar with this moment, a brief freezing and reevaluating. Professor Harkness has watched her students flounder and sputter when presented with accusations of plagiarism; blaming their friends, their parents, and most absurdly, her. She has caught historians red-handed, forging documents and fudging dates in search of fame.</p><p>Although the myth that people look to the left when lying was long ago debunked, Agatha still thinks herself adept at sensing the truth of a matter. </p><p>The truly awful part is that she never noticed the truth hiding within herself<em>. </em></p><hr/><p>“Wait, <em> what</em>?” Alice gapes. She looks between Billy and Agatha rapidly, short hair swishing at her chin.</p><p>“How do you think I ended up here years after my mother’s death?” Agatha asks. “Something brought me here. Someone sent that letter.” Jen grimaces.</p><p>“Salem is more powerful than you might think, Agatha,” Jen whispers, like she’s trying to convince herself.</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha glares at her. If anyone is intimately familiar with the power of Salem, it’s her.</p><p>She glances back at Rio, who seems absurdly amused by the whole thing. “What reason would Billy have to trick you into returning into Salem?” she asks, tiny sparks of magic jumping between her fingertips. </p><p>The sight is still surreal to Agatha, as if she’s dreaming and hasn’t quite woken up yet. Rio’s magic is bright green, like new grass in the spring, and reminds Agatha of the flower she watched bloom amongst the snow.</p><p>“Hey! Billy is right here! ” He stands suddenly, hands held up in front of him in surrender. Agatha rolls her eyes; she doesn’t even have her magic.</p><p>“He brought me here. I couldn’t see it before”—she waves a hand at her head to explain—”but it was definitely him.” </p><p>She thinks about the runes on the abandoned building next to Lilia’s shop and the hastily scribbled shapes in Billy’s notebook. They match up with the seal on the letter she received.</p><p>“I didn’t do anything!” Billy cries. Agatha tilts her head. He seems genuine.</p><p>“Agatha, he didn’t even know you,” Alice reasons, and Jen nods along with her. Agatha thinks back to that day in Rio’s office, to her very first interaction with Billy.</p><p>
<em> “I’m Billy!” he chirps. “Sorry I didn’t introduce myself earlier. I didn't realize you were, well, you.”  </em>
</p><p>“You did. That day, in the mortuary, you knew who I was.”</p><p>Billy pales, wringing his hands together anxiously.</p><p>Alice rounds on him, mouth open. “Billy? You did?” </p><p>He nods slowly.</p><p>“How?” Jen asks. His face gets even paler.</p><p>“Well…” He gulps. “You know I like witchcraft, right? I was doing research and this house”—he waves a hand—”is kind of famous? For being… haunted?” </p><p>Agatha remembers meeting Rio for the first time, her brief comment that she was staying in a haunted house, and things begin to make sense. She stands, moving to the entryway. Everyone freezes to watch as she lifts a hand and sweeps it around her, mimicking sharp lines that were washed away days ago during her cleaning frenzy.</p><p>“So you summoned me?” she asks. Alice gasps.</p><p>“No!” Billy moves towards her, hands splayed wide. “I just wanted to use the <em> power </em>here, you know?”</p><p>“What could you possibly want with the <em> power of my house?!” </em> Agatha shoots back, mind spinning. She rubs her hands together and feels the phantom brush of chalk—white fingers, overlapping shapes. </p><p>“I just wanted my family back, okay?” he cries, voice breaking. “I didn’t mean to summon you, or whatever!” </p><p>The room goes quiet. Alice rubs a hand through her hair, sighing. Agatha remembers her saying that Billy’s family died and that he started getting into trouble after that. </p><p>She arches an eyebrow and imagines a book rising up in front of her as she begins to speak, her voice taking on the tone it often does when she lectures. “Witchcraft does not occur without intent.”</p><p>“Then it wasn’t me! Some other person summoned you. Maybe an enemy. You have plenty of those, right?” he shoots back.</p><p>Agatha jerks forward but stops when hands come to rest on her waist. Rio’s grip burns through her, goosebumps jumping to her arms. Her train of thought derails suddenly. </p><p>“Don’t blast the kid, Agatha.” Rio’s voice is low and teasing, but Agatha thinks she’s probably serious. Billy does work with her, after all.</p><p>“You know I couldn’t even if I wanted to,” she hisses back. Billy’s eyes widen. </p><p>“I wouldn’t doubt you,” Rio croons, like she’s betting on it.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. <em> Distraction</em>. She returns to the task at hand, points a finger at Billy and does her best intimidating professor glare. “Explain.”</p><p>“I did the ritual here, you’re right,” Billy confesses. “I found it in a book.” </p><p>Agatha holds out a hand. Billy reaches for his bag and drops a small red book into her open palm. The cover is ancient and frayed, barely legible text printed in gold on the spine. She flips it open and finds the page quickly. The corner is dog-eared.</p><p>“A spell to resurrect the dead?” Rio gasps, peering over Agatha’s shoulder. Jen and Alice are there too, moving to stare at the complex spell. “Where did you get this?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “The basement.” She knows this book, flipped through it once many years ago. She turns to smirk at Rio. “Learned from the best?”</p><p>“You could’ve died!” Alice cries. She looks heartbroken. Jen runs a hand across her back.</p><p>“Billy, why wouldn’t you ask us about this?” </p><p>Agatha watches the three of them, the care in their expressions, and has to look away. She stares at the book instead, attempting to translate the Latin in her mind. </p><p>“What is it?” Rio’s eyebrows pull together.</p><p>“If he did that spell”—she gestures to the book—”and summoned me instead, he did it without direct intent.” Agatha thinks about reading <em> The Taking of Power. </em>She remembers tracing her finger down the domains of witchcraft, eager to learn more. There was one, at the very bottom, that was crossed out.</p><p>“You think it’s..?” </p><p>Agatha nods. “Chaos magic.”</p><p>Billy’s head snaps up, then. “What?”</p><p>“We should sit down,” Alice says, an arm around Billy’s shoulders as she leads him back to the kitchen and directs him into a chair.</p><p>“He didn’t know?” Rio asks quietly.</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head and finds that her anger flees as quickly as it arrived. She thinks about the letter, a rune pressed in blue wax that dragged her all the way here. “He didn’t know.”</p><hr/><p>“I wish I could kiss you," Agatha says, the words rushing past her lips before she can stop them. </p><p>She kicks her feet up on the coffee table and stares at the ceiling to hide her blush. The television flickers in the corner, some old black and white movie playing out across the screen.</p><p>She can hear Billy, Jen, and Alice arguing in the kitchen; mostly about the legalities of breaking into Agatha’s house and how incredibly reckless his recent actions have been. Agatha still isn’t quite sure how to feel about any of it. She’s had a couple hours to stew, staring out the frozen windows and drinking the scalding chicken noodle soup Rio had insisted on making. </p><p>She’s full of restless energy, trapped in her mother’s absurdly haunted house with the most infuriatingly enthusiastic company—including the boy who effectively uprooted her entire life—and Rio, who she can’t even <em> kiss</em>. </p><p>Even if she could leave, though, there isn’t anywhere else for her to go. </p><p>“Why can’t you?” Rio asks. She is lounging next to Agatha on the couch, the two of them attempting to give Alice and Jen space to parent their pseudo-child turned criminal. Her laptop is perched in her lap, where she has been typing up a blog post about the different types of Elderberry shrub native to Salem. Agatha notices a section for both <em> Sambucus canadensis </em> and <em> Sambucus racemosa.  </em></p><p>Rio leans forward, her lips curling up in the corners. Her laptop slides off her lap and onto the couch beside her.</p><p>“Because I would”—Agatha prepares to feel like an idiot—”feel it.”</p><p>“The magic?”</p><p>Agatha nods, relief blooming in her chest at how easily Rio understands. She continues to avoid eye contact.</p><p>Rio shifts next to her, silent for a moment, and then speaks. “You know, my family wasn’t magic.” </p><p>“What?” Agatha stares at her, everything she knows about magical inheritance rushing to her forefront of her mind. As far as she knows, magical power is intricately connected to land and blood. It is hidden in broken soil and flowing in purple-blue veins. “How is that possible?”</p><p>“There’s a type of magic that you don’t know about—so guarded that it doesn’t appear in the books you’ve read.” Rio looks up suddenly, her eye color shifting before Agatha’s waiting gaze. She gasps. Rio’s irises take on a deeper, greener color. There is gold there, too, like sunlight reflecting off a still body of water. “It doesn’t need shared ancestry to travel.”</p><p>“Life,” Agatha whispers. </p><p>Speaking it too loudly would feel wrong, like breaking an unaddressed but critically important rule. Everyone is full of life, after all. What else makes a home in the blood of all creatures, saturates the soil of all land?</p><p>Rio nods. “You felt it?”</p><p>Agatha recalls her brief tumble into the snow last night, how Rio’s hands had gripped her neck and encouraged her to breathe, pushing air down into her lungs when the cold seized her muscles. </p><p>“You helped me breathe”, she says. Rio nods. She takes Agatha’s hand, pressing it over her heart. </p><p>It makes sense then, what she had been doing at the lighthouse. Agatha can feel it under her palm, a heartbeat stronger than any one person should have; like it’s keeping the entire world alive.</p><p>“Did you know I was trapped?” she asks. The question has been stewing in her for a while.</p><p>“Not until I kissed you,” Rio says, tracing her fingers over the back of Agatha’s hand. “Before that, I thought you just had a weird relationship with magic.”</p><p>The moment is shattered when the door creaks open, ancient hinges screeching as they grind together. Agatha’s hand falls away.</p><p>Billy hovers awkwardly in the doorway, hands hidden behind his back. Agatha opens her mouth to speak, but he is faster. “Look, I know you’re mad at me.” </p><p>“She’s not,” Rio says quickly. Agatha glares at her, but it’s not as sharp as it could be. Rio is right. The flame of anger that has been burning in her for decades is too exhausted to keep going.</p><p>Billy looks puzzled for a moment, but then he shakes his head and continues. “I know I did this horrible, awful thing to you but <em> what if </em> I could make up for it?”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Go on.”</p><p>“What if I could break the spell?” </p><p>“What spell?” she asks, leaning back and crossing her arms across her chest. Rio is suddenly tense beside her. Agatha knows exactly what spell he means.</p><p>“Your spell. Your mother’s spell.”</p><p>“And how would you do that?” Agatha imagines burying her heart under miles of snow, piles of falling snowflakes shoveled overtop to keep it from beating, from hoping.</p><p>Billy steps out of the doorway and brings his hands in front of him—his backpack. The straps are faded from use. Enamel pins dot the front like vibrant stars in a night sky. He unzips it quickly, pulling out a large book.</p><p>“This.” The cover is completely black, and Agatha blinks rapidly against the illusion that all of the light in the room is being stolen away. He slides it onto the coffee table and taps it twice. “It’s in here. I read it a while ago, but when Alice told me about the spell, I remembered it. I think it’s the solution to what your mother did.”</p><p>Agatha stares at Billy’s hand. She considers the flickering shadows that had appeared and disappeared in an instant when his fingertips touched the cover of the book. She flips through her mental archive of journals and papers, thick books and dramatic accounts of tragedy. She peers at the two distorted keys fused to the surface of the tome.</p><p>“What <em> is </em>it?” She works to keep her voice steady; to keep her investment purely academic. Rio tenses beside her, arm coming up to rest on Agatha’s back. </p><p>“A very dark magical artifact,” she says, and her tone sends shivers up Agatha’s spine. She seems <em> scared</em>, her eyes wide and shoulders hunched in a way Agatha has never seen before.</p><p>“More like stolen property.” Alice stands in the doorway, hands on her hips. Agatha isn’t quite sure when she appeared there. “From the witch museum across town.”</p><p>“Really?” Jen asks, appearing from behind Alice. Her mouth drops open, and she stares at the book like it’s just grown three heads and begun to walk. “You stole this?”</p><p>“It can help Agatha!” Billy defends.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “That is not why you stole it,” she snaps. Billy ignores her and Rio squeezes her shoulder.</p><p>Alice’s gaze drifts between Agatha and the thick, unnerving book in front of them. </p><p>“Tell us,” she eventually commands. </p><p>”The idea is to overwhelm Agatha with magic,” Billy says.</p><p>“That sounds just great, wouldn’t you say, Rio?” Agatha barks a laugh, turning to look at Rio. Her eyes are glassy and, Agatha realizes with a jolt, brimming with tears. She snaps her mouth shut, reaching out an unsure hand in Rio’s direction. She takes it immediately, her fingers tight and trembling against Agatha’s.</p><p>“We would blast you with enough magic that your own power could break out,” Billy continues, ripping a piece of paper from his regular notebook. He quickly replicates the runes and circles the sharp points of the triangle.</p><p>”It would kill anyone not under a binding spell,” Jen says. “A spell like this would overwhelm the body and the blood with power.” </p><p>“<em> These witches must be linked together in magic and in heart,” </em>Alice reads from over Billy’s shoulder. “What does that mean?”</p><p>”It’s a spell for a coven,” he says.</p><p>Alice wrinkles her nose and drops her head into her hands. Jen laughs, short and disbelieving. Rio squeezes her eyes shut and breathes deeply, like she’s trying to soothe something in herself. Agatha is still, her eyes trained on the snow outside.</p><p>When the door flies open and Lilia steps inside, breaking the tense silence of the room, no one is surprised. She does not seem shocked to see them, crossing the space and settling into one of the armchairs. Agatha realizes with a jolt that Lilia was never lying—not about any of it. The thought that she had been so incredibly wrong in her judgement makes her feel like a fraud.</p><p>“Is it possible?” Alice asks, eventually. Despite Agatha’s resistance to hope, her active avoidance of the possibility, her pulse begins to race. She turns to Rio, who only stares at the book with a pained expression on her face.</p><p>“It has been done before,” Lilia says, but her tone is grave. “It is not easy. This book does not suffer fools.”</p><p>Lilia settles on the couch, thin hands drifting across the pages of the keyed book. Agatha watches her carefully. Her expression seems… familiar?</p><p>“You know this book,” Agatha says. Rio flinches beside her. </p><p>
<em> Rio does too.  </em>
</p><p>“I did, once.” Lilia flips the pages back and forth. Their corners are burned and dark, drops of what Agatha thinks might be dried blood spotting the edges. She looks up to meet Agatha’s eyes. “Your mother did as well.”</p><p>Agatha wonders how many pages she would have to turn to locate the spell her mother used on her. She remembers the metal cage from her nightmare. She imagines it holding tight around her chest, her hands aching from banging against solid bars. </p><p>“It’s dark, right?” Alice asks. Jen nudges her in the ribs and she scowls.</p><p>“Dark does not mean <em> evil</em>, not necessarily,” Lilia corrects, her voice stern. Agatha imagines her at the front of a silent classroom, lecturing passionately on magical ethics—or the lack thereof.</p><p>“It means fear,” Rio says, her voice quiet. “People were scared of it, of the power obviously contained in the magic, and so they called it dark.” </p><p>Agatha’s heart stutters in her chest.</p><p>“When can we try it? Soon?” Billy asks. Lilia shakes her head.</p><p>“This spell”—she waves a hand at the book—”requires eternal night.” Billy nods along enthusiastically, as if he hasn’t yet realized the issue with this.</p><p>“Why?” Alice asks, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Billy starts reading, tracing his finger down the page. “She who is bound, <em> inclusa et abscondita, </em> may only be unbound during the most eternal night. The binding of one’s magic, <em>malum magicae, </em>is of darkness and therefore, may only be undone in darkness.”</p><p>“But we don’t <em> have </em>eternal night.” Agatha rubs a hand across her chest, at the constant ache there. It seems worse, more painful, now that she can explain it.</p><p>Jen taps her foot against the floor, like she’s moments away from jumping into what Alice and Agatha had once nicknamed <em> chaos planning mode.  </em></p><p>“We can get pretty close, though,” she says, lifting her head to meet Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Billy’s eyes get wider for a moment before he startles and jumps, nearly banging his head against the hanging light. “Tonight is the winter solstice!”</p><hr/><p>“<em>Infractus corde,” </em>Billy whispers to himself. He is pacing up and down the hallway, staring down at the book. “What once was hidden is now…”</p><p>“Billy! Are these tall enough?” Alice asks, stumbling down the stairs with an armful of thin, white candles. After Jen begged her to stop reciting the dangers of using dark magic, she devoted herself to helping prepare in any way she could.</p><p>Agatha sits on the floor in the center of the entryway, chin resting in her hand. She watches the sun dip below the horizon. They’ve been waiting for hours, each of them going stir-crazy in their own way as they anticipate nightfall.</p><p>Lilia is standing in the corner of the room with her eyes closed, lips mouthing words that no one else can hear, and Agatha decided a while ago that they should probably leave her alone.</p><p>Jen pokes her head around the corner. Her earrings are tiny bird cages—Agatha doesn’t know if she should laugh or cry at that.</p><p>“It’s almost time,” she says, jutting her chin out towards the window. She holds a piece of thin blue chalk in her hand, which Agatha is certain she took from Billy. “Time to draw the runes.”</p><p>“It should be me.” Agatha stands and takes it from her hand, kneeling in the center of the imaginary circle. Anxiety sits low in her stomach, reminding her of how many ways this could go badly. She pauses.</p><p>
<em> She is standing in her office, surrounded by books. They spiral around her like a whirlwind, thrown open to blood-stained pages and runic charts. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She is crouching in the kitchen, research papers rushing around her like a red sea. They do not hold the answers she is looking for. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She is eighteen. </em>
</p><p>Her fingertips brush the ground. She draws a circle first, arching around her like a shooting star. She sketches a triangle in the center, each corner jutting out. There is an eye in the center, a crescent mirroring the moon rising above them. Agatha draws the shapes quickly, her hand steady as she shifts and turns. She takes a deep breath and draws the last line, the most important one. It does not point behind her, like this symbol usually would, but in front. She draws the cross at the end of the arrow, the metaphorical point.</p><p>She steps over the chalk lines carefully, standing outside and admiring her work. Billy stops next to her, his eyes bouncing between her runes and the book. He stares at her.</p><p>“They’re perfect.” His voice is full of awe. Agatha remembers that, recalls the wonder that she once felt at the mere existence of magic—before her mother drove it from her.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says. “Mediocre witches don’t leave behind haunted houses, after all.” She turns to look at Billy, watching as a small smile appears on his lips.</p><p>“I really didn’t mean to, you know?” he asks quietly. </p><p>Agatha nods. “I know what it’s like to be young and desperate, but Billy”—she looks down at the runes—”magic can’t fix everything.” </p><p>She thinks of his desperate face, the tears threatening to spill from his eyes when he told her he only wanted to bring his family back. He broke into Agatha's former house, stole a dangerous ancient magical relic out of a guarded museum, and risked his own life to undo one of the only things magic is unable to touch.</p><p>“Death?” he asks, his voice small.</p><p>Agatha nods. She glances over her shoulder, at the last glimpse of sunlight dancing along the horizon, and spots movement on the porch.</p><p>“Can you finish setting up here?” she asks Billy. </p><p>“Yeah, sure.” He disappears into the living room.</p><p>Agatha brushes the fine powder from her hands and pushes the front door open. Rio sits in one of the chairs, the snow melted away where her body makes contact. She snaps her fingers in a rhythm that could almost be music, and Agatha watches as green sprouts jump from the earth, immediately withering and retreating under the weight of the snow.</p><p>“This is hard for you,” Agatha says. She settles next to Rio, brushing the snow away with her hand. “Why?”</p><p>The six of them have been planning the spell for the entirety of the day, carefully outlining each step and rereading the words until they barely sound like words anymore. Everyone is nervous, sure, but Rio has been exceptionally so. </p><p>“I told you already.” She looks away, eyes drifting over the yard. “It’s my magic, Agatha. I can feel it.”</p><p>“I thought you said darkness wasn’t necessarily evil?” Agatha asks, rubbing her hands together against the chill.</p><p>“It’s not about the type of magic, or the darkness or it—it’s the death.”</p><p>“But there’s death everywhere, Rio,” Agatha reasons. “We could die driving to work or falling down the stairs.”</p><p>“These deaths aren’t natural, though. This book, the Darkhold, has been used to kill <em> thousands</em>, Agatha.” Rio shakes her head, the words spilling out of her. “So many witches have been killed using it and <em> sure</em>, some of the spells could be used for good, but not many.”</p><p>Agatha understands then, what Rio is worried about.</p><p>“You’re worried it’ll kill me.”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes. “It’s dangerous. We could give you too much magic, or not enough. The night could be too short, or too light. The runes could be—”</p><p>“I trust you,” Agatha says, cutting her off. She kneels in front of her, the fabric of her pants sinking into the snow. “That has to be enough, because I don’t have any other options.”</p><p>The thought makes her cringe and she pushes it away.</p><p>“You really think this will work?”</p><p>Agatha sits in the snow, stares at her hands, and lets herself imagine, for just a moment, what might happen next. A fluttering begins in her chest, like a reminder.</p><p>“As a rule, I don’t believe in fate,” she says. “It’s more powerful to choose something than to have it thrown your way.”</p><p>“So you’re choosing this?” Rio asks, rubbing her hands up and down Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Agatha wonders if she should hesitate, or feel unsure about her decision, but then she thinks about her mother, standing over her with storms in her eyes, and nods. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio holds out a hand. “Let’s do it, then.” The sun dips below the horizon, streetlights bursting to light. </p><p>Agatha and Rio walk back into the house together, hands intertwined. Alice and Jen eye them curiously and, if the mood wasn’t so somber, Agatha would certainly flip them off.</p><p>“Ready?” she asks. Alice and Jen take their positions at the corners of the triangle with Billy. Lilia is behind Agatha and Rio is directly in front of her. Jen waves a hand and all the lamps flicker off, the only light coming from the absurd amount of candles that Alice has placed around them. </p><p>Agatha arches an eyebrow. Alice holds up her hands. “The spell wasn’t exactly specific when it came to the amount.”</p><p>“The first step is the words,” Agatha reminds everyone, nodding in Billy’s direction.</p><p>He drops his notebook to the ground. “<em>Quod semel latuit, venturum vivit</em>.” The candles flicker, as if a strong wind is blowing through; one that none of them can feel. Agatha takes a deep breath.</p><p>Alice starts first, orange magic blossoming at her fingertips. Jen follows, pink vines exploding from her palms. Billy’s power is a vibrant, glowing blue. It bleeds across his skin in no particular pattern, like spilled ink. Lilia is next. Her magic is yellow, like a blooming daffodil or beating sun. </p><p>Rio is last, and her magic does not come from her skin. It erupts from underneath, wood creaking as flowers and vines explode from the floor. They snake up her arms and legs, green light gathering in the palms of her hands.</p><p>Agatha can feel the magic all around her. The air feels charged with static, like anything she touched would spark and shock her. She feels vaguely like she’s underwater, as if the pressure of the room is rapidly changing.</p><p><em> “Infractus corde!” </em>Billy yells, his hands crashing together, and time seems to slow down. Agatha watches, her entire body shaking, as each of her friends turn their powerful hands on her. She feels the magic before it even touches her skin, a buzzing that starts a frenzy inside her. </p><p>The world tilts and dips out of focus and suddenly, the ground is no longer underneath her. Agatha is both large and small, right-side up and upside down. She squeezes her eyes shut. There is something squeezing her, like a great snake holding her captive.</p><p>“The World Reversed!” Lilia screams, and it is the last thing Agatha hears before only her heartbeat accompanies her.</p><p>The sensation of being bombarded by the magic of five very powerful wizards is somewhat akin to being electrocuted, if Agatha had to describe the feeling. She does not think—there is no room in her mind for thoughts. She only feels. She feels hot and cold at the same time, her nerves unable to process the overwhelm of information.</p><p>It seems to go on forever, an endless cycling of dying and reviving, and then there is nothing.</p><p>For an eternal moment, Agatha is alone. There is only darkness, and the steady hum of something bright. She turns, although she isn’t quite sure how she’s standing or walking, and everything around her explodes with purple light. It cracks open her chest, splitting her ribs and rushing into her bloodstream. </p><p>Everything is light—<em>life</em>.</p><p>When Agatha opens her eyes again, she does not recognize the place she has returned to. She winces, lifting herself from the ground. Alice is sobbing, Jen’s arms tight around her. Billy is staring at Agatha. Lilia seems undisturbed, a soft smile on her lips.</p><p>Agatha turns her eyes to the room around her. It’s overflowing with greenery, thorned vines enveloping the doors and crisscrossing across the ceiling. There is moss along the ground, soft and damp. There are also flowers, rapidly blooming from every surface; purple, blue, yellow, pink. They fill the space with a sweet aroma. At the center of it all is Rio, her eyes nearly completely black. She laughs, low and relieved. </p><p>Agatha notices, with a gasp, that the vines are also anchoring <em> her </em>to the ground. </p><p>She laughs too, then, dropping her head into her hands. “Keeping me alive, Rio?”</p><p>“Always.” Her eyes shift, returning to their usual color. </p><p>The vines fall away and, in their absence, Agatha knows it has worked. She lifts her hands in front of her, unable to stop the stuttered breath that falls from her lips. She watches, transfixed, as magic buzzes at her fingertips. The ache in her chest is gone, a mere memory now. She drops her hands to the ground, plunging them into the earth—which has risen to meet her—and feels only the once-familiar thrum of power.</p><p>“I can’t believe we did it,” Billy whispers. Magic is dancing across his skin, the previously abstract blue spots now forming intricate lines and symbols. He looks up at Agatha with wonder. She runs a hand down her face and nods. </p><p>“You did good,” she says, before she can talk herself out of it. Billy looks like a kid on Christmas at her words.</p><p>“Your card is no longer reversed,” Lilia says plainly. Agatha nods to her, even though she doesn’t quite know what that means. She reaches out tentatively and takes Lilia’s hand in hers.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says. She doesn’t often say those words and if she does, she hardly means them, but this feels like a special enough occasion to change that.</p><p>Alice finally collects herself enough to jump into Agatha’s arms, tear tracks still marking her face. She smells burnt, like singed paper and burned earth. Jen follows, light pink magic snaking around Agatha’s body and squeezing. </p><p>When they pull away, Jen furrows her brow at the state of the room. </p><p>“Rio, what happened?” she asks, poking the moss with her finger. Rio blushes. </p><p>“A little… too much magic on my part, I think.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, reaching forward and framing Rio’s face with her hands. </p><p>The world continues to turn, absurdly. Alice and Jen climb to their feet, yanking some of the vines down so they can get into the rest of the house. Billy begins to dance around the room merrily, skin buzzing with power. Lilia hovers just on the edge of the circle, a fond expression on her face. </p><p>Rio takes Agatha’ hand and drags her into one of the spare bedrooms. When she waves a hand over the throned vines they slither away like snakes. Agatha marvels at them before Rio tugs her inside.</p><p>Magic humming in her veins, Agatha finds herself drawn to Rio like a moth to a roaring, consuming flame. Rio meets her halfway and, when they touch, Agatha lights up. She imagines she should likely feel tired after the spell, drained and exhausted, but she isn’t. Her nerves feel charged and new, every inch of her buzzing with power. </p><p>She snaps her fingers, purple wisps of magic pulling the curtains shut and slamming the door behind her. She doesn’t even think—she is not commanding the magic, it is an extension of her.</p><p>Rio smirks, looping her arms around Agatha’s waist and pulling her close. Her skin is still slightly marbled, soft green lines dancing alongside her veins and arteries. “I told you so.”</p><p>Agatha drops her mouth to Rio’s neck, fighting the nearly overwhelming urge to kiss her. She brushes flower petals out of her hair with a smirk.</p><p>“Told me what?” she whispers, letting her hands drift and settle on Rio’s shoulder blades. Agatha can nearly taste her magic. It smothers her senses and envelops her fully, the sharp burst of life; like the first breaking of new ground or the first breath in an unknown world.</p><p>Rio’s eyes light up, like they always do before she tells an awful joke. </p><p>“That this place is magical.” She practically hums the words, her palms coming up to rest at Agatha’s neck, fingers brushing across her pulse points. “Even without your powers, you were still magical.” </p><p>Agatha swallows, a tsunami of doubt rising up in her at the worst possible moment. Remnants of her mother are hidden in the subtle blue tones of her power and the tremble in her hand.</p><p>“Not evil?” she asks.</p><p>Rio pulls her closer, their foreheads resting together. Her eyes seem to shine for a moment before she presses them closed. The corner of her mouth twitches.</p><p>“I’ll prove it to you,” she whispers, and leans forward, breath ghosting across Agatha’s cheek. She shivers, her entire body drawn forward. Rio stills, like she’s waiting for Agatha to move first. </p><p>She does.</p><p>Their lips meet and do not part, magic supplying the endless air in their lungs as easily as it strengthens their hearts. Colors dance across Agatha’s closed eyelids and she can’t be sure if it’s an illusion, pressure sparking light, or their magic dancing around the room.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse races and her head spins, but it has little to do with magic. Rio’s leg slides in between Agatha’s, a rush of green light exploding from her skin. Pressure builds in her stomach and makes her legs shake. Magic bursts from Agatha’s fingertips suddenly, purple ropes that guide them, stumbling and blind, until the back of Rio’s knees hit the bed. </p><p>Strong hands grip Agatha’s hair and neck, desperate motions that beg for more. Rio’s magic is encouraging and sharp, making Agatha’s lungs expand further and her heart beat faster. She realizes with a jolt that her shirt is gone, fabric vanishing in a rush of purple. Rio’s magic has done the same, the barriers between them falling away.</p><p>There are sparks against skin, then, burning and healing in tandem. Agatha gasps and groans against the pressure of Rio’s hips, every brush of lips and fingers unraveling her. </p><p>Magic rushes from her in waves, purple sparks dancing along the edges of the bed and charging her hair with static. Rio pulls back for just a moment, pupils blown wide in the soft purple and green light.</p><p>“Do you know why I showed up here that day? In your backyard?” she asks suddenly. Agatha breathes heavily, trying to slow her racing thoughts enough to respond. Her face burns.</p><p>“No.” She shakes her head. “I was too angry.”</p><p>The memory is laughable, her intense rage at Rio for sitting on that bench, for showing up and acting like she belonged. Agatha wonders if she was ever truly mad, or if perhaps she knew, in some twisted way, that Rio <em> did </em>belong there.</p><p>“You‘re full of life, Agatha Harkness—not evil,” she says, and the words are so reverent that Agatha has no choice but to believe her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Agatha, come on!” Rio yells, dragging Agatha out the front door with a silver-ringed hand. Agatha sighs, sliding into the passenger seat of Rio’s truck. “We’re going to be late for dinner!”</p><p>Rio’s cabin disappears behind them as she drives, smoke from the tiny chimney still visible over the trees. Agatha has grown quite fond of the house after spending the last few nights in it—since her family home is currently overrun with moss and vines from Rio’s over-eager magic.</p><p>Agatha probably could have asked Rio to clear it out, but it has become a welcome excuse to spend her nights tucked against Rio’s side and her mornings lounging by a crackling fire. </p><p>The only downside is that Rio’s house is covered in holiday-themed decorations. Fake holly leaves dangle from the mantle and snowman decor can be found in nearly every room. Agatha had pretended to hate it at first, hiding the creepiest of the Santas under the bathroom sink so he couldn't watch her any longer. </p><p>“Rio, slow down,” Agatha says. “Jen and Alice will wait for us.”</p><p>She starts to rub her hands together at the cold air that comes rushing from the truck vents. She catches herself and snaps her fingers instead, warm magic rushing over her palms and returning color to her fingers. </p><p>Agatha had worried that getting her magic back would involve a difficult learning curve. Most skills do. She had worried that during those many cold years, she forgot how to cast and how to command. Turns out, using her magic is as natural as it always was. </p><p>Even still, she lived in a world without magic for so long that sometimes she forgets how much has changed. </p><p>Rio doesn’t take her eyes off the road, but Agatha sees her lips twitch. “It’s Christmas Eve, Agatha!” she reasons. “I didn’t know someone could take <em> that long </em>to get ready.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “It’s a skill.”</p><p>Rio reaches for the volume knob and starts blasting Christmas music. Agatha just sighs and leans back against the headrest. It’s impossible to loathe the holidays when Rio makes her snowflake-shaped pancakes each morning and kisses her under a mistletoe every ten minutes. </p><p>It doesn’t help that she can simply snap her fingers and grow one from the ceiling when she wishes. The downside of dating a green witch, it seems.</p><p>They arrive only five minutes late, which is enough to raise Agatha’s heart rate and leave Rio completely unfazed. She grins and lifts half a dozen boxes from the back of her truck—Christmas presents that she meticulously selected for everyone. Agatha stares at them, at the tiny dangling labels, and sees that Rio wrote her name on each of the presents as well.</p><p>
<em> From Agatha and Rio, with love. </em>
</p><p>The sight makes warmth bloom in her chest. It grows like a flower that was once forbidden and is now given permission to thrive.</p><p>“Gifting on my behalf, Rio?” she asks playfully.</p><p>Rio bumps their arms together. “You helped me pick them out. You deserve some credit for that, at least.”</p><p>Agatha fights the urge to grin. She lifts her hand and drums a knock on Jen’s door, their familiar pattern from middle school. Jen pulls the door open immediately, smiling brilliantly at her two friends. Her earrings are fir trees today, glittering and green. </p><p>Alice appears behind her, an arm looped around Billy’s shoulder. He’s wearing an obnoxious Christmas sweater, ornaments patterned up his arms and around his waist.</p><p>“Only five minutes late!” Alice cheers. Agatha glares but finds herself smiling anyway. They step through the entrance and slide their boots off.</p><p>“Never thought I would see this,” Jen mutters under her breath.</p><p>“See what?” Agatha teases, taking the presents from Rio and depositing them under the large tree. Rio wraps Billy in a hug, pulling back to look him over like a protective mother. The sight makes Agatha’s heart stutter in her chest.</p><p>“You, happy and <em> in love </em> in my living room,” Jen says. Her words are playful but her tone is fond. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t miss the shine in her eyes.</p><p>“On Christmas Eve, too!” Alice chirps from the kitchen, where she is expertly balancing plates and sliding them onto the dining table. Agatha notices Lilia, too, an apron tied around her waist.</p><p>Rio dances back across the room, waving a hand so all the foliage brightens and grows. The decoration on the mantle erupts onto the floor and Jen sighs.</p><p>“Must be magic, right Agatha?” Rio asks, pressing close to her and snapping her fingers above them. Agatha shakes her head to hide the blush erupting on her cheeks, all too familiar with Rio’s routine. </p><p>One of her hands moves to Agatha’s waist and the other slips under her leg. Rio tips her back easily, kissing her softly under the guise of the newly grown mistletoe hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>“Our turn!” Alice yells, grabbing Jen’s wrist before she can protest. Rio drags Agatha away so their friends can take their spot, pressing their lips together under the festive plant.</p><p>“It’s always magic, isn’t it, kid?” Lilia leans next to Billy, brushing flour from her hands and lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>Billy hums and rolls his eyes. “Guys! Can we eat now, please?”</p><p>“We know you have a crush of your own, Billy!” Alice quips.</p><p>“Eddie, was it?” Jen asks playfully. Billy’s eyes widen.</p><p>“How do you—how do you know about that?” he sputters.</p><p>“I’m a cop, Billy.” Alice grins and taps her badge, hidden below the hem of her oversized sweater. "I know everything."</p><p>Everyone laughs at her words, and Agatha feels dizzy with it—joy. She leans close to Rio’s ear as they take their seats at the table. </p><p>“You know you don’t need an excuse to kiss me, right?” she whispers.</p><p>Billy groans, his cheeks still pink.</p><p>“How’s it going with your job, Agatha?” Alice asks, spearing a piece of ham and abruptly shifting the topic of conversation.</p><p>“Yeah, did your department head get back to you?” Jen reaches over Alice to grab the salt, earning her a playful glare.</p><p>“He did.” Agatha takes a deep breath. “The department approved it.”</p><p>Rio smirks, grabbing Agatha’s hand under the table and intertwining their fingers. The feeling is grounding, like feeling solid earth under her palm.</p><p>“Oh, that is just wonderful, dear!” Lilia says.</p><p>Alice obviously fights the urge to jump out of her chair and hug Agatha. Instead, she smiles widely. “I knew they would!”</p><p>Agatha blushes and, with great difficulty, doesn’t roll her eyes. She knows from experience that if she did, Rio would poke her in the ribs for <em> not taking a well-deserved complement. </em>She squeezes Rio’s hand instead and winks at Alice.</p><p>“Wait, what?” Billy stares at her, a biscuit halfway to his mouth.</p><p>“I got approval to move my research here,” Agatha says. </p><p>Her warm and cozy office in the city is currently being packed up and mailed to Salem; to Rio’s address. Books and journals have already started to pile up in her small home office. Agatha has been in close contact with the local museums since she decided to risk everything and see what Salem <em>truly</em> has to hide.</p><p>“Oh.” He bobs his head up and down. “Congrats.”</p><p>Agatha glances to Rio for encouragement. She nods. “Actually, Billy, I have a question for you,” she says.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Would you want to…” Agatha fiddles with her napkin. “Work with me?”</p><p>Although Agatha would never admit it, her colleagues and bosses have been subtly pushing her in the direction of Salem for years. The town is a gold mine when it comes to witchlore research, and so much of its hidden knowledge has been overlooked by previous researchers who weren’t familiar with the place itself—researchers who weren’t witches. </p><p>Agatha is, but she can’t do it all alone. She has been corresponding with her graduate students virtually since arriving in Salem, but none of them can uproot their current research to assist her. </p><p>She needs someone local.</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” Billy nearly chokes on his biscuit. Alice shoves a glass of water in his direction and Jen covers her mouth with her hand. “But… I work with Rio!”</p><p>“It’s fine, Billy,” she says with a smile. “Your heart isn’t really in the mortuary business. I can tell.” </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes—before she met Rio, she didn’t imagine it was possible for someone to be so fond of such a morbid job.</p><p>“What would I do?” Billy asks.</p><p>“You would help me sort through first hand accounts of the witch trials, mostly,” Agatha says. “We’re looking for anything untouched, basically. Stones uncovered, journals that haven’t been read, stories that haven’t been told.”</p><p>Billy is silent for a moment. Agatha knows he has potential, has known it since the moment she noticed the strange spirals scribbled in his carefully held notebook. Both his power and mind are raw and unguided, and they’ve obviously taken him down dangerous paths.</p><p>Agatha knows far too much about dangerous paths walked in desperation.</p><p>“That sounds… like fun,” he says carefully.</p><p>Agatha nods. She remembers a time, when she was younger and more naive, that the work really <em>was</em> fun. “It’s very rewarding.”</p><p>Billy, for perhaps the first time, smiles at her. </p><hr/><p>“I need a vacation,” Agatha groans. She stares at the mess in Alice and Jen’s living room, discarded boxes and piles of wrapping paper littering the floor. Unsurprisingly, Christmas music hums from the speaker in the corner. </p><p>“Wasn’t this supposed to be your vacation?” Alice teases. She drapes her legs over the side of her chair. </p><p>Agatha supposes that’s true. She is certainly using her long-saved vacation time. “Somewhere tropical,” she says, waving a hand in the air and envisioning a beach, soft waves, and clear skies.</p><p>“So, I’m actually not a huge fan of sand.” Rio wrinkles her nose and Agatha smirks.</p><p>“You guys could come too!” Agatha points at Jen and Alice. Lilia left a while ago, Billy peppering her with questions about the history of witches as the door shut behind them. “Remember that road trip we planned back in middle school?” she asks, recalling their carefully curated, down-to-the-minute schedule. It would have never actually happened, of course, but it was fun to imagine.</p><p>“That sounds fun.” Rio nods enthusiastically. She lowers her voice and leans closer to Agatha. “I would go anywhere with you.”</p><p>Agatha nudges her playfully in the shoulder. Jen smiles and shakes her head fondly, but Alice narrows her eyes.</p><p>“Wishful thinking,” she snaps suddenly, climbing to her feet and leaving. Agatha feels the room crackle with an unexpected rush of magic, potent and tense<em>.  </em></p><p>She is frozen for a moment, staring at Jen. She starts to get up but Agatha waves a hand. “Let me talk to her.” </p><p>She pushes the kitchen door open gently. Alice is leaning against the counter, head in her hands. Her breathing is exaggerated and deep, and Agatha recognizes it as an attempt to calm down when it feels like the world is spinning much too rapidly.</p><p>“Alice?” she asks, shifting uncomfortably. </p><p>Agatha isn’t great at this stuff. She honestly isn’t even sure why she volunteered to talk to Alice. She almost turns around and calls for Jen, who is certainly better at comforting than her, but Alice lifts her head and fixes Agatha with a stare.</p><p>She looks more sad than angry.</p><p>“You…” She squeezes her eyes shut. “You want to go on vacation, Agatha. You want to leave, just like you always have, and that’s <em> fine</em>, but I can’t.”</p><p>“Alice, it’s just a trip—we were joking! I know that you have responsibilities here.” Agatha tries to speak softly. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Because I <em> can’t </em>leave!” Alice cries. “You never understood that.”</p><p>A memory surfaces in Agatha’s mind, one she’s tried desperately not to think about for the past couple decades. Alice, tears streaming down her face, begging her not to leave. Alice, telling her that she <em> can’t </em>leave. It’s the one thing they never shared—the only secret that ever existed between them.</p><p>Agatha jolts with the realization.</p><p>“What is it?” she asks, her voice cracking on the last word. It doesn’t seem like Alice can respond, mouth pressed into a thin line. </p><p>“<em>Curse</em>.” </p><p>Agatha’s heart sinks. She turns around at the word. Jen stands in the doorway, unshed tears in her eyes. She gravitates to her wife—in a way that Agatha understands now—and wraps an arm around her back. Alice nods.</p><p>“Family curse,” she croaks. “No one can leave Salem.” </p><p>Agatha feels betrayed only briefly. She wonders why Alice kept this from her, why she hid something so monumental and important, but it doesn’t take long for her to figure it out. Alice protects them; she always has. She would never have wanted to share this burden, even if Agatha wouldn’t have viewed it that way.</p><p>Rio appears, then, slipping in through the open door. “On danger of what?” she asks. To anyone else, she would certainly appear unfazed, but Agatha notices the tension in her shoulders and the nervous tapping of her hand.</p><p>“What do you think?” Jen snaps. She drops her eyes to the floor.</p><p>“Death,” Alice whispers. “It’s impossible to break. Believe me, my family has tried for decades.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind races. After ending up back in Salem, discovering that magic is real, and lifting her own awful curse, it’s hard for her to believe that <em> anything </em>is truly impossible. She takes a deep breath, trying to distance herself, but this isn’t a theoretical discussion on magical theory. This is Alice; her lighthouse in the dark, the first person who believed that her power could be used for good; that she wasn’t evil. </p><p>Agatha hasn’t given much thought to it: what her power might be able to do beyond the dangerous and feared legends that live in her mind and haunt her mother’s house—but she does now. She wishes she had access to Evanora’s hidden library. It holds the only book she’s ever discovered with any information on her particular brand of magic. </p><p>
<em> The Taking of Power. </em>
</p><p>She realizes something with a jolt. The book didn’t specify what <em> kind </em>of power. </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, forcing the words out before she can talk herself out of it. “What if I could break it?” </p><p>She’s already coming up with a plan, her brain working overtime trying to recall everything she’s ever read on historic bloodline curses. There’s not much, but she’d guess that her power would only work if the curse was separate from Alice’s own magic, layered over it or intertwined.</p><p>“I just told you, Agatha. It’s impossible.” Alice shakes her head. “My mother tried everything. It drove her insane.” </p><p>“Your mother didn’t have a witch with abilities of <em> legend </em>to help her,” Rio practically sings, and Agatha would probably blush if her heart wasn’t pounding so hard. </p><p>“I think I could“—Agatha struggles for the right words—“absorb the curse magic and leave your magic alone.”</p><p>“You’ve never done anything like that before,” Jen snaps. Agatha is surprised when no anger rises up in her. She knows that Jen is scared, can see it in the set of her jaw and the furrow between her eyebrows. Agatha can imagine how much research she must have done on this very topic, trying desperately to free the woman she loves.</p><p>Agatha steps forward, eyes locked on Alice. “You always told me that my power wasn’t evil—that it could be used for good. What if this is it?”</p><p>Alice blinks. She only looks afraid for a moment, and then the expression is gone. She lifts her chin.</p><p>“Let’s try it.”</p><p>“Alice,” Jen whispers. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I trust her,” she says, and Agatha’s heart nearly explodes.</p><p>Alice trusts her—even now.</p><p>“You’ll need to blast me.” Agatha steps back and Rio seems to understand what she needs, sliding in behind her and resting her hands on her waist.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” she whispers in her ear.</p><p>Alice shakes her hands out, chest rising and falling quickly. “This feels wrong,” she says.</p><p>“I know, but you won’t hurt me,” Agatha reassures her, even though she has no way of knowing that.</p><p>Alice lifts her hand, orange magic that resembles flame erupting from her skin. Agatha flinches, images of her mother’s painful and sharp power pressing into her mind, but she forces herself to stay put. </p><p>Alice’s magic reaches for Agatha, but there is no violence in its motion, only familiarity. Agatha reaches out, too, even though that hadn’t been part of her hastily compiled mental plan. Sparks and threads gather in her hands, responding to her call.</p><p>Her fingertips do not meet scorching heat as she feared. Instead, there is just endless warmth. It seems to sink into Agatha’s very core and she gasps, tears jumping to her eyes at the depth of it. Alice’s love, loyalty, and <em> protection </em>are woven into the flames. Agatha tilts her head. If she listens closely, she can hear the curse. It buzzes in her ear, but she doesn’t know how to find it.</p><p>They stand there for a few minutes, the two of them suspended in a sort of trance. Agatha is careful not to tug on Alice’s magic any further. She doesn’t want to hurt her. Agatha doesn’t move until she feels Rio’s hand brush against hers, her fingertips golden and full of light.</p><p>“Let me help.” Rio’s hand rests on top of Agatha’s, a rush of light spiraling through the orange magic in front of them. </p><p>Suddenly, Agatha can see the power in Alice’s body—the magic that helps her blood rush through her veins and allows her lungs to explain. Rio is illuminating <em> just </em>Alice’s magic, the power within her that is lush with life.</p><p>Agatha can see the curse, then. It’s darker than Alice’s magic and burns when it touches her fingertips. She wraps her hands around it regardless, yanking it towards her chest. Alice cries out, but Agatha isn’t surprised. The curse is ancient and rooted deep. She lets her own instinct take over, overwhelmed by that same selfish drive that her mother had been so very afraid of. </p><p>Her power wants to <em> take</em>. For the first time in decades, Agatha lets it.</p><p>The curse builds in her palms, sparks flying up her arms like tiny jolts of electricity. It pushes toward her ribs, seeking a new connection. Alice slumps over, collapsing into Jen’s arms as the connection snaps abruptly. Agatha turns on her heel. She doesn't know how to destroy it, but she has a feeling Rio might. </p><p>Rio presses her hands into the distorted, swirling magic. It changes colors, shifting to green, and shatters like glass in Agatha’s hands.</p><p>“Back to where you belong,” Rio whispers, her voice almost fond. Agatha doesn’t have any time to consider what she’s done—the impossibility of it all—before Jen’s arms are wrapped around her.</p><p>“Thank you, Agatha,” she gasps in her ear.</p><p>Agatha pulls back with a small smile. “Of course.”</p><p>Alice is leaning against the counter, eyes sparkling. She doesn’t say anything, only presses a hand against the center of her chest and smiles. Agatha knows the feeling.</p><hr/><p>Agatha Harkness doesn’t hate the holidays. She never truly did. When she opens her eyes on Christmas morning—in Salem—it’s Rio that she sees.</p><p>“Hello,” she murmurs, pressing her lips to Agatha’s shoulder. “It’s snowing.” </p><p>The house is toasty warm, Rio’s carefully hand-stitched stockings hanging from the fireplace. The two of them have plans with Alice and Jen later and, if Rio has her way, they’ll spend the day ice skating and then tucked away in a booth at the local diner. It’s not what Agatha imagined her holidays would look like this year, but she’s decided to roll with it. </p><p>She would never admit it, but she really can’t imagine being anywhere else.</p><p>“I can see that,” she whispers, glancing over at the window. Countless snowflakes stick to it and then melt away, each of them complex, unique, and gone in an instant. They seem drawn to the glass, despite it promising their end. </p><p>Or maybe, <em> just maybe, </em> it’s not the end at all.</p>
