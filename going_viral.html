<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Billy Maximoff was halfway through a smoky-eye tutorial that had, as usual, desolved into a chaotic Q&amp;A. His ring light cast soft shadows across his cheekbones, emphasizing the sharp angles of his face. The black eyeliner was thick, unapologetic, and dramatic.</p><p>His black curls fell forward just right. His usual 400 watchers had spiked to 700 for no particular reason, but he wasn’t complaining.</p><p>“Alright, goth court,” he said, angling the camera slightly, “I’m blending with my fingers because I’m emotionally unstable and brushes are a capitalist invention.”<br/>
Comments rolled under the screen:</p><p>- ur skin is so rude rn it’s glowing<br/>
- billy u look like you listen to lana del rey with a knife in ur hand<br/>
- drop the eyeliner brand or i riot<br/>
- blending with trauma I see<br/>
- ur like if Hozier and sarcasm had a baby i love u</p><p>Billy was about to respond when the front door slammed. His stomach dropped. He froze.</p><p>“Oh god,” he muttered, just as the unmistakable click of stiletto heels made their way upstairs and started down the hallway. “No no no no…”</p><p>Agatha Harkness, his aunt, stormed into the room holding a matte black shopping bag that screamed luxury. She was dressed like she had just stepped out of a courtroom drama and into a Prada shoot: black slacks tailored to intimidation, a silk blouse so deep plum in color it was almost black, and her signature red lipstick drawn on with the precision of a threat.</p><p>She didn’t see the phone.</p><p>She never even looked.</p><p>“You left your concealer in the kitchen,” she announced, dropping the bag dramatically on his bed. “Again. How you expect to maintain an image of tortured beauty while leaving makeup next to the toaster is beyond me.”</p><p>Billy’s soul left his body. “I’m live.”</p><p>She kept going, not acknowledging that he had spoken. the comments continued to run:</p><p>- WAIT WHO IS THAT<br/>
- ma’am please run me over with your heel<br/>
- why does she look like she has a driver and a secret<br/>
- is that his MOM omg she’s so hot<br/>
- billy pls introduce her i’m sweating</p><p>Agatha started pulling makeup out of the bag like it was a boutique unboxing video. “Anyway. I was downtown for a meeting and had to pass by Saks, and I thought, ‘My nephew deserves something high-quality,’ so I picked up a few things.”</p><p>Billy gawked. “A few?”</p><p>“Foundation, two shades, because undertones are real and you need to stop pretending they aren’t, a refill on that Tom Ford eyeliner you like, and a YSL lip stain. Oh, and some setting spray that smells amazing. Theres a few other bits I thought you’d like as well.”</p><p>She was completely oblivious to the instream of comments and the watching count climbing.</p><p>- TOM FORD???<br/>
- she’s rich rich omg<br/>
- she buys him better makeup than i buy myself<br/>
- can she adopt me i come with minimal trauma and a thirst for luxury<br/>
- AUNTIE WITH THE GIFTS 😭</p><p>Agatha glanced toward him, still not noticing the glowing ring light and camera. “Don’t tell Toby.”</p><p>Billy blinked. “Tommy.”</p><p>“Whatever,” she said with a flick of her hand. “The annoying one. If he finds out I bought you things, he’ll get weird and start making jokes about favoritism. Which, for the record, isn’t true. I just think you have some taste, mostly thanks to me, but he looks like he was raised in a locker room.”</p><p>Billy stared at her, wide-eyed. Eyes moving back to see his followers and watchers reactions.</p><p>- she said what she said<br/>
- not her dragging his twin while gift-giving<br/>
- IWANNA BE THE FAVORITE TOO<br/>
- she’s the villain we all need<br/>
- SOMEONE TELL HER SHE’S ON CAMERA I NEED HER TO KNOW SHE’S OUR LEADER NOW</p><p>Agatha picked up a bronzer compact, opened it, squinted at Billy’s face, then nodded. “This should work. You need warmth. You’re starting to look like you live in a crypt.”</p><p>Billy sputtered. “You bought me a Gucci bronzer?”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” she said, tossing it lightly onto his bed. “And don’t let your friends bully you into using cheap powder. Your cheekbones are the only thing you inherited from your father that are actually useful.”</p><p>- OH MY GOD SHE’S A LEGEND<br/>
- this woman is dangerous and beautiful and i want to build her a temple<br/>
- someone make her a TikTok account immediately<br/>
- we have no choice but to stan rich aunt supremacy</p><p>Billy was frozen. The stream had nearly hit 1,000 viewers. He didn’t know if he should scream, end it, or just let it burn. His aunt, sharp, oblivious, powerful, had just accidentally become their newest obsession.</p><p>He cleared his throat. “Uh… you seriously didn’t see the camera?”</p><p>Agatha turned to look at him. Then her eyes flicked to the glowing ring light.</p><p>Pause.</p><p>“You’re live on that tiktok thing?”</p><p>He nodded, bracing for impact.</p><p>Agatha, to his utter shock, just shrugged. “Well. At least they’re seeing good taste in action.”</p><p>She turned on her heel. “Don’t leave the lipstick in your backpack again. It’s summer. Things melt. Use your brain, teen.”</p><p>She disappeared down the hallway with a final click of her heels, as if she hadn’t just unknowingly launched a fandom.</p><p>- she’s like Miranda Priestly meets hot wine aunt i’m obsessed<br/>
- billy blink twice if you know how lucky you are<br/>
- I want to be her nephew OMFG</p><p>Billy stared at the screen.</p><p>He looked at the bronzer. The eyeliner. The luxury lip stain. The viewers were still rolling in, the comments nonstop.</p><p>He whispered into the camera: “She’s never going to live this down.”</p><p>But what he really meant was he wouldn’t.</p><p>Billy sat there, still stunned, as the chat swelled past a thousand viewers, the highest he’d ever had on a live.</p><p>He glanced off-screen, where the luxury makeup haul glimmered under the soft light like forbidden treasure. The bronzer case caught the light, and the YSL lip stain gleamed in all its expensive glory. Agatha had just waltzed in, dragged his twin, dropped more designer makeup than an unboxing channel, and left like nothing happened.</p><p>- BILLY BRING HER BACK<br/>
- i’ve never felt this kind of yearning before<br/>
- she’s my new religion-<br/>
- the power… the presence… THE LIPSTICK<br/>
- what’s her NAME i need to write it in my diary in cursive</p><p>Billy leaned forward into the frame, eyes still rimmed with thick eyeliner, trying not to let a smirk crack through his faux-misery.</p><p>“You guys seriously need to chill,” he said, biting back a laugh. “She’s… just my aunt.”</p><p>- JUST??? JUST your AUNT???<br/>
- how dare you<br/>
- do you live in a movie???<br/>
- she walked in like a Dior ad with trauma<br/>
- please what’s her @ i’ll sell my soul</p><p>Billy sighed, adjusting his phone. “Her name’s Agatha. And no, I’m not telling you her last name because I like living.”</p><p>- Agatha 😩 say less<br/>
- Agatha… it suits her. Sharp. Powerful. Legendary.<br/>
- AGATHA. I’m screaming. That’s such a hot name??<br/>
- my laptop just got hotter typing it<br/>
- I’m starting a fan account rn @AgathaHive</p><p>Billy rolled his eyes. “You guys have main character disease.” Then he paused, reading a message from a man that had just joined, just for a second and said it without thinking: “It wouldn’t matter aceman, She’s not into guys.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Like, literal silence. He could see the chat not moving. And then….</p><p>- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT INTO GUYS<br/>
- billy what do you mean 😭😭😭<br/>
- she’s… a lesbian??<br/>
- A GAY ICON???<br/>
- why do the lesbians win EVERYTHING</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened as he realized what he’d just done. “Oh my god.”</p><p>- billy you CANNOT drop that and walk away<br/>
- AGATHA IF YOU SEE THIS I SUPPORT YOU BUT MY HEART IS SHATTERED<br/>
- she could destroy me and my entire bloodline and i’d still say thank you<br/>
- you mean she’s smart, rich, intimidating and gay?? lesbians really have it all huh</p><p>Billy laughed, pressing a hand to his face. “Yeah, sorry fellas. She’s happily single and extremely not into you.”</p><p>From down the hall, faintly, her voice drifted, “Billy, who are you talking to?”</p><p>Billy nearly knocked over his drink. “No one!”</p><p>- tell her we said hi<br/>
- she’s in the other room and still making me sweat<br/>
- being gay makes her hotter somehow???<br/>
- the agatha cinematic universe is expanding<br/>
- i’ve never been this emotionally invested in someone else’s aunt</p><p>Billy leaned closer to the screen, dropping his voice to a whisper. “Okay, for the record, do not try to find her. She doesn’t even have Instagram. Her phone is like… three generations behind and only used for emails, angry voice notes, and threatening phone calls.”</p><p>- she’s analog in a digital world and i’m obsessed<br/>
- does she read books?? like actual paper books??<br/>
- she gives off ‘owns a wine fridge and a concealed carry permit’ energy<br/>
- i love her more every second<br/>
- agatha please marry my mom and become my other mom</p><p>Billy grinned, the softest he had smiled all day. “You all are so annoying.”</p><p>But it was weirdly… nice. Agatha didn’t know she was going viral, and that somehow made it better. No performance. No PR. Just her: razor-sharp, rich, brutally honest, and completely out of touch with how iconic she was becoming online.</p><p>- petition to make Agatha a TikTok trend<br/>
- someone needs to animate her in a power suit with flames behind her</p><p>Billy raised his coffee cup. “Anyway. R.I.P. to all the straight men in this chat. Better luck next aunt.”</p><p>- rude but fair<br/>
- AGATHA 4 EVER<br/>
- we’ll always have the makeup drop 💄<br/>
- okay but can we see what she bought again??<br/>
- run a makeup haul in her honor</p><p>Billy grinned, reaching off screen to grab the luxury haul. “Fine. But please try not to be too jealous.”</p><p>He held up the bronzer. “First up: Gucci Poudre de Beauté. Retail price? Too much.”</p>

<p>Billy knew the exact moment he convinced her.</p><p>It was when Agatha sighed, looked up from her espresso, and said, in a voice so dry it could start a brushfire, “If this involves me standing under that ring light again while you and your brother scream, I will literally kill myself.”</p><p>Which, naturally, meant she would do it. Generally speaking, although she bitched and moaned, she always did whatever either of them asked her to do.</p><p>She stood in his bedroom doorway, arms crossed, and regarded Billy’s little makeshift filming setup with the same expression she used for parking tickets and overpriced brunch.</p><p>“Why is the chair furry?” she asked, one brow arched. “Is this part of your aesthetic now or did a Muppet die here?”</p><p>Billy, already grinning behind the camera, waved her toward the chair. “It’s faux fur. It’s chic.”</p><p>Agatha walked over and sat down like the chair had personally insulted her. “I give you too much allowance, clearly. This is a cry for help.”</p><p>From the hallway came the unmistakable sound of a chip bag being opened and stomping feet.</p><p>“No,” Agatha muttered. “Not dumber as well.”</p><p>Tommy burst in. “Are we filming again? I brought props.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even turn to look at him. “Theo, If you’ve dropped chips all over my stairs again I will actually get you neutered.”</p><p>Tommy flopped dramatically onto the bed. “Sure. Threaten my reproductive future. Classic Amanda.”</p><p>Agatha turned slowly, like a villain in a prestige drama. “I will bleach every last one of your football jerseys.”</p><p>“Jokes on you then because you pay for them all.”</p><p>Billy had to sit down to keep the camera from shaking from laughter, Agatha and Tommys relationship was always a hilarious back and forth.</p><p>Agatha rubbed her temples. “Why do I do things for you two? I need a therapist.”</p><p>“Because you love us,” Billy said sweetly, aiming the camera at her face, catching the eye-roll.</p><p>“Eurgh,” she muttered. “And apparently love suffering too.”</p><p>“Okay,” Billy chirped, “this is ‘Agatha Reacts to Gen Z Things, featuring our surprise guest..”</p><p>“Disappointment?” Agatha interrupted.</p><p>“Tommy,” Billy said brightly.</p><p>“Same thing,” Agatha replied, crossing her legs and adjusting the sleeve of her blazer.</p><p>That was a cue to the chaos: Billy held up slang terms on cards, showing them to the camera. Tommy threw in colourful commentary. Agatha acted like she was on trial for murder and was guilty, proud, and too tired to lie about it.</p><p>The first Card: It’s giving.</p><p>“It’s giving… brain damage.” Agatha said, poking her tongue into her cheek and then reaching out to Tommy and poling him in the forehead.</p><p>“No, it means like… it has a vibe, like ‘it’s giving boss energy.’” Tommy corrected.</p><p>Agatha pointed to his hoodie. “This is giving gym class. Involuntary.”</p><p>The second card: Delulu.</p><p>“Sounds like a prescription.”</p><p>“It means delusional. Like when someone thinks they have a chance with you.”</p><p>“Oh. Tragic. Next.”</p><p>This was an easy card: Slay.</p><p>“I know that one. I say it when I want you to shut up faster when your asking me about your outfits.”</p><p>“You slay, Angela.” Tommy pulled the ends of her hair as he said it, causing her to bat her hands at him.</p><p>“Theo, touch my hair one more time I will shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.”</p><p>The video only got worse. Or better, depending on perspective.</p><p>“Agatha, what’s the worst Gen Z trend?” Billy said, trying to keep his video serious.</p><p>“You.” Agatha replied deadpan.</p><p>“Wow.” Tommy replied.</p><p>“What’s something you think Gen Z should bring back?” Billy continued.</p><p>“Shame,” Agatha looked Billys mesh top up and down and raised her eyebrow.</p><p>“Okay, slay.” Tommy laughed, pleased that for once Billy was also on the receiving end of Agathas sharp tongue, however when she caught his eye Agathas pulled a face at him.</p><p>“Please eat drywall.”</p><p>By the end of it, she was sipping her espresso, quietly muttering to herself about "the youth being doomed to be cringe." Tommy had fallen off the bed, and Billy was breathless from laughter.</p><p>Agatha stood and stretched, visibly exhausted. “Are we done. Please say we’re done.”</p><p>Billy beamed at her. “We are. Love you.”</p><p>She paused in the doorway, then glanced over her shoulder at both boys.</p><p>“I tolerate you. Deeply.”</p><p>Then, to Tommy: “And you’re the reason I keep the emergency wine.”</p><p>Billy posted the video.<br/>Unedited.</p><p>He didn’t mean to, he just forgot that he’d pressed record the moment Agatha entered his room. But the video, chaos and all, hit 2.3 million views overnight. His follower count climbed to over 750,000.</p><p>The comments were unhinged.</p><p>- She’s my Roman Empire<br/>- Why is Amanda/Theo energy better than every show on Netflix<br/>- Agatha is a menace. I’m in love<br/>- She’s like if sarcasm had a trust fund<br/>- WHO IS SHE! I NEED TO KNOW</p><p>And then someone, in the depths of the comments, noticed a detail, a document half-visible in the background, the name of a firm faintly printed on the corner of Agatha’s portfolio where she’d placed it down on his dresser as she walked in.</p><p>It took about 3 hours before someone posted:<br/>- Wait… does Agatha work at Harkness &amp; Kale LLP?</p><p>Suddenly, the response to that comment were flooded.</p><p>- HER NAMES AGATHA HARKNESS - SHES THE BOSS!!!!!<br/>- I WORK IN THAT BUILDING<br/>- I CALLED THE FRONT DESK AND ASKED FOR HER SHE’S REAL<br/>- BILLY. SIR. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE</p><p>Billy woke up at 11am to 34 missed texts and three voice notes, one that started with “Why the fuck are your online twinks ringing up the firm and asking for me?”</p><p>Agatha’s name and the hashtag #AUNTAGATHA had somehow become synonymous with power, disdain, luxury lipstick, and masked affection.</p><p>She called him during her lunch break and opened with: “I just had a client ask if I was the ‘slay queen aunt from TikTok.’ I’m suing you.”</p><p>Billy just giggled. “Technically… that’s your fault for being iconic.”</p><p>Silence. Then, “I’m going to replace your skincare with glue.”</p><p>Billy had never felt more like a criminal - or more justified.</p><p>Because the views? They were climbing. His account was booming. And all he had to do was... catch his aunt in her natural habitat.</p><p>She never tried to be cool. Never tried to be funny or relatable or trendy. She just was. Which, naturally, made her a content goldmine.</p><p>And Billy? He was a genius. He never lied. He just… didn’t tell her. He began creating ‘Agatha in the wild’ content interspersed with his usual GRWM and make up content.</p><p>The first video was captioned: your aunt drives a manual and doesn’t care if you live or die</p><p>Billy had set his phone in the cupholder. Camera angled perfectly. Audio crisp.</p><p>Agatha was driving them back from one of Tommys track meets, one hand on the wheel, the other on the gearshift. She drove like she lived, smooth, precise, and like she’d absolutely win in a high-speed chase if mildly provoked.</p><p>The windows were down. Her curls blew slightly in the breeze.</p><p>And then, mid-traffic, she started singing along to the playlist Tommy had put on. Which wasnt unusual, she sang all the time - but he’d never filmed it for tiktok before.</p><p>Soft at first, then full, low, rich, perfectly on pitch. Her voice was like warm velvet and thunder all at once.</p><p>“I gave up a piece of my heart, then I turned to run, Oh, my head's in the clouds, but I don't feel close to the sun, And the light fades away from my face, and the tears fall like rain, So I turn my words all into faith, hope it's me that they save…”</p><p>Billy sat frozen. He didn’t even look at his phone.</p><p>He just let it roll.</p><p>He added to the caption: #Shedoesn’tknowI’mrecording.</p><p>- she sings?? SHE SINGS???<br/>- how is she not famous, married, and worshipped by a thousand ex-girlfriends<br/>- this is giving musical villain with repressed trauma<br/>- i want to cry shes so #goals<br/>- billy you are living in a cinematic universe</p><p>It hit 1.5 million views overnight.</p><p>Billy turned off his phone after reading the first few hundred comments and casually said, “You sounded really nice in the car earlier.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even glance up from her book.</p><p>“Thank you. Please don’t make it weird.”</p><p>Video Two of Agatha in the wild was captioned: She’s not even trying</p><p>It was Sunday. Agatha’s “Do not speak to me before lunch ” day.</p><p>She was on the couch, sprawled like a cat: oversized black t-shirt from some obscure European gallery, matte-black cycle shorts showcasing her toned legs, flawless skin, iced Starbucks in one hand, tablet in the other. She had on square frame reading glasses. No makeup, still somehow stunning.</p><p>Billy was filming from the hallway like a wildlife photographer for national geographic.</p><p>She sipped her coffee and muttered to herself.</p><p>Billy caught: “If I see one more spelling mistake in this deposition I’m sending her back to school, what the hell even is this.”<br/>sips<br/>“Have to do everything myself because I’m surrounded by incompetent people.”<br/>sips<br/>“Kale better be as miserable as I am today.”</p><p>Billy added some commentary under the caption: She hasn’t moved in two hours and has more presence than anyone at the Met Gala.</p><p>- she’s literally just lying there working and it’s a SERVE<br/>- that starbucks cup has more emotional damage than me<br/>- no makeup??? cycle shorts??? and still that terrifying???<br/>- i need her to narrate my life while insulting me<br/>- I AM the incompetence she’s talking about<br/>- someone said this is what a cigarette would look like if it came to life and learned French</p><p>Agatha never found out about that one. Billy swore he’d delete it if it ever got back to her.<br/>He was lying.</p><p>Video Three was slightly different Agatha in the wild content.</p><p>It was almost midnight. A rare, warm evening.</p><p>Agatha had just gotten home from whatever exhausting grown-up conversations she’d been dealing with at work for hours, still in heels and a navy pinstripe suit. She didn’t even go fully inside.</p><p>She kicked off her heels and threw them through the door, grabbed a blanket from the back patio, and lay down in the grass like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Billy and Tommy joined her after a moment, having heard her return, flopping down next to her like large, chaotic puppies.</p><p>She pointed upward, calm and steady.</p><p>“That’s Lyra,” she murmured. “See the diamond pattern? Vega’s the bright one.”</p><p>Tommy squinted. “You just… know this?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look over. “Some people smoke, some people gamble. I read.”</p><p>Billy had the camera facing to his side, capturing the outline of her against the dark sky, one hand lazily gesturing at stars.</p><p>“You know the stories?” he asked.</p><p>“Every single one,” she said. “Orion’s a mess. Perseus was worse. Honestly, most of them were emotionally unstable sword boys with god complexes. I relate more to the monsters, if we’re being honest.”</p><p>She said it so matter-of-factly, Billy almost forgot he was filming.</p><p>Caption: I caught a rare moment of the world’s scariest woman being soft. She’s gonna kill me if she finds this.</p><p>- still in the blazer. still serving.<br/>- this is how witches in modern clothes look when they’re not cursing people.<br/>- no one talk to me I’m watching this on loop until I disintegrate<br/>- she’s not just an aunt she’s a teacher<br/>- THE FACT THAT SHE KNOWS CONSTELLATIONS OFF THE DOME??<br/>- petition to rename Orion’s Belt to Agatha’s Patience</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t figured it out. Not completely.</p><p>She noticed her barista started saying her name before she even gave it. A girl at Whole Foods winked at her while her friends stared and giggled. Her mailman asked if she was “on the internet.” But Billy always shrugged and changed the subject.</p><p>She hadn’t seen the videos.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Billy knew it was only a matter of time. And when she found out… he’d have to flee.<br/>Maybe fake his own death. Dye his hair. Change his name.</p><p>But for now?</p><p>He posted another video of her pouring wine into a coffee mug and saying, “No one is ever truly okay. That’s a marketing tactic to sell their wellbeing bullshit.”</p><p>It got 1.1 million likes in 5 hours.</p><p>Billy wasn’t the only one trying to capitalise on TikTok’s obsession with his aunt. When a junior associate at Harkness &amp; Kale LLP named Yelena decided to record a TikTok trend with her boss, she genuinely wasn’t expecting a response.</p><p>She had just come from a 9 a.m. briefing where Agatha, in a gunmetal gray suit and red lipstick sharp enough to draw blood, had walked three partners through a corporate nightmare with the calm efficiency of a surgeon removing a grenade.</p><p>Yelena had whispered to her friend in the elevator: “She’s like a sexy Terminator, but for law.”</p><p>So when she saw the trend of Asking my boss what she’d do if… on Tiktok she decided to try record, she didn’t expect Agatha to actually respond.</p><p>Caption: “Asking our boss what she’d do if…”</p><p>It started with the camera on Yelena. She was in the office kitchen, whispering into her phone mic.</p><p>“Agatha, what would you do if we accidentally took the office wine home…”</p><p>The camera panned to Agatha, who was in the background pouring herself black coffee. She didn’t even look up.</p><p>“Tell you to drink it. It’s $20 garbage. Why do we still stock that?”</p><p>The video cut to Yelena again: “What if we used the corporate card to order lunch?”</p><p>“If it’s under $100, I literally don’t care. You work 45 hours a week. Eat.”</p><p>Yelena suppressed a grin, “What if someone came in late because they had a mental health day?”</p><p>“Why are they coming in, I pay full sick pay? If you need a day off take a day off, I prefer you all to be mentally functional.”</p><p>Yelena quietly mouthed “she’s actually the best” to the camera.</p><p>Then she went with a slightly different question.</p><p>“What if we accessed a client file from a personal device without VPN?”</p><p>Agatha’s head slowly turned. She lowered her sunglasses.</p><p>Voice low. Calm. Lethal. “Fired. Immediately. And reported. That’s not your file. That’s someone’s life. If I can’t trust you with that, I won’t trust you with anything. Take my wine. Take my card. Take my gum. Don’t touch client data. I’m not running a daycare. This is a law firm. Treat it like one.”</p><p>The camera cut back to Yelenas stunned face. She added under the caption of the video: yes i’m scared of her. yes i would take a bullet for her. yes shes the best boss!</p><p>- This woman runs a law firm like it’s a mafia family and I respect her for it.<br/>- She said take my card but touch client data and you DIE. I’m obsessed.<br/>- I’m in love with her. She could ruin me and then write me a letter of recommendation.<br/>- No fr this is how bosses should be. She gets it.<br/>- She doesn’t manage. She reigns.<br/>- WHERE DO I APPLY I’LL GET A LAW DEGREE I DON’T CARE</p><p>Billy saw the video blow up within hours, he reposted it with a smile. Then texted her:</p><p>Billy: Heyyy so you’re going viral. Again. Sorry. Not sorry.</p><p>Agatha: I don’t know what that means and I don’t care unless I’m getting sued.</p><p>Billy: The internet loves you.</p><p>Agatha: Everyone loves me, I’m exceptional</p><p>Agatha did eventually see the video, but her only comment was,  “If Yelena posts anything confidential shes fired.”</p><p>And yet, she kept showing up in the office kitchen, pouring coffee, giving answers to questions she didn’t know were being recorded.Always clear. Always firm. And somehow deeply kind beneath the exasperation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Billy was loving the chaos. He posted a new TikTok with text over of her pouring wine into a coffee mug while reading client briefs: She’s your favorite character and she doesn’t even know she’s in a show.</p><p>- BILLY TELL HER SHE’S FAMOUS<br/>- I want to work for her and also disappoint her just to see what she says<br/>- how does she run a firm and raise two twins and look that hot??<br/>- wait is she THE Agatha from the wine+constellation video???”<br/>- she owns the firm??? you’re telling me she’s the CEO?? oh my god<br/>- Mother is mothering 😭🫣✨</p>

<p>Billy’s TikTok page was technically a makeup account.</p><p>Technically.</p><p>Yes, he still posted eyeliner tutorials and trendy lip-syncs. He did unboxings, GRWMs, and the occasional chaotic review where something exploded or melted or glitter-bombed him. But anyone who had followed him knew one thing:</p><p>They weren’t there for the blush.</p><p>They were there for Aunt Agatha, tiktoks favourite lesbian.</p><p>So Billy decided to finally give the people what they wanted.</p><p>With context.</p><p>Because as biting, cold, and vaguely threatening as Agatha came off, a ‘slay  queen’ with amazing taste and a voice like she was permanently unimpressed - she was also the reason Billy had a roof over his head, a path to walk on, and a makeup drawer that would bankrupt a mid-sized influencer.</p><p>Caption: Video Title: GRWM ft. The Closet of Aunt Agatha (She doesn’t know I’m here lol)</p><p>The video opened in a whisper. Billy smirked into the camera like he was sharing state secrets.</p><p>“Okay so I’m doing my makeup in Agatha’s dressing room because her lighting is better than mine and also her makeup collection is borderline illegal.”</p><p>He flipped the camera. The room looked like it belonged in a Bond film — dark wood paneling, antique gold hardware, purple velvet stool tucked under a marble-topped vanity. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors flanked both sides, catching the gleam off every eyeshadow pot and lipstick.</p><p>Glass drawers glowed under museum-quality lighting. The products were arranged with terrifying precision - like Agatha expected a Chanel executive to swing by for a surprise audit.</p><p>“This is one of five YSL highlighters. I think this one cost $120? She hasn’t even opened it.”</p><p>He held the compact like it was radioactive.</p><p>“I’m using it anyway. If I go missing tomorrow, just know: she did it.”</p><p>The camera panned to a shelf labeled BACKUPS, an entire drawer of unopened luxury makeup, categorized like it was a government archive.</p><p>“This is a whole Tom Ford section. That’s… a problem.”</p><p>He dabbed on cream blush while the ambient lighting hit his cheekbone just right.</p><p>“The thing is, she doesn’t wear half of this. Not day-to-day. But she always says, ‘If I need it, I want to know it’s there.’ Like she’s preparing for a Vogue shoot and a court appearance simultaneously.”</p><p>- SHE HAS GUCCI ALL IN ITS OWN DRAWER I’M SCREAMIN!!!!<br/>- her taste is terrifyingly good. i’d commit crimes for a tour.<br/>- billy blink twice if she threatens you with chanel tweezers<br/>- the way she secretly adores you and shows it through capitalism, probably keeps spares for you😭</p><p>Later that night, Billy uploaded a quiet slideshow tiktok for the Then &amp; Now trend. No voiceover. Just Ed Sheerans Photograph playing and slow fades:</p><p>* A blurry photo of two toddler boys, their eyes wide with bright smiles on their faces as Agatha spins them around by the arms, their mom and dad sat to the side laughing<br/>* A photo of Agatha in jeans, sweatshirt, sunglasses on her head in a fold out chair with billy on her lap, watching Tommys first track race<br/>* A birthday party, maybe their 8th, she held a tray of cupcakes,  Billy clung to her arm while Tommy blew out the candles with icing all over his nose.<br/>* Halloween. She was dressed as a witch, the boys were superheroes. Her expression was pure flatline disdain, like she couldn’t believe she agreed to this.<br/>* A picture taken by Jen at the last firm party, agatha uncharacteristically soft, caught unaware, cupping both their cheeks as she said something to them<br/>* A selfie from Tommys football game last week, all made up in the teams colours and bright smiles on all three of their faces</p><p>Comments rolled in like waves:<br/>- i’m sobbing at my desk rn<br/>- this is so soft and she doesn’t even know 😭<br/>- she’s emotionally constipated but in the most loving way possible<br/>- she’s the definition of love as a verb, not a feeling<br/>- you and tommy are thriving because of her. pass it on.</p><p>Later that week, the screen flickered on to Billy sitting cross-legged on his bed, he’d decided to go live and do an ask me anything, hoodie half-zipped, eyeliner smudged from earlier in the day. No lights, no ring cam. Just the soft glow of a salt lamp beside him, casting shadows on the posters adorning his walls.</p><p>He was scrolling through comments, eyes flicking, lazy but focused.</p><p>“Okay. You guys are nosy. But I love it.”</p><p>A grin. He tugged the hood over his curls, glancing sideways.</p><p>“Someone just asked why I’m always at my aunt’s house. Which is fair. I guess from the outside it probably looks weird. Like, dude, just go home.”</p><p>He leant forward a little. His voice dropped - not dramatic, just… quieter. “Thing is... this is home.”</p><p>He exhales like he’s been meaning to say this for a while. Then he locks eyes with the lens.</p><p>“So, story time. I’m gonna try not to cry, which would be a first. But whatever. This feels important.”</p><p>The chat slowed down a little, the wave of emojis and jokes pausing, gifts popping left and right.</p><p>“Our parents died when we were ten.”</p><p>His voice didn’t waver, not exactly. But he stopped for half a breath - this was something he hadn’t shared yet.</p><p>“It was one of those random morning through a phone call thing. You hear about them in books or, like, Lifetime movies. But then it happens to you and you’re just standing there in your pajamas, holding a cereal spoon, and your babysitter is telling you your life isn’t yours anymore.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, watching as hearts rolled in.</p><p>“And then… there was Agatha.”</p><p>He leant back against his headboard, pulling one knee up.</p><p>“She was my mom’s best friend. Since college. Mom used to always say Agatha was her ride or die, she once tried to fight a professor because he gave mom a B on a poetry essay. Mom talked her down with pie. Like, literal pie.”</p><p>He smiled faintly, and the chat lit up with:<br/>- OMG is she not actually Aunt then???<br/>- not agatha about to throw hands over poetry 😭<br/>- she’s been unhinged since the beginning i love her</p><p>Billy clocked the first comment and decided to address that one first.</p><p>“She’s always been our Aunt but not actually by blood. She’s been there since before we were horn and is both of our godmothers. When everything happened, we didn’t have to ask her. She didn’t even give anyone else the chance.”</p><p>He tipped his head back.</p><p>“She showed up at our house that same day, within the hour,  with a duffel bags, her coat still wet from the rain. She looked at me and Tommy and said, ‘Where do you want to go? Who do you need?’ Like it was already decided. Like it was obvious. We moved in with her that same week. She cleared out her guest rooms, built our beds herself, got the manual backwards, cursed at it for two hours, then made it work anyway.”</p><p>He smiled back at the camera, watching as viewer numbers climbed higher and higher.</p><p>“She hired therapists. Set alarms for school. She learnt to cook, because before us she used to burn soup. I didn’t even know that was possible. But she was there. She gave us space to feel it.”</p><p>His eyes watered a little remembering those first few months.</p><p>“She’d leave drinks and snacks outside the door. Or a new book. Or a note with some random joke on it. And if one of us needed to cry? Even though she didn’t do hugs, she’d sit with us, snuggled up for hours just letting us cry and telling us it was okay to cry. She’d let us know we weren’t alone.”</p><p>He paused to rub his hand over his face, catching a few stray tears.</p><p>“She’s never tried to replace our mom. She never tried to be someone she wasn’t. Agatha is… dry. Sarcastic. Amazing but slightly terrifying. She thinks emotions are optional, necessary, but best used sparingly. But she stayed. She chose us. Chooses us. Every day.”</p><p>The chat was nearly silent now. Over 250k watchers. Just a few floating hearts and soft emojis.</p><p>“I’m sixteen now. And Agatha’s still here. Still pretending to hate children. Still pretending we cause her migraines while buying me the new Dior palette as soon as it drops and making sure shes home to say goodnight.”</p><p>“Still calling Tommy by any other T name just to watch him get annoyed. Still telling me I need to be more cool.”</p><p>He did a heart sign with his hand as the viewers left hearts.</p><p>“But she’s never missed a school meeting or play. Never missed Tommys sports stuff. Never forgot a birthday. Never let us go without anything we needed.”</p><p>He picked at the hem of his sleeve. His voice softening.</p><p>“She says she doesn’t believe in unconditional love. Says it’s not practical. That everyone has limits. But I’ve never hit hers. Not when I screamed at her in grief. Not when I shut down. Not when I broke stuff. Not when I started wearing eyeliner and half the school got weird about it.”</p><p>He close his eyes briefly, trying to stop the tears.</p><p>“She just kept showing up. Kept buying my make up. Kept threatening to call the principal ‘and explain basic human decency using small words and legal terms.’”</p><p>He blinked hard and smiled, like he was shoving the tears back where they came from.</p><p>“So yeah. That’s why I’m always at her house. Because it’s my house. She’s the reason we’re okay. The reason we’re still us.”</p><p>The chat finally exploded.</p><p>- i’m literally crying into my takeout rn<br/>- she didn’t ask to be family. she just became it<br/>- billy this is the most powerful soft trauma dump i’ve ever seen<br/>- she’s healing generational curses in heels and shade<br/>- agatha if you see this we love you pls don’t sue us</p><p>Billy leans toward the screen again. His voice is lighter now, like he’s surfacing.</p><p>“She still hasn’t seen any of these videos, by the way. If she does, I’ll probably get a strongly worded text about ‘oversharing like a wimp with too much access to WiFi. Then she’ll leave a new serum in my drawer with a note that says ‘for the emotional wrinkles.’”</p><p>He winked at the screen.</p><p>“Either way, I win.”</p><p>Then: “Anyway, thanks for being kind. And if you have an Agatha in your life? Tell them you love them. Even if they pretend to hate it.”</p><p>“I’ll be back tomorrow. Probably from her vanity again. She loves me more than Tommy. Pass it on.”</p><p>[LIVE ENDED]</p><p>Tommy decided that he wanted in on the viral fame his brother was getting and therefore made a new Tiktok account to also post Agatha.</p><p>His first video started with Tommy holding the phone low, eyes rolling.</p><p>“Okay, so my Aunt just called me Tristan again. Third time this week with the same T name, she’s getting sloppy.”</p><p>The video cut to Agatha, deadpan, barely looking up from her phone.</p><p>“Because you’re terrible, Tristan. That’s fitting.”</p><p>Back to Tommy smirking.</p><p>“So I call her ‘Amanda, or Angela or Agnes or any A name really - just because it sounds like something she’d hate.”</p><p>Cut to Agatha, eyes narrowing.</p><p>“An Amanda would never leave her kids a full fridge of snacks and re-stock it every week.”</p><p>Tommy laughed, holding up the phone.</p><p>“We’ve got this thing that we’ve had since I can remember. Every time she slips a new ‘T’ name on me, I hit her with an ‘A’ name. Keeps her on her toes.”</p><p>Comments flooded in instantly.</p><p>- This is the best parent child energy I’ve ever seen<br/>- Amanda and Tristan forever<br/>- Can we get a duet? Agatha vs. Tommy?<br/>- I love that she’s petty but buys him ALL the sports gear</p><p>What nobody saw in the TikToks was the truth beneath the banter. Agatha didn’t just call Tommy the wrong name for laughs (okay, mostly for laughs). She was there. Always.</p><p>She paid for every sports club, every training session, every new pair of cleats that Tommy insisted he needed because “the old ones weren’t official enough.”</p><p>She never made a fuss. Never asked for thanks. But she was at every game, every meet, on the sidelines, sunglasses on, phone in hand like the world’s least enthusiastic cheerleader.</p><p>And when the game ended, she’d slip Tommy a crisp twenty-dollar bill and ruffle his hair.</p><p>“For snacks,” she’d say, not looking at him.</p><p>Tommy never told Billy.</p><p>It was their secret.</p><p>Tommy’s Next Video was captioned : What Agatha Really Does When She’s ‘Mean’ to Me</p><p>Tommy was sat on his bed, the glow of his phone illuminating his grin.</p><p>“I’m copying my brother. You see the videos of Billys where she’s, like, mean and calls me weird names?”</p><p>He nodded at the camera.</p><p>“Yeah, well, that’s just Act One. Act Two is her showing up at every practice with coffee and a first aid kit, just in case, even though I never get hurt.”</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>“She pays for everything, even stuff I should probably use allowance for. And she slips me extra cash all the time. I put it right in my sock so Billy doesn’t find it… She also usually stops by my room first with a new pair of trainers or something before Billy gets all his shit.”</p><p>“I heard that! A dollar in the swear jar you little shit!” was called from somewhere down the hall.</p><p>Comments exploded under the video.</p><p>- She’s petty but loves him so hard. This is adorable<br/>- I want their whole family dynamic on a sitcom<br/>- That’s peak guardian energy, telling him off for swearing while swearing<br/>- Billy, Tommy, Agatha — can we get a holiday special already??</p><p>Billy watched Tommy’s videos with a mix of pride and disbelief. They were both going viral now.</p><p>And Agatha?</p><p>She was still completely oblivious.</p><p>Their next live was a joint effort, a collaboration by the maximoff twins. The party they were at was supposed to be lowkey.</p><p>It was one of Agatha’s work friends - a “casual Friday night thing,” she’d called it. Wine, some catered food, adults talking shop on a balcony while their teenage kids raided the snack table and made silent eye contact from across the room like they were in a high school remake of The Godfather.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t forced  Billy and Tommy to attend, but the mere fact she’d asked - which meant she wanted them there - was enough for them to want to go.</p><p>“Don’t embarrass me,” she muttered in the car.</p><p>“Don’t introduce us like little kids,” Tommy fired back.</p><p>“Don’t wear that,” she said to Billy, glancing at his see-through blue mesh top.</p><p>“Leave him alone. It’s fashion, Andrea.”</p><p>“Something you don’t understand Tucker.”</p><p>The house was gorgeous, perched high in the hills, all glass doors and string lights, soft jazz playing through invisible speakers. Inside: dozens of adults in expensive but strategically relaxed outfits. Leather loafers. Slips. Gold hoops.</p><p>Outside: teenagers, feral energy humming beneath the polished surface like static.</p><p>Billy and Tommy peeled off almost immediately, making a beeline for the patio where the “younger guests” had clustered. The usual mix of private school kids, half of them vaping under fairy lights, pretending they weren’t watching Billy pull out his phone with excitement of getting exposure from a Maximoff live.</p><p>“We’re going live together,” Billy whispered.</p><p>“Aprils gonna kill us.”</p><p>“Then it’ll be my highest-viewed stream.”</p><p>The Live: We’re at a Party</p><p>The live started with Billy and Tommy grinning into the camera, their faces golden under the string lights. Music in the background. Glasses clinking. Energy chaotic.</p><p>“We’re not supposed to be here,” Billy stage-whispers.</p><p>“We are supposed to be here,” Tommy corrects. “She’s just going to regret it.”</p><p>“Same.”</p><p>They were halfway through laughing about a guy who brought a guitar (unplugged, tragically) when something caught Billy’s eye off-camera.</p><p>He turned and grinned.</p><p>“Okay goth court. There she is - Agatha in the wild.”</p><p>Tommy followed his gaze. He swore under his breath. She’d had a large black coat on when they set off so neither Teen had seen her outfit underneath.</p><p>“No. Shut it down. This is gonna be a lesbian thirst trap. Billy. Billy shut it—”</p><p>“NOPE. She look iconic. It’s happening.”</p><p>He flipped the camera, zooming toward the far side of the room.</p><p>There, across the marble floor, framed by a glowing art deco chandelier by the open patio doors — was Agatha.</p><p>She was in a black backless dress tied a the neck with a bow, thigh length, paired with a black red bottom heel and a crimson lip, her hair in a low bun that somehow made her look even more intimidating. She was laughing with two men in suits and Jen Kale, and just as the camera panned to her, she slammed back a row of tequila shots like she invented the concept.</p><p>“She’s doing shots,” Billy cackled.</p><p>“Oh god, Billy - turn the camera away - look at your comments already!”</p><p>The Comments on the live were rapid fire:</p><p>- I’m feral. I’m barking. I’m on my knees.<br/>- Backless?? Agatha please step on me<br/>- She drinks tequila like it’s water and I’m here for it ❤️🥰<br/>- The hair?? The dress?? The neckline??? I’m filing a restraining order on myself<br/>- Someone stop me from emailing her firm my resume with a thirst trap attached<br/>- Billy. Billy please tell me she’s still single. Please.</p><p>Billy lowered the camera slightly, shaking with laughter.</p><p>“She doesn’t even know we’re on live. That’s the part that always kills me. She has no clue. She just exists like that.”</p><p>“And I have to be her kid when hundreds of people are thirsting over her,” Tommy muttered.</p><p>“You wish you were her child. I’m the favorite.”</p><p>“She pretends you’re the favourite because you’re such a cry baby.”</p><p>“Okay whatever, she doesn’t even use your real name.”</p><p>They broke into twin laughter, knowing that they were equally loved - just that the love was shown in different ways to accommodate their different personalities. The camera caught Agatha in the background again, head tilted, eyes narrowed at one of the men like she’s about to verbally destroy him.</p><p>“She’s arguing. Look at her face. That’s her ‘I’m being polite but you’re wrong’ expression.”</p><p>“That’s her murder face,” Tommy corrected</p><p>“I should start selling this footage. I’d make rent in minutes.”</p><p>“Billy.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“We live rent-free.”</p><p>“…So we get the clout instead then.”</p><p>They ended the stream just before Agatha started making her way toward them — long stride, expression unreadable, heels clicking like a warning.</p><p>Billy hid his phone. Tommy finished his drink in one gulp.</p><p>“You told the internet weirdos I was doing shots?”</p><p>“You were doing shots.”</p><p>“It’s a party teens!”</p><p>She glanced between them. “What else did you film.”</p><p>“Nothing,” they said in unison.</p><p>“I was trending last week for being on the sofa in cycle shorts, Billy. I have only so much dignity left.”</p><p>And yet — she smiled, faintly, like they amused her in spite of everything.</p><p>Then she slipped a folded $50 into Tommy’s hoodie pocket, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>“For food on the way home. Your call what we eat, Tyler.”</p><p>Then she turned and disappeared back into the crowd (and back to the bar, it was free, sue her).</p>

<p>Rio’s day started the same way it always did: two shots of espresso, thirty minutes of mobility work, and a sunrise run that made the world feel like it was still asleep.

Not to expose Agatha like this.</p><p>It was 9:30 p.m., Agatha had only just returned home from work after being out of the house nearly 15 hours. Tommy was hunched over the couch, scrolling through sports stats. Billy’s eyeliner had smudged hours ago and his silk pajama pants were riding dangerously low. The garden behind them through the sliding glass doors glowed in soft, amber fairly lights. He’d been doing a random live, just chatting with some of his followers.</p><p>And then, off-screen, came the shuffling.</p><p>The unfiltered, undeniable sound of Agatha, barefoot, sleep-deprived, and wholly unaware she was about to be broadcast to tens of thousands.</p><p>She appeared in frame like a haunted painting: oversized purple silk robe, messy curls pinned up with a literal ballpoint pen, barefooted. A dish towel slung over her shoulder. She was holding two bowls of home made pasta.</p><p>“I told you both not to eat cereal for dinner again,” she muttered, voice raspy with exhaustion. “It’s not a real meal, here, eat some proper food.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Billy said sweetly, “you made your Alfredo pasta?”</p><p>“Against my will. I told you there was money for takeout this morning.”</p><p>She placed Tommys bowl down on the coffee table in front of him, pausing briefly to brush his hair back in a move so absentmindedly tender it would surprise most people. Then she stood still for a moment, like she was trying to remember what planet she was on.</p><p>“What was I doing?” she asked.</p><p>“Losing the war against sleep,” Tommy said, eagerly reaching for the bowl.</p><p>“I’m fucking knackered.”</p><p>“Swear Jar Agnes!”</p><p>She shuffled back to the kitchen after giving Tommy the finger and returned with a mug. She then dropped onto the end of the couch, stiff-backed and trying so hard not to close her eyes that it physically hurt to watch. Her coffee was held it like it might keep her alive. Her hands were trembling slightly, mascara smudged beneath one eye.</p><p>Billy adjusted his phone subtly to show her more fully in frame for his watchers, his viewer number already having doubled since she appeared. “Say hi to tiktok.”</p><p>She blinked slowly. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>The moment Agatha came into frame, the chat had exploded.</p><p>- MOTHER IS HOME 🏠<br/>- She’s so tired she’s glowing. Is that possible.<br/>- Wait— IS THAT A PEN IN HER HAIR???<br/>- She’s literally half dead and still hot I’m unwell<br/>- OMG my baby! She’s literally cooked for you both but wheres her food?!?!? 😭</p><p>And then:</p><p>@RioVidalTrainer joined the live.</p><p>- Tell her I said hi. No wait don’t. Actually yes do</p><p>Billy grinned like a villain.</p><p>“Guys…” he said, drawing his words out slightly, “Rio Vidal, the fitness trainer lady, is in the live.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look over, too busy scrunching her nose at Tommy shovelling the pasta like he was starved. “Who the hell is Rio…?”</p><p>Her eyes flicked to Tommy’s phone as he held it out to her to show her Rios profile, slow, heavy-lidded, squinting slightly trying to fight the draw of sleep.</p><p>And then, casually, without drama, between yawns and barely conscious:</p><p>“Oh. She’s hot.”</p><p>Billy froze.</p><p>Tommy dropped his fork into his bowl.</p><p>The chat erupted.</p><p>- SHE SAID IT SHE SAID IT SHE SAID ITTTTT<br/>- RIO ARE YOU BREATHING?!?<br/>- I wish I was Rio!<br/>- Rio has left the chat (to scream into a pillow)</p><p>On the Other Side of the Screen, Rio Floundered in Real-Time</p><p>Rio had been leaning casually against her kitchen counter in a sports bra and shorts, watching the live with a grin, heart fluttering slightly at the softness of the woman on the screen, then she nearly dropped her shake.</p><p>She choked on air, sputtered, knocked over a shaker bottle, and slammed her elbow against the fridge. She covered her face and let out the most undignified, high-pitched noise she’d made in ten years.</p><p>“She called me hot? Did she mean it? Was that real? Did I dream that?”</p><p>She typed: @RioVidalTrainer: okay well. That’s me not sleeping tonight</p><p>Followed by: if she wants my number I will hand-deliver it on my knees … Or DM me or whatever….</p><p>Back in the living room and still being broadcast on Billys live, Agatha leaned against Tommy’s shoulder and closed her eyes wheres he’d shuffled closer and closer. Her coffee now sat untouched.</p><p>“I’ve been at the office and then court for nearly 16 hours,” she muttered sleepily. “I need to be back there at 6am. If you guys wake me up before then I’ll murder you.”</p><p>“We’ll be quiet,” Billy said softly.</p><p>“Don’t say things you don’t mean teen….”</p><p>Her voice got quieter, softer, drifting off as the warmth of the couch and the Teen snuggled to her side swallowed her up. She wasn’t fully asleep, not yet. But her eyes were closed. Her shoulders dropped. And she looked… peaceful.</p><p>Like someone who had been holding the whole world together all day and was finally, briefly, allowed to stop.</p><p>“Love you, Ags,” Tommy said quietly, almost like a secret, forgetting for a moment they were on Billy’s live.</p><p>“...Love you both too,” she mumbled.</p><p>Billy smiled into the camera. His voice stayed low.</p><p>“Hahaha you all heard that right? She’s asleep now. You’re welcome, internet.”</p><p>The screen froze on Agatha dozing against a Tommy and a throw pillow, barefoot, eyeliner smudged, surrounded by boys she had raised, built a life for, protected like armor.</p><p>And in the comments:<br/>- Don’t talk to me I’m emotionally compromised.<br/>- She’s so much more than the thirst trap we made her into and I’m sobbing.<br/>- She’s hot, she’s tired, she’s raising those boys and still showing up. I’m done for<br/>- I’m jealous of a teen boys shoulder… time to talk to my therapist</p>

<p>Tommy had never been particularly subtle, that was more Billys forte. So when he saw Rio, well known fitness instructor to professional athletes, regularly dropping into their lives, he took the initiative to reach out.</p><p>His DM to Rio was sent at 10:04 PM, sandwiched in her messages between a shared meme about frogs in tiny hats and a message from some sleaze ball who didn’t seem to realise she was a lesbian.</p><p>Tommy: @Thecoolermaximoff<br/>- hey, I was wondering if you would be open to accepting me for training, we could do some collab videos or something?</p><p>Rio stared at it, thumb hovering over the keyboard.<br/>She’d spent the last few weeks watching all of both maximoffs videos and lives as often as she could, solely to see them get terrorized by the woman who looked like she'd been carved out of marble and made Rios heart flutter every time she watched her.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>And now, Tommy, her crushes most frequent victim, wanted training. By her.</p><p>Rio’s Reply was sent exactly 19 Seconds Later, because despite her want to get closer to his Aunt, she had morales and a reputation to maintain.</p><p>Rio:<br/>- My fees are high, I dont do free training for content and my current wait list is about 6 months, sorry kid</p><p>Tommy: @Thecoolermaximoff<br/>- I get that but I’m not asking for freebies or anything, my aunt will pay your usual fees, she’ll also pay a priority fee if you can do out of hours maybe? I just need a decent trainer for over the summer if I want to make the national team and you’ve worked with some of the best</p><p>Rio:<br/>- I could maybe work with that, let me send over my fees and the usual contract, happy to do some collaborations for content</p><p>Tommy:<br/>- Perfect, thank you so much!!! She’s already in bed but I’ll send it over to her email for the morning</p><p>She received a direct bank transfer from a A Harkness at 6am the next morning for $2800 for one month of sessions x2 weekly with the reference off Tommy Maximoff.</p><p>And that was how Rio found herself at 6pm on a Wednesday night in a gym 45 minutes away from her usual, guiding Tommy through a tailored fitness plan.</p><p>Rio had worked with competitive boxers, professional athletes, TikTok egirls, and tech bros with crypto delusions and zero pain tolerance.</p><p>She had seen people vomit mid-set. Cry under a barbell. Wet themselves whilst dead lifting. Nothing shook her.</p><p>Usually.</p><p>Rio was halfway through adjusting the leg press machine when she heard the door.</p><p>The front desk staff didn’t say anything, they stared and one girl was visibly flustered. And that was how Rio knew. Without even looking.</p><p>She turned slowly.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Agaha, beloved boss slay queen aunt of tiktok, in a long black trench coat over a forest green pantsuit that screamed professionally and personally tailored, heels clicking on the gym floor, sunglasses still on despite the fluorescent lighting, carrying a bottle of Smartwater like it was champagne.</p><p>She didn’t smile.</p><p>“Where’s Tommy Nat?” she asked the red head by the door politely, scanning the space, clearly familiar with the gym and its staff.</p><p>“Back corner,” Rio managed to interrupt, stunned. “Rowing machine. He’s trying to beat his best.”</p><p>“He better be trying,” she said, stepping past her without so much as a glance.</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed. She’d seen Agatha dozens of times on TikTok, in the background of twins’ videos, in her own dreams once or twice (or more if she was honest). But up close? In motion?</p><p>Unfair.</p><p>She had a presence like static electricity and dry judgment. She didn’t just walk , she glided.</p><p>Tommy waved from across the gym, earbuds in, sweaty and proud.</p><p>“I got to 2K meters!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Terry,” Agatha called back. “Would you like a sticker?”</p><p>“Don’t start Amy,” he grinned, “I’m trying to impress someone.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, slow and surgical, and then turned back, finally, however as soon as she saw Rio aiming the camera at Tommy, her jaw tightened, eyes already locked on Rio.</p><p>There was no warm-up. No small talk. Just a sharp, “Turn that camera off.”</p><p>The words sliced through the gym hum like a scalpel.</p><p>Rio blinked, confused for half a second. She’d only been filming Tommy, getting some shots for his form review. She wasn’t even facing the camera at her.</p><p>“Wait, it’s just—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, stepping closer. Her voice didn’t rise, but it filled the space. “I don’t care if it’s for your TikTok or your brand or some compilation. You do not film him. You do not post him. You do not put him anywhere without his explicit permission, and if I find out you’ve been recording him to boost your content—”</p><p>Her coat flared slightly as she moved. Her heels clicked like a countdown.</p><p>Tommy, oblivious, was pulling his earbuds out.</p><p>“Hey, Astrid,” he called, cheerful and hoarse. “Rio got the video! I actually looked good…”</p><p>Agatha turned her head, just slightly.</p><p>“Not now, Trevor.”</p><p>Tommy sighed, resigned.</p><p>“Oh god she’s got her murder face on again.”</p><p>Rio held up her hands, calm but firm.</p><p>“I wasn’t filming him for me,” she said. “It’s part of his program. He asked me to. He literally handed me the phone.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t blink.</p><p>“People ask to vape on planes. That doesn’t make it smart.”</p><p>“I’m not exploiting him. I’m training him. Like he asked, like you paid me to.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tensed. She took one more step — close enough that Rio could smell her perfume, something dark and expensive, like pepper and polished wood.</p><p>“Listen carefully,” Agatha said, low now. “I don’t care how many followers you have or how many kettlebells you can toss over your shoulder. That boy is mine. I’ve raised him since he was ten. If you embarrass him, use him, hurt him, or try to stitch him into your little digital marketing plan—”<br/>She leaned in, and her voice was velvet-wrapped threat: “I will make your life hell.”</p><p>It wasn’t a shout. It was a promise.</p><p>For a second, Rio just stood there.</p><p>Breath steady. Pulse loud in her ears. She should have been annoyed. Offended. Defensive. But instead, she felt something else, something complicated.</p><p>Respect. Admiration. Attraction.</p><p>Because behind the terrifying presence and killer outfit, Agatha wasn’t being cruel.</p><p>She was being protective. And it was hot.</p><p>In a way most people didn’t even know how to be.<br/>So Rio nodded once. Careful. Direct.</p><p>“Okay,” she said. “You don’t know me. That’s fair.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“But here’s what you need to know,” Rio continued. “Tommy is safe with me. He’s not content. He’s not leverage. He’s a kid I care about helping. That your literally paying me to help. And if you want to sit in on every session, cross-examine my nutrition plans, and sign off on every video clip—do it.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, waiting for the catch.</p><p>“If you want to be in control,” Rio said, voice softening, “you can be.”</p><p>Something flickered in Agatha’s face, the kind of flicker that happens when someone expected a fight and got a quick submission instead.</p><p>She didn’t speak right away.</p><p>Instead, she turned, checked on Tommy, now pretending to lift a medicine ball over his head and making exaggerated grunting noises.</p><p>“I know he’s ridiculous,” she said finally, “ but so many adults have tried these last few months to make money off of them. Their just kids.”</p><p>“He’s a good ridiculous,” Rio said. “So is Billy, from what I’ve seen. But you seem to have a handle on it all.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbed her forehead like she was staving off a headache.</p><p>“They haven’t a clue how many contracts I’m having to review for them before they even get sight of them and how many cease and desists have been sent out.”</p><p>“You’re doing something right then, looking out for them,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha turned. Looked at her. For the first time — really looked. And then said, dry as ever:</p><p>“You’re irritatingly sincere for someone with visible abs.”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>Agatha gestured to Tommy.</p><p>“Five minutes Tony. Then you’re done for tonight.”</p><p>Tommy beamed. “Thanks.”</p><p>“I’ll wait in the car, the smell of sweaty teenage boy is making me gag.”</p><p>She turned to go. But just before she reached the door, she paused, half over her shoulder.</p><p>“See you around sweetheart,” she said, looking her up and down clearly checking her out.</p><p>Rio's mouth opened. Then closed. She stared after her. Let out a breath. Flushed. “Okay,” she muttered. “So that happened.”</p><p>Tommy uploaded a new TikTok video that night: it opened with a clip of Rio spotting him during a deadlift, followed by his on the rowing machine, Rio had captured his back and forth with Agatha so obviously that had been included, the close being Agatha asking if he wanted a sticker.</p><p>@BillyMaximoff: You try so hard but you know everyones only here for #AuntAgatha</p><p>- Why is she so fucking hot 🥵🥵🥵🥵<br/>- Rio and Agatha in the same room - Jealous!!!<br/>- Yes maam, I want a sticker</p><p>The following Saturday, the next session with Tommy, was one of those Saturdays where the sky couldn't decide whether it wanted to rain or blind everyone. But inside the gym, the mood was chaotic. This time, both Billy and Agatha came along and stayed, allegedly to supervise, but mostly because Billy promised he’d film content for Tommy.</p><p>“For fitness purposes,” he said, smirking.</p><p>“For clout,” Agatha corrected. “Let’s not pretend your above it.”</p><p>Rather than actually film content though, Billy decided to just go live from the gym. He angled his phone slightly, lip-glossed and grinning into the front camera.</p><p>“Back in the gym! I’m supervising my feral twin while he pretends he’s a professional athlete. Also…. More Agatha in the wild!!”</p><p>The camera panned to Agatha, tying her hair up with one hand, black nails gleaming. She was in a sleek, razor-cut black sports bra, high-waisted leggings, and a cropped zip-up jacket that clung in exactly the right places.</p><p>The Argument started only a few minutes in.</p><p>Tommy groaned mid-plank and looked over at Agatha, who was leant lazily against a wall like she had no bones.</p><p>“You literally can’t even touch your toes,” he puffed.</p><p>“Incorrect, Troy. I’m hypermobile.”</p><p>“That’s not even a real word.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“You cannot be more flexible than me.”</p><p>“I did ballet for eleven years and taught myself aerial yoga during quarantine. I could do a backflip into a split on command.”</p><p>Billy, eyes lighting up in recognition of amazing content, zoomed in, watching the viewer reactions roll in.</p><p>“You heard it here, folks. Agatha just said she can do a backflip into a split. I don’t believe her.”</p><p>Tommy scoffed. “That’s not even possible at your age.”</p><p>Agatha arched one brow and flicked his ear. “Say I won’t.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Tommy said, confident. “You’d dislocate your hip.”</p><p>“I’ll dislocate you in a minute, Tate.”</p><p>Rio, who had finished showing Tommy how to stretch, had took a water break near the mirrors. She turned around mid-sip, caught in the frame of Billys live, just as Agatha took three smooth steps forward away from the wall, flipped effortlessly, and landed in a full center split like she was in the olympics.</p><p>No warm-up. No hesitation.</p><p>The room went dead quiet.</p><p>Billy shrieked.</p><p>Rio’s water bottle hit the floor as she drooled water out of her mouth in shock.</p><p>The comments on the live exploded.</p><p>- OMFG can this woman be any more of a thirst trap?!?!<br/>- Lesbians everywhere just collectively orgasmed<br/>- Don’t think we didn’t see you drooling Rio<br/>- Please say someone is screen recording this??? I need it… for reasons<br/>- Rios whole future just flashed before her eyes, ending in marriage 😂😂😂😂</p><p>Rio stood frozen, still half-crouched reaching for her dropped bottle, mouth slightly open.</p><p>Agatha, entirely unbothered, brushed invisible dust from her thigh and raised a single brow.</p><p>“I accept your apology, Tobias.”</p><p>“How!! How Ashley!!!,” Tommy cried.</p><p>Billy spun the camera toward Rio just in time to catch her blinking like someone had just lit a firework inside her brain.</p><p>“Rio?” Billy asked sweetly. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, eyes still on Agatha. “Fine. Yep. Great. Uh. Do it again?”</p><p>Agatha stood, slow and easy, like this was just another Saturday.</p><p>“I don’t perform on demand,” she said.</p><p>“Unless there’s wine involved,” Billy stage-whispered.</p><p>“And don’t post that split,” she added, already knowing it was too late.</p><p>Billy smiled directly into the camera.</p><p>“So sorry, your honor. You were live and the internet’s already in love.”</p><p>Tommy, once he was finished with his session and had reviewed everything Billy recorded, also posted a new tiktok.</p><p>Caption: “When your gym trainer meets your Aunt</p><p>The video was the screen recording from his argument with Agatha, however, he’d cut out all of the clips with him in and had left just Agatha and Rios reaction to Agatha, slow motion panning from Agatha to Rio drooling,</p><p>- Would it be workplace harassment if I welcomed the attention?!?<br/>- i can’t believe we all just witnessed a case of gay panic in real time<br/>- she said she was hypermobile and now Rio’s hyperventilating<br/>- Mother is mothering and Rios down bad</p><p>The videos had been circulating for three days.</p><p>Billy’s live was reposted on meme accounts.</p><p>Twitter. Instagram. Some chaotic corner of Reddit titled r/WifemeAgatha curating Agatha content like she was the second coming of christ but in lesbian form.</p><p>Someone edited it to dramatic opera music.</p><p>Another reversed it and played it frame-by-frame like it was NFL footage.</p><p>One person uploaded a video of their grandmother watching Agatha land the split and whispering, “I see now why the Lord made some women like women.”</p><p>And through all of this, Rio did not comment. She didn’t like it. She didn’t repost it. She didn’t even ask either maximoff to take it down.</p><p>But she watched it.</p><p>So many times her phone began suggesting Agatha content under the fitness tag.</p><p>And finally, she broke, addressing the video in her own tiktok.</p><p>The video opened with Rio in her hoodie, post-shower, hair still wet and head in her hands.</p><p>She’d added a text overlay:</p><p>- POV: You’re a normal fitness instructor until she does a backflip and splits in leggings and ruins your life.</p><p>The video cut to Rio watching the Agatha video on a split screen - watching herself sipping water, then spitting it out mid-split.  She stared at the screen. Blinked. Looks at the camera. Then she hits replay. Again. And again.</p><p>Rio then slowly laid down on her gym floor, whispering: “I am not okay. I am so serious. It’s living in my head rent free.”</p><p>Then she followed up with a slideshow of blurry zoom-ins of Agatha’s face, her form, the split, the bounce when she landed, all with increasingly feral reaction text:<br/>* how is she a real person<br/>* do lawyers usually have quads like that???<br/>* what perfume is that and why do I want it on my pillow forever<br/>* SHE DIDN’T EVEN STRETCH FIRST</p><p>The end of her video was Rio fanning herself and winking at the camera. Billys comment was pinned to the top.</p><p>@BillyMaximoff: Hahaha she doesn’t know about half of these videos  and please never show her this i am begging you<br/>- this is the gayest thing i’ve ever seen and i was at pride when tegan and sara showed up in a jeep<br/>- Rio join the support group. We cry every Tuesday. Bring wine.<br/>- I’m still processing<br/>- Okay but just kiss already</p><p>Billy kept Rios video a secret for nearly four hours. Until Tommy, cackling in the car on the way home from practice, let the TikTok autoplay on full volume.</p><p>Agatha, in sunglasses and a perfectly tailored blazer, paused mid-turn.</p><p>“Was that my me doing the backflip the other day?”</p><p>Billy gripped his phone tighter. “No?”</p><p>Tommy leaned between the seats. “You're famous, Amanda.”</p><p>“I told you two not to post me.”</p><p>“Technically,” Billy hedged, “you said to stop filming you. Which we do, when you ask.”</p><p>Agatha snatched Billy’s phone, watched exactly five seconds of Rio’s drooling video, and then silently handed it back.</p><p>“We’re switching gyms.”</p><p>“You’re blushing,” Tommy sang.</p><p>“I will leave you both at the side of the road to walk home. Shut up.”</p>

<p>The video was supposed to be about Billy.</p><p>He’d set up his ring light, brushed and styled  his curls just so, lined his eyes in a deep emerald shade that matched the backlight behind his bed.</p><p>The live caption said: ask me anything 💋✨ i’m bored, i’m pretty, i’m listening</p><p>The first few questions were along the lines of what he expected, aimed for him about him:</p><p>- What eyeliner do you use?<br/>- Are you single?<br/>- Do you actually like your twin or is it an elaborate long con?</p><p>But as usual, a few minutes in, the comments shifted. Fast.</p><p>- what’s Aunt agatha’s favorite band or singer???<br/>- does she have a comfort food or is she too hot for that<br/>- please give us 5 fun facts about agatha we are BEGGING</p><p>Billy didn’t even try to resist. He sighed dramatically, flopped back on his pillows, and smiled at the camera.</p><p>“Okay, fine. You want the Agatha Lore Drop? You get it.”</p><p>“So someones asked What’s her favorite band or singer? Fleetwood Mac. No question. Also Hozier. She says his voice sounds like what good whiskey tastes like. And Mumford &amp; Sons and Lana Del Ray. She likes loads of music really.’”</p><p>His eyes scanned the chat, ignoring the outlandish and downright inappropriate questions, looking for ones that were safe to answer.</p><p>“Okay, this one - whats her favourite comfort food.” Billy leaned in, whispered like it was national security.</p><p>“Corndogs. From gas stations. Not fancy. Gas. Station. Corn. Dogs.”</p><p>He held up a hand to swear he was telling the truth.</p><p>“One time she picked me up from a party in her silk pyjamas and wanted one that bad she went inside in them and bought us both one for the way home, she made me swear on my eyeliner I’d never tell anyone about it.”</p><p>He winked at the camera.</p><p>“You’re welcome for that visual.”</p><p>His eyes continued scanning the chat, laughing softly at all of the thirsty comments.</p><p>“Okay, another one, whats her favourite color It’s purple. Deep, moody, royalty-core purple, she has some killer outfits in it as well - one second I’ll show you.“</p><p>Billy screen shared some photos of Agatha’s beat purple outfits, including her in a plum tailored suit and another in a deep-v violet silk wrap she wore to a party once.</p><p>- so fucking hot 🥵 🔥<br/>- Queeeeennnnn</p><p>“Okay, calm down she’s old enough to be some of your moms. Lets see, another Q. Does she like animals? Agatha pretends not to like anything small or fluffy. But she loves rabbits. Like. Deeply. She says she ‘relates to them on a spiritual level.’ We used to have a rescue bunny named scratchy and she built it a three-story enclosure and used real moss and plants that she changed all the time so he had variety.”</p><p>Billy took a deep breath, fingers laced together dramatically.<br/>“Alright. You wanted five fun facts? You’re getting five.</p><p>1. She’s obsessed with horror films — the trashier, the better. Give her a martini and a haunting and she’s locked in.<br/>2. She knows every word to “Bodak Yellow” and refuses to explain how or why.<br/>3. She can speak spanish fluently<br/>4. She once out-argued our principal into reversing a suspension for Tommy. Not even her favorite twin.<br/>5. She hand-writes thank-you notes. On custom embossed stationery. In ink. In cursive. Like it’s 1895.”</p><p>Billy laughed so hard he snorted when he read a comment asking when she’d make her own account on tiktok.</p><p>“No. She won’t, she doesn’t even know what a FYP is. God forbid she ever did and saw half the things we’ve posted of her, she’d murder us.”</p><p>He continued flicking through the viewer comments, laughing at some of the responses. He saw a suggestion for a rapid fire of Agathas preferences and decided to go with it.</p><p>“Okay, a Bonus Round of Agatha Lore: Rapid-Fire Preferences</p><p>* Her coffee order: Black. Extra shot. No sugar. Will judge your order<br/>* Her guilty pleasure: Trashy romance books with horrible covers.<br/>* Her sleep habits: Five hours max on a work noght, blackout mask, silk pillowcase, no exceptions. Weekends she likes a lie in<br/>* Her biggest fear: Feelings.<br/>* Her biggest weakness: Also feelings”</p><p>He continued, “anyway its obvious she’s the main character and we are all just side-quests but I love her for it.”</p><p>- gas station corndogs. she’s perfect. she’s real. i love her.<br/>- agatha listening to hozier and being a queen all up in her feelings is now canon 😭😭😭<br/>- if she ever makes a tiktok the world will stop spinning and we’ll all ascend<br/>- I want this woman so bad, im literally gagging for her on my hands and knees</p><p>Rio hadn’t meant to open TikTok that night.</p><p>She was already behind on her sleep, her shoulders sore from back-to-back clients, and she’d just finished logging her macros like a responsible adult.</p><p>But then she saw it.</p><p>@BillyMaximoff: ask me anything 💋✨</p><p>The live was already in progress, Billy smirking under neon lighting, and the comments were… unhinged.</p><p>Rio clicked. She couldn’t help it. She didn’t even pretend to think about it first.</p><p>She was half-sprawled across her bed, holding her green tea in one hand and her phone in the other. Her eyes were already wide.</p><p>“... she built it a three-story enclosure and used real moss” Billy was saying “and plants that she changed all the time so he had variety.”</p><p>Rio groaned into her pillow. “Of course she did,” she muttered. “Of course she’s a cottagecore woman at heart.”</p><p>Rio watched the chat explode with comments, woman of all ages lusting after Agatha.</p><p>- mother pls, saw a pic of her hands the other day and thats all I can think about<br/>- she’s built from vengeance and caffeine<br/>- i would let her yell at me, step on me and I’d</p><p>And all she could think was: God, same.</p><p>Then she continued watching the live, intent on pearning more about the enigmatic woman that was always on her mind.</p><p>“Does Agatha date?” Billy paused. His lips twitched.</p><p>“Bold of you to assume she has time for that. Her schedule is ‘win cases, judge silently, sip wine and deliver sarcasm. But,” he added after a beat, “she’s dated. Rarely. But some really pretty women.”</p><p>Rio sat up straight, her empty teacup hit her thigh with a thud.</p><p>Billy kept talking, voice casual but sharp. “It’s hard for her. She’s always been in protector mode, especially with me and Tommy. She doesn’t let people in unless she knows they can’t hurt us.”</p><p>A pause as he read the numerous comments flooding in.</p><p>“Her type? Ugh. I hate this question because now you’re gonna judge every woman you see around her. But fine.”</p><p>Billy’s eyes glittered with mischief, knowing the chaos his words would cause.</p><p>“She likes women who are… strong. Physically, sure. But mentally. Women who can take care of themselves, but still make room for her. Quiet confidence. People who don’t scare easy. And she loves when someone can match her sarcasm.” He leaned in, deadly serious. “Also, if you can physically lift her, it’s over. I’ve seen it happen.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t blink.</p><p>Didn’t breathe.</p><p>Her mind played on a reel of every time Agatha had raised an eyebrow at her across the gym. Every time she’d made a comment with that knife-dry wit. Every time Rio had watched her move and thought: I could keep up with you. I could handle all of that.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now she was lying there in gym shorts thinking - Oh my God. I have a chance. I’m her type. She risked reading through the incoming comments:</p><p>- strong women with sarcasm?? bestie i am on the floor<br/>- did rio see this. blink twice if you’re spiraling rn queen<br/>- she likes being lifted! i’m literally a personal trainer, NOTICE ME MOTHER!!!<br/>- Petition to date aunt agatha<br/>- I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE!!!</p><p>Rio, still stunned, finally clicked out of the app. And whispered into the empty room: “Okay… Okay. So now what?”</p><p>Because now?</p><p>Now she wanted to show up to Agatha’s house with flowers. She had to have a plan for Tommys next session in a few days to make Agatha notice her.</p><p>Tommy had been prepared to film some Agatha in the wild gym content at his next session with Rio, expecting Agatha to go in with him. Today, though, she didn’t even unbuckle her seatbelt.</p><p>She just leaned across the car’s passenger seat in her usual no-nonsense blazer to ruffle his hair, lips painted the color of expensive wine, and said:</p><p>“Do not let that woman talk you into squatting until your spine gives out.”</p><p>Tommy grinned, sensing that his Aunt was trying to avoid her, still slightly flustered from seeing Rios video.</p><p>“You’re scared Rio’s gonna out-alpha you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Please. I could out-alpha her in heels with a migraine.”</p><p>“Sure, Amanda.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Goodbye, Trevor, I’ll be hack in an hour.”</p><p>And just like that, she was gone, tires spinning, windows tinted like judgment.</p><p>He was mid-plank and regretting everything when he heard the gym door open. The air shifted. Even Rio, who’d been cool and focused all session, looked up like something had passed over her grave.</p><p>Agatha walked in. Like someone deeply unimpressed with fluorescent lighting and already aware that at least three people were staring at her.</p><p>“Is this your idea of cardio?” she asked Tommy, toeing the mat with one sleek black boot. “Looks like slow torture.”</p><p>“You’d know,” Tommy grunted, voice strangled.</p><p>Rio, still holding a water bottle, cleared her throat and stood taller.</p><p>“If you’re here to criticize, I’ll charge for double sessions.”</p><p>Agatha’s head turned, slowly. She took in Rio’s sharp cheekbones, sports bra, and visible biceps with a glance so clinical it almost made Rio shiver.</p><p>“Do you always charge extra for bad flirting?”</p><p>“Only when it works.”</p><p>Tommy froze mid-crunch.</p><p>Rio smiled, slow and sure. “You’re a tough crowd, Agatha.”</p><p>“And you’re a walking annoyance. Congratulations.”</p><p>“Yet you came back.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t blink.</p><p>“I came to pick up the human pull-up bar I raised from the ashes of mediocrity. Not for you.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, just enough for the air between them to pull tight and for her to feel her breath against her.</p><p>“If you wanted to stay and spot him, I could find you something to hold.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I prefer cross-examining witnesses to lifting iron. Less sweat.”</p><p>Tommy, now fully seated on the mat, threw his towel over his head.</p><p>“I hate both of you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and glanced sideways at Rio, just a flicker of something softer in her eyes.</p><p>“That makes two of us.” Then. She winked, winked! At Rio before smirking at her,  clearly and obviously checking her out.</p><p>Agatha left that day without saying anything else.<br/>Just a nod. A flick of her hair. A quiet, dangerous smile.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio didn’t stop thinking about her all night.</p>

<p>The gala invite arrived out of the blue and without fanfare, Rio had been glancing at her phone between clients (if she was looking at Agatha thirst traps, sue her) when she felt a presence come closer. She didn’t need to look ip to know it was the object of her thoughts, the subtle fragrance of power washing over her as she leant closer, Tommy moving ahead to set up.</p><p>“I need a plus-one for the Stark charity gala tomorrow. I’d usually take the twins but Tommy’s out at a track meet up and Billy has a date that he thinks he’s keeping a secret. You’re marginally less embarrassing.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes wide and heart beating. She was still holding her phone and suddenly wasn’t sure whether to drop it or throw it.</p><p>“Are you asking me to the gala?”</p><p>“Don’t be dramatic about it. I’m inviting you because I’m paying you an offensive amount for personal training. It seems only fair that some of that money circulates back to the underprivileged. Through a charity event. With you. In formalwear.”</p><p>“So… not a date?”</p><p>“Absolutely not. It’s in the interest of philanthropy. And logistics. Just don’t wear sportswear.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“Give me your phone.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her phone, handing it over with a bemused expression, completely overwhelmed with what seemed to be happening.</p><p>Agatha added herself to Rio contacts without fanfare.</p><p>“I’ll text you the address and see you there.” With that she strutted over to Tommy to say she’d be back for him in an hour and then sauntered out like she’d not just caused Rio to internally combust.</p><p>Rio laughed out loud as she made her way to Tommy. So this was happening. Apparently.</p><p>The next evening Billy was in full stylist mode, waving a brush like a conductor in Agathas dressing room.</p><p>Tommy, lying across Agathas duvet with his phone already filming, camera pointed into the next room, was live on TikTok.</p><p>“Welcome to Get Ready With Your Favorite Ice Queen,” Tommy announced. “Tonight’s stark gala look is called: Boss bitch in midnight blue.”</p><p>A shout of “Dollar in the jar” drifted out of her bathroom as the viewer comments rolled in.</p><p>- OH MY GOD IS SHE GOING TO THE STARK GALA???<br/>- show the dress. SHOW THE DRESS.</p><p>Agatha, now seated at her vanity in a purple silk robe with her hair in pin curls, turned just enough to glare at the phone.</p><p>“If you’re live, I will unplug your spine like a monitor cord.”</p><p>Tommy grinned.</p><p>“Say hi to your fans, Aisling.”</p><p>“Go away Travis. This isn’t say yes to the dress, piss off.”</p><p>“Your hair says otherwise - who do you even think you are”</p><p>Billy slid a deep plum lipstick into view.</p><p>“I told her this shade is called ‘Litigation.’”</p><p>“It’s called ‘Violet Fury,’” Agatha muttered, but let him apply it anyway.</p><p>The chat went feral.</p><p>Rio was watching the live with a bowl of protein oats in her lap, taking a break from her own get ready preparations. The second the camera panned to Agatha’s reflection in the vanity mirror, all bare shoulders, subtle smirk, and eyes like sharpened diamonds, Rio swore under her breath.</p><p>“I’m not ready for this.”</p><p>Her roommate Alice peeked over her shoulder.</p><p>“Wait. Is that the scary lawyer you’re obsessed with and going on a date with tonight? Shes so hot!”</p><p>“I’m not obsessed and it’s not a date.”</p><p>“It totally is - she looks like she eats baby lesbians for breakfast.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio whispered. “What am I supposed to do with that?”</p><p>Agatha then stepped out from the dressing room now in a structured midnight silk gown, low back, with a thigh-high slit that could halt city traffic. Her heels, sleek, red bottomed, impossible, clicked against the hardwood as she walked.</p><p>Tommy panned the camera dramatically.</p><p>Billy gasped.</p><p>“Ma’am.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked. “It’s just a dress.”</p><p>“That’s not a dress. That’s a statement.”</p><p>The comments were an explosion of chaos:<br/>- how is she real. how is SHE REAL<br/>- Boys blink twice if you die inside knowing she’s the hottest woman alive<br/>- does she know what she’s doing to us, does she KNOW<br/>- I just came I swear (Tommy abruptly ended the love after reading that comment).</p><p>The house was oddly quiet once the live ended.</p><p>Tommy had been banished to his room after loudly threatening to spill a drink on her gown. Agatha was at her vanity, fastening one of her earrings, a small diamond teardrop, the kind that looked understated but probably cost more than a month of rent in most zip codes.</p><p>Billy was the one now sat cross-legged on her bed, holding one heel in his lap, slowly tracing the sole with his finger. He wasn’t filming anymore. He wasn’t even talking.</p><p>Just watching.</p><p>And Agatha, beautiful, sculpted, sharp-jawed Agatha, finally looked up, catching his gaze in the mirror.</p><p>“You’re staring,” she said softly, but not unkindly.</p><p>“You look like a movie villain. In the best way.”</p><p>She smiled. Only a little. “That’s the goal.”</p><p>Billy hesitated. “Do you ever… get nervous?”</p><p>Agatha paused. Just for a second. “About what?”</p><p>“Everything. Everyone’s expectations of you.”</p><p>She turned toward him then, not in the mirror, but fully, one arm resting in her lap, one earring still loose in her fingers.</p><p>His next words were whispered… “I’m not like you..”</p><p>“Where have I heard that before. What’s going through that tiny little brain of yours hmmmm?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Okay, you don’t want to tell me, thats fine. But, don’t you dare feel guilty about your talents. Thats what makes you special.”</p><p>Billy nodded like he understood, even if he didn’t fully. “But I’m not strong like you.”</p><p>“Your not supposed to be, because thats my job,” she said. “Your you, your unique, your brilliant and don’t you dare let anyone ever make you feel otherwise.”</p><p>She reached over and handed him the second earring.</p><p>“Here. Help me.”</p><p>Billy stood, moving carefully to fasten the delicate clasp behind her ear. His fingers were warm. A little shaky.</p><p>“I think you’re the strongest person I’ve ever met,” he said quietly, voice thick. “Like… ever.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. Her perfectly painted nails. Her ring, the one she always wore on her left index finger, heavy and silver and old.</p><p>“I’m actually pretty tired most of the time,” she murmured.</p><p>Billy didn’t say anything. But he stepped closer, wrapped his arms around her shoulders from behind, and pressed his forehead gently against her back. Her silk gown was cool under his skin. Her breath was steady.</p><p>“You’re allowed to be tired,” he said.</p><p>“I know,” she replied. “But thank you for reminding me.”</p><p>They stood like that for a minute. Two. The kind of stillness that didn’t need filling. When he finally let go, she turned in her chair and caught his face in one hand, thumb resting against his cheekbone, expression unreadable.</p><p>“You and your brother are the best thing I never asked for you know. And you can come to me with anything.”</p><p>Billy blinked quickly, tried to cover it with a crooked grin.</p><p>“God, you’re so dramatic.”</p><p>“It’s the dress.”</p><p>“No, it’s you. You dramatic even in sweatpants.”</p><p>She smirked. “Don’t tell your brother I said anything nice. I have a reputation to protect.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Billy said, already typing it into the notes app on his phone. “This is going in the wedding toast when you marry Rio.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her cheeks flushed faintly, and she turned away just before he could tease her for it.</p><p>Rio stood just inside the marble entry of the Museum holding the gala, smoothing invisible wrinkles from her black tailored jumpsuit. It was clean-lined, minimal, daring in a way that didn’t try too hard. Still, she kept tugging at her sleeves, trying to steady her breath.</p><p>She wasn’t sure why she was so anxious.</p><p>Actually, she knew exactly why.</p><p>And then the room shifted, quietly, collectively, as Agatha walked in.</p><p>Heads turned. Posture straightened. Conversations paused.</p><p>Agatha didn’t notice. Or pretended not to. She moved like a gazelle, all sleek lines and impossible confidence, her midnight blue gown catching the light. Her dark curls had been swept back, earrings catching flashes of gold from the chandeliers.</p><p>She walked toward Rio with a glass of champagne already in hand and an unreadable look in her eyes.</p><p>“I hope you didn’t wear sneakers under that,” she said.</p><p>Rio exhaled a laugh. “Didn’t want to risk your wrath.”</p><p>“Smart woman.”<br/>She sipped her drink, eyes flicking down Rio’s outfit. “You clean up well. Almost too well. I might have competition for once.”</p><p>“You’re joking.”</p><p>“I never joke,” Agatha deadpanned. “Especially not about being the best-dressed woman in the room.”</p><p>They’d mingled. Spoke with donors. Posed for a photo beside a local judge who thought Agatha was "just delightful.”</p><p>Agatha had fielded five offers for her law firm to expand into entertainment law. She’d rolled her eyes at four and promised to consider it to the fifth, mostly because he had good taste in cufflinks and whiskey.</p><p>Rio had never seen anyone own a room like this. But she also noticed the way Agatha leaned against the wall when she thought no one was watching, her shoulders dipping just slightly, like even she had to take a breath sometimes.</p><p>It was quieter outside. A warm breeze moved through the trees, and fairy lights shimmered within the museum garden.</p><p>Agatha stood there, now with her heels dangling from one hand, toes pressed flat to the flagstone.<br/>Rio approached quietly.</p><p>“Taking a break?”</p><p>Agatha turned, her expression unreadable in the low light.</p><p>“Just a quick one, some of these people are exhausting.”</p><p>“You mean to tell me you’re not invincible?”</p><p>“Only on weekdays.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, stepping closer. Their shoulders almost touched. Almost.</p><p>“You’re really good at this, you know,” she said. “Working a room. Owning it.”</p><p>“It’s not owning,” Agatha replied. “It’s deflecting. Everyone looks at the dress, the voice, the hair. No one looks close enough to see the cracks.”</p><p>There was a pause. The breeze stirred the hem of Agatha’s gown.</p><p>“And if someone did look close enough?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes turned to her, slow, deliberate, blue and burning.</p><p>“Then I suppose I’d have to decide whether I let them stay.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look away.</p><p>“Maybe you should.”</p><p>A beat passed. Agatha tilted her head, just slightly.</p><p>“Are you flirting with me, Rio?”</p><p>“Depends,” Rio said softly. “Is it working?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled, not a smirk this time, not quite. Something smaller. Real.</p><p>“I’ll let you know after dessert.”</p><p>Unbeknownst to the …someone across the balcony, a caterer, had been filming. Not maliciously. Just… opportunistically.</p><p>The clip was less than thirty seconds: the camera shaky, but clearly showing Agatha barefoot, gown swirling, talking closely with Rio, who was smiling like no one else existed. Their body language said everything, the closeness, the quiet intimacy, the charged pause before the moment ended.</p><p>The caption on TikTok, posted just an hour later, was: Not me catching the Boss Queen Aunt Agatha flirting with fitness Rio at the stark Gala 👀👀👀</p><p>It hit 300K views in the first hour.</p><p>After their moment on the balcony, Rio thought Agatha might retreat, find some excuse to detach. Disappear into a conversation with a professional. Glide back into aloofness like it was a second skin.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>She stayed close.</p><p>They drifted back into the party together, and the space between them remained, undeniably, smaller.</p><p>The ballroom had swelled again with music and chatter. A jazz quartet played something languid and warm. Waiters passed flutes of champagne, little gold-rimmed dishes of fig tartlets and miniature shrimp towers.</p><p>Rio caught the faintest smile tug at Agatha’s mouth when someone called her name from across the room and she very deliberately turned in the opposite direction.</p><p>“They wanted to talk about real estate law,” Agatha said under her breath. “I’d rather impale myself on a cocktail fork.”</p><p>“You know, for someone with such menace, you hide it very well.”</p><p>“That’s not menace,” Agatha corrected. “That’s discretion.”</p><p>“And this?” Rio nodded toward the two of them.<br/>Agatha didn’t blink.</p><p>“This is… recklessly tolerable.”</p><p>Rio grinned, chest warming, confidence increasing, sing songed. “You’re flirting.”</p><p>“I’m being polite.”</p><p>“If this is just polite, I’d love to see you actually flirt.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lingered on her then, not in a dramatic, cinematic way, but quiet. Considered.</p><p>“Hmmm,” she murmured, voice low, “I’m sure you would.”</p><p>They moved together through the party, interrupted only by shallow conversations and people trying too hard to impress Agatha, who fielded every one with barely concealed boredom.</p><p>Rio flirted the way she trained: persistent, intentional, and a little bit smug.</p><p>Agatha’s replies were sharp, acidic, and somehow still encouraging, letting Rio inch closer, never fully pushing her away.</p><p>“What’s your deal, Agatha?” Rio asked at one point, tipping her head toward her, two drinks in. “You’ve got this whole Wall Street Medusa thing going, but you care. You show up for Tommy. You show up for Billy. That’s not armor, that’s heart.”</p><p>Agatha blinked once, slowly. “You don’t know me well enough to make such an assumption.”</p><p>“Maybe I’d like to.”</p><p>There was a pause. Agatha downed the last of her champagne and set the glass down neatly. “Dangerous thing to want.”</p><p>Hours in, the party had thinned. The music had faded into something soft and string-heavy.</p><p>Someone was laughing in the hallway. An older woman had fallen asleep upright in a velvet armchair, clutching a purse shaped like a swan.</p><p>Agatha stood beside the coat check, having donated a hefty fogure, matched by Rio much to Agathas amusement, one heel dangling lazily from a finger, her gown whispering around her ankles as she shifted her weight.</p><p>Rio stepped beside her, voice lower now, private.</p><p>“I had a really good time tonight.”</p><p>“I’m glad,” Agatha replied, “you were surprisingly good company.”</p><p>“I want to kiss you,” Rio said, blunt. No theatrics. Just truth.</p><p>Agatha turned to her.</p><p>Eyes steady.</p><p>Face unreadable.</p><p>Then, softly: “Are you asking for permission?”</p><p>“I’m giving you the option.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha said nothing. Not yes. Not no. Just stood there, gaze narrowed, weighing Rio like she weighed contracts. And then she reached out, fingers curling into the lapel of Rio’s jumpsuit and pulled her in.</p><p>The kiss was nothing like Rio expected.</p><p>It wasn’t shy. It wasn’t frantic. It was precise. Slow.</p><p>The kind of kiss that makes a person rethink what kissing is supposed to be. Agatha tasted like champagne and power. Her hand slid around the back of Rio’s neck, anchoring her there, not demanding, but holding.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Rio’s heart was full sprint.</p><p>Agatha blinked at her once, then said, deadpan:<br/>“If you turn this into a TikTok, I will sue you.”</p><p>“Worth it,” Rio murmured, breathless.</p><p>“Don’t test me.”</p><p>They didn’t know about the phone in the corner. About the girl from stark finance, drunk and nosy, who had filmed from the edge of the ballroom, no sound, just shadows and candlelight and that kiss.</p><p>The video would be posted before midnight.</p><p>Caption: The Ice Queen has melted. And I am not okay. #AuntAgatha #RioVidal #SapphicRoyalty #GalaAfterDark #WhoNeedsFiction</p><p>By sunrise, it would have a million views, the comment section chaotically feral.</p><p>- OMG I AM SO JEALOUS OF RIO<br/>- *pushes their faces together* now kiss 💋<br/>- Im just going to lay in bed and pretend im Rio, okay, bye<br/>- No but why does she look so soft 🥵🔥<br/>- When two sides of tiktok collide this is what you get 🔥💋🔥💋🔥<br/>- Say a prayer for all of the heartbroken lesbians everywhere 😂</p><p>But tonight?</p><p>Tonight, Agatha slid her arm through Rio’s and walked out into the night without looking back.</p>

<p>The first thing Rio became aware of the next morning was her phone buzzing like she’d sat on it.</p><p>She woke up in her apartment — clothes from last night sprawled across the floor like breadcrumbs of a dream she still couldn’t fully remember. Her head hurt. In a good way.</p><p>She reached for the buzzing phone. Her heart stopped.</p><p>Notifications: 7.3K new comments 2.1K new followers 300+ message requests on TikTok</p><p>A grainy video, shot from an odd angle of her and Agatha from last night appeared on her FYP. It was, grainy but unmistakable , the kiss— subtly filmed and it had already gone viral. The caption: The Ice Queen has melted. And I am not okay.</p><p>Her mind reeled as she scrolled the first few comments:<br/>- HEART ATTACK IN 15 SECONDS. Agatha’s NOT real.<br/>- Fuck Agatha has the moves - the way she pulled her in 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵<br/>- SHE KISSED HER. Kissy kiss kiss<br/>- Rio! OH MY GOD<br/>- No because I need to know if Rios still alive</p><p>Her muscles felt tight. Heart pounding. A wave of anxiety ran through her. And yet, she couldn’t stop smiling. Even in the video you could see their chemistry, could see the way she leant into her, the look in Agathas eyes as she pulled Rio by the lapel towards her.</p><p>She needed to see her again.</p><p>At home, the twins were awake and loving the chaos from the videos at the gala. Billy was in front of his laptop, scrolling with panicked excitement.</p><p>“THEY’RE GETTING SO MANY COMMENTS I CAN’T BREATH.”</p><p>Tommy, still in pajamas, watched the video on his phone.</p><p>“THAT’S A KISS, EURGHH NOW MY SESSIONS ARE GOING TO BE WEIRD!.”</p><p>“Tommy. SHE HELD HER NECK. SHE HELD HER NECK. THAS SUCH A POWER MOVE.”</p><p>Agatha was already at work, obliviois to the chaos from last night,busy filing documents, real work, paperwork that paid bills and ran the firm, when her secretary knocked.</p><p>“Morning. Something popped up on the socials that I think you need to see, it’s a little different to usual.”</p><p>“The what, what is it?”</p><p>“Your… online presence. Some… video.”</p><p>She frowned. “Show me.”</p><p>The secretary handed over an iPad. The title alone made her pause:</p><p>“The Ice Queen Has Melted…”</p><p>She pressed play. Twenty seconds in, the undeniable silhouette of her gown, the tilt of her head, the pull towards her, the lingering kiss.</p><p>Her perfectly cultivated world, private, controlled, now slightly fractured, slowly being dismantled by what started as a normal conversation with Billy over make up but was steadily spiralling.</p><p>She didn’t look at the comments.</p><p>She just shut it off.</p><p>Two hours later, her and Jen were locked in Agathas office having a debrief. Jen was in professional mode, but still laughing as her friend visibly panicked, which was a rarity- because this was different to the boys videos, this was a private moment, something meant to be just between her and Rio, that had now been shared by hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>“It’s trending. You have 200,000 TikTok saves. There’s zero legal risk. No policies bar this. But marketing might spin it for some engagement online. Should we… make a statement?”</p><p>“No. I’m not explaining myself. We don’t market me. Our reputation is built on us winning cases, not internet notoriety. We just keep doing our jobs.”</p><p>Jen nodded. Agreed. But they still discussed risk, continued public interest, clients, speculation - all manageable for now. Even the continued emails and random drop ins to the firm, which were dealt with swiftly and firmly, were irritating, but could be handled.</p><p>But this was getting more personal now, it wasn’t her boys having fun and being kids, or colleagues doing innocent trends, this was grown adults, professionals, filming her without consent or knowledge, to try make some money or to gain clout online.</p><p>That afternoon, after she had handled meeting after meeting with a steadily rising frustration, her phone buzzed — Rio. She chuckled slightly as she saw it flash with what she had saved the contact under.</p><p>Gym Rat 💀💀💀: Thanks for last night. I had a great time</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. Not yet. Because sometimes, even she needed time to sort her thoughts and feelings out. Rio, however, was persistent, when she didn’t respond, another message came through an hour later.</p><p>Gym Rat 💀💀💀: Want to grab dinner with me saturday? 7? Somewhere private?</p><p>Agatha: Vineyard Bistro. Ask for table at the back</p><p>Agatha hadn’t planned to go out as the week drew to a close. She rarely did unless it was work related or something the boys wanted to do. But Jen had just won a brutal class action, and Lilia, one of oldest friends (a former real estate agent turned psychic to the stars), was back in town.</p><p>There were oysters. Expensive mezcal. Laughter that hadn’t rung that loud from Agatha in years.</p><p>She wore a tailored black jumpsuit, skin glowing, hair loose and full of rebellious curls. She had on red lipstick and a silver chain that caught the light. She looked, and knew she looked, hot.</p><p>Jen, in gold stilettos and a slinky pink silk dress, had an arm slung over Lilia, who wore boots and a vintage blazer that still smelled like paint thinner and incense.</p><p>By the time they made their way back to Agathas house, a dozen margaritas between them, the night wasn’t winding down, it was winding up.</p><p>Billy awoke to the sound of music thudding through the floor like thunder had decided to host a pride parade, at 1:07am.</p><p>He cracked open one eye.</p><p>“What the hell.”</p><p>From across the hall, Tommy groaned and opened his door.</p><p>“Is it an earthquake or is Agatha drunk?”</p><p>They stumbled downstairs, bleary-eyed, hair flattened at odd angles. And there they were.</p><p>Agatha, Jen, and Lilia,  all standing on the marble kitchen island, barefoot, tequila glasses in hand, singing at full volume:</p><p>“Put the lime in the coconut and drink it all up…”</p><p>The Bluetooth speakers were blaring the Practical Magic soundtrack — first Coconut, then it slid into Stevie Nicks’ Crystal, and Agatha knew every word.</p><p>Jen shook a salt shaker like a maraca. Lilia was flinging lime wedges across the room, aiming for the sink but missing spectacularly.</p><p>Agatha?</p><p>Agatha was tossing her head back, red lipstick smudged at the corner of her mouth, eyeliner still perfect, singing like she was on stage at coachella, using a spatula as a microphone.</p><p>Her jumpsuit had come partially unzipped in the back, the silk slipping just slightly off one shoulder.</p><p>Billy blinked, grabbed his phone, and out of pure instinct at this point, went live.</p><p>“Why Is My Life Like This”</p><p>He held the camera up shakily, yawning.</p><p>The screen filled with Agatha in full chaos mode, dancing barefoot across the marble with Jen, the two of them dramatically re-enacting scenes from the movie, Lilia shaking her hips to the beat like she was twenty years younger.</p><p>“This is not how I imagined my night,” Billy whispered.</p><p>“I’m going to have trauma from watching Andi and co do high kicks in our kitchen,” Tommy muttered behind him.</p><p>But the comments were immediate and feral:</p><p>- AGATHA??? IN A LOW BACK JUMPSUIT??<br/>- Her voice 🥹🥹🥹 my baby 🥹🥹🥹<br/>- I’m fully in love with her and also slightly afraid.<br/>- Imagine looking this powerful while dancing drunk on marble countertops.<br/>- Is that Jen Kale? The lawyer who went viral for telling off a CEO outside court!?<br/>- Agatha's hot girl coven is real and I wanna join.</p><p>Billy flipped the camera around mid-yawn.</p><p>“This is my life. I just wanted to sleep. Now there’s tequila on my kitchen floor and I’m emotionally confused.”</p><p>From behind him, Agatha pointed the spatula at him like a dagger.</p><p>“Turn that off or I’ll write you out of my will.”</p><p>“OMG Agatha you can’t joke about you dying like that.”</p><p>She winked and went right back to singing.</p><p>Eventually, Lilia collapsed on the couch, laughing into a pillow. Jen stole the last of the chips Tommy had opened and started reading legal briefs out loud in dramatic voices to him, in full soap opera mode.</p><p>Agatha, flushed and barefoot, leaned on the kitchen island, sipping her drink. Her curls were wild around her face and down her back, one strap of her jumpsuit askew, face still luminous with tequila-blushed joy.</p><p>Billy, off-camera now, simply broadcasting the kitchen and its occupants, watched from the stairs. And maybe it was the exhaustion, but he felt it in his chest.</p><p>Not just love. But safe.</p><p>“You’re annoying,” he said quietly, as Agatha caught his eye.</p><p>“You’re lucky I love you,” she muttered back.</p><p>He smiled, and the live ended.</p><p>The screen recording of his TikTok live had 2.3 million views before dawn. It was being reposted with the caption: The Hottest Non-Witch Coven You’ve Ever Seen</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio, wide awake in bed, watching the chaos unfold on her feed, typed one comment under the video before closing the app.</p><p>Is there anything this woman cant do… I’m dead 💀🥵</p><p>The following morning, the sun was too bright. The car ride was too short. The coffee hadn’t even made a dent in her headache.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was, for once, undeniably human.</p><p>Her signature sunglasses covered most of the damage, but Tommy still gave her a side glance as she sat in the driver’s seat, one hand barely curled around the wheel.</p><p>“You good?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Are you even safe to drive? You want me to do it alone today?”</p><p>“I’m fine to drive, stop being a pussy.”</p><p>Tommy smirked.</p><p>“You look like you got hit with a bus, you sire you want Rio to see you like this.” He finished the sentence by making kissy faces.</p><p>“I’m going to cut you out of the will too.”</p><p>“Whatever you say, Alice.” He patted her shoulder as she put the car in park.</p><p>Rio was wiping down a bench when she saw them.</p><p>Agatha, in black leggings, sneakers (somehow still designer), and a slate grey hoodie that drowned her usual polish. Her hair was in a messy braid, strands everywhere. She had no makeup on, sunglasses still on indoors, and clutched a very large coffee like it owed her rent.</p><p>And still, Rio’s stomach did a slow, idiotic flip.</p><p>God help me. She’s so fucking hot.</p><p>Agatha slumped against the wall in the far corner of the gym after a half hearted wave in her direction, like she was allergic to effort. Tommy dropped his bag and immediately jogged over to start warming up.</p><p>Rio made her way over. Slowly.</p><p>“Rough night?”</p><p>“Define rough.”</p><p>“Singing Practical Magic songs at full volume on your kitchen island?”</p><p>“There’s a traitor in my house.”</p><p>“It was live,” Rio said, hiding her grin. “You trended for two hours.”</p><p>“I will end your bloodline,” Agatha replied, sipping her coffee and pretending to have zero shame.</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning on the edge of the squat rack.</p><p>“You look… good. Human.”</p><p>“Don’t insult me.”</p><p>“Not an insult. I like this version of you.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, removing her sunglasses just enough to squint at her.</p><p>“What, bedraggled and caffeine-dependent?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said. “Just… real. Less polished.” She hesitated. “Someone I can’t wait to take out to dinner tonight.”</p><p>That stopped Agatha. No smirk. No snapback. Just a long, measured look. “That was dangerously sincere.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“What happened to ‘if you want to be in control, you can be’?”</p><p>“Still true. But let me have this, one date, properly, like a gentleman.”</p><p>For a beat, Agatha didn’t answer. She studied Rio like a legal brief, eyes sharp even through the hangover haze.</p><p>“Pick me up at seven, I’ll send you our address. And if you wear a tank top, I swear to God I’ll walk straight back in.”</p><p>Rio’s grin was slow and victorious.</p><p>“Dress code noted.”</p><p>From the mat, Tommy groaned loudly.</p><p>“Can you two please do this somewhere else? You’re flirting in front of the weights.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away from Rio.</p><p>“Todd, shut up.”</p>

<p>Billy was banned from going to the door under threat of phone confiscation, and Tommy had been sent to his room with the promise of a new pair of trainers fifteen minutes before Rio was due to arrive - mostly because Agatha knew he would definitely barge past her to the door and say something equally chaotic and embarrassing.</p><p>She stood in front of the large mirror in her entryway, assessing.</p><p>Her dress was deep purple, a soft silk slip with delicate straps and a high slit that flirted up her thigh when she moved. Her makeup was precise but not theatrical, smoky liner, a wine-colored lip.</p><p>Her hair was curled loosely, like she'd just stepped off an old-Hollywood film set, hairspray and gel holding everything immaculately in place.</p><p>She looked, as always, dangerous. But under it, something softer tugged.</p><p>She’d agreed to this. A real date. With a real woman. For the first time in a few years. One who’s smile had been stuck in her brain since the first time she saw her in the gym, who made her cheeks warm each time they interacted, despite her cool exterior.</p><p>And now she was nervous.</p><p>She hated that.</p><p>The doorbell rang at 7pm. Rio. She stood there, holding a gorgeous bouquet of cream roses, eucalyptus, and purple azaleas wrapped in rustic paper.</p><p>Her black leather pants were sculpted like armor, paired with a slightly oversized black blazer and a simple white crop top. Her dark hair was slicked back, brown eyes wide and warm when they landed on Agatha.</p><p>“Wow,” she breathed.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow, smirking.</p><p>“Say that again, I always enjoy an ego boost.”</p><p>“You look…” Rio swallowed, clearly struggling to articulate. “Incredible. Purple looks very good on you.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, smiling like the devil in lipstick.</p><p>“Honey,” she said, reaching for the bouquet, manicured hand slightly brushing Rios, “Everything looks good on me.”</p><p>“I’m not arguing.”</p><p>She took the flowers, turned around with a flick of her hair, knowing damn well Rio was watching her walk, and took them into the kitchen to find a vase.</p><p>“I thought about showing up in gym gear. Just to keep things balanced,” Rio said following behind her, eyes taking in the interior.</p><p>“I’d have closed the door in your face,” Agatha replied, laughing slightly.</p><p>“Would’ve been worth it just to see you open it in that dress.”</p><p>“You’re too smooth. I don’t trust it.”</p><p>“You trust me with your kid.”</p><p>“Because I paid you $350 an hour for it.”</p><p>“Still.”</p><p>“You clean up well, for a gym rat, you look good.”</p><p>Rios responding smile was wide and immediate, small tooth gap on full display.</p><p>Agathas insides squirmed at the look as they moved to leave…she was so screwed.</p><p>Rio’s car was already parked at the end of the drive, a sleek, sage green coloured, two seater corvette.</p><p>Agatha gave it a look, unimpressed but not surprised.</p><p>“Of course your car growls,” she said, eyeing the showy vehicle.</p><p>Rio stood there waiting, one hand casually in her pocket, the other held out. “It purrs, actually. Like a very expensive, emotionally unavailable cat.”</p><p>Agatha smirked but took the hand, letting Rio help her in with unnecessary, though appreciated, attention.</p><p>“And here I thought a car like this is just compensating for something.”</p><p>“You already kissed me,” Rio said, walking around the front of the car with a grin. “I can promise you I have nothing to compensate for.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she settled into the seat. “God, don’t remind me.”</p><p>But Rio’s laugh was soft when she slid into the driver’s seat, glancing at her sideways. “Too late. I’ve saved the TikTok edits. Someone added sparkles and the Bridgerton score.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped toward her. “You’re joking.”</p><p>“Nope. Two million views. I’m tagged in at least a hundred thirst compilations.” She reached over and gently took Agatha’s hand again, lacing their fingers together as she pulled away from the curb. “You’re a gay awakening meme now. Congratulations.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and tilted her head against the window, but didn’t pull her hand away.</p><p>“God, whoever it was had no right recording us like that”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, eyes sincere under the city lights. “No, they didn’t - but it happened. It was a good kiss though.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She just kept her gaze on the window, where the night rolled past in flashes.</p><p>Rio’s thumb stroked gently across the back of Agatha’s hand as she drove one-handed, delighting in being able to touch her. She didn’t speak until the quiet of the moment had settled between them.</p><p>“I’m glad you said yes to this,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha looked at her then, really looked. The streetlight flickered over Rio’s face, casting her in gold and shadow, eyes steady on the road but entirely sincere.</p><p>The sharpness of Agathas usual mask of indifference softened, just a fraction, just for a moment.</p><p>“It was a good kiss,” she said, leaning back, lips twitching. “And it would have been rude to say no.”</p><p>Their hands stayed twined between them on the center console, a quiet, grounding thing.</p><p>When the car finally rolled to a gentle stop, Rio put it in park but didn’t let go of her hand right away.</p><p>She turned, fully this time.</p><p>“Just for the record,” she said, voice low and steady, “whether or not some random secretly films us for tiktok and it combusts again, this—tonight—is real. And I’m not taking it lightly.”</p><p>Agatha watched her for a long second, brows slightly raised.</p><p>Then she smirked.</p><p>“Well, that’s very sweet,” she said, voice syrupy, “but if randoms continue to film me it won’t just be cease and desists that I send to them.”</p><p>Rio grinned and reached for the door handle, but just before she did, agathas grip tightened in her arm Briefley.</p><p>“For the record, Rio, I wouldn’t have agreed to this if I wasn’t interested.”</p><p>Rios smile was megawatt as closed the door behind her and offered her arm again. This time, Agatha didn’t hesitate.</p><p>The lighting was low, flickering from real candles, and the server seemed to recognize Agatha, who, of course, refused to acknowledge it. Rio ordered a bottle of red wine without asking Agathas preference.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow.</p><p>“Confident.”</p><p>“I’ve watched enough of Billy’s lives and posts where your drinking Merlot to know you like it.”</p><p>“Oh, we’re researching now?”</p><p>“I like to be prepared.”</p><p>“That’s adorable,” Agatha said. “And borderline unhinged.”<br/>“You bring that out in me.”</p><p>Their food came slowly. Agatha had the Risotto. Rio had steak. They shared a plate of charred broccolini, and eventually their back and forth settled into something sweeter, softer : that rare, almost sacred feeling of being seen.</p><p>Rio leaned her elbows on the table.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>“You continue to ask me things.”</p><p>“Why’d you take them in?”</p><p>“Tommy and Billy?” Agatha blinked, surprised at the direction the conversation had taken, “Why wouldn’t I?”<br/>“They weren’t yours. You didn’t have to.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the stem of her glass. Her lips pressed into a faint line.</p><p>“Their mother was my best friend,” she said, slowly, clearly lost in memory. “The kind of best friend you swear dumb, emotional promises to when you’re still learning to be an adult. One of mine was: ‘If anything ever happens to you, I’ll take care of them.’”</p><p>“People say things like that all the time,” Rio said gently. “Doesn’t mean they follow through.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t tend to promise things I don’t mean. A beat passed. “And if someone was going to teach them how to survive the world,” she added, “it might as well be someone who’s already been with them for most of it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak for a long time. Then, softly— “I like you. Even more than I thought I did.”</p><p>“That sounds dangerous,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“I’m willing to risk it.”</p><p>After their meal, which Agatha, after much disagreement,  relented in letting Rio pay for, they stood by Rio’s car. The street was quiet. Moths danced around the street lights.</p><p>Agatha toyed with her clutch, eyes searching but not in her usual aloof way. More like she was thinking too hard. Weighing something.</p><p>“You’re not like the people I usually date,” she said.</p><p>“What are they like?”</p><p>“Superficial,” Agatha answered. “It usually goes well to begin with but when they realise the twins come first or how busy I am with the firm, they get bored. Or worse - try to change it.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer.</p><p>“I don’t want to change anything.”</p><p>“You should. I’m secretly a disaster.”</p><p>“No. You’re like an onion. Layered.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, caught off guard, and in that crack of honesty, Rio leaned in, slowly, clearly, and kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed. Or messy. Or hungry. It was careful. Deep. Like a promise.</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away.</p><p>When they broke apart, her hands were in Rio’s blazer, and Rio’s breath was still catching.</p><p>“You’re good at that,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then let me do it again.”</p><p>Back to the twins… Tommy had seen it coming. The second Agatha floated down the stairs in that ridiculous purple slip dress, all legs, smirk, and don't-you-dare-comment energy, he knew it was over. Rio didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>Then he watched as she pulled up. The blazer? The leather pants? The bouquet? The blush? It was all too much.</p><p>He grabbed Billy by the collar and dragged him upstairs before Agatha even opened the door.</p><p>“Window now, we’re going full surveillance.”</p><p>“You’re obsessed.”</p><p>“I’m invested.”</p><p>So they sat, cross-legged on Billy’s floor, peeking out through the slats of the shutters like nosy church ladies, and watched.</p><p>Billy had the gall to whisper dramatically:</p><p>“It’s giving… soft launch.”</p><p>“It’s giving lesbian romcom.”</p><p>“It’s giving wedding 2027.”</p><p>“Don’t jinx it.”</p><p>But now, hours later, this was the moment.</p><p>Rio’s car was parked under at the drive. They stood close together, like something from an old movie. They weren’t talking anymore. They were just… looking at each other.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Billy whispered. “Do it. Kiss her. Come on, come on…”</p><p>“Do it, you hot gym nerd.”</p><p>And then, as if on cue, Rio leaned in.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t move. Not away. Not at all. She leaned right back. They kissed like they meant it. Like neither of them were playing. Like they both knew exactly what this was, and what it could be.</p><p>Tommy grabbed Billy’s wrist so hard it left a mark. “They’re kissing!!!”</p><p>“We manifested this.”</p><p>“Eurgh, actually bro, I don’t want to see this.”</p><p>Billy flopped onto his bed, beaming.</p><p>“I’m posting the flowers Rio gave Agatha on timtok.”</p><p>“No, wait, wait,” Tommy said, already typing. “I have some video from before dinner when she was yelling at me that she needed to get ready. We cut that together with the Rio drooling video and the flowers - boom. Narrative.”</p><p>“We’re storytellers.”</p><p>“We’re icons.”</p><p>They were halfway through editing a TikTok when Billy paused and looked at Tommy with a rare flicker of something tender.</p><p>“She looks happy though, doesn’t she?”</p><p>Tommy didn’t answer for a second.</p><p>“Yeah,” he said. “She really does.”</p><p>When they posted the video a few minutes later from Billys account, Tommy was the first to comment, causing the comments to erupt.</p><p>@thecoolermaximoff 🚨🚨 SHE KISSED HER. IT HAPPENED. KISSED. OUTSIDE. UNDER THE STARS. IN THE DRESS. 🚨🚨<br/>- My babys, ive never shipped anyone as hard as these two 🥹💋❤️<br/>- No because thats so romantic ❤️<br/>- Selfishly I do t want #AuntAgatha to be with anyone<br/>- Okay but like when do we get the behind the scenes of Rio lifting her in the gym 👀👀👀</p><p>Agatha’s office the following Monday was silent save for the muted hum of the air conditioning and the rhythmic click of her pen against a set of deposition notes. Her heels were off, tucked beneath the desk, and her reading glasses were perched at the tip of her nose. She was halfway through drafting a motion when her phone buzzed, screen lighting up with Rio 💋💀 (yes she’d changed her contact name - sue her)</p><p>Agatha stared at it for a beat. She almost didn’t answer.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>“Vidal.”</p><p>“That sounds sexy, say it again.”</p><p>“It’s also how I answer the phone when I’m busy.”</p><p>“You’re always busy.”</p><p>“And yet, here you are. Interrupting me anyway.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh was light, amused and becoming familiar in a way that made Agatha sit back slightly, twirling the pen between her fingers.</p><p>“I was wondering if I’ll see you at Tommy’s session later.”</p><p>“He’s your client, not me.”</p><p>“Sure, but he can’t drive. And he told me you banned him from public transport.”</p><p>“That child can not be trusted around the general public.”</p><p>“He said your overprotective.”</p><p>“He also said cottage cheese was a protein shake alternative. Don’t listen to him.”</p><p>There was a pause on the other end, a soft shuffle like Rio had moved to lean against something.</p><p>“Okay, but seriously. Will you be there?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, glancing at the clock, calculating.</p><p>“I’ll drop him off but I can’t come in, I’ve got a consult at five that might run over so it might be one of the assistants picking him up.”</p><p>“Right. Makes sense. I mean—”</p><p>“You could come to dinner tonight?”</p><p>The sentence slipped out so smoothly, even Agatha blinked. Rio stilled. She wasn’t expecting that.</p><p>“Dinner?”</p><p>“Yes, dinner. You know, the thing people eat at the end of the day. Usually involving food and chairs.”</p><p>“Is this a... date dinner?”</p><p>“It’s a dinner. You, me, and the feral twins.”</p><p>“That’s not an answer.”</p><p>“That’s all you’re getting.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath, and Agatha could hear her smile through the phone.</p><p>“Okay. Dinner.”</p><p>“7:30. Don’t be late. Billy gets fussy when he’s hungry, and Tommy eats like he’s never been fed.”</p><p>“What should I bring?”</p><p>“Just yourself.”</p><p>They both paused. The air between them buzzed something easy and familiar beginning to grow roots.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“You sound happy.”</p><p>“Don’t romanticize it, I have a reputation to keep.”<br/>But when she hung up, she was smiling.</p><p>Agatha came through the door still in her work blouse and slacks, hair swept into a loose updo and heels dangling from one hand at 6:45.</p><p>“I invited Rio for dinner,” she said, like she was talking about the weather and not the fact that she was voluntarily bringing someone around them after only one date (something that had never happened).</p><p>Billy looked up from his phone.</p><p>“You what.”</p><p>“Don’t make it weird.”</p><p>“Oh, we passed weird the minute you let a woman kiss you under the stars like you were in a Jane Austen reboot.”</p><p>“Jesus, were you spying you little creep. Do you want to eat or not?”</p><p>“I want to live-stream this entire meal.”</p><p>“You’ll eat dry toast in your room if you so much as reach for your phone at dinner.”</p><p>Tommy poked his head out from the loving room.</p><p>“Do we have enough food?”</p><p>“Don’t fret Tank, you’re not going to go hungry because an extra persons here.”</p><p>“Just asking, Amy, she’s a fitness freak so I doubt she eats loads anyway.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was happiness in them that she couldn’t mask.</p>

<p>The kitchen was filled with the rich aroma of garlic, cream, and pan-seared chicken. “I’m making Marry Me Chicken”, Agatha had announced as she flipped a skillet with cinematic flair.</p><p>Billy nearly passed out on the spot. “You’re literally trying to seduce her…Slay queen”</p><p>“I was already making this before I invited her.”</p><p>“It’s got basil and thyme,” Tommy whispered to Billy. “She means business.”</p><p>“It’s got a cream based pan sauce, Tommy. She’s going full domestic goddess.”</p><p>Rio arrived just before half seven with a bottle of wine, a potted plant, and a nervous smile that tried not to be nervous.</p><p>She was met with chaos.</p><p>Tommy had burned his finger trying to dip it in the pan to taste the sauce as Agatha hit him with the spatula to get him away.</p><p>Billy was once again live on TikTok, holding his phone high and pointing it to where Agatha and Tommy were now trying to shove each other under the running tap,  like he was documenting wildlife. As Agatha pushed Tommys head under but still had a gentle hand on his finger.</p><p>Rio was sat on a bar stool at the island, watching with a bemused expression. The viewer comments were spilling in fast.</p><p>- Love how shes actively trying to drown him while still making sure his fingers okay 😂<br/>- Like I know he’s her nephew but I wish I could grab Agatha like that 🥵<br/>- Imagine how good life is for these two #Jealous<br/>- Am I the only one that sees Rio in the window reflection?!?!?!<br/>- Wait - Billy - is Rio there with you 😲</p><p>As Agatha pulled away from Tommy after one final push to his head, soaking the teenager, she realised what Billy was doing and made him shut the live down.</p><p>When she was sure she wouldn’t be on the live, Rio stepped closer to offer to help with the plates.</p><p>Agatha brushed past her to reach for a serving spoon, not saying excuse me, hands just naturally moving to her waist to move her slightly out of the way.</p><p>Rio casually stepped into Agathas space, passing over plates so Agatha could dish everything up.</p><p>Agatha reached over to adjust Rio’s sleeve cuff with the tiniest tug whilst fully taking her outfit in and saying, “You wore leather pants again?”</p><p>The tension between them wasn’t hot, it was glowing.</p><p>“Can you two get a room?” Tommy muttered as he dried his hair with a tea towel.</p><p>“This is a room,” Agatha said dryly. “And I’m the one who paid off this mortgage. So deal with it.”</p><p>“You’re openly flirting,” Billy sing-songed.</p><p>“I’m simply existing. You children are dramatic.”</p><p>The chicken was ridiculous. Like, criminally good. Rich and tender and full of the kind of flavors that made Rio consider proposing on the spot.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her, wine glass in hand, her legs casually crossed under the table and her expression softening. Not with intention. Just naturally.</p><p>Tommy and Rio were halfway through a re-telling of that nights session when Billy’s phone dinged.</p><p>“No, absolutely not, don’t look at your phone at the table,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Okay,” Billy replied. “But we’re probably viral again.”</p><p>“I hate you.”</p><p>“She’s so proud of me really,” Billy told Rio, who smiled at Agathas eyeroll.</p><p>Tommy leaned across the table.</p><p>“Be honest,” he said to Rio, “you in love yet?”</p><p>“Tommy,” Agatha said sharply, the fact that she used his real name telling him she was genuinely annoyed.</p><p>“Just asking.”</p><p>“I will ground you,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Okay but do it after dessert?”</p><p>The scent of rosemary and cream still hung warm in the air as Rio rolled up the sleeves of her shirt and reached for a dish towel. Agatha was already at the sink, rinsing out the last of the pots, sleeves lightly damp, a smear of sauce clinging just below her wrist.</p><p>“You really didn’t have to help,” Agatha said, not looking up.</p><p>“I don’t mind, you cooked, it’s the least I can do,” Rio replied, bumping her shoulder gently into hers.</p><p>“If your sure,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>They worked in quiet rhythm. Rio drying plates and Agatha passing them with the kind of ease that only came when people trusted each other to move without friction.</p><p>“You always cook like that?” Rio asked after a moment.</p><p>“Most of the time, unless I know I’m going to be home late, then they get takeout.”</p><p>“So… you cook more often than not.”</p><p>“Mostly, I try to finish by 5 most days.”</p><p>There was a pause, filled only with water running and the faint thud of Billy and Tommy setting up a movie in the living room.</p><p>“You really do have the most amazing dynamic with them,” Rio said finally.</p><p>Agatha handed her a pan, eyes flicking toward the noise from the other room.</p><p>“They’re idiots. But they’re mine.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You’re not so bad with them either.”</p><p>“Is that approval?”</p><p>“It’s an observation.”</p><p>Rio grinned, but didn’t push.</p><p>When they finished, Agatha wiped her hands on a tea towel and sighed. “Come on. Let’s go pretend we like action movies.”</p><p>The lights were low. Tommy had picked some big-budget spy thriller, one of those ridiculous franchises with zero plot and fifteen explosions per scene. Billy had already curled up at one end of the large, deep set, corner couch with a bowl of popcorn balanced dangerously on his stomach.</p><p>Tommy was sprawled on the floor on his stomach with a pillow under his elbows, staring up at the screen like a much younger child.</p><p>Agatha lowered herself into the corner seat with a groan. Rio hesitated before sitting, not wanting to assume, but Agatha patted the spot beside her without looking.</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Within fifteen minutes, Agatha had slowly, subconsciously, leaned into Rios side, head slightly against her shoulder.</p><p>Rio didn’t move. Didn’t really react. Her arm slipped behind Agathas back, resting gently on her waist, not possessive, just warm. Comfortable. Like they’d done it a thousand times.</p><p>Tommy caught Billy’s eye, mouthing something, and Billy lifted his phone with zero shame, sneakily streaming live on tiktok.</p><p> </p><p>🎥 Secret couch cam. Mission: don’t be suspicious 🫢</p><p>The live caught everything: how Rio softly tucked Agathas hair behind her ear, hand idly drifting in the ends to play with them. Rio reaching blindly for popcorn and Agatha shoving some into her mouth for her. Both of them laughing under their breath at a bad one-liner in the film.</p><p>Billy dramatically zoomed in on them and mouthed “they are just the cutest.”</p><p>- Agatha snuggling? This is the softest thing I’ve ever seen<br/>- Like actually, Rios so fucking hot 🔥<br/>- If you guys ruin this I swear to god.<br/>- Tell me she kisses her goodnight. Please.<br/>- I want to be a throuple with them - I BEG<br/>- Agathas secretly a bottom im calling it</p><p>Two hours in, Agatha had nearly fallen asleep on Rios shoulder. Billy was fully asleep. Tommy was fake-snoring to annoy the adults. Agatha moved to get up, but paused.</p><p>“You okay?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I just… I didn’t expect this.”</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“Me. Here. Like this.”</p><p>“Too much?”</p><p>“No, definitely not, tonights been great.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, resting her temple against Rio’s cheek briefly.</p><p>“I don’t usually do this, you know.”</p><p>“Me neither.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“But maybe we could… do it again.”</p><p>“Dinner?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha smirked. “And snuggling through a crappy movie while my kids secretly record us for internet clout.”</p><p>Rio grinned.</p><p>“Sounds like a dream.”</p><p>Their kiss goodnight at the door was soft and warm and followed both women into their dreams.</p><p>The next morning, Agatha moved through the house like a force of nature: heels in one hand, a stack of annotated briefs in the other, hair twisted up in a sharp, perfect bun. Her navy blazer was half on, phone balanced between her shoulder and cheek, coffee going cold on the counter.</p><p>Billy leaned against the fridge, already dressed in an oversized flannel and heavy eyeliner.</p><p>“Are you going to see Rio today?” he asked sweetly.</p><p>“I'm cross-examining a witness today, I’m not seeing her.”</p><p>“So... no?”</p><p>“Billy, why are you asking me? I saw her last night.”</p><p>“Yeah but you could see her again today.”</p><p>“I now you watch a lot of gay shit but the whole lesbian u-haul thing doesn’t work that fast in real life.”</p><p>Tommy skidded in wearing mismatched socks and a grin that could only mean danger.</p><p>“Tell Rio hi for us!”</p><p>“What is with you both, again, I’m not seeing her today.”</p><p>“You texting her though?”</p><p>“What is this, a congressional hearing?”</p><p>“You’d dominate a congressional hearing,” Billy said admiringly.</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha muttered, jamming a gold pen into her bag. “Now move. Some of us have actual jobs.”</p><p>She swept out of the kitchen like a particularly stylish thunderstorm.</p><p>“Did she just blush?” Billy asked.</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>“You think she will do the whole u-haul thing?”</p><p>“Nah, but I think we’ll be seeing alot more of Rio around here.”</p><p>Agatha’s office was its usual immaculate war zone: post-it notes, color-coded binders, and the lingering smell of her second espresso. She’d just finished court for the day not half an hour ago.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>Rio 💋💀 : How’s the trial going?</p><p>Agatha: Like slow death by stupidity and procedural delays.</p><p>Rio 💋💀 : Sounds sexy</p><p>Agatha: I can think of sexier things 😉</p><p>She smirked at the screen, leaned back in her chair for just a momen and smiled when another message from Rio came through:</p><p>Rio 💋💀: You still good for dinner after Thursday’s closing arguments?</p><p>Agatha: Yes, as long as court finishes on time</p><p>Rio 💋💀 : If it doesn’t, we’ll still meet up - get takeout?</p><p>Agatha: Sounds like a plan</p><p>The next morning started badly. She was late. The house was a mess. Her heels were in the hallway, her coat slung over a chair, and the sound of two teenagers whispering badly from the living room was not helping.</p><p>Agatha padded into the kitchen with her shirts bow fastening undone and her hair falling out of its bun.</p><p>“She’s texting her again,” Tommy whispered, not actually whispering.</p><p>“Let me see—” Billy lunged for her phone on the counter.</p><p>“Touch it and I swear I will break my no corporal punishment rule,” Agatha said flatly, opening the fridge.</p><p>“No you won’t,” Billy said with a grin.</p><p>“So,” Tommy leaned against the wall, smug. “Big day in court, big texts with Rio…”</p><p>“Are you sixteen or eighty?” Agatha shot back. “You sound like a nosy great-aunt.”</p><p>“You didn’t say no,” Billy pointed out. “When are you seeing her again. You should invite her to dinner tonight.”</p><p>She turned toward them, a travel mug in her hand, eyes narrowed.</p><p>“No. And when she does come over, if either of you rats scare her off with your tiktoks or your annoying personalities, you’re moving out.”</p><p>“You like her,” Billy singsonged.”You want to marry her.”</p><p>“God give me strength,” Agatha muttered, but she was smiling around the rim of her mug as she flounced out the door.</p>

<p>Agatha’s day had been a blur of objections and relentless cross-examinations, of whispered strategy in courthouse hallways and the steady pulse of adrenaline that came with every raised eyebrow from a judge.</p><p>By the time she clicked her heels down the corridor of her firm, her throat was raw from argument, her blouse clinging slightly from the heat of the packed courtroom. Exhausted but triumphant, she was already halfway into planning the wine and comfort that awaited her with Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t seen her since dinner Monday night and she missed her more than she wanted to admit, especially since they’d only had three dates, not counting the times spent in the gym for Tommys sessions.</p><p>What she hadn’t expected, what made her pause just a beat in the doorway of her office, was the bouquet waiting on the edge of her desk.</p><p>Peonies, loose garden roses, bits of eucalyptus tucked in between, all tied with a purple ribbon that matched the dress she wore on their date. It was beautiful. Wildly romantic. And not subtle in the slightest.</p><p>Her secretary peeked around the corner, eyes bright with the kind of glee that made Agatha instinctively suspicious.</p><p>“Delivery from a Miss Rio,” she said, practically vibrating. “When I told her your hearing wrapped up, she said she’d wait. She’s in the lobby. Said she’s taking you to dinner.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “She… came in?”</p><p>“Waltzed right through the door carrying those. Parked her green Corvette out front. Every junior in this place is in love with her now. She’s very… pretty.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but a flush crept up her neck. She smoothed her blouse, checked her lipstick in the small mirror inside her drawer, and straightened her blazer like she was heading into another trial.</p><p>But when the elevator doors opened and she saw Rio, waiting casually in the lobby, leaning one hip against the wall like she hadn’t just disrupted the entire flow of the office, Agatha felt a familiar tug low in her chest.</p><p>Black jeans. Cropped green top. Hair still slightly damp from a recent shower. Rio stood out like a spark in a box of damp matches.</p><p>When she noticed Agatha, her whole face softened. Her smile was crooked, familiar, and easy.</p><p>“You really brought flowers to my office?” Agatha asked as she approached, voice low and amused.</p><p>“I wanted to give you something to celebrate when you said you’d won.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “You’re not being subtle. But for the record, I always win.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped briefly, appreciatively, to Agatha’s neckline. “Can you blame me? You look lethal in court clothes.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath that was halfway between a laugh and a sigh. “You’re trouble.”</p><p>Rio offered her arm with a grin. “You love it.”</p><p>Agatha took it without hesitation. And, with half the firm still watching, she leaned in and pressed a quick, deliberate kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“God,” Rio murmured, hand briefly tracing Agatha’s waist as they walked out together. “You’re really going to be the death of me.”</p><p>At the bistro, quiet, intimate, strung with soft lights like stars caught in branches, they shared a bottle of deep red wine and passed plates across the table like it was second nature. Rio fed her a piece of crostini, brushing fingers with hers, and Agatha didn’t even flinch.</p><p>The comfort between them was there.</p><p>“So, how was court?” Rio asked over her glass, eyes glittering.</p><p>“You know I won my motion. Opposing counsel tried to ambush me with a procedural technicality, so I buried him in case law from ‘98.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, impressed. “That’s hot.”</p><p>“You say that a lot.”</p><p>“That’s because it keeps being true.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, taking another sip of wine. “You really are the worst kind of distraction.”</p><p>“Only the worst because I’m also the best,” Rio said, reaching out to brush her thumb over Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>There was a quiet stretch of music and candlelight between them. Then, with the kind of calm that suggested forethought, Agatha said, “By the way… we won’t be needing your training for Tommy in August.”</p><p>Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha twirled her fork, her voice casual. “We’re going on holiday. Three weeks. We do it every year, one week picked each by the boys, then a week I get to choose. My choice is England.”</p><p>Rio stilled. Not tense. Not upset. But… reflective.</p><p>“That’s amazing,” she said. “Really. I didn’t know you had that kind of trip planned.”</p><p>“I forgot about it, honestly,” Agatha admitted. “With everything lately, I didn’t connect the dates until my assistant flagged it on my calendar.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, something unreadable flickering in her eyes. “Three weeks is a long time.”</p><p>Agatha reached across the table and covered her hand. “If I’d known you a little longer, I’d have invited you.”</p><p>Rio looked up, startled.</p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha said. “It might be chaos with those two, but… I would’ve made space.”</p><p>Rio flipped her hand palm up, letting Agatha’s fingers rest in hers. “Next time,” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Next time.”</p><p>Back at Agatha’s house, the front porch was lit by a single warm light. The door clicked open softly, and they stepped into the cool quiet of the entryway, the faint smell of vanilla and whatever overpriced candle Billy had lit that day drifting through the air.</p><p>Rio stood just inside, her expression shifting, something new beneath the usual charm. Not hesitation. But something close.</p><p>“I… can I ask you something?” Rio said, voice a little quieter now.</p><p>Agatha turned, brows drawing together. “Of course.”</p><p>Rio looked down briefly, then back up. “We’ve been doing this for a few weeks. Dates. Flowers, you sitting in and distracting me at Tommys sessions. I just want to know where we are. If that’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened. She stepped forward, gently brushing her knuckles along the line of Rio’s jaw. “You’re asking if this is exclusive?”</p><p>Rio nodded once. “Yeah. I guess I just want to know if… it’s just me. If you want it to be.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “It is just you,” she said. “I haven’t even thought about anyone else. You’re the only one I want.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, just a fraction. She exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.</p><p>Agatha continued, quieter now. “And for what it’s worth… I’ve never brought anyone into this part of my life before. Not like this. Not this quick. Inviting you here. Introducing you to the chaos that is Tommy and Billy at home and not just at training.”</p><p>“They like me,” Rio said with a grin.</p><p>“They talk about you all the time,” Agatha responded, “which is alarming. You’re their new favorite person.”</p><p>A small silence bloomed between them. Comfortable.</p><p>Rio stepped closer. “So… just me.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her chin up. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good, because you have completely taken over my brain, I couldn’t even look at anyone else,” Rio whispered, and leaned in to kiss her, slow, sure, a press of warmth and a promise in the dim hallway light.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the door once it shut behind Rio, her eyes open. And for just a moment, she let herself smile, soft, helpless, and utterly real.</p><p>Upstairs, Tommy peeked out from the hallway where he’d been hiding.</p><p>“She’s so in love,” he whispered.</p><p>Billy nodded sagely. “We’re going to be getting a step aunt - it’s basically confirmed.”</p><p>Agatha woke the next morning feeling annoyingly well-rested, despite only getting her usual five hours on a weekday.</p><p>Her mind had already begun untangling a client’s disastrous contract clause before her second sip of coffee. She was halfway through a client call, jotting notes on a legal pad in tight, aggressive cursive, while her laptop glowed with opposing counsel’s pitiful attempt at a settlement proposal.</p><p>Her tone was clipped, efficient. Her mind, however, was still somewhere between last night’s kiss and the feel of Rio’s hand on her waist as they’d stood in the doorway like something out of a film.</p><p>The good mood lasted all of thirty-five minutes.</p><p>Yelena appeared in the doorway with the air of someone up to something. Her phone was angled slightly downward, recording.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered to the camera. “Doing the trend where I tell my boss everything I’m doing until she snaps. Pray for me.”</p><p>She gave one brisk knock and entered without waiting.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” Yelena chirped. “Just letting you know I’m going to refill my water bottle.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even glance up from her notepad. “Do I look like a hydration coach?”</p><p>“No, but I respect your commitment to bodily function awareness.”</p><p>“Take your electrolytes and your nonsense elsewhere.”</p><p>Yelena saluted, grinning. “Back in twenty-five steps.”</p><p>“Take thirty and don’t come back.”</p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p>Twenty minutes passed. Agatha made progress on her notes, wrote a blistering email in record time, and momentarily remembered why she hadn’t fired Yelena yet when she saw she’d made progress with their recent client’s deposition.</p><p>Then: “Hey, Agatha,” Yelena said, standing in the doorway again. “Just letting you know, I’m sending a fax.”</p><p>Agatha looked up slowly. “To the year 2003?”</p><p>“Fax on the copier machine still works. Mostly.”</p><p>“If you jam it again, I will replace you.”</p><p>“Understood. The boss is threatening.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off without another word.</p><p>Six minutes later-</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yelena blinked. “You didn’t let me finish.”</p><p>“I don’t need to. Go away.”</p><p>“I’m just heading to the supply closet.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her temples. “For what Enlightenment?”</p><p>“Staples. Maybe vibes.”</p><p>“Vibe with some productivity instead.”</p><p>Yelena disappeared again, whispering to her camera: “She’s so done with me.”</p><p>By the time lunch rolled around, Agatha’s mood had deteriorated from pleasant to cold-pressured steel.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha?” Yelena asked, popping her head in like a jack-in-the-box. “Going to lunch.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, very slowly. “Is this a request for permission or a desperate cry for validation?”</p><p>“...A little of both?”</p><p>Agatha tapped her pen on her pad. “Take an hour. Take two. Take a sabbatical.”</p><p>“Wow. You’re so supportive.”</p><p>“Go. Away.”</p><p>Yelena covered her laugh with a cough and ducked out again, immediately posting the compiled videos to Tiktok.<br/>Caption: Telling my boss every little thing I do - Part 1. Wish me luck.</p><p>Within fifteen minutes of posting, the video hit 100k views. The comments were instant:</p><p>- Yelena your playing with FIRE 🔥<br/>- The look Agatha gives??? I'd simply pass away<br/>- I need her to tell me to go away too<br/>- SHE’S SO SEXY AND SCARY I’D NEVER RECOVER<br/>- This is how workplace crushes start</p><p>When Agatha walked past Yelena’s desk after lunch, coffee in hand, her eyes narrowed. She clocked the angle of Yelena’s phone.</p><p>“Are you filming me?”</p><p>“...Define filming?”</p><p>“I bill by the hour,” Agatha said coolly. “If you’re trying to turn me into content, I charge influencer tax.”</p><p>“Does that include copyright claims if I post your ‘I will replace you’ line?”</p><p>“No. But defamation lawsuits are a flat fee.”</p><p>Yelena gave her a dazzling grin. “It’s a good line though.”</p><p>Agatha muttered something under her breath that sounded distinctly like “this is why I have ulcers.”</p><p>The nonsense continued into the afternoon, at 1:47 p.m. Yelena poked her head in again.</p><p>“Just heading to the kitchen. Gonna microwave some soup.”</p><p>Agatha: “If it explodes again I’m not cleaning it.”</p><p>Not even half an hour later she was back, camera angled to capture the look of pure frustration when Agatha was disturbed yet again.</p><p>“Just printing three pages. Double-sided. Thought you should know.”</p><p>“Tell it to someone who cares.”</p><p>Each time she saw Yelena through the glass making her way over, she became more and more frustrated.</p><p>Bathroom break. Just keeping you in the loop.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up. “What would you like, applause or a urologist?”</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>“I’m back from bathroom. Going to get some more ice water.”</p><p>Agatha slammed her pen down.</p><p>Yelena paused. “Too much?”</p><p>“Yelena,” Agatha said slowly, turning in her chair like a villain in a bind film. “It is my professional opinion that if you interrupt me one more time today, I will sue you.”</p><p>Yelena blinked. “So… I shouldn’t tell you I’m thinking about taking a lap around the break room?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, standing, “you should just do it. And keep walking. Off a cliff.”</p><p>Yelena giggled. “But I’m your favourite junior”</p><p>“I don’t have favourite. I tolerate you all. Barely.”</p><p>Yelena raised her phone. “Part 2 coming soon!”</p><p>“Part 2 will be your severance package.”</p><p>By three, Agatha was sat at her desk, teeth clenched so tightly she was fairly certain her jaw was going to lock. Her pen hovered uselessly over a contract she’d now reread three times without absorbing a single word. The buzz of lights above her had become intolerable. Her coffee was cold. Her patience now nonexistent.</p><p>The copier machine outside her door had started making a noise again, a sad sputtering sound like it was reconsidering its life choices.</p><p>She briefly considered pulling the plug on it. And then Yelena. In that order.</p><p>Her fingers drummed irritably against the desk.</p><p>She glanced at her phone. Three new texts from a client demanding changes they’d already approved, one Slack message from a junior associate asking how to redact a PDF (again), and a notification from her secret TikTok account (of course she had one, she just didn’t tell anyone).</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and shoved her chair back. The walls of her office suddenly felt too close. She was one interruption away from putting herself on stress leave.</p><p>Her phone rang just as she was about to stand.</p><p>Rio 💋💀</p><p>Agatha answered immediately, the irritation in her expression softening before she even spoke.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, voice warm, low.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio replied, light laughter in her tone. “You sound tense.”</p><p>“You mean uncharacteristically close to losing my license for assaulting an employee? Yes, I’ve had a fantastic afternoon.”</p><p>“That bad?”</p><p>“Yelena’s decided to narrate her entire existence to me in real-time for tiktok. I’ve heard about three water breaks, two faxes, and at least one bathroom report.”</p><p>Rio laughed again. “God, I loved her last video with you. Is she still alive?”</p><p>“Barely. I’ve drafted her severance package twice.”</p><p>Rio paused, then asked more gently, “You want a quick distraction?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, eyes closing briefly. “Desperately.”</p><p>“So, I’ve built Tommys plan for the next months cycle, I got your payment through this morning for the next month worth of sessions. You didn’t have to pay me you know.”</p><p>“Of course I did, just because your my… just because we’re dating doesn’t mean your work times free.”</p><p>Rio smiled at the pause, knowing what Agatha almost said. “Well, anyway, since he’s going to be away after the end of this period, I’ve built it up to endurance and full sets.”</p><p>“I don’t know how you get him to take it so seriously, every other trainer he’s had he’s quit after a few sessions.”</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped slightly, playful. “That’s because I bribe him with smoothies and boost his ego by telling him his form is hot.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a smile. “So you bribe my child with flattery.”</p><p>“I bribe my future step child with flattery. Big difference.”</p><p>Agatha froze, only for half a second, but she was smiling now, the exhaustion loosening around her like a cracked shell.</p><p>Just then, her door cracked open without knocking.</p><p>Yelena. Holding her phone. Still filming. Catching the softest expression she’s ever seen on her bosses face.</p><p>“Agatha?” she asked with exaggerated innocence. “Just letting you know, I’m about to go downstairs to see if the barista is still there because I might die if I don’t get a cold brew soon and also I was wondering if—”</p><p>Rio’s voice drifted from the phone, “Is that Yelena? Tell her I said hi—”</p><p>And that’s when Yelena got it. The Moment. The camera caught the shift in Agatha’s expression - the warmth disappearing like a candle being snuffed. Her eyes narrowed. Her jaw locked. She stood in a single, silent movement and crossed the room with slow, terrifying precision.</p><p>“Yelena,” she said, voice velvet-smooth, “get. Out.”</p><p>Yelena blinked. “But I—”</p><p>“I am on the phone,” Agatha said, her tone low but sharp enough to slice marble. “I am in my office. I am working. And if you interrupt me one more time with a camera in your hand, I will file a restraining order on behalf of my peace of mind.”</p><p>Yelena’s mouth opened to apologise.</p><p>“I’m not done,” Agatha added.</p><p>Yelena snapped her mouth shut.</p><p>“You are a capable, marginally intelligent associate who should know better. So please, in the name of all that is holy and professionally appropriate: go home. Not the supply closet. Not the break room. Home. I don’t want to hear about your next breath.”</p><p>A long, tense pause. Then— “...So that’s a no on the cold brew?”</p><p>“Yelena.”</p><p>“Leaving now.”</p><p>Yelena backed out slowly, still holding her phone.</p><p>As soon as the door clicked shut, Agatha exhaled and pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>Rio’s voice, soft and amused: “You okay?”</p><p>“I might murder her.”</p><p>“I’m gonna be honest… the tone you used just now? Extremely sexy. Feel free to use it on me anytime.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath of laughter, head tipping back against her chair. “Glad it’s doing something for someone.”</p><p>“Finish up work. Go home. Have some dinner and a long bubble bath.”</p><p>Agatha smiled again, tired but honest. “That sounds like the best idea.”</p><p>An hour later, Yelena posted the part 2, including the part she went from smiling like the sun was shining dorectly on her to terrifyingly intimidating in a beat.</p><p>Billy sat at the kitchen island, eyeliner immaculate, laughing so hard he had to pause his own TikTok draft.</p><p>“She’s a menace,” he said through giggles, showing the screen to Tommy. “Watch.”</p><p>“Ohhhh she did her murder face and voice at Yelena. I bet she cried after.”</p><p>“I would quit if I worked for her and she told me off like that.” Billy said.</p><p>“You have been told off by her like that.”</p><p>“True. And she still hasn’t gotten rid of me.”</p><p>“Yet.”</p><p>The comments were feral and numerous, the video view count rising and being shared across everyones FYP.</p><p>- No because was that Rio on the phone making her smile like that? 🔥💋❤️🔥🥰<br/>- I would commit white-collar crime just to have her yell at me like that 🫠💼<br/>- She said ‘go home’ and my knees buckled THROUGH THE SCREEN<br/>- Yelena risking her life for this content deserves a Pulitzer. Or hazard pay<br/>- Not Agatha smiling like a Disney princess right before she verbally murders someone… the RANGE???<br/>- So who was she talking to tho 👀 cause the smile? the hand-in-hair moment? That was NOT a work call, babes 😂<br/>- I’m not saying I’d marry her on sight but I am already planning our power suit-themed wedding<br/>- I paused at 1:03 just to watch her smile again. That smile is RARE and ILLEGAL and I would like it tattooed on my soul</p><p>And, alone in her apartment, Rio opened her phone and immediately saw the videos.</p><p>She watched Agatha breeze through the office, all sharp cheekbones and weaponized sarcasm. Her eyes softened with every line. Every sigh. Every eyeroll.</p><p>She didn’t even realize she’d hit replay until her salad went warm on the counter.</p><p>“God help me,” Rio muttered, smiling. “She’s going to kill me and I’ll thank her for it.”</p><p>She rang Agatha when she’d given her enough time to have dinner and relax for a while.</p><p>“She caught you smiling on camera earlier.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me that.”</p><p>“She posted it already. You look like someone dropped a sunrise on your desk. Was that smile for me.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I’m banning phones from this floor.”</p><p>Rio’s voice warmed. “It was cute. I like that I can make you smile like that.”</p><p>It was thoughts of that smile that followed her into dreamland, her heart full and slowly (yeah, not slowly, at all) falling.</p>

<p>The gym was buzzing with low music and the rhythmic thuds of weights hitting the padded flooring. Tommy had insisted they arrived early to warm up. Agatha, as usual, gave him what he wanted, which was how she found herself at the gym on a Saturday morning at 7:30am.</p><p>She stepped through the double glass doors immaculate as ever, nodding politely to Nat, dressed in black sneakers and a matching gym set. Her sunglasses stayed on for a moment too long as she scanned the gym, eyes searching out the woman that was taking up more and more of her thoughts.</p><p>When she finally spotted Rio by the squat rack, hair twisted into a messy bun, sports bra and green joggers clinging in all the right places—Agatha’s gaze paused.</p><p>Then softened.</p><p>“Morning,” Rio said, grinning wide. “You decided to grace us with your presence early today.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “Only because I was promised teenage suffering.”</p><p>“Guess that makes me the suffering,” Tommy muttered, moving to stretch in front of the mirrors.</p><p>Unbeknownst to either woman, Tommy had already opened TikTok on his phone and hit Go Live. He propped the phone up on his gym bag, angled perfectly to capture him in his work out, but also the two women within frame.</p><p>Agatha folded her arms and leant against the treadmill, watching Rio stretch out her shoulders whilst letting out an obnoxiously large moan, a grin playing at her mouth.</p><p>“Is this a gym or porn studio,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio winked. “We could make it both. Want to make a  demo?”</p><p>Tommy’s face twisted in visible pain. He pointed toward the camera like he was a documentary subject begging for help and whispered.</p><p>“This is too much. Their saying shit like this. In public! In the gym. If anyone has a spare couch I can move into, drop it in the chat.”</p><p>In the chat, chaos had already begun:<br/>- Agatha looking like she walked off the cover of Vogue Fitness: Boss Edition 🔥<br/>- Now I’m envisioning them in a porno, thanks Rio 🥵<br/>- That comment in front of her kid - Rios feral 😂</p><p>Tommy’s groan as he read a few comments echoed off the gym walls as he shouted across, “You’re both terrible. This is a place of sweat and suffering, not flirting and foreplay.”</p><p>Rio glanced back at him. “That can be tonights class.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked but seeing it was approaching 8am, the time of Tommys actual hour session, she moved away to do some stairs while Rio actually did her job.</p><p>Tommy was halfway through his third set of dumbbell cleans, grunting under the weight and glaring at Rio.</p><p>“Engage your core,” she reminded calmly. “And drive through the hips. It’s not a rage throw, it’s controlled.”</p><p>“I am controlling myself,” he hissed. “From crying.”</p><p>From across the gym, Agatha raised an eyebrow over the top of her water bottle. She was perched neatly on the stair machine, climbing at a steady pace with casual elegance.</p><p>Her high pony was frizzing slightly at the temples, her sleeves rolled up just enough to reveal toned forearms, and her top clung in a way that made it obvious she hadn’t meant to look that good, which made it worse.</p><p>Rio was trying to focus. She was. But Agatha wasn’t helping by existing like that in her direct eye-line.</p><p>Tommy paused, gasping, and wiped sweat from his forehead. “This is cruel.”</p><p>“You’re fine,” Rio said, casually spotting his form.<br/>“You want to talk cruel? I can shoulder press an adult over my head.”</p><p>Tommy stared at her. “No, you can’t.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “You think I can’t?”</p><p>“You’re not that strong.”</p><p>A smile tugged at Rio’s lips. Dangerous. Effortless. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Yes?”</p><p>“Can you come here a sec?”</p><p>She glanced over, skeptical. “Why?”</p><p>“Just need a hand with something.”</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha stepped off the stair machine. She crossed the gym floor like she owned the place, wiping a stray drop of sweat from her brow. “What has he done?”</p><p>“He hasn’t done anything,” Rio said, entirely too casually. “Just stand still a sec.”</p><p>“What are you, Rio?”</p><p>She barely had time to register the mischievous glint in Rio’s eyes before hands landed on her waist, firm, warm and in one shockingly fluid movement, diagonal and she was airborne.</p><p>Agatha let out a startled “oh my god—!” as Rio straightened fully, pressing her overhead like a barbell.</p><p>Tommy choked. “OH MY GOD YOUR LIFTING HER!"</p><p>Rio’s arms were rock solid, her posture perfect, like this was just another Saturday. “See? Told you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were wide, blinking fast. “Are you..Rio put me down, I’m not -what if I kick you.”</p><p>The chat exploded.<br/>- MOTHER IS BEING BENCH PRESSED HELP<br/>- Agatha’s legs did the little FLUTTER thing<br/>- Rio just straight-up deadlifted a whole lawyer and smiled about it<br/>- This is the lesbian Olympics. I’m watching history</p><p>Agatha, suspended midair, made a sound that could only be described as scandalized awe. Her hands clutched instinctively at Rio’s shoulders, eyes wide.</p><p>Rio was grinning like the cat that had not only eaten the canary but had cooked it dinner first.<br/>“You’re very aerodynamic,” she teased, holding her in place like it was effortless.</p><p>“Put me down,” Agatha said, voice high and thin.</p><p>“Say please.”</p><p>Agatha flushed violently, “Put me down. Please.. Before you drop me.”</p><p>“ I won’t,” Rio said, serene. “You’re very balanced.”</p><p>“I look stupid.”</p><p>“You’re stunning.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“This is deeply inappropriate.”</p><p>“Tell me to stop,” Rio said, her voice low, soft, steady and just a bit smug.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth. Then closed it. Then flushed so hard she looked sunburnt.</p><p>Rio finally, gently, lowered her back to the ground. Agatha stumbled slightly, but Rio’s hands stayed on her waist, anchoring her in place. Their faces close. Breathing uneven.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked softly.</p><p>Agatha was not okay. She had just been overhead pressed by a beautiful woman in public and was now having an internal crisis about how extremely into it she was.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she whispered. “I’m great. I’m perfect.”</p><p>“You sure?” Rio said, brushing a thumb just slightly along the hem of her shirt, briefly touching the smooth skin of her lower abdomen.</p><p>Agatha nodded quickly. “Totally.”</p><p>Tommy, dead inside, stared into the camera like a deer in headlights.</p><p>- This woman just fell in love like we weren’t all watching 😂😂😂<br/>- She smiled like a Jane Austen character about to faint.<br/>- I don’t know who I’m more in love with, Rio or Agatha. Actually, yes I do. BOTH 🔥🔥🔥<br/>- Someone check Agatha’s pulse. I think she just saw God.🥵<br/>- Tommy deserves compensation.</p><p>“I hate this you all. I hate that it was on livestream. I hate that my aunt got manhandled and liked it.”</p><p>Agatha, still visibly flustered, calmly adjusted her sunglasses on her head.</p><p>“I was not manhandled,” she said. “It was a strength demonstration.”</p><p>“You literally sighed when she lowered you back down.”</p><p>Agatha turned away as Rios grin brightened even further, a new blush across her cheeks.</p><p>Tommy groaned again and covered his face.<br/>“She lifted you like a kettlebell and now I have to live with the knowledge that you blushed Amanda. I saw it. The whole internet saw it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She just walked away back to the stair machine.</p><p>Because yeah, she was blushing.</p><p>Because she knew, with sudden and terrifying certainty. She was absolutely, completely, no-turning-back falling for that woman.</p><p>Tommy had escaped to the showers the moment the cooldown stretch ended, muttering something about needing to “scrub the last hour off his retinas.”</p><p>Rio stood by the wall, toweling sweat from the back of her neck, sweat clinging to her abs, flushed and glowing from the hour-long session.</p><p>Her bottle clinked as she capped it, glancing sideways.</p><p>Agatha was leaning against the opposite wall, ankles crossed, arms folded, composed, as ever, but the edge of her mouth betrayed her. She was smirking. Thoughtful. Watching Rio with eyes that didn’t hide anything.</p><p>Rio slung her towel around her neck and grinned. “You are ridiculously attractive.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Tyler is traumatised.”</p><p>“He’ll survive.”</p><p>There was a beat. A soft pause in the early-morning noise. Outside, the sun was fully up, a rare gentle warmth flooding through the high windows. Agatha looked like she was considering something.</p><p>“You’re booked solid today?” she asked, almost casually.</p><p>Rio nodded, pulling her phone from her bag to double-check. “Yep. Back-to-backs. I’ve got two strength sessions, a corrective movement consult, and a mobility group at four. Probably won’t finish until close to eight.”</p><p>“Brutal,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio glanced up. “Why?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, then away, brushing imaginary lint from her top.</p><p>“There’s a farmers market tomorrow. I thought maybe—if you’re free—you’d want to come.”</p><p>Rio blinked, emotion rushing her at the expression in Agathas face.</p><p>“To spend the day with you?” she clarified, though her tone was soft. Hopeful.</p><p>Agatha nodded, pretending she wasn’t watching Rio’s every reaction like it was a cross-examination.</p><p>Rio smiled slowly. “I’d love to.”</p><p>“It’s early,” Agatha added quickly. “Not brunch and flowers early, just coffee-and-produce early. Bring your canvas bags. I have some but they’re usually filled with random paperwork by the end.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer. “So it’s a date?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth quirked. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, one brow raised, teasing. “Then I’ll see you tomorrow. 9 a.m.?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “Make it 9:30. I don’t want you seeing me before caffeine.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “I’ve seen you at the gym with no make-up on and a hangover. I think I can handle pre-coffee.”</p><p>Agatha flushed, just faintly, and looked away. “Don’t be smug.”</p><p>“No promises,” Rio said, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “I’ll text you.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>She started to head toward the front entrance, then paused, half-turning. “Oh and Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“That blush?” Rio pointed, then winked. “I’d like to see it again.”</p><p>Agatha made a strangled noise, tried to hide it behind a cough, and waved her away.</p><p>Rio laughed all the way down the hall.</p><p>Tommy climbed into the back of Agatha’s car, still towel-damp and grumpy.</p><p>“I’m never going to a gym session with her again.”</p><p>“You were the one who wanted Rio as your trainer, at $350 an hour, might I add.”</p><p>“She’s a great trainer. But she deadlifted you. You made a noise like you’d been dipped in fucking honey.”</p><p>“Language.”</p><p>“I’m traumatized. I get a free pass.”</p><p>Agatha started the car, her phone buzzing softly with a new message.</p><p>Rio 💋💀: Looking forward to tomorrow. I’ll carry your bags 😘</p><p>Agatha smiled down at it, the softest, smallest smile.</p><p>“Todd,” she said calmly.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“I’m in a very good mood. Let’s not ruin that, shall we?”</p><p>Tommy groaned again and flopped dramatically against the seat.</p><p>The following morning was unreasonably beautiful. Blue skies, golden sun, a whisper of cool breeze threading through rows of pop-up stalls bursting with wildflowers, lavender honey, overpriced cheese, and local celebrities disguised in ball caps and sunglasses.</p><p>Agatha, of course, wore neither.</p><p>She strode into the market, loose white linen trousers that moved like smoke, a soft purple silk blouse tucked at the waist, dark shades she didn’t actually need, and a woven straw tote slung over her shoulder like it was a designer bag (it wasn’t but it was French).</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her iced oat milk latte when she saw her.</p><p>“You… look like you walked out of a Vogue spread called ‘I Bill at $900/hr and I Don’t have to try.’”</p><p>Agatha barely glanced at her, smirking. “Flattery won’t get you out of carrying the tomatoes.”</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, wore an oversized band tee tucked into black biker shorts, a denim jacket tied at the waist, and hair twisted into a low bun.</p><p>Somehow, next to Agatha’s couture-adjacent elegance, she still managed to look annoyingly hot.</p><p>“Where are the demon twins?” Rio asked, scanning the stalls.</p><p>“Ten feet behind you,” Billy said, sliding into frame with a devilish smile, already live on TikTok.</p><p>“Do not put that phone in my face before I’ve had coffee,” Agatha warned without looking.</p><p>“But you look so approachable.”</p><p>“And yet I haven’t approached jail time for smacking you.”</p><p>“She’s radiant today,” Billy said to the stream.</p><p>“Here with Rio, who also looks unfairly hot.”</p><p>“Wait” Rio blinked. “You’re live right now?”</p><p>“Oh sweetheart,” Agatha said, sliding her sunglasses down to glare at Billy. “He’s always live. Billy switch it off.”</p><p>He did but he still filmed content, creating a video that he posted later that morning.</p><p>Caption: We followed the lesbians to the farmers market and here’s what happened.</p><p>The video captured Agatha inspecting a bunch of rosemary like she was judging its moral character, holding it out for Rio to smell and then carefully selecting bunches of herbs across the stall.</p><p>Rio carrying a basket of tomatoes, watching Agatha from behind, eyes trailing the exposed part of her back like she wanted to write poetry about her spine.</p><p>Agatha catching Billy filming and saying, “If you don’t piss off with that camera, I’m making you walk home.”</p><p>Tommy in the background, aggressively haggling with a pastry vendor. “Two croissants for five dollars. Come on. I’m only a child.”</p><p>- AGATHA IN LINEN???? god help me 🥵❤️🔥<br/>- Rio watching her like she’s the sun. I’m sobbing.<br/>- No bc why is this literally the best rom-com I’ve ever watched in 15-second bursts<br/>- Tommy’s bargaining is so real<br/>- Someone give Agatha her own show called Sarcasm &amp; Sage</p><p>Into the afternoon Billy decided to go live again.</p><p>They stopped at a stall selling fresh fig tarts where Agatha bought a few.</p><p>She picked one up delicately, examining it like art. Rio looked up just in time to see Billy’s camera pointed directly at Agatha’s mouth as she bit into it.</p><p>Agatha chewed, blinked slowly, and then said, “If you post this, I swear to god—”</p><p>POP.</p><p>A fig seed squirted directly onto Billy’s shirt.</p><p>The camera shook. Tommy wheezed. Rio covered her face.</p><p>“The fig fought back,” Billy cried. “I’ve been attacked.”</p><p>“You’ve been warned,” Agatha said, licking her thumb with a precision that sent TikTok straight to hell, the comments and viewers climbing higher and higher.</p><p>- SHE LICKED HER FINGER. GOODBYE<br/>- That’s a Bond villain. In linen. Eating pastry. Help.<br/>- Not the tart assaulting him on camera 😢😂<br/>- This is gay cinema. I’m not joking</p>

<p>Billy found the envelope on the porch a few hours after they got back from the farmers market, thick, official, and marked in bold red: URGENT LEGAL CORRESPONDENCE.<br/>He held it like it might start ticking.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Her voice came from inside, half-distracted as she sent a text to Rio, having kissed goodbye at their cars like lovestruck teenagers.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You got... petitioned?”</p><p>“Unless it’s a petition to rename our street after me, I don’t want it.”</p><p>Billy hesitated. “It’s from the opposing counsel. Shield case.”</p><p>There was a pause. Then the sound of barefeet on hardwood.</p><p>Agatha appeared in the doorway like a thunderstorm, one brow arched, lips already pursed in suspicion. She’d changed into cycle shorts, an oversized fleetwood mac concert T-Shirt and an expensive claw clip like it was a crown.</p><p>“Now that I want.”</p><p>Billy handed her the envelope like it might explode. She took it with a single, perfectly manicured nail and tore it open with casual menace.</p><p>“Let’s see what Salem Seven’s latest tantrum looks like in Times New Roman,” she muttered, flipping through the pages.</p><p>As she read, her expression turned from amused to incredulous to deeply, profoundly annoyed.</p><p>“Oh, you have got to be kidding me.”</p><p>“What?” Billy asked, eyes wide. “What did they do?”</p><p>Agatha snapped the top page flat and read aloud in a mocking voice:</p><p>“Due to Ms. Harkness’s ongoing and highly publicized internet presence, which may risk the professional perception of the proceedings and distract from the legal merit of the case…”</p><p>She stopped. A slow blink. A deep inhale.</p><p>Then: “Oh no, no, no. Let me get this straight. They’re trying to get me kicked off my case because my nephews post videos of me drinking Starbucks and singing in the car? That’s their strategy?”</p><p>Billy blinked. “Wait… can they actually do that?”</p><p>“They can try,” she said flatly, then crumpled the petition into a tight ball and tossed it into the sink behind her without looking.</p><p>A perfect shot.</p><p>“This isn’t law. This is petty PR warfare disguised as due process. They’re not playing chess, they’re flinging their pacifiers out.”</p><p>She started pacing as she continued to pull documents out.</p><p>“Let me guess,” she said, rifling through the rest of the packet. “They cited the couch video.”</p><p>Tommy wandered into the kitchen. “To be fair, that video did hit over a million likes. It’s iconic.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a look. “I was laid on the couch working.”</p><p>“Still iconic,” he mumbled.</p><p>Agatha spun back to Billy. “They don’t want me removed because of ethical concerns. They want me gone because I’m six steps ahead and two receipts away from burning their whole argument to the ground. So now, they’re trying to make it personal.”</p><p>She straightened, eyes sharp, smile slow. Wicked. The kind that spelled trouble.</p><p>“Unfortunately for them, I thrive when it’s personal.”</p><p>Three days later, the courtroom was cold. Polished wood and silent tension. On one side: Salem Seven, perched in their conservative suits like vultures waiting for roadkill.<br/>On the other: Agatha, steel and smirk in a dove-gray pantsuit that cost more than their entire filing budget.</p><p>No makeup. No frills. No Jen there for back up.</p><p>Just her hair pulled back with surgical precision, sharp glasses, and a three-inch stack of evidence tabs in four colors: red for contradictions, green for witness flubs, purple for judicial precedent, and yellow for what she called ‘fuck-you highlights.’</p><p>The judge cleared his throat. “We’re here regarding the motion filed by Salem Seven, requesting the disqualification of Ms. Agatha Harkness as lead counsel due to alleged... online notoriety.”</p><p>Salem Seven’s lead stood. A raspy-voiced woman  with a face like a bug.</p><p>“Your Honor,” she began, “the integrity of this trial depends on professionalism. Ms. Harkness’s viral media presence, TikToks, video re-posts, blog mentions, creates the impression of bias and invites undue attention. It undermines the seriousness of the proceedings.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even glance at her. Instead, she slowly stood, calmly adjusting her cuffs.</p><p>“Your Honor,” she said, voice smooth as honey and twice as sticky. “I’m not here to teach the opposing counsel how the internet works, but if having someone who are themselves known on TikTok or someone in their family is, is grounds for disbarment, the entire city of Los Angeles is disqualified.”</p><p>Salems spokesperson opened her mouth. Agatha raised a finger.</p><p>“I wasn’t finished. Thank you.”</p><p>She pulled a page from her stack and held it up.</p><p>“This is Exhibit A. A list of sixty-seven currently practicing attorneys in this state and those surrounding, with active large public followings. TikTok’s, blogs, speaking tours, podcasts, one lawyer who vlogs legal advice from his spin class. Not one, not one, has been removed from a case. Not for attention, not for personality, and certainly not for being filmed laid on a couch in shorts.”</p><p>A pause. She glanced at the seven lawyers like they were expired milk.</p><p>“This isn’t about ethics. It’s about ego. They’re not afraid of bias. They’re afraid of losing - to me.”</p><p>Then she smiled. It wasn’t friendly. It was shark like. “And frankly? I don’t blame them.”</p><p>The courtroom was silent.</p><p>Even the judge seemed impressed.</p><p>“Motion denied,” he said, with a small sigh. “And Ms. Harkness?”</p><p>“Yes, Your Honor?”</p><p>“Consider running for office. You’d terrify Congress.”</p><p>That night, back home, Billy and Tommy were devouring Thai food on the patio. Agatha sat with a glass of wine, three post-its stuck to her shirt, laptop open, glasses perched on her nose.</p><p>Somewhere, her phone buzzed with another notification.</p><p>“You’re really not mad?” Billy asked.</p><p>“I’m always mad,” she replied, sipping her wine. “But not at you.”</p><p>“We didn’t mean to cause you any trouble. It was just fun.”</p><p>“Darling,” she said, scribbling something onto her notes before ruffling her hand through his curls, “if I lose a case because someone saw my bare legs on TikTok, I shouldn’t be practicing law. But when I win despite it? That’s power.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “You’re like Elle Woods, if she had a deathnote book and kept a crow as a pet.”</p><p>Agatha toasted him with her wine.</p><p>Billy posted that night. A video montage that started with Agatha sipping cold brew in an oversized sweatshirt, sunglasses on, lip curled in disapproval. Then Agatha in her office, reading a deposition with her feet on the desk,ankles crossed and red bottoms on show. Another picture of Agatha walking out of court, victorious, not smiling—smirking.</p><p>Caption: Imagine trying to disqualify a woman because she looks snatched in everything and is an actual Queen.</p><p>The final photo was courtroom-official: Agatha, standing at the bench in a tailored suit, spine straight, one brow lifted like she already knew the answer to every question.</p><p>Text overlay: You come at the queen… you better file correctly.</p><p>It went viral before midnight.</p><p>- You come at the queen, you better file correctly is my new email signature<br/>- Not me applying to law school just to be like her 😭<br/>- I didn’t know being legally intimidating was a sexual orientation until today</p><p>Rio had just wrapped up her final session for the day. Her ponytail was still swinging, and her phone was lighting up on the counter like it owed someone money.</p><p>One glance told her everything. She ignored the hundreds of tiktok notifications, tags and mentions but saw a message from Alice that just said “OMG LOOK.”</p><p>She wiped her hands on a towel, pulled out her phone, and hit play on Billy’s video that Alice had shared with her.</p><p>His montage was set to Beyoncé’s Run the World.</p><p>There was Agatha, in grainy-but-glorious Gen Z angles: Sipping coffee with that patented glare. At her desk with a legal pad and murder in her eyes. Walking out of court like the runway was hers and justice was the afterparty. And then the closing punch: You come at the queen... you better file correctly.</p><p>Rio snorted. “Of course he edited it like a trailer.”</p><p>She watched it again.</p><p>Then again. Then liked and saved it to her growing secret collection of Agatha videos that she watched to fall asleep.</p><p>Then screenshotted the court photo and made it her lock screen, unable to resist, she added her own comment to the video:</p><p>@RioVidalTrainer: y’all know that’s MY woman right? 🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥</p><p>Back at the house, Agatha was pouring herself a second glass of wine and mumbling about formatting inconsistencies in a footnote when her phone buzzed.</p><p>Rio 💋💀: Your tiktoks favourite lesbian thirst trap, should I be worried about any competition?</p><p>Agatha smiled down at the screen, then typed back:</p><p>Agatha: If you want to talk about thrist traps - Billy showed me the one where you poured your water bottle over yourself</p><p>Another ping.</p><p>Rio 💋💀: You don’t even have to try though. Your so sexy. Feel free to cross-examine me anytime 🔥🥵</p><p>Agatha: Come over tomorrow for dinner? You could maybe bring an overnight bag - if you want to</p><p>The minute her text was received her phone screen lit up Rio 💋💀. She didn’t even manage to fully say hello before Rio breathlessly said “You mean it?”.</p><p>Agatha smiled, letting her eyes flutter closed for a moment. “I don’t invite just anyone to stay the night, Rio. But yes, I mean it.”</p><p>There was a beat of hesitation on the other end. Then Rio’s voice softened, careful now. “Are Billy and Tommy going to be home?”</p><p>“They will be, will that be a problem?”</p><p>Rio laughed, but it was still a little tentative. “I just don’t want to overstep. First time staying over, I can be on my best behavior. I mean, I can sleep in the guest room. If that makes things easier. For them. For you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile warmed, her fingers curling loosely around the wine glass. “I appreciate that,” she said. “Really. But you’re not a stranger, Rio. The boys know you. I wouldn’t invite you to stay over if I thought it would be weird.”</p><p>“So… no guest room?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Not unless you snore. In which case, I’ll personally escort you to it in the middle of the night.”</p><p>“I do not snore,” Rio said, mock-offended. “But fine. No guest room. Still—I don’t want them thinking I’m just here to jump their Aunt.”</p><p>“Even if you are?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“Especially if I am,” Rio murmured. Then, quieter: “I really like you, Agatha. I want to do this right.”</p><p>The words settled gently in Agatha’s chest. She found herself smiling again, this time softer, a little more real.</p><p>“Come at seven,” she said. “We’ll have dinner.”</p><p>“And dessert?” Rio asked, playful again now, but not pushing too far.</p><p>Agatha sipped her wine slowly. “If you’re lucky.”</p><p>Rio let out a low hum. “I’ll bring something sweet. Just in case.”</p><p>“Pack light,” Agatha added. “But bring a toothbrush. I want you to feel comfortable here.”</p><p>Rio was quiet for a second. Then: “Okay. I will.”</p><p>When the call ended, Agatha lingered in the kitchen a moment longer. Upstairs, she could hear the low thrum of bass from Tommy’s room and the telltale laughter of Billy either on live or on the phone to the not so secret boyfriend.</p><p>She wasn’t nervous. Not exactly. But something about tomorrow felt new. Bigger than just dinners and a few stolen kisses.</p><p>And somehow, that made her want it even more.</p>

<p>The evening had mot started peacefully.</p><p>Agatha was stressed. Not her usual low-key, simmering irritation, this was full-blown, stomach-tight, trying-to-keep-her-shit-together, kind of stressed.</p><p>It was not just dinner. Not just drinks and a cuddle on the couch with the chaos twins and a movie.</p><p>An actual overnight stay, toothbrush, pajamas, and everything. And Agatha was making pasta from scratch like a lunatic, because she had apparently decided to cope with her emotions by cooking like Gino D’Acampo.</p><p>The twins had promised to not go live or post anything to tiktok tonight, however, they’d made no such promises about teasing her about the situation.</p><p>“Are you making it from scratch to impress her or to avoid spiraling?” Tommy asked, lounging against the counter, one eyebrow cocked like he’d been born to torment.</p><p>Billy didn’t look up from his phone. “She’s definitely spiraling.”</p><p>“I am cooking,” Agatha snapped, slapping a sheet of pasta down on the floured worktop with more force than necessary. “You like food, don’t you? You like not starving?”</p><p>“She’s not even here yet and you’re sweating,” Tommy said. “That’s so cute.”</p><p>“I am not sweating Tony. It’s called being warm. Because its summer. And I’m cooking.”</p><p>“She’s staying tonight though?” Billy singsonged, finally glancing up. “Like, she’s sleeping here. In your bed.”</p><p>Agatha threw a dishtowel at him. “Out. Both of you. Go set the table outside, go torment the neighbors, I don’t care, just get out of my kitchen.”</p><p>They both cackled on the way out, leaving her with her sauce on low heat and her thoughts flustered.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, Agatha actually startled, nearly dropping a ladle into the pan. She took a breath. Smoothed her hair. Checked her outfit.</p><p>Then Rio walked in, overnight bag slung over one shoulder, a bottle of wine in one hand and a hopeful smile on her face. Her hair was wild in loose curls, and the sleeves of her jacket were pushed up, showing her toned arms and making Agathas mouth water at the sight.</p><p>Billy popped back into the kitchen behind her with all the subtlety of a marching band. “She’s here!” he called out, like a wedding herald.</p><p>Tommy followed, immediately eyeing the bag. “That better include pyjamas - no one wants to see your birthday suit walking around tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “Boys. Get a grip.”</p><p>But Rio just laughed, setting the wine on the counter.</p><p>Billy grinned at her. “If she makes you pasta from scratch, it means she wants to impress you.”</p><p>“GET OUT,” Agatha barked. “Now.”</p><p>The twins scattered, but not before Tommy mimed dramatic kissing faces at them.</p><p>Agatha exhaled hard and turned to Rio. “Sorry. Their little dickheads sometimes.”</p><p>“They’re fine. Funny, even.” Rio stepped closer, arm brushing down Agathas back in a gesture that felt so natural already that it made her pause.</p><p>“I’m making lemon-garlic pasta with garlic bread and I haven’t had a moment of peace from them since I walked in from work.”</p><p>Rio smiled, leaning in to kiss her sweetly, softly. “You look incredible.”</p><p>“You’re biased and blinded by the thought of carbs.”</p><p>“Also true.”</p><p>Dinner happened, somehow. Billy DJ’d from his phone with an unhinged playlist that shifted from Fleetwood Mac to Fall Out Boy without warning.</p><p>They ate outside on the back patio, string lights swaying overhead in the warm evening air. The sky turned lavender and soft, and Agatha finally, finally started to fully unwind.</p><p>Afterward, Rio insisted on washing the dishes, sleeves up and hair even messier, while Agatha dried and dodged flirty soap flicks. Tommy dropped a spoon into the sink and splashed both of them, then disappeared, smug and unpunished.</p><p>By the time the boys had vanished to their rooms, snickering behind closed doors, probably live-streaming on tiktok  about their aunts romantic guest, Agatha and Rio were left in the garden with half a bottle of red and the stars blinking above them.</p><p>The garden set they’d moved to was impossibly soft. Rio had tucked her legs beneath her, cradling her wine glass. Agatha threw a blanket over them both.</p><p>“You always this domestic on Thursdays?” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha leaned her head back against the cushions, fingers massaging her temple like she had a hangover from just trying.“Usually I’m in a robe watching true crime and yelling at people on the TV.”</p><p>“Hot.”</p><p>“Don’t fetishize my burnout.”</p><p>“I’d never,” Rio said solemnly. “But also, I definitely would.”</p><p>“You're incorrigible.”</p><p>“You’re terrifying in the best way.”</p><p>“You’re still here.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Because you’re pretty and I like you.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her, pressing light kisses against her lips. “Hmmm, I like you too.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio murmured. “Because you’re stuck with me now.”</p><p>A silence stretched between them. Not awkward , never awkward, but weighty. Something there.</p><p>Agatha sat cross-legged on her bed, her reading glasses sliding down her nose, a thick legal text open in her lap.</p><p>Rio knocked once before stepping inside. Barefoot. Wearing one of Agatha’s borrowed shirts in leu of the pyjamas she’d packed.</p><p>“You look like a hot librarian,” Rio said.</p><p>“I would be a hot librarian. But meaner.”</p><p>Rio walked in slowly, eyes flicking over the room, expensive sheets, stacked books, the large plant throving in the corner.</p><p>“Do you actually enjoy sleeping in these or is this just for a show of capitalism?”</p><p>Agatha smirked but didn’t answer. She closed her book and watched Rio approach, not touching, not assuming. Curious. Gentle.</p><p>“Thanks for tonight,” Rio said, quieter now.</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Agatha’s voice matched hers in softness. “I like when you’re around.”</p><p>“That sounds dangerously like a feeling.”</p><p>“It’s a preference. Don’t get ahead of yourself.”</p><p>“I like you too.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“And now I’m in your house.”</p><p>“You’re in my bedroom.”</p><p>That silence again. But this one wasn’t loaded, it was open. Patient. Rio stood at the edge of the bed, uncharacteristically nervous.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, lifted the edge of the blanket. “Get in.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait, like—”</p><p>“Don’t overthink it Rio, just get in.”</p><p>They lay side by side in the dark.</p><p>Rio didn’t ask again if she was really supposed to be here. She knew. She’d packed a toothbrush. She’d worn Agatha’s shirt to bed. She’d followed her down the hall and over the threshold of her door.</p><p>This wasn’t an accident.</p><p>“You always like to be in control?” Rio asked, voice low, eyes on the ceiling but fingers just barely brushing Agatha’s under the blanket.</p><p>Agatha hesitated. Her voice, when it came, wasn’t defensive. Just honest. “I always have to feel safe.”</p><p>Rio turned then, not sudden, just fluid. Her hand slid gently over the sheets, palm open near Agatha’s ribs, not yet touching. “Do I make you feel safe?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She turned her head, eyes meeting Rio’s in the dark and nodded once.</p><p>“You make me feel seen.”</p><p>Rio inhaled, slow. “That’s not the same.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “It’s scarier, but more.”</p><p>They stared at each other a long moment. Rio moved first.</p><p>Just a quiet shift forward, her hand rising to rest against the curve of Agatha’s waist, under the blanket. Waiting.</p><p>When Agatha didn’t move away, when she leaned in just slightly, Rio leaned too.</p><p>The kiss was slow. Careful. Like neither of them wanted to break the spell of it. Agatha tasted like wine and toothpaste; Rio kissed her like someone who knew how rare this was, how the woman now underneath her rarely let anyone into her orbit like this.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid into Rio’s hair, anchoring them both, a small sound escaping her throat that sounded like surrender.</p><p>The blanket shifted. Sheets rustled. Their bodies met in that hesitant, hungry way people do when want has built for days, weeks, maybe longer. It wasn’t rushed. It wasn’t showy. It was hands beneath fabric and the hush of skin against skin, knees brushing, breath hitching, lips parting only to find each other again.</p><p>Agatha whispered something into Rio’s neck, maybe a warning, maybe a plea, maybe just her name, and Rio answered with her mouth, her hands, her body saying I’m here. I see you. I want this too.</p><p>The world outside narrowed to the room, the bed, the soft creak of the headboard as Agatha finally, finally let go.</p><p>Later, they lay tangled together, breath slowing, sweat cooling. Rios arm draped over Agathas back, thumb brushing absently at bare skin with Agathas head resting on her bare chest.</p><p>Neither of them spoke for a long time.</p><p>And then, in a voice so quiet it was almost not meant to be heard, Rio said, “I’m falling for you.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head up and pressed a kiss to her jaw. “You wouldn’t be here if I didn’t feel the same.”</p><p>In the morning, when the birds were singing outside the window and the soft light crept in through the curtains, Agatha cracked one eye open.</p><p>She was warm. One leg over Rio’s, an arm slung across her waist, Rio’s curls tickling her neck as she breathed slow and even.</p><p>“You drool,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Only on people I like,” Rio murmured, voice still rough with sleep against her shoulder.</p><p>“Disgusting.”</p><p>“You cuddled me all night, so you didn’t mind really.”</p><p>“Lies and slander.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, but didn’t move. Neither did Agatha. For a minute, they just stayed like that — tangled in sheets, the weight of the night still soft on their skin.</p><p>Then, the distant sound of movement downstairs.</p><p>A cupboard opening. A spoon clinking. The faint hum of a TV.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “One of them’s up.”</p><p>“Place your bets.”</p><p>“Billy,” they said in unison.</p><p>Downstairs, Billy was already perched on the kitchen island in his usual early-morning glory: mismatched pajamas, socks with tiny skulls, and lip balm so glossy it reflected.</p><p>He adjusted his phone against a mason jar of uncooked pasta, tapped the screen, and blinked into the camera.</p><p>Tiktok Live.</p><p>“Good morning, goth court,” he intoned, dramatically. “From the house of chaos. I am alone. Agatha has yet to emerge. Neither has her overnight guest. Something smells like… domesticity. And lesbian love.”</p><p>From upstairs Tommys voice called down, “Billy, I swear to God, if you narrate like that before I’ve had coffee—”</p><p>“Tommy’s alive,” Billy reported helpfully to the live chat. “Cranky. Probably in a carb coma still from last night.”</p><p>The TikTok live was already blowing up.</p><p>- AGATHA HAS AN OVERNIGHT GUEST??<br/>- Someone check if Agatha’s wearing socks. That’ll confirm if it happened.<br/>- MOTHER AND FATHER HAVE DONE THE DEED 🥵🔥🥵</p><p>Billy sipped his iced coffee. “Anyway. She made Italian food from scratch last night. Homemade pasta. Garlic bread. And then, my dear viewers, she disappeared into the night with a certain muscular gym trainer who could realistically bench press her.”</p><p>Just then, footsteps.</p><p>And then Agatha appeared in frame.</p><p>In a short black silk robe over matching sleep shorts. Legs toned, bare. Hair tousled like a shampoo commercial gone feral. No makeup, but still devastating. She walked barefoot across the kitchen like the kitchen owed her rent.</p><p>- WAITTTT SHE’S IN A SHORT ROBE???<br/>- WE ARE BEING FED<br/>- Mother is SERVING. Unbothered. Hydrated. Possibly freshly 🍆 💦🐱🍆💦🐱🍆💦🐱<br/>- WHERE 👏 IS 👏 RIO 👏<br/>- Does anyone else smell U-Haul energy</p><p>Agatha ignored the phone entirely. She pressed the button on the coffeemaker with the grace of someone who had no patience right now for teenage boys and TikTok fame.</p><p>Tommy wandered in next, hair everywhere, eyes half-lidded, he glanced once at Billy’s phone.</p><p>“Are we livestreaming her morning routine now?”</p><p>Billy didn’t look away from the camera. “The people need this.”</p><p>“This is how cults start,” Tommy muttered, pouring his cereal.</p><p>Agatha sat at the table, tucking one foot under herself, sipping from a mug that read World’s Okayest Human. Her expression was blank. But the twitch in her left brow promised later violence.</p><p>And then Rio padded in.</p><p>Wearing Agatha’s purple silk robe.</p><p>Hair a complete mess.</p><p>Agatha’s shirt underneath, crumpled like it had hit the floor at some point.</p><p>Billy dropped his phone. Then scrambled to catch it. Then screamed. Loud. “OH. MY. GOD.”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha muttered, still not looking up. “Please.”</p><p>Tommy didn’t even glance over. “She’s wearing your robe, April.”</p><p>- I’m deceased 💀💀💀<br/>- THEY HAD SEX. NO ONE JUST CASUALLY SHARES ROBES<br/>- Billy’s scream was the sound of the gay agenda winning<br/>- Tommy eating cereal like nothing’s happening is a vibe<br/>- THE SHIRT IS RUMPLED. THE SHIRT. IS. RUMPLED<br/>- Billy’s about to start sobbing and livestream it with sad piano music</p><p>Billy was pacing now. “Is this… Is this the lesbian slow-burn-to-accidental-soft-domestic-arc I’ve been WAITING FOR?!</p><p>“Get a job,” Agatha said without missing a beat.</p><p>“TikTok is my job.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, still half-asleep, reaching for a mug. She glanced at the phone. “Morning, Tiktok.”</p><p>- MORNING TIKTOK?? RIO PLEASE I’M FRAGILE<br/>- OH SHE KNOWS. SHE KNOWS SHE’S HOT<br/>- Power couple. Power. Couple.<br/>- I want a woman who makes me pasta and lets me wear her robe 😭</p><p>Billy zoomed in. “Look at her. Post-sin. Post-pasta. Post-Agatha.”</p><p>“I will end you,” Agatha said mildly.</p><p>“You’re glowing. You have afterglow, Agatha. You are literally radiant.”</p><p>Rio walked over and pulled on Agathas hand, pulling her up, fingers interlaced, leading her back upstairs and out of frame.</p><p>She bumped her shoulder lightly as they sat on the bed.</p><p>“So,” she said, smile still soft, voice just for her, “you gonna murder Billy?”</p><p>“Legally?” Agatha murmured. “I shouldn’t say.”</p><p>Rio leaned her head on Agatha’s shoulder. The light caught the edge of her jawline. She looked like she belonged there.</p><p>Agatha’s exhale was slow. “It’s been a long time,” she said quietly. “Since anyone stayed.”</p><p>Rio turned to her, eyes softer now. “I’m glad you invited me.” A beat. “I want you. So bad.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, really looked. And then: “You already have me.”</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened. “Against your better judgment?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, quiet and true. “Especially against my better judgment.”</p><p>They kissed then, soft and slow. Familiar already.</p><p>The kind of kiss that meant something had shifted, something real had rooted itself.</p><p>Downstairs Billy stood holding his phone, ending the Tiktok live with a dramatic “I’m doing this for culture.”</p><p>Beside him, Tommy was wiping sleep from his eyes. “We’re going viral again, aren’t we?”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely.”</p>

<p>The studio lighting hit just right: warm morning sun slanting through the windows, haloing Rio in natural golden light as she adjusted her tripod, tightened her ponytail, and tapped record.</p><p>“Alright,” she smiled into the camera, “five-minute core blast. Grab a mat, grab a towel. If you’re not crying by the end, you’ve not put enough effort in.”</p><p>The video was sharp. Clean. She moved with ease, strong, sure, grounded. When she posted,  usual comments from her fitness followers flooded in fast:</p><p>- Core goddess<br/>- Why do you make it look so easy 💪<br/>- Your fitness videos are my religion now<br/>- DO A LIVE</p><p>She didn’t have any clients due for the next hour.</p><p>So she decided to do it - it had been a while since she’d done a live and she did like to do them every once in a while to keep followers engagement.</p><p>@RioVidalTrainer (LIVE).<br/>Caption: Ask Me Anything — post-core workout cool-down! Be nice. Or don’t.</p><p>Rio perched on a gym bench in a navy tank top, towel around her neck, cheeks still flushed from the workout. A few flyaway hairs stuck to her sweaty forehead. Her water bottle glinted as she sipped.</p><p>“Okay, questions. Fitness, nutrition, routines, anything you want to know — go.”</p><p>The chat exploded. At first, it stayed on topic:</p><p>- How often should I do strength vs. cardio?<br/>- What’s your go-to breakfast?<br/>- How long have you been training people?<br/>- Are your sessions expensive? 💸 💸 💸</p><p>She answered calmly, easily, until one question popped up and flooded the feed like wildfire:</p><p>- What’s going on with you and Aunt Agatha?? 👀👀👀👀<br/>- DOES SHE REALLY COOK?<br/>- Are you guys like… official?<br/>- How did you meet MILF Supreme??<br/>- Is she actually mean or is that just for Tiktok?</p><p>Rio blinked at the screen, mouth twitching in amusement.</p><p>“Wow,” she said, stretching her legs out in front of her. “Y’all really just skipped straight to the fanfic and ship part of the chat.”</p><p>More comments:<br/>- SO YOU ARE DATING???<br/>- Who’s the bottom and who’s the top?!?!<br/>- MOTHER AND FATHER I BEG 🥰❤️🔥<br/>- Is she really that mean and sarcastic or is that just for tiktok?</p><p>Rio laughed, a real, delighted laugh that showcased her tooth gap, and tossed her towel at the camera before answering.</p><p>“First of all, I don’t think she knows how much tiktok is in love with her. Second, yes, she cooks. It’s terrifying how good she is at it. Third, she is exactly as mean as she seems, and that’s why I like her.”</p><p>The comments exploded.</p><p>- OMG IT’S REAL 🥵🔥<br/>- Confirmed. It’s canon<br/>- Tiktoks lesbian mummies locked in 🔐<br/>- Are the boys chill with it or feral?<br/>- Can I be you, or her, or both - I’m in love with both of you 🥰🥰🥰🥰</p><p>“I tried to show her an edit someone made where they turned her walking in heels into an entrance theme, she just blinked and said, ‘That’s not even my best suit.’”</p><p>- SHE WOULD SAY THAT<br/>- SHE’S INSANE I LOVE HER<br/>- Her power is terrifying I want her to scream at me in court<br/>- Tell is a out the twins!!!!!<br/>- Did you really stay over yesterday and 🍆💦</p><p>“The boys?” Rio added, grinning. “Their great. They live for the chaos. Billy literally livestreamed our breakfast yesterday. Tommy just calls her ‘Amanda’ or ‘Amy’ or whatever name he’s decided on that day.”</p><p>She hesitated, then added softly, “And yeah. I stayed over yesterday.”</p><p>The chat exploded. Caps-locked chaos. Shrieking emojis. Memes mid-formation.</p><p>- I’M SCREAMING<br/>- THE SHIP IS REAL<br/>- I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT<br/>- I need to know for…reasons…did you 🍆💦</p><p>Rio didn’t answer that part. Not directly. But her eyes darted downward for a second, and her smile turned quieter, warmer. A little blush rose at her collarbones.</p><p>Then someone asked:</p><p>- Was it love at first sight?</p><p>Her expression shifted. Not bashful but serious. Private. Like someone holding a truth close to their chest and deciding, just this once, to show it.</p><p>Rio paused. Smiled softly. Chewed the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“No,” she said. “It was worse. It was intrique. Sarcasm. Too many backhanded compliments. And then suddenly I couldn’t stop thinking about her.”</p><p>Her eyes flicked down, then back to the screen.</p><p>“So yeah. Maybe not love at first sight. But definitely something inevitable, like gravity.”</p><p>The chat slowed. Sweetened. Turned earnest.</p><p>- You guys are actually so cute 😭😭😭<br/>- I’m gonna cry into my protein shake now.<br/>- Please never break up I’m too invested.<br/>- Protect Rio at all costs 😭<br/>- Can you do a couple’s workout video?? Please???<br/>- You love her ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</p><p>Rio gave a small, self-deprecating shrug.</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe it’s not love yet. But… I’m falling. And it feels like the kind of fall where the ground doesn't matter.”</p><p>Silence. Then:</p><p>- YOU’RE DONE FORRRRRR<br/>- AGATHA BETTER BE GOOD TO YOU OR WE RIOT<br/>- Get Agatha on this live right now</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>“If you can get her out of a deposition, sure. Otherwise, she’s currently busy intimidating and yelling at people in $800 heels.”</p><p>Then Rio leaned back, laughing as the chat went absolutely feral.</p><p>“I’m ending this before you all start planning a wedding without us.”</p><p>She waved, cheeks flushed again, not from exertion this time, but something far warmer.</p><p>“Thanks for the chaos. I’m gonna tell her later that you all think she’s terrifying and perfect. She’ll love that.”</p><p>And then the live ended, leaving only hearts drifting up the screen like embers.</p><p>Agatha was actually mid-email, espresso in hand, legal notes spread across her glass desk like a war plan. Her phone buzzed once. Then twice.</p><p>She looked at the screen.</p><p>A text from Billy: YOU’RE TRENDING AGAIN LOL</p><p>A second later, a link followed.</p><p>Agatha clicked it. The live replay of Rio. Talking about her. Looking annoyingly soft-eyed and sexy with her skin slightly glistening.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and muttered, “Jesus Christ, I’m dating a golden retriever.”</p><p>But then she pressed play again. Just one more time. Just to hear the part about gravity and the kind of fall where the ground doesn’t matter.</p><p>What a fucking poet. And with that, she smiled.</p><p>The house was unusually quiet for a Saturday.<br/>Billy had vanished into his room to film a GRWM  tutorial, complete with mood lighting and a 2000s R&amp;B playlist.</p><p>Tommy was at a track meet up and wouldn’t be back for hours.</p><p>And Agatha was barefoot.</p><p>That alone was enough to make Rio feel something shift in her chest.</p><p>Because Agatha was rarely barefoot.</p><p>But this morning, she padded through the kitchen in an oversized slate-gray cashmere cardigan, one sleeve half-pushed up, the other still slouched low around her wrist. Her yoga pants clung just right, lazy and loose in places but hugging the curve of her hips like second skin.</p><p>Her curls were looser too, half-tamed from sleep, like she hadn’t looked in a mirror yet. Or didn’t care to.</p><p>Her face was clean. No signature eyeliner, no contour, no perfectly engineered mask of intimidation. Just… her. Still breathtaking. Maybe more so.</p><p>And she hadn’t noticed she was being watched.</p><p>But Rio watched.</p><p>Watched like it was the only thing worth doing.</p><p>Like her body still remembered every place it had touched last night (after Agatha had called frustrated with herself not being able to sleep and asked her to come over) and this morning, and all the hours in between when sleep had been interrupted by hands and sighs and soft moans against skin.</p><p>She was still damp from her shower, hair curling at the ends, wrapped in one of Agatha’s black gallery t-shirts that draped off one shoulder like it had always meant to. Her legs were bare. And her voice, when it came, was still morning-rough, intimate by accident.</p><p>“You always make it like that?” she asked, nodding to the coffee. “So careful.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn around. Just smirked over her shoulder.<br/>“What, like a neurotic control freak?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said simply. “Like someone who gives a damn.”</p><p>That made Agatha pause.</p><p>Her smirk lingered, slower now. She slid the mug across the island, letting their fingers brush, a soft graze of knuckles, not quite casual. It felt electric.</p><p>Neither of them moved away.</p><p>“Toast or eggs?” Agatha asked, voice low, velveted with sleep and something warmer.</p><p>Rio smiled, eyes fixed on her mouth. “Surprise me.”</p><p>Agatha turned to the stove. The silence between them wasn’t empty, it was humming.</p><p>Comfortable, yes, but also heavy with all the things they hadn’t said yet. Every sound seemed sharper. The crack of eggs, the sizzle in the pan. The soft hum Rio realized, with a stupid rush of affection, was Fleetwood Mac. Silver Springs, of course.</p><p>Rio shifted on the counter, legs swinging slightly, just watching her. Watching the care in Agatha’s movements — the way she plated food like it was a painting, toast stacked like sculpture, herbs added with a flick of wrist and pride.</p><p>Rio could still feel the ghost of Agatha’s hand around her waist from hours ago. The low, wrecked sound she’d made when Rio had kissed her throat. The way her body had curled inward like she’d never meant to need someone and suddenly did.</p><p>And that’s when Rio decided to ruin the moment in the best possible way.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha?”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Would you be my girlfriend?”She paused. Then added, softer, “Officially.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled on the garnish. She didn’t turn around.</p><p>For a second, Rio worried she’d pushed it too far, cracked something too soon. But then Agatha’s hand lowered slowly, and she set the plate down with precision.</p><p>Then she turned.</p><p>And she looked at Rio like she was studying her.</p><p>Like she was trying to commit her to memory. Like she already had.</p><p>“You’re asking me,” Agatha said, “like you think I’ll say no.”</p><p>Rio’s smile flickered. Honest. A little breathless. “I’m asking you because it matters. To me.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, bare feet quiet on the tile, her expression unreadable — and somehow devastating.</p><p>She stopped between Rio’s knees, standing close enough to feel her warmth, to see the faint trace of a bite Rio had left on her collarbone last night.</p><p>“What does it mean, at our age?” Agatha asked, voice low.</p><p>“It means,” Rio said, “if anyone flirts with you at a charity gala, I get to roll my eyes and say, ‘Back off, she’s mine.’”</p><p>“So…” Agatha arched a brow. “Possession.”</p><p>“No,” Rio replied, eyes dancing, “Commitment. And a little bragging.”</p><p>They were so close now that every breath exchanged between them felt deliberate.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze searched her face, lingered at her lips, dropped to where the collar of her own shirt hung loose on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>She exhaled. “Alright.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Yeah?”</p><p>“But if you ever put me in a TikTok without warning, I will burn out your corvette.”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio whispered.</p><p>And then she leaned in , not rushed, not messy. Just close. Like they had all the time in the world, and this was what mornings were going to be from now on. She kissed Agatha gently. Once. Then again. Slower, deeper, like a promise written in heat. Like she was tasting the yes in her mouth.<br/>Agatha smiled against her lips, one hand bracing Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“God help me,” she murmured, “I can never get enough of you.”</p><p>“That,” Rio said, catching her breath, “is the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me.”</p><p>Agatha snorted in response, well aware of the words she’d whispered against flush skin the previous night that were much more romantic.</p><p>But she didn’t pull away. Her hand slid up to Rio’s waist, dragging her a little closer, and Rio laughed softly into her mouth, dizzy with affection and the weight of knowing that this was real.</p><p>Billy had been about to get a drink when he overheard their moment and realised it was best not to interrupt, instead he returned to his live,  “Tommy isn’t back yet so I’m doing a solo GRWM, but Agatha is in the kitchen making eggs with her girlfriend so …”</p><p>- WAIT. IT’S OFFICIAL???<br/>- THEY’RE GIRLFRIENDS???<br/>- CONFIRMED CONFIRMED OMGGGG<br/>- AGATHA HARKNESS HAS A GIRLFRIEND I’M SOBBING<br/>- THIS IS MY ROMCOM NOW. GOODBYE NETFLIX</p><p>Off-camera, the faint clink of plates. A low laugh, Rio’s, followed by a warmer, smokier one.</p><p>And then Agatha’s unmistakable voice, faint but sharp as always: “Billy, get down here and get some food.”</p><p>Billy turned back to the camera with a shit-eating grin. “They’re total goals,” he said fondly. “I love them so much.”</p>

<p>The house was unusually relaxed and quiet for a weekday morning.</p><p>Billy was curled on the couch in a hoodie purposely purchased three sizes too big, laptop perched on his knees, sipping oat milk coffee and doom-scrolling.</p><p>Tommy was upside-down in the armchair, head hanging off the edge, lazily tossing a tennis ball at the ceiling much to Agathas annoyance.</p><p>Agatha herself was at the kitchen table with her reading glasses on, editing a brief, her curls tied up messily, her feet encased within fluffy socks, having decided to work from home for the day.</p><p>A mug of espresso steamed beside her, untouched. She looked like she was trying to ignore both of them.</p><p>She failed.</p><p>“You’re sighing,” Billy said, without looking up.</p><p>“I breathe. That’s allowed.”</p><p>“No, that was a sigh.”</p><p>Tommy threw the tennis ball and missed. It bounced off the light fixture. “She only sighs like that when she’s about to do something weird. Or expensive.”</p><p>Agatha set down her pen.</p><p>“Fine.” She took off her glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “I’ve booked the time off.”</p><p>Both boys blinked.</p><p>Billy sat up straight. “Like, our holiday, time off?”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Yes. Three weeks.”</p><p>Tommy fell off the chair. “Three, wait, what?”</p><p>“I’ve cleared it with Jen. We’re going on holiday in two weeks.”</p><p>Billy’s jaw dropped. “In two weeks we’re going away for nearly a month? Seriously?”</p><p>“Yes, seriously. You’ll each choose a country like usual. One week per destination. I’ll sort out the order when I know where you want to go.”</p><p>Tommy was already standing, pacing, hands in his hair like this required urgent strategizing.</p><p>“Wait wait wait—any country?”</p><p>“Within reason,” Agatha said, sipping her espresso. “Nothing involving active warzones or destinations where you’re likely to get killed.”</p><p>Billy gasped. “Oh my god.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha muttered. “What a mistake I’ve made.”</p><p>“This is the best day of my life.”</p><p>Tommy pointed at her. “Do not take it back.”</p><p>Agatha looked amused, in that half-suffering, fully-fond way she had whenever they got excited.</p><p>“Can we pick anywhere?” Billy said, already pulling up Google Maps.</p><p>“I also reserve veto power over anything involving extreme weather, political coups, or volcanoes currently erupting.”</p><p>“Fair.”</p><p>Billy closed his eyes dramatically. “Japan. I’m choosing Japan. I want to see the cherry blossoms and eat sushi that will spiritually ruin supermarket sushi for me forever. Also: shopping. Also: beauty products. Also: Tokyo streetwear.”</p><p>“I’m not letting you bankrupt me at a Harajuku boutique.”</p><p>“I’ll budget,” Billy promised. “Ish.”</p><p>“Good. Because if you bring home more than one suitcase, you’re shipping yourself back in a box.”</p><p>Tommy was already googling. “Zimbabwe.”</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>Tommy grinned. “Victoria Falls. Elephants. I read this article once about night safaris and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since.”</p><p>Billy looked at him, impressed. “That’s such a cool choice.”</p><p>“You’re not riding a lion,” Agatha said.</p><p>Tommy gave her a look. “I’m not an idiot.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Most of the time,” he muttered.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha said with a sigh, tapping a note into her iPad. “Week two: Tokyo and Kyoto. Week three: Zimbabwe. And week one…”</p><p>She looked at both boys, smile widening at their clear excitement.</p><p>“I’ll start us off with England.”</p><p>Billy groaned. “Ugh. Boo. Lame.”</p><p>Tommy shot him a look. “You love England.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly. “It’s been a few years. And I want proper tea. And rain. And bookstores that smell like ghosts.”</p><p>Billy made a face. “That’s so you.”</p><p>“I know. It’s part of the appeal.”</p><p>Tommy raised an eyebrow. “Just London?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes glinted. “London for two days. We’ll do galleries, tea, and a proper night out if I don’t regret it by 8 p.m.”</p><p>“God save the Queen,” Billy muttered, already Googling outfit ideas.</p><p>“Then,” Agatha continued, “we go north. Lake District.”</p><p>Tommy’s eyebrows shot up. “Mountains and lakes and hiking?!”</p><p>“And wool jumpers and literary references no one but me will understand.”</p><p>“And pubs with fires?” Billy asked.</p><p>“Obviously. And if I catch either of you ordering a vodka Red Bull, I’ll disown you on the spot.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “And after that?”</p><p>“Edinburgh,” she said. “Three days. Ghost tours. Cobblestones. Castles. Your inevitable emotional breakdown because you didn’t pack enough socks.”</p><p>Billy clutched his chest. “I’m going to weep in a ruin. I can feel it already.”</p><p>Agatha stood to refill her coffee. “We’re doing walks. Museums. Quiet things. I need to start slow before Japan gives me sensory overload and Zimbabwe kills me with joy.”</p><p>Billy perked up again. “Can I vlog it?”</p><p>“You’ll vlog it even if I say no,” Agatha sighed. “Just don’t film me without eyeliner. We’ll fly from Edinburgh to Japan for Billy’s week.”</p><p>“Tokyo and Kyoto,” Billy declared. “Cherry blossoms. Thrift shopping. Robot cafés. Maybe a tattoo.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look. “You will not get a tattoo in a language you don’t speak.”</p><p>“Fine,” Billy said. “Just piercings.”</p><p>“We’ll discuss it.”</p><p>Tommy raised his hand like a student. “And then—Zimbabwe?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yes. You get us last, Tommy. Which is frankly terrifying.”</p><p>“I’m thinking safari lodges, traditional dancing, national parks. Just vibes.”</p><p>“I will die if there’s no Wi-Fi,” Billy said.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied. “One less child to wrangle.”</p><p>Tommy turned serious. “Thanks for doing this. For real. We know it’s expensive. And time-consuming. And…”</p><p>Agatha waved him off. “Don’t get sentimental.”</p><p>Billy smirked. “She’s only pretending to be annoyed.”</p><p>“I am annoyed,” Agatha said, “but I’m also fond of you, and that’s my cross to bear.”</p><p>Tommy raised his juice like a toast. “To Andrea,  destroyer of law, spender of much cash, bringer of vibes.”</p><p>Billy clinked his mug against his. “To trauma bonding across time zones.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, standing to refill her coffee. “To me. For surviving both of you.”</p><p>As she turned away, her phone buzzed on the table. A single message lit up the screen.</p><p>Rio 💋💀 : Hope you’re surviving the twins this morning. Just ran past a bakery that smelled like you.</p><p>Agatha didn’t smile, exactly. But the edges of her mouth softened.</p><p>“Hey,” Billy said suddenly, squinting at her.</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “What now?”</p><p>“You’re doing the thing again.”</p><p>“What thing?”</p><p>Tommy snorted. “She’s thinking about her girlfriend.”</p><p>“I’m not…” Agatha began, then stopped. Cleared her throat. “I’m planning our holiday.”</p><p>Billy raised both brows.</p><p>Tommy grinned. “She’s already planning what to bring her back from Fortnum &amp; Mason.”</p><p>“If either of you speak again,” Agatha said, “I’ll book middle seats.”</p><p>Billy gasped. “You wouldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha just smirked. “Watch me.”</p><p>But when she walked back toward the table, the boys noticed she was smiling, soft and smug, with that quiet kind of joy that slips in when you’re too happy to stop it.</p><p>Tommy and Billy exchanged a grin.</p><p>“She’s so in love,” Billy whispered.</p><p>“She’s doomed,” Tommy agreed.</p><p>From down the hall, Agatha’s voice floated back: “I can hear you.”</p><p>That evening in the gym, Tommy was finishing his cooldown, lying on his back, one ankle crossed over the other, arms spread wide like he was waiting to ascend.</p><p>Rio tapped the toe of her sneaker against his ribs. “Don’t die dramatically on my floor. That’s for leg day.”</p><p>Tommy groaned. “Tell that to my hamstrings. You’re evil. Amanda has terrible taste.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow and leaned against the pull-up bar frame. “I thought you liked me.”</p><p>“I do,” he said, eyes still closed. “That’s why I’m asking.”</p><p>There was a pause. Just long enough for her to realize this was a shift.</p><p>She crouched next to him, resting her arms over her knees. “Asking what?”</p><p>He cracked one eye open. “Are you gonna hurt her?”</p><p>Rio blinked. That wasn’t a question she’d expected, not from Tommy, the goofball nephew, the one who joked his way through everything.</p><p>Her face softened. “Wow. We’re going deep, huh?”</p><p>He shrugged, a little defensive now. “It’s not a threat or anything. Just, she’s different lately. Happier. Lighter.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, serious now. “She told me she loves you both, so much. She always been happy with just you.”</p><p>“I know, she’s the best,” Tommy muttered. “But she put her life on hold for us.”</p><p>That hit harder than she was prepared for.</p><p>Rio sat fully, crossing her legs on the mat. “I’m not going to pretend I’ve got this all figured out. We haven’t even been together that long. But I’m not doing this for shits and gigs.”</p><p>He looked over at her, finally meeting her eyes. “She pretends she doesn’t care what we think. But she always does.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said softly.</p><p>“She’s tough. But not with people she loves.” A beat. “She shows she cares with you. I’ve never seen her be like that with anyone but us before.”</p><p>Rio felt something squeeze tight in her chest.<br/>“I care for her too,” she said, voice quiet. “She matters. I’m not going anywhere if I can help it.”</p><p>Tommy studied her. “Good. ‘Cause if you break her heart, Billy and I will make a three-part exposé and post it during peak TikTok hours.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “I’d expect nothing less.”</p><p>He sat up, running a towel over his face. “Alright. Now that that’s settled, let’s go humiliate ourselves on a tiktok live.”</p><p>@RioVidalTrainer (LIVE)<br/>Caption: Core &amp; speed drills Q&amp;A with @thecoolermaximoff</p><p>Rio appeared first, wiping sweat from her brow, her hair up in a messy bun, tank top damp along her back. She smiled as she set the phone on its tripod.</p><p>“Alright, we’re live. Hi. Welcome. We just wrapped a session, the usual flavor of pain, and today’s guest is mostly popular demand and some light blackmail.”</p><p>Tommy leaned into frame, still catching his breath, a towel slung around his neck. “You said if I didn’t do this, you’d make me do wall sits for an hour.”</p><p>“I stand by that.”</p><p>“Anyway, hello, I’m Tommy. I was a promising youth until Rio tried to kill me with timed sprints.”</p><p>Comments rolled in fast:</p><p>- THE COLAB I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED<br/>- Is Agatha watching this??<br/>- Rio why do you always look like post-battle Katniss<br/>- GIVE US YOUR CORE ROUTINE TOMMY</p><p>Rio held up a hand. “Let’s stay focused. Today we’re talking about conditioning, lateral speed, reaction timing, and lower core strength.”</p><p>Tommy nodded, still winded but grinning. “Yeah. I’m trialing for the national track team and for football this fall. So we’re working on my quick-twitch response and making sure I can take a hit without crumbling into emotional dust.”</p><p>“You’re actually stronger than you think,” Rio said, casually.</p><p>“High praise from one of the elite fitness coaches.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “I’m honoured that you think that.”</p><p>The chat lit up:</p><p>- OMG national team??? GO TOMMY<br/>- Wait he’s actually talented?? 👏👏👏<br/>- Agatha raised him RIGHT<br/>- He’s lowkey built??<br/>- STOP I’M FALLING FOR RIO AND TOMMY AT ONCE</p><p>Tommy caught the last one and snorted. “Pick a struggle.”</p><p>Rio gave the camera a look. “Please don’t fall in love with my client-slash-potential step child.”</p><p>“Potential step teen,” he corrected.</p><p>Rio chuckled, trying to rein it back in. “Alright. Let’s take some training questions-”</p><p>But the chat had other plans.</p><p>- Does Agatha cook for you after workouts??<br/>- Is Rio living with you guys?? 👀👀<br/>- Who’s the soft one in the relationship?<br/>- WHERES MOTHER!!!</p><p>Tommy raised both brows at the screen. “Oh, you lot really came with your nosey boots on today.”</p><p>Rio sighed, pretending to be exasperated. “You people are feral. This is a training live.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “You did sleep over. A few times now”</p><p>“I sleep. At places. That’s allowed.”</p><p>“You better not be sleeping at over places than ours.”</p><p>The comments exploded:</p><p>- SO IT’S TRUE??<br/>- Protective Tommy is kinda hot 🔥🥵❤️<br/>- Not tommy subtlety threatening Rio<br/>- CONFIRMED MULTIPLE SLEEPOVERS<br/>- IS IT LOVE YET??<br/>- I SWEAR TO GOD IF RIO HURTS HER—</p><p>Tommy read one out loud, gasping. “'I swear to god if Rio hurts her' Wow. Protective internet fans incoming.”</p><p>Rio laughed, cheeks flushing. “For the record, I have no intention of hurting her. You can all keep your pitchforks in the group chat.”</p><p>Tommy cut in, smirking. “Agnes has been humming in the mornings. Humming. Like some cursed Disney villain who found love in the redemption film.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “She’s going to murder you for saying that on live.”</p><p>“She’ll have to catch me first.”</p><p>The chat spiraled:</p><p>- AGATHA. HUMS.<br/>- This is the gayest softest thing ever<br/>- Rio made the Ice Queen melt 😭<br/>- I’d pay to watch them do a domestic morning vlog<br/>- Let Agatha join next time PLEASE</p><p>Rio shook her head, biting back a smile. “You all are a nightmare.”</p><p>Tommy tilted his head. “You’re smiling like a lovesick loser.”</p><p>“She makes it easy,” Rio admitted, too quiet for it to be fully picked up and then she blinked like she hadn’t meant to say it out loud.</p><p>The chat however realised what she said:</p><p>- I JUST ASCENDED<br/>- RIOOOO 🥰🥰🥰🥰<br/>- She makes it easy? I’m crying in my protein shake<br/>- THIS IS BETTER THAN ANY ROMCOM<br/>- DON’T EVER BREAK UP EVER OR I’LL LOSE MY WILL TO LIVE</p><p>Tommy gave her a sidelong glance. “You said it, not me.”</p><p>“End the live,” Rio muttered, covering her face with one hand.</p><p>“Nope. The people need this. The people deserve joy.”</p><p>“Tommy.”</p><p>“Say hi to your girlfriend for the internet.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “This is why she threatens you all the time.”</p><p>And with that, the Live ended, abruptly, mid-laugh, as Tommy tried to sign off with a flourish and Rio tackled the phone off the stand.</p>

<p>The house was a hum of chaos, filled with movement as it’s occupants ran through check lists of items to pack, documents needed and accessories to consider.</p><p>Upstairs, Billy was in his room with music playing as he laid out multiple outfit options like a stylist preparing for Fashion Week. Tommy kept sprinting up and down the stairs, convinced he’d forgotten something crucial every five minutes.</p><p>The scent of takeout filled the house, Thai, at Rio’s request, since she’d stayed to drive them to the airport in the morning. Lemongrass and chili clung to the air as she stood at the kitchen island in sweatpants, barefoot, sorting through containers and trying not to focus on the clock. Or the fact that, in less than 12 hours, Agatha would be gone.</p><p>For three weeks.</p><p>And somehow, in a relationship that hadn’t yet hit the two-month mark, it felt like someone was pulling oxygen from her chest.</p><p>She hadn’t expected this to get so real. Not so fast. But it had. She spent more nights at Agathas house than her own in the last two weeks, desperate to fill her free time with Agatba, so much so Alice was making U-haul jokes daily.</p><p>Agatha entered from the living room, loose black trousers and a tank top that made her look too casually beautiful for this world. Her curls were tied up high and imperfect, reading glasses perched on her nose. She carried their passports and the boarding pass printout like she was holding a court deposition.</p><p>“We need to be at the airport no later than”</p><p>“Seven,” Rio recited. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha paused and looked at her, expression unreadable. Then she softened. “Sorry. Habit. I tend to… over-manage when it comes to trips.”</p><p>“I like it,” Rio said honestly. “You’re prepared. That’s sexy.”</p><p>There was a beat between them.</p><p>Billy skidded into the room. “Can I pack some of your spare makeup or will you accuse me of theft at the airport?”</p><p>“Are you taking the YSL things?” Agatha asked without blinking.</p><p>“...No.”</p><p>“You can take anything else,” she replied, eyes still on Rio. “But if I see them in any sort of Inheritance Realness TikTok, I’m destroying them in front of you.”</p><p>Tommy appeared behind him, holding a single Alexander McQueen sneaker. “Has anyone seen my left shoe?”</p><p>“No,” the three of them said in unison.</p><p>The house had finally calmed by 10:30pm. The noise, the flurry of forgotten items and frantic repacking, had faded into a comfortable hush.</p><p>Billy had gone to bed with a collagen face mask on, blasting lo-fi jazz from his speaker like it was part of a ritual. Tommy lay in his own bed half-wrapped in a weighted blanket, murmuring commentary to himself as he watched football highlights.</p><p>In Agathas room, everything was still.</p><p>Rio sat cross-legged on the bed, the cotton of an oversized T-shirt grazing her thighs, her skin still damp from a late shower. The day’s heat clung to her, mixed with the residual ache from a brutal training session prior to coming over. It was the kind of tired that lived in her bones, but it wasn't the sore muscles that made her feel hollow - it was the ticking clock.</p><p>Less than 12 hours.</p><p>Agatha would be gone. For three weeks.</p><p>And even though this thing between them was still new, not even two months in, Rio felt the weight of it like gravity had shifted inside her chest. It wasn't just a girlfriend leaving for a trip. It was like oxygen stepping out the door.</p><p>Agatha sat beside her against the headboard, long legs folded beneath her, her tablet glowing softly in her hands. Her glasses sat low on the bridge of her nose, curls now loose down her back.</p><p>She was everything Rio had ever wanted. Rio couldn’t look away.</p><p>She watched the small movements, the pinch of Agatha’s lips when she concentrated, the way her thumb hovered mid-scroll like her brain moved faster than her hands. The sharp, elegant curve of her jaw. The skin along her collarbone still kissed by the sun.</p><p>Agatha felt her watching. Slowly, she looked up.<br/>“What?”</p><p>Rio didn’t smile. She was too full for smiling. “I’m gonna miss you.”</p><p>That stopped Agatha. Like the words rewrote the air between them.</p><p>The tablet dropped slightly in her lap. “It’s only three weeks.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio’s voice didn’t waver, but something inside her cracked. “And I’ll feel all of them.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet. Then she reached out and took Rio’s hand, no drama, no ceremony. Just warmth and weight and fingers that curled gently into her own.</p><p>“I’ll miss you too,” she said, voice low, the truth of it naked in the quiet. “More than I want to admit, honestly.”</p><p>Rio blinked against the heat in her eyes. “Don’t do that.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Say things like that and still leave me here like I’m supposed to function well without you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, not teasing but overwhelmed, like she didn’t know where to put the feeling building in her chest. “You train Olympians and terrify six-foot linebackers.”</p><p>“That’s the version of me the world sees. The version you get - I  melt if you even breathe in my direction.”</p><p>There was a stillness then, charged, stretched between them like silk.</p><p>Agatha reached out, brushed her fingers through Rio’s damp hair, and tucked it behind her ear with such deliberate tenderness that Rio leaned into the touch like it anchored her to the bed.</p><p>What followed wasn’t rushed.</p><p>It was slow, reverent, rooted in something deeper than want.</p><p>Agatha shifted, rising onto her knees, her body fluid and elegant in the dim lamp light. She cupped Rio’s face with both hands like it was fragile, precious, hers. Her thumbs moved in soft arcs over Rio’s cheekbones, her gaze locked in, unwavering.</p><p>Then she kissed her, not hesitantly, but with certainty.</p><p>It was a kiss like a vow: deep and unhurried, weighted with the ache of goodbye but the promise of the future. Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s waist, then up her back, mapping the familiar ridges of her spine as if she needed to commit them to permanent memory.</p><p>They moved with instinct, too many nights spent learning each other in the dark, not fumbling, not frantic. Shirts slipped off shoulders in slow motions, the whisper of cotton against skin making every breath feel louder. Fingers traced, lingered, wandered.</p><p>Rio kissed Agatha’s collarbone, her shoulder, the soft place where her pulse fluttered beneath the skin. Agatha’s hands were sure and grounding, moving over Rio’s body like she was both learning and remembering all at once.</p><p>They didn’t speak.</p><p>Not because there was nothing to say, but because everything important was already being said in the way their bodies met, parted, melded.</p><p>Agatha kissed down Rio’s neck like she was savoring her. Rio’s breath hitched when Agatha’s mouth found the hollow of her throat, tongue lathing down, mapping her body with nips and kisses. Her hands trembled slightly as she ran them over Agatha’s bare back, down to her hips, pulling her in closer, needing more of her everywhere, all at once.</p><p>When Agatha pushed her gently back against the pillows, her eyes never left Rio’s. And when she whispered her name softly as she reached the apex of her legs, Rio felt it down to her spine.</p><p>They made love like they were trying to mark time. Like if they moved slowly enough, deliberately enough, they could make these last few hours stretch into the days they’d be apart.</p><p>Every gasp was a thread pulling them closer.</p><p>Every kiss a tether.</p><p>Every moan a promise and a vow.</p><p>When it was over, and the quiet returned, they stayed tangled in each other, legs thrown over hips, skin warm, breath shared.</p><p>Agatha’s hand lay over Rio’s heart.</p><p>Rio turned toward her, still breathless but steady now, her voice nothing more than a whisper. “I want this.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, heavy-lidded, fingertips brushing along Rio’s jaw. “You have it.”</p><p>“No, I mean” Rio swallowed, grounding herself. “I want you. Not just tonight. Not just a few days a week. I want mornings. I want holidays. I want arguments like tonights about which takeout to order and how you have too many throw pillows on the bed. I want you… long-term.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak right away.</p><p>She looked at her, really looked, like she was trying to see all the way through her. Then she leaned in and kissed her again, slower this time. Just full. Honest.</p><p>When she pulled back, her thumb traced Rio’s bottom lip, her face open and honest.</p><p>“I want that too,” she said softly. “When I’m back, we’ll talk about this properly, okay?”</p><p>The open affection in her ice blue eyes was enough to make Rio pull herself over the top of her again, kissing down her neckline to prove that she deserved to stay.</p><p>Rio was awake that morning before the twins, wrapped in one of Agatha’s robes, standing in the kitchen with a mug of tea and the quiet ache of goodbye setting in.</p><p>Agatha entered, dressed in her airport outfit, linen blazer, dark jeans, clean sneakers, sleek carry-on already by the door.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>No dramatics. No declarations.</p><p>Just one long look that said: We’ll both feel this the whole time.</p><p>“Three weeks,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, wrapping her arms around her waist and slotting a knee between her legs, smiling as the gasp it caused from the other woman. “Bring me back something good.”</p><p>“I will do.”</p><p>“But hurry.”</p><p>Agatha smiled into her neck. “God, I’m going to miss you.”</p><p>“Me too.” As Rio pulled her closer, dragging her upstairs for a final goodbye before the twins were up, she felt the truth of the statement settle in her bones.</p><p>An hour later, Billy thundered down the stairs in a tight fitting leisure set. "Which airport are we using again?"</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up from double-checking passports. "Newark. We have the lounge booked before we board. You ready?”</p><p>Billy was nearly vibrating with excitement. “I am.”</p><p>She glared at him. He grinned harder.</p><p>Rio leaned against Agatha’s car, arms folded, wearing dark sunglasses and a fitted black zip-up jacket that made even Billy do a double take.</p><p>“You know,” he said, opening the back door, “you could be a spy.”</p><p>“Don’t tempt me.”</p><p>“You’re driving Annies car?” Tommy said, sliding his suitcase into the boot. “You trust her enough to have your car?”</p><p>“She can probably deadlift the car,” Agatha muttered. “So yes.”</p><p>Rio smirked, climbing in behind the wheel.</p><p>Billy already had his phone out, sunglasses on, starting a TikTok live the second they began backing out.</p><p>Caption: Family holiday but make it ✨chaotic✨ and first class ✈️</p><p>Billy panned the camera from his face to Tommy, who was eating a granola bar like he’d been starved.</p><p>“I’m currently en route to Newark with my aunt, her girlfriend, and my annoyance of a twin brother!”</p><p>- Wait Rio’s driving?? Is that Agathas car<br/>- Where’s Agatha? Is that her in passenger<br/>- Tommy looks like a Golden Retriever about to go to the dog park 😂</p><p>Billy angled the camera toward the front of the car.</p><p>Agatha was now fully in frame in the passenger seat, elegant as ever, scrolling through her emails like she wasn’t also biting the inside of her cheek and blushing. Why? Because Rio had one hand on the wheel and the other resting on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Do you want me to mute this before it gets too horny?” Billy stage-whispered.</p><p>Agatha reached back without looking and slapped him round the head.</p><p>Tommy cackled.</p><p>Rio pulled up to the curb and parked. The twins were already unloading bags, shoving each other lightly.</p><p>Agatha stepped out slowly, her outfit still immaculate. Her jaw tight.</p><p>Rio came around to the pavement side, pulling her into a hug without asking.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha didn't move. Then her arms wrapped around Rio, long and strong and quiet.</p><p>“I hate this already,” Rio whispered. “Three weeks?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was in her ear. “Don’t. Please.”</p><p>“Your going to be gone for ages.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back, brushing Rio’s cheek with her thumb. “Then don’t forget me.”</p><p>“As if I could.”</p><p>And then, right there on the curb, next to a stack of luggage and a muttering pair of twins livestreaming with 60,000 people watching, Agatha kissed her. Not shy. Not apologetic.</p><p>Billy gasped into the camera. “Your getting this right!!!!”</p><p>Tommy groaned. “My retinas!”</p><p>- Some screen record! Right now!!!! 🥵💋🥵<br/>- MOTHER AND FATHER 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br/>- I need the screen record of this - I beg please</p><p>Rio laughed against Agatha’s mouth, but her eyes shimmered just slightly.</p><p>“You’ll text me when you land?”</p><p>“I’ll FaceTime you from the lounge before I even board the plane.”</p><p>“You’re going to have an amazing time sweetheart, enjoy it.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “With those two? Not a chance.” But the soft smile and light in her eyes betrayed her. She reached down and pulled Rios hand into her own. She felt Agatha slip something into it.</p><p>When Rio opened her hand there was a slim silver ring, the one Agatha usually wore on her right pinky. Not for any reason, not to make any promise. Just hers to hold.</p><p>“Don’t lose it,” Agatha said, straightening her bag and stepping back like nothing had happened.</p><p>But when she turned one last time before entering the airport, the smile was small. Real.</p><p>And just for Rio.</p><p>The TikTok live continued as Billy panned his camera in a dramatic 360°. The camera locked onto Tommy in the background piling three pastries onto a tiny plate.</p><p>“Tommy is acting like he’s never seen food before in his life,” Billy stage-whispered.</p><p>Tommy looked over, croissant halfway in his mouth. “We didn’t eat breakfast!”</p><p>“You had three protein bars,” Agatha’s voice cut in, dry and unmistakable. “And half of Rio’s granola.”</p><p>“Allegedly,” Tommy mumbled.</p><p>- IS THIS THE FIRST CLASS LOUNGE??? OMG<br/>- AGATHA IS A HERO FOR TAKING THEM<br/>- Is Agatha open to adopting… asking for a friend 🫣<br/>- Where’s Rio???</p><p>Billy turned the camera toward Agatha, who sat in one of the lounge’s oversized cream chairs like a queen in exile. She was reading something on her tablet with a glass of prosecco in hand.</p><p>“She’s not coming,” Billy told the chat. “She drove us here and kissed Aunt Agatha goodbye like she was dying.”</p><p>“It was disgusting,” Tommy called from the buffet.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Disgusting is you talking with your mouth full of food Tristan.”</p><p>- WAIT RIO DROVE THEM TO THE AIRPORT 😭<br/>- THEY SAID GOODBYE ALREADY??? nooo!!! I MISSED IT<br/>- Omg Gurl! You did miss it, it was so fucking hot 🔥🥵🔥<br/>- I need someone to have screen recorded the dramatic goodbye kiss or I’ll perish</p><p>“She looked like she was trying not to cry,” Billy added dramatically. “And Agatha looked like she was definitely pretending not to care, but her jaw muscle was doing the Thing.”</p><p>Agatha sipped her prosecco and muttered, “If you narrate my facial expressions again, I’m moving you to economy.”</p><p>“So! Our first two days,” Billy said, now seated cross-legged on a velvet bench. “We’re in London. Agatha made a whole itinerary. Like a PTA mom.”</p><p>Tommy waved a printed, laminated copy that she’d made for him, leaving it digital for herself and Billy. “She even colour-coded the days for me.”</p><p>“It’s efficient,” Agatha said without looking up. “You’d forget your own name without me.”</p><p>- PLS TELL US WHAT’S ON THE ITINERARY<br/>- LAMINATED?? i’m crying that’s so mom coded<br/>- this family is honestly like a movie</p><p>Billy leaned in like he was spilling state secrets. “So tomorrow: Museums, especially the Natural History Museum. Full tour. Agatha is feral for history.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked up, eyes glittering. “Theres a David Attenborough immersive experience. It’s 50 minutes of the planets evolution and he narrates it.”</p><p>“She’s been talking about this since she started planning the trip,” Tommy said, sitting beside her with a fruit plate.</p><p>“It’s like her version of Disneyland,” Billy added.</p><p>- STOP. NOT THE DAVID ATTENBOROUGH THING<br/>- why is the thought of her being excited for museum trips sexy?<br/>- Shes intelligent and like to learn - POOKIE I CANT 🥰🥰🥰🥰<br/>- AGATHA IS MOMMY 🥵🔥</p><p>“She’s also planned multiple restaurants and tourist attractions within the two days we’re there. I think we’re doing afternoon tea at the Ivy?”</p><p>Agatha gave Billy a levelled look. “And if either of you wear ripped jeans, I’ll mail you home in a cargo crate.”</p><p>Billy beamed at the camera. “She says things like that and we love her anyway.”</p><p>- she’s terrifying and I’d die for her<br/>- protect Agatha at all costs<br/>- Not her entering her british royalty era 🥰<br/>- Do you realise actually how lucky you are to have her?</p><p>Billy turned the camera to himself. “So here’s the deal: I’m going live every day of this trip. Highlights, meltdowns, luxury, haunted castles, safari lions, and Agatha threatening to murder us.”</p><p>“Only if you deserve it,” she muttered behind her tablet.</p><p>“She’s also got a skincare travel kit that looks like a NASA experiment and a suitacase of clothes better than the paris runway. Stay tuned.”</p><p>- THIS IS THE BEST SHOW I’VE EVER SEEN<br/>- I’m not even joking this is my Roman Empire<br/>- DO YOU THINK RIO IS WATCHING RN<br/>- They miss each other so bad it’s PAINFUL</p><p>Billy turned the camera back to Agatha one last time.</p><p>“Any parting words?”</p><p>Agatha looked at him over the rim of her glass, unimpressed and stuck her middle finger up at him.</p><p>Billy ended the live as Tommy said, “Wait… we’re boarding soon right? I still haven’t gone to the bathroom.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “God save me.”</p>

<p>They touched down at Heathrow just past nine in the evening UK time, now being 5 hours ahead of Rio back home. The airport was its usual chaos of rolling luggage and determined families, but Agatha glided through immigration with the calm authority of someone who knew precisely where she was going and had no time for fools.</p><p>Billy and Tommy trailed behind her, dragging carry-ons and trying not to look too awestruck.</p><p>The Connaught awaited.</p><p>Bellhops in dark green uniforms and feathered hats collected their suitcases and the carry on luggage while a concierge welcomed "Ms. Harkness" with a deferential nod.</p><p>Tommy nudged Billy. “We’re literally staying in a place where they treat you like royalty.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back, just said over her shoulder, “Try not to break anything.”</p><p>The suite was breathtaking, plush velvet armchairs, silk-draped windows looking out over a quiet garden courtyard, fresh hydrangeas on the glass table, and a gold-plated tea service like something from a historical drama. The marble<br/>bathroom alone looked like it belonged in bridgerton.</p><p>Tommy flung himself onto a sofa with a satisfied groan. “This feels like money. Like, fuck you money.”</p><p>“Language!”</p><p>Billy already had his phone out. “I’m going live.”</p><p>Billy’s camera swept across the suite, giving the viewers a tour of the hotel apartment: the sprawling queen beds in his and Tommys room with six pillows, the sleek modern artwork, the heated bathroom floor. He moved through the suite and landed on Agatha, perched in a leather armchair with a champagne flute in one hand and her phone in the other, dark curls still smooth from the flight.</p><p>“This is our home for the next three nights,” Billy announced. “Agatha, say hello to your fans”</p><p>Agatha raised her glass without looking up.</p><p>“You boys need to be ready to go out to dinner in 20 minutes.”</p><p>The chat exploded:</p><p>- No because I just googled and I think thats the apartment at the Connaught - its $13,412 for three nights 😲😲😲😲<br/>- AUNTIE AGATHA REALLY SAID THE COST DOESN’T MATTER<br/>- Can I be adopted too or???<br/>- WHERE ARE YOU GOING FOR DINNER 🥘</p><p>Billy ended the live and set his phone down. “I mean it though. This is incredible. Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha met his eyes. There was something fond and exasperated in her expression, like a woman torn between teasing and soft sentiment.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” she said. “Now go shower. Quickly. We’re dining somewhere that doesn’t accept sweaty jet lagged teens.”</p><p>The restaurant she’d booked, Cipriani, shimmered in golden hues as they arrived by private car provided by the hotel. Waiters wore pressed suits. The Thames sparkled outside the windows.</p><p>Agatha, in her slate-gray silk blouse and tailored pants, fit right in with the old money that surrounded them, regardless of the fact hers was all self made.</p><p>Tommy adjusted his button-up for the tenth time.</p><p>Billy scanned the menu, chewing his nail absentmindedly.</p><p>“I don’t know what to get, what are you getting?”</p><p>“Get the Burrata for appetiser,” she said, taking a sip of her drink. “You can have some of my king crab as well.”</p><p>Billy ordered as she suggested, Tommy going for the Bresaola with shaved parmesan.</p><p>Both boys followed Agatha in ordering the fillet of beef for their entrees with roasted vegetables.</p><p>A cellist played something softly in the corner, soothing the tension from the flight.</p><p>Midway through the meal, Billy raised his glass.</p><p>“To Agatha, for choosing to waste her hard earned cash on us.”</p><p>Agatha quirked a brow but accepted the toast. “For the record?” she said, sincerely. “Nothing I spend on you both is ever a waste.”</p><p>Rather than going live Billy instead created a short video to post of their meal. Tommy devouring the appetiser, Billy mouthing, “This is the best burrata of my life.” Agatha delicately splitting her own appetiser  between the boys so each had a taste. The entrees on the table as they clinked glasses.</p><p>- I want her to ruin my life and then buy me this dinner<br/>- She’s literally a Bond villain but also the best parent 🥰<br/>- Not my pookie making no fuss while sharing her food ❤️</p><p>As dessert arrived, vanilla gelato with dark chocolate drizzle for the boys,  Agatha reached over and gently squeezed both of their hands. He caught the moment on camera, silently.</p><p>Post-dinner, the city lights glittered around them as they walked the Thames promenade, it was nearing 11pm now. The London Eye glowed like a moon, and Tommy nearly tripped over himself staring at it.</p><p>Inside the private pod, the view unfolded, London lit up in gold and white. Billy went live again.</p><p>Caption: Night views of London ✨✨✨✨</p><p>Billy pointed the camera at the skyline. Then at Agatha. “Act cool.”</p><p>She didn’t even blink. “You can’t ‘act’ what you already are.”</p><p>- WHY IS SHE SO COOL???<br/>- DOES SHE KNOW SHE’S FAMOUS??<br/>- I’D JUMP OUT THE EYE FOR HER.</p><p>Tommy waved dramatically at the Houses of Parliament. Billy pointed to the glowing city and whispered, “It’s giving... wealth.”</p><p>They reached the top and Agatha pulled each teen into a hug as they watched the city below them, each teen resting their head on her shoulder- content to enjoy the moment.</p><p>Back at the suite, Tommy passed out mid-sentence, mouth open, still wearing one shoe. Billy was brushing his teeth, humming an old Beatles song off-key.</p><p>Agatha retreated to the balcony. The air was crisp. London glowed beneath her.</p><p>She pulled out her phone. FaceTime. Rio 💋💀</p><p>It rang once. Twice.</p><p>Then the screen lit up. Rio, hair tied up, gym tank and hoodie on in her own apartment, her face tired but soft.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, smile blooming.</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Hi.”</p><p>“You look…” Rio tilted her head. “Gorgeous. But tired.”</p><p>“It’s nearly midnight here,” Agatha said, but her voice warmed. “They’re thrilled with the rooms though. I may never be able to convince them to stay in a normal hotel room again.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You love luxury though.” There was a pause. Then Rio leaned closer to the camera. “I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly. The words landed in her chest. “I know,” she murmured. “I miss you too.”</p><p>“I can tell you need to sleep sweetheart, go to bed.”</p><p>“I’m going to, I just wanted to see your face before I did.”</p><p>Another pause. Rio smiled softly. “I’m glad you called me, speak tomorrow. Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha whispered it back. “Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>She stayed on the balcony a while longer after the call ended, letting the quiet of the city settle around her. She wished she’d invited Rio. Fiercely. But this trip was for the boys. But next year. Next year she hoped she’d be with them.</p><p>The following morning began at the Connaught with silver cutlery and the soft clink of porcelain. Breakfast was poised and precise: perfectly poached eggs, sourdough toast, green juice so vibrant it practically glowed. Tommy insisted it tasted like grass; Billy stole a croissant when Agatha wasn’t looking.</p><p>By ten, they were en route to South Kensington, Agatha in the front, alternating between chatting with the driver and reading museum reviews out loud like a tour guide with a PhD and no patience.</p><p>They walked through the great vaulted entrance of the natural history museum, their sneakers squeaking faintly on the polished floors. The museum buzzed with families and field trips, but they kept close, Billy already holding up his phone, Tommy bouncing on his toes.</p><p>The David Attenborough Immersive Experience was held in a special exhibition wing, lined with warm darkness and a soft, forest-like scent in the air. As they stepped into the domed theater, projections flickered to life across walls and floor, ancient oceans, Jurassic swamps, blinking mammoths.</p><p>And then, his voice. Sir David Attenborough's gentle narration washed over the room, reverent and slow, a low rumble of time and memory.</p><p>Agatha went still. Eyes bright as the show began.</p><p>Billy caught it first. Her eyes, always sharp, softened. Not misty exactly, but full. Filled with something deep and reverent. Like wonder mixed with pure awe and enjoyment. Tommy didn’t say anything, just leaned close to her, shoulder against hers.</p><p>Billy switched to go live.</p><p>Caption:🦖💔 Sir David owns our hearts</p><p>The camera caught the room in soft blues and greens, Agatha’s profile framed in light cuddled next to Tommy.</p><p>- OMG MY BABY - SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY<br/>- The way you can tell this is something she’s going to remember for ever 🥰❤️🥰<br/>- LOOK AT HER EYES OMG<br/>- SIR DAVID + AUNT AGATHA = SPIRITUAL AWAKENING.<br/>- SOMEONE MAKE THIS A MOVIE = peak family core right here</p><p>Afterward, they walked the galleries, dazed in the best way. Agatha barely spoke, only hummed thoughtfully now and then. Tommy roared at a T. rex animatronic and got shushed by a worker.</p><p>Billy documented everything like a news reporter.</p><p>They arrived at the Tower of London mid-afternoon. The twins darted ahead, fascinated by tales of betrayal and beheading. Agatha took it in stride, pausing by plaques, lecturing gently, correcting Billy’s interpretation of Tudor history like it was a TED Talk.</p><p>Tommy peered through a window slit. “Imagine getting stabbed here.”</p><p>“Charming,” Agatha replied. “Truly a cultural scholar in the making.”</p><p>Billy filmed their walk through the Crown Jewels exhibit. “She just called a sceptre ‘gaudy.’ That’s a direct quote.”</p><p>Caption:  Tower of London Adventures</p><p>Billy narrated the video dramatically in a whisper.  It was a snapshot of the visit. Tommy pretending to duel a suit of armor. Agatha sipping a flat white beside a raven like she summoned it herself. The three of them smiling by the guards.</p><p>- WHY DOES SHE LOOK LIKE SHE’S BEEN HERE BEFORE??<br/>- SHE'S A PRINCESS IN A CHIC BLAZER<br/>- HISTORY IS HOT NOW?<br/>- Tommys hilarious 🤣</p><p>They finished the afternoon at Buckingham Palace, watching the guards shift in perfect formation.</p><p>Billy went live again, showing Agatha standing in profile, composed, watchful. The wind lifted her curls slightly, the sun turned her black blazer charcoal blue.</p><p>Tommy whispered, “Bet one of the guards falls in love with her.”</p><p>“She has that effect,” Billy replied. “It’s either that or striking fear in them.”</p><p>- THE GUARD IS DEFINITELY STARING.<br/>- I WOULD DEFECT FROM THE CROWN FOR HER<br/>- British royalty = ✖️ Aunt Agatha = ✔️</p><p>Their final day in London, Camden Market hit like a sensory overload: colors, smells, sounds.</p><p>Drumbeats echoed from street performers; incense curled from corners. Billy was live showing the neon lights and graffiti walls. Tommy darted between doughnut stalls, hands sticky with sugar and joy.</p><p>Agatha, for her part, moved like a cat among pigeons, aloof but still curious. She touched things carefully: tattered novels, handmade candles.</p><p>Billy held up a vintage vinyl record. “What about this?”</p><p>Agatha took it, examined it like forensic evidence. “Acceptable. Price isn’t criminal.”</p><p>- SHE SAID ‘PRICE ISNT CRIMINAL’ LIKE SHE HASNT JUST DROPPED RACKS SINCE YOU LANDED, I’M HOWLING.<br/>- I wish I saw you today! I was there earlier<br/>- There a beatles record to the left that looks great</p><p>Tommy bought an embroidered bomber jacket. Billy found another rare vinyl. Agatha bought three books and a vintage map of London for Rio, though she didn’t say it was for Rio. The boys just knew.</p><p>Back at the Connaught lounge, they sat in a velvet booth, mocktails and cocktails in hand to celebrate their final night in London.</p><p>Caption: Best time EVER.</p><p>Billy raised his glass. “To Aunt Agatha: maker of dreams and creator of amazing itineraries.”</p><p>Tommy echoed, “And the queen of chaos.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her glass lazily. “I’ll allow that.”</p><p>- WHY IS SHE SO ICONIC WHEN SHE’S NOT EVEN TRYING??<br/>- CAN YOU ADOPT ME TOO.<br/>- I’M GENUINELY GOING TO CRY WHEN THIS TRIP ENDS.</p><p>Billy ended the live. The camera just caught Agatha looking sideways at him, lips tugged into a quiet heartfelt smile.</p><p>Checkout was smooth the next day, even though Agatha had them up and out before 7am. The boys were bleary-eyed from packing chaos and TikTok scrolling, but Agatha? Fresh as ever. Blazer, boots, and dark glasses.</p><p>Waiting for them on the curb: a black Range Rover.</p><p>Tommy’s jaw dropped. “We’re driving that?”</p><p>“Correction,” Agatha said, sliding behind the wheel with elegance. “I’m driving. You’re getting in the back and probably snoring for the next four hours.”</p><p>Billy filmed the moment from the backseat.<br/>Caption: She rented a RANGE ROVER for the rest of the trip!</p><p>- SHE DRIVES IN ENGLAND TOO???<br/>- AUNT AGATHA ROAD TRIP ERA???<br/>- She really looks like the best kind of villain OMFG 🥵</p><p>As they pulled out onto the road north, the London skyline receded in the mirrors. Agatha adjusted the GPS with one hand, sunglasses catching the morning light. Tommy snored softly behind her. Billy tapped through TikTok comments and whispered: “They love you.”</p><p>She smiled faintly, eyes on the road.</p><p>“I know.”</p>

<p>The Cotswolds was like a painting, every curve of road cloaked in wildflowers, low stone walls veiled in moss, and sun trickling through hedgerows. The Range Rover glided past it all, tires purring on the narrow country lanes.</p><p>Tommy stirred in the backseat, stretching under his hoodie. His cheek had been smushed against the window for the last few hours, his dreams filled with visions of athletic stardom. However, the antics of the occupants of the front seats had woken him.</p><p>He angled his phone toward the front seats, catching the soft profile of Agatha, sunglasses on, one hand resting lazily at the wheel, the other on the clutch.</p><p>Mumford &amp; Sons, Awake My Soul, was blasting through the speakers.</p><p>Billy and Agatha were singing it in harmony - billys voice quiet and a little off, but Billy’s voice wasn’t half-bad. Agatha’s though, matched the song perfectly, she was singing fully, grinning at Billy.  It wasn’t the kind of performance she’d ever give if she knew people were watching, it was something meant just for them.</p><p>Tommy watched, half-awake, and said nothing.</p><p>Just listened for a moment, however he realised the goldmine this was for views on tiktok and sneakily went live:</p><p>The camera shook as he just let them continue in their moment, oblivious to the climbing viewer count, steadily growing into the tens of thousands.</p><p>“In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die. And where you invest your love, you invest your life. In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die. And where you invest your love, you invest your life…. Awake my soul….<br/>Awake my soul.”</p><p>- Awake my soul?? In a RANGE ROVER??<br/>- I AM HAVING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS TO THIS<br/>- this is folklore-core. this is healed woman energy<br/>- billy looking at her like she’s his whole universe 🥹<br/>- Pookies are dueting OMG my babies 🥰🥰🥰<br/>- Tommys cheeky smile at the camera, I know they don’t know about this 😂😂😂😂</p><p>And then, just as the chat was turning more feral, a new comment appeared, nestled quietly among the noise:</p><p>@RioVidalTrainer - There she is 💚 literally melts me every time I hear her sing 💚</p><p>It lingered on screen. A tiny burst of feeling through the chaos.</p><p>Tommy saw Rios message flash as hundreds of viewers liked the comment, he tilted his phone down slightly, capturing Agatha mid-note as the song built again. The way her expression softened when she hit the chorus and looked at Billy with a blinding smile was their moment.</p><p>He ended the live. No announcement. Just let it go black with the last line of the song still echoing in the air “Awake my soul…”.</p><p>Billy looked back at Tommy, catching him red-handed. “Were you just live?”</p><p>Tommy raised his brows, unapologetic. “You both sounded like the radio. I had a moral obligation to share it with the world.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t glance back, but her smirk was audible. “If I find myself on TikTok with a cottage core compilation, I’ll sue.”</p><p>Billy snorted. “You sound like cottage core witch. Let us have this.”</p><p>From somewhere beneath her sarcasm, a thread of pride crept into her voice. “Just don’t let anyone say I can’t hold a tune.”</p><p>“Rio didn’t,” Tommy said, checking his phone. “She said, ‘There she is’ and that she ‘melts every time you sing’.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond for a moment. Then quietly, like it snuck up on her, “…She always says the sweetest things.”</p><p>They pulled into a gravel driveway about ten minutes later.</p><p>The Airbnb was a riverside barn conversion, all weathered beams, tall glass doors, and a garden that sloped gently into the stream. The converted hayloft had been turned into a lounge nook, and the bedrooms upstairs overlooked the hills like something out of Country Living.</p><p>“Holy shit..” Tommy began, but stopped when Agatha shot him a look.</p><p>Billy opened the back door and immediately started filming, panning over the ivy-covered stone, the wild lavender brushing the doorframe, the small dock at the river’s edge.</p><p>“This is not a drill,” he whispered, then louder: “We’re entering our cottagecore era.”</p><p>Inside, a basket of logs waited beside the hearth. Billy and Tommy dumped their duffels on the worn velvet armchairs while Agatha walked through the kitchen, opening a bottle of elderflower presse she’d picked up on the drive.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just lit the fire, poured a glass over ice, and sat at the open sliding doors, watching the water shimmer.</p><p>Billy wandered off to find signal. Tommy threw himself across the couch and groaned. “Can we just... live here forever?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Lets make it the retirement plan.”</p><p>Once everything had settled, once the boys were upstairs wrestling over which room had the “better vibe,” Agatha sat down on the soft couch and opened her phone, clicking into face time and then Rio 💋💀.</p><p>The connection picked up straight away. Rio’s face appeared, hair loose around her face, no makeup, clearly still at the gym working.</p><p>She smiled though like she’d been waiting all day.</p><p>“Hey you, hows the cotswolds.”</p><p>Agatha turned the phone around slowly, letting Rio see the flickering fireplace, the stone walls, the view out the glass door.</p><p>“It’s beautiful, peaceful. Tommy wants to live here forever.”</p><p>“That’s not allowed, you need to come home to me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly, her eyes shining brighter with the feeling of just speaking to Rio. They talked long into the afternoon, before Agatha announced they were going on a hike.</p><p>The air was cool, the kind that made your lungs feel scrubbed clean.</p><p>They hiked through rolling meadows, past flocks of sheep and quiet woodlands. Tommy took off ahead, racing up a hill and yelling “I AM ONE WITH NATURE.”</p><p>Agatha muttered something about juvenile brain development but climbed after them steadily, boots crunching on the path.</p><p>At the first summit, the view stretched out in waves, green, gold, and soft sky.</p><p>Agatha took a long breath. Said nothing. Just stood there, wind tugging at her curls.</p><p>Billy caught it on camera, quietly, sharing just the short video to tiktok.</p><p>Agatha was gazing at the view. Tommy doing cartwheels in the background, the wind blowing everyones hair gently.</p><p>- This is the softest we’ve seen her<br/>- Someone paint her into a Brontë novel<br/>- Agatha needs her own BBC drama</p><p>The second day, Agatha drove them to a hidden natural pool tucked between hills. Locals called it a wild infinity dip, clear, cold water flowing into a little gorge. The air was crisp, but the boys stripped down to their trunks without hesitation.</p><p>Tommy cannonballed in with a yell. Billy stood on the edge, dramatically narrating: “And thus the influencer perishes nobly, sacrificed to the gods of Cold Girl Aesthetic.”</p><p>He jumped.</p><p>Agatha sat on a rock nearby in shorts, sipping coffee from a thermos. She wasn’t getting in, until Billy goaded her.</p><p>“Come on, you can’t let us out-youth you.”</p><p>She raised a brow. “I was drinking espresso martinis in Berlin nightclubs before you were born.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. Ten minutes later, she was in, grumbling, shrieking when Tommy dived at her, but in. She swam steady laps, sleek and shockingly graceful.</p><p>Tommy, floated on his back: “This is weirdly calming.”</p><p>That afternoon led them along woodland trails edged in foxgloves. At a bend, they found the main infinity pool, a granite ledge sloping into still, glossy river water that spilled into a deep blue basin. Tommy ripped off his shirt and cannonballed into the pool, shrieking. Billy captured the splash; Agatha hovered at the edge, foot poised to dip in, not entirely sold. Eventually, she stepped in quietly, floating on her back as the boys played.</p><p>Agatha’s dark curls hung wet and free. She glanced at her nephews, wild, safe, alive and pretended not to notice as Tommy climbed out and opened his phone, switching to live.</p><p>- THIS IS LITERALLY A MOVIE<br/>- RIVER GODDESS AGATHA?<br/>- BLISSED OUT FAMILY FANTASY<br/>- MOTHER IN A SWIMSUIT 🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵</p><p>Billy laughed through chattering teeth. Agatha offered a mischievous grin before disappearing under the water and discretely grabbing his ankle, causing him to flail and scream.</p><p>Tommy captured everything on the live, including Agatha emerging and flicking her hair back like a tv shampoos advert.</p><p>- Is this me dreaming, I swear I’ve had this dream before 🔥🥵🤣<br/>- This is my Roman Empire<br/>- Mother on the land and sea …. Fuck me 🔥<br/>- I’m watching this in bed tonight 👀👀👀</p><p>Once they were sun-drunk and starving, they went to a M&amp;S Food Hall, Agatha pushed the cart like a war general: eyes sharp, lips pursed, surveying the British produce.</p><p>Billy and Tommy tossed in tubs of olives, pomegranate seeds, stuffed peppers, sugarloaf pineapple and every other weird thing they could find.</p><p>“Why are these grapes… cotton candy flavour?” Tommy asked.</p><p>Agatha peered at the label. “Because capitalism has no limits and neither do we. Put them in.”</p><p>Of course, the twins had to document it for tiktok, filming everything to make a video on the drive back.</p><p>Caption: M&amp;S with Aunt Agatha</p><p>- I swear M&amp;S is elite<br/>- This is peak cozy chaos<br/>- Love this for them, fully embracing a picky bits tea<br/>- Their food haul is to die for for real 🍇</p><p>Dinner that night was on the garden patio, wooden boards piled with picky bits: rosemary crackers, weird fruit, cold meats, nuts. Candles flickered. Tommy talked with his mouth full. Billy filmed another video.</p><p>Agatha just sat back, one leg crossed over the other, nursing wine, watching her boys bicker over cheese.</p><p>“I know you’re filming me again,” she said softly.</p><p>Billy grinned. “It’s for the people. You’re public property now.”</p><p>Their last day in the Cotswolds was all mist and rain that threatened but never appeared. They ducked into a classic village pub, flagstone floors, low beams, and the smell of ale and baked camembert.</p><p>They sat near the fire. Agatha had steak pie and a gin. Billy tried a non-alcoholic beer “for the experience” and immediately regretted it. Tommy devoured fish and chips, then asked again if they could move and live here forever.</p><p>Agatha watched them with that same softness, proud, maybe even a little vulnerable.</p><p>“Thank you for this,” Billy said quietly over sticky toffee pudding.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “You already posted thanks about seven times.”</p><p>“Still. Thanks.”</p><p>She didn’t say “you’re welcome.” She just reached over and tapped his phone face-down.</p><p>“No filming tonight.”</p><p>That evening, they packed. The fire crackled. The rain finally came, pattering against the windows. Tommy fell asleep on the couch under a blanket.</p><p>Billy was laid by the doors watching the stars, airpods in.</p><p>Agatha sat at the kitchen table with a tea and her phone. She scrolled through Rio’s messages.</p><p>A voice note waited.</p><p>She put in one earbud. Pressed play.</p><p>“Hi, sweetheart. Just dropping you this to say I’m thinking about you. Hope the boys haven’t driven you feral. I miss you. Speak tonight.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and smiled the same soft smile she always aimed at the twins.</p>

<p>The Range Rover rumbled up the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, tires clicking against the ancient stone. Rain streaked diagonally across the windshield, the kind of fine mist that soaked you to the bone without you even realising.</p><p>All around them, the city rose from the fog like it was being summoned, narrow alleys, turreted rooftops, crooked chimneys. The buildings weren’t just old, they were tired but in a aesthetic way.</p><p>Billy was practically fused to the passenger-side window, fogging it up with excited breath. “Okay,” he whispered, “this is like if Hogwarts and Pinterest had a baby, and then that baby became a moody art student and moved to Scotland for the vibes.”</p><p>Agatha, behind the wheel, didn’t even blink. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard since you tried to order a flat white in a 600-year-old pub.”</p><p>“They had an espresso machine!” Billy protested, indignant. “That implies coffee! It’s false advertising!”</p><p>“They also had a guy playing the spoons,” Tommy added from the back seat. “You deserved to be cursed out.”</p><p>“I wasn’t cursed out, I was politely asked to reevaluate my modern sensibilities,” Billy said. “There’s a difference.”</p><p>Their apartment, naturally as it was chosen by Agatha, was tucked just off the Royal Mile, all weathered hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, and arched windows that looked out toward a sliver of Edinburgh Castle. The whole place smelled faintly of old books and lemon polish.</p><p>Billy dropped his bag at the door and spun slowly in place. “This place is so beautiful it makes me want to think about being a poet.”</p><p>Tommy collapsed onto the couch dramatically. “This place looks haunted. In a sexy way.”</p><p>Agatha raised a single eyebrow. “Please stop saying things like that Trent. It makes you sound like a creep with a fetish.”</p><p>Billy was already recording, capturing the interaction as he walked his followers and viewers through the apartment.</p><p>Caption: Get the kilts out - We’re now in Scotland!</p><p>- She looks so hot 🥵 she adopt me or destroy me or both<br/>- I swear this needs to be an actual bbc mini series<br/>- You guys! I am so jealous of you, the whole trip so far is vibes<br/>- #AuntieAgatha really does have 💰 💰💰💰 huh?</p><p>By late morning, they stood at the foot of Edinburgh Castle, wind trying to peel their jackets off, flags snapping above them in the wind.</p><p>Agatha handed them both a folded paper map, her cashmere scarf twisting violently in the wind.<br/>“Use these,” she said calmly, “or I will lose you both. And not by accident.”</p><p>Billy immediately rolled his into a telescope. “Aye aye, Captain.”</p><p>Tommy turned his into a paper plane. “Think I can launch this across to the tower?”</p><p>“Try it,” Agatha muttered, “and I’ll launch you into unpaid ghost tour work.”</p><p>The maps were gone within thirty seconds. Chaos ensued. The twins posed dramatically with cannons. They argued over the dates on war memorials. Tommy bought a plastic sword from the gift shop. Billy dod the same and live-streamed himself dramatically</p><p>Caption: Day 1 in Edinburgh. History lessons with Aunt Agatha</p><p>- WHY DID SHE LET THEM HAVE WEAPONS!?<br/>- AGATHA IN A TRENCH COAT STOPPPPPP<br/>- No seriously… make this a show. She’s the tired guardian, they’re the chaos twins<br/>- Is it weird that I want her to scold me about history?!?<br/>- Mother is mothering again - slay queen 👸</p><p>Agatha trailed behind them like a weary war general, arms crossed, coat flaring in the wind.</p><p>“I swear to God,” she muttered, watching Billy edge dangerously close to the castle wall for a shot, “if one of you dies for content, I will leave your body on the battlements.”</p><p>They hit Greyfriars Kirkyard by late afternoon, where shadows pooled between gravestones and the trees arched overhead - creating an atmosphere that was decidedly spooky.</p><p>Agatha, in her full glory, slipped seamlessly into historical guide mode.</p><p>“That’s the grave that inspired Tom Riddle. Yes, that Tom Riddle. And yes, there have been odd reports, cold spots, flickering lights, but most of that is just projected theatrics and teenage panic.”</p><p>Billy shivered and pulled his cloak tighter. “You say that like you were here.”</p><p>Tommy leaned in, eyes wide. “Is she a witch?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just smirked and pretended to not notice Billy posting a new tiktok video he’d taken walking around and listening to her.</p><p>Caption: “Haunted graveyard tour led by our possibly immortal aunt</p><p>- SHE’S IN HER ELEMENT I’M SCARED AND TURNED ON<br/>- Agatha gives Hermione x bellatrix and i’m so here for it<br/>- I want her to rail me on a gravestone 🪦</p><p>They ended the day on Victoria Street, where the shops were stacked like a wizard’s dream, harry potter merchandise displayed in all curved fronts and vibrant paint jobs.</p><p>Billy twirled on the cobbles, a new velvet cloak billowing. “You cannot tell me I’m not serving.”</p><p>Tommy waved a wand he’d just purchased and accidentally poked another passing tourist.</p><p>Agatha stood near a doorway, arms folded, sipping black coffee and looking like someone had Photoshopped a Jane Eyre character into the modern era.</p><p>“You know,” Billy said, sipping his butterbeer, “this place is literally fanfiction. Like, the good kind.”</p><p>Tommy nudged him. “So who’s the main character?”</p><p>Billy didn’t hesitate. “Me, obviously.”</p><p>Tommy rolled his eyes. “Wrong. You’re comic relief.”</p><p>Agatha took another slow sip of her coffee. “You’re both side characters.” Naturally, they were live again, this time on Tommys account.</p><p>Caption: Billy’s having a moment. Agatha says we’re NPCs.<br/>- NO BECAUSE SHE’S RIGHT. YOU ARE THE SIDE CHARACTERS<br/>- Agatha 100% has a backstory we’re not ready for<br/>- This woman raised them with pure sarcasm AND capitalism</p><p>The next morning dawned grey and soft-edged, like someone had turned down the contrast on the world.</p><p>They joined a walking tour run by a man named morti, who wore a crushed velvet cloak, top hat, and spoke only in dramatic proclamations about unquiet spirits and lingering souls of the damned.</p><p>“This is my dream job,” Billy whispered reverently. “Just wear weird stuff and talk about death.”</p><p>Agatha, bone-dry as ever, murmured, “You do already do that. Just with worse fashion sense.”</p><p>Tommy stuck close to her, arms interlinked as they wandered down narrow closes and alleyways on the ghost tour. He claimed it was to hear the guide better. But really, it was because he didn’t like the way the shadows moved.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. Just gave his arm a quiet squeeze now and then when the guide’s lantern flickered near a particularly creepy intersection.</p><p>Later that afternoon, they took on the climb to Arthur’s Seat.</p><p>Rain slicked the trail, and Billy slipped three times.<br/>“I’m not built for this type of nature!” he yelled the third time, sat in the mud like a tantruming toddler.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. “Get over it. Or perish.”</p><p>Tommy offered him a hand while laughing so hard he nearly joined him on the mud.</p><p>At the top, the city stretched below them, grey roofs, castle turrets, streaks of the distant sea. The clouds rolled like waves above them. For once, the twins were quiet, standing on either side of Agatha as the wind tugged at her curls.</p><p>Rain tapped the windows like a lullaby on their final night in the UK.</p><p>Billy emerged from the bathroom in full red tartan flannel pajamas, holding two other folded sets like trophies.</p><p>“Matching,” he declared. “Shut up. It’s a moment.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at him. “Are you trying to destroy me with aesthetics?”</p><p>“Emotionally? Yes.”</p><p>Tommy was already pulling his on. “It’s tradition. You can’t fight it.”</p><p>Agatha raised one eyebrow. “You realize this makes us look like we’ve been kidnapped by Pinterest, right?”</p><p>Billy handed her the final set with zero shame.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she emerged from her room in the full plaid ensemble. Damp curls loose from her shower, wine glass in hand, expression blank like a hostage. A very well-dressed, clean-smelling hostage.</p><p>Tommy let out a low whistle. “You look like a mom from a holiday commercial.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was deadpan. “Say that again and I will attend your track meets with face paint and go full manic sports mom mode.”</p><p>Tommy made a quick tiktok compilation which included a soft picture of the three of them, their snack trays that agatha had made harry potter themed and the cozy set up.</p><p>Caption: Matching tartan PJs and a Harry Potter marathon</p><p>- STOPPPPP THEY’RE MATCHING??? I’M UNWELL<br/>- No because my favourite family are also potter heads #Icanteven Pookies 🥰🥰🥰🥰<br/>- THEY LOOK LIKE A FAMILY IN A CHRISTMAS MOVIE. I’M SOBBING<br/>- Anyone who says she’s not soft. LIED<br/>- I’d sell my soul to be in this room ngl</p><p>They piled onto the couch, food containers scattered around them, fireplace crackling in the corner.</p><p>Billy nestled into the center of the couch, already half-asleep. Tommy took the floor with a nest of pillows. Agatha curled at one end, wine glass perched dangerously close to a container of saag paneer.</p><p>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban flickered on the TV.</p><p>Billy lasted twenty-five minutes before going full fetal against Agatha’s side, mouth slack, breathing soft.</p><p>Tommy kept muttering things like “No way I’m a Gryffindor,” until Agatha finally looked down and said, “You are one. Painfully loyal. No impulse control. Bad at plans.”</p><p>He looked up, stunned. “Really?”</p><p>“You think you’re edgy,” she said. “But you’re basically a golden retriever with anxiety.”</p><p>Tommy blinked. Then grinned. “You’re totally Slytherin though. Like… dark academic Slytherin. Secretly raises orphans in a castle. Has a tragic past. Probably owns a cursed ring.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of wine. “Incorrect. I inherited the cursed ring.”</p><p>The fire had dimmed to a warm glow by the time both boys were snoring in mismatched heaps of plaid and limbs.</p><p>Agatha slipped off the couch, barefoot and quiet, padding into the kitchen where her phone buzzed softly with an incoming FaceTime call.</p><p>Rio 💋💀</p><p>She accepted.</p><p>The screen lit up with Rio, lying in bed, hair a tousled mess, hoodie half-zipped, sleepy smile already forming.</p><p>“Hey,” she said.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, camera angled slightly so he could see her full flannel glory. “Hello from Plaidland.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened. “You’ve been assimilated.”</p><p>She panned the camera to show the sleeping boys and the crackling fire. “We’ve lost all dignity. Billy said this was a ‘moment.’ I didn’t have the energy to fight it.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You look good, though. Relaxed. Soft.”</p><p>Agatha made a face. “Don’t say soft. I’ll combust.”</p><p>“You are, though,” she said, teasing. “You’re drinking red wine in matching pajamas. That’s peak softness. You’re like… a Pinterest board come to life.”</p><p>“I am a menace in flannel,” she corrected.</p><p>“Oh, TikTok agrees,” Rio said, holding up her phone and reading. “Someone called you ‘BBC’s next powerful woman protagonist with tragic backstory and sharp eyeliner.’ Another said they ‘want to be scolded by you and railed at the cemetery.’”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “I am haunted by the internet.”</p><p>“You love it.”</p><p>“I barely tolerate it. And only because it occasionally gives me edits of myself set to Hozier.”</p><p>They talked quietly for a while, trip highlights, Mortimer the dramatic ghost guide, Tommy’s failed wand-lighting attempts. Rio watched her with soft eyes and small laughs, chin in hand like she was memorizing her.</p><p>Then her eyes started to droop. She yawned mid-sentence and blinked at the screen.</p><p>“Okay. I should go. I’ve got early one-on-one sessions tomorrow.” She paused. “Love y—bye. I mean bye. Night.”</p><p>She hung up before she could answer.</p><p>Agatha stared at the blank screen, eyebrow raised, lips twitching.</p><p>Outside, the rain kept falling in silver sheets.</p><p>Inside, the fire was dying down, and the boys’ breathing was slow and even.</p><p>She set the phone down on the counter and whispered to no one in particular, “Love you too.”</p>

<p>They landed in Tokyo on a warm, clear afternoon, humidity curling at their shirts the second they stepped out of the plane at Haneda airport. Billy bounced on his heels while Tommy kept muttering things like “This city runs on anime and energy drinks”, and Agatha… Agatha just pulled her sunglasses lower on her nose and muttered, “Try not to get detained at customs.”</p><p>The car ride into the city was quiet, the skyline slowly forming around them. The neon hadn’t even started buzzing yet and already Billy looked like he might burst.</p><p>“Stop vibrating in your seat,” Agatha said dryly from her seat as she checked the reservation confirmation on her phone.</p><p>“I’m not vibrating,” Billy replied, practically glowing. “I’m just excited.”</p><p>The Aman Tokyo was all black stone floors, soft wood walls, incense curling through the lobby like an invitation to relax and exhale all negativity.</p><p>Their suite gave them floor-to-ceiling views of the Imperial Palace gardens. Tommy immediately tested the depth of the soaking tub.</p><p>Billy flung himself onto a tatami mat like he was born for it.</p><p>“This is the most peaceful place I’ve ever been in,” he whispered as he went live, keen to show off the opulence and tranquility of the suite to his viewers.</p><p>Caption: Aunt Agatha paid for silence and views. We give her neither 💀💀💀</p><p>- THIS ROOM IS SEXY.<br/>- You are so lucky, do you want another sibling??<br/>- LOOK AT HER. SHE’S A VILLAIN IN A JAPANESE THRILLER.<br/>- IN LOVE. IN AWE. IN AGATHA. 🥵❤️💋🥰</p><p>Agatha walked past the open screens, hair pinned back with quiet precision, the camera caught her looking out of the window, one hand held underneath her chin after just getting off the phone to Rio, she was silently overthinking the fact that Rio never brought up the fact she almost said I love you on the last call.</p><p>- OMG SOFT MOTHER ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br/>- DO YOU THINK SHES THINKING ANOUT RIO?!?<br/>- Billy give her a damn hug!!!!!</p><p>They headed straight to Asakusa, weaving through lantern-lit streets and into Nakamise-dōri. The smell of grilled mochi and soy-glazed skewers filled the air. Tommy bought cotton candy shaped like a bear’s head and took a selfie with it. Billy tried three kinds of melonpan.</p><p>Agatha, in linen trousers and oversized sunglasses, eyed the chaos like an anthropologist.</p><p>“You know,” she murmured, eyeing a yakitori stall, “there was a time in my life I would have turned and gone home because this is just too loud.”</p><p>“And now?” Tommy asked.</p><p>She accepted a skewer of grilled chicken from a vendor and handed him one. “Now I put up with it for you two idiots.”</p><p>Billy posted a quick tiktok, zooming in on Tommy eating something suspicious. Agatha was to the side inspecting ceramic teacups with reverence.</p><p>- HER JACKET PROBABLY COST MORE THAN MY LIFE<br/>- That chicken looks delicious<br/>- SHE’S ACTUALLY CHILLING?? OUR MOTHER???</p><p>The next morning they hit teamLab Planets early.</p><p>Immersive projections turned rooms into dreamscapes. Billy filmed everything, voice hushed in awe. Tommy declared, “This is what I think dying feels like.”</p><p>Agatha walked barefoot through knee-deep water in a mirrored room, constellations blooming on the walls around her. In one room, the whole walls and ceiling were plants, blooms of vibrant pinks and oranges filling the space, Agatha was clearly enamoured, turning to the boys as she trailed her hands along the greenery, “Rio would absolutely love this.”</p><p>Billy caught the moment and posted it to tiktok.</p><p>Caption: I caught Aunt Agatha having an emotion. Archive this.</p><p>- HER LITTLE FACE ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br/>- IT’S GIVING SOFT. IT’S GIVING IN LOVE<br/>- CAN WE FRAME THIS??? ICONIC<br/>- The fact your surrounded by so much beauty and she can only think or Rio 🥰🥰🥰🥰</p><p>Later, they slipped into the quiet of Meiji Shrine. Tommy lit a candle for good grades. Billy scribbled a prayer card and Agatha basked in the peace and quiet, snapping photos of the forest encompassing the shrine to send to Rio, not for the first time wishing that she was there with them.</p><p>The second morning began with Agatha sipping black coffee in the lobby, impatiently waiting for the twins to make an appearance. This was the part of this leg of the trip she had been dreading and she was eager to just get it over with. It was 4am but the boys insisted they wanted to do this, despite the 5 hour travel time.</p><p>“You have exactly five minutes to get downstairs,” she’d texted in the group chat, ending the message with skulls and stabby knife emojis.</p><p>By the time the sleek black car pulled into Universal Studios Japan, Billy was practically vibrating out of his sneakers, and Tommy was already wearing a novelty Minion visor.</p><p>Agatha took one look at it, pulling a face of clear disgust. “You’re walking behind me Trent.”</p><p>Billy as usual, immediately went live as soon as he excited the car.</p><p>Caption: Entering Universal with the most reluctant chaperone (who paid for VIP #noqueues)</p><p>- AGATHA IN HER COOL AUNT ERA<br/>- TOMMY THAT HAT IS A HATE CRIME<br/>- I say this everytime you post but I am so goddamn jealous<br/>- Of course our queen paid for VIP #wouldnt expectanythingless</p><p>Billy spun the camera toward Agatha, who stood in wide-leg cream trousers, a black lightweight vest top and sunglasses, looking as though she was attending a museum tour, not a theme park.</p><p>“Are you… excited?” he asked.</p><p>“I’m bracing myself for a day of being utterly miserable,” she replied.</p><p>The second they stepped through the gates of Hogsmeade, Billy’s soul left his body. Steam curled above the Hogwarts Express; snow dusted rooftops; butterbeer foam clung to tourists’ lips.</p><p>Billy beelined to Ollivanders. Agatha lingered by the door, arms crossed, but her mouth betrayed her when Billy tried his first wand spell and accidentally made a set of quills flutter. Tommy was recording everything to post videos throughout the day.</p><p>He captured the moment billy yelled “expecto patronum” like a war cry while agatha subtly foxed his newly acquired ravenclaw scarf around his neck mid spell.</p><p>They did the flight of the hippogriff and then the Forbidden Journey ride twice, once because Billy begged, and again because Tommy claimed Agatha looked too composed in the picture the first time. The second run had her laughing, hair windblown, eyes brighter. Tommy caught it all on camera, posting the compiled video as they sat in the hogs head, having a butterbeer and deciding which part of the park to venture to next.</p><p>- THIS IS AUNT-Nephew GOALS<br/>- THE WAY SHE FIXED HIS SCARF?? I’M CRYING<br/>- This place looks so amazing<br/>- Tommy you must be having the most amazing time I swear</p><p>They made their way through amity village, stopping to ride Jaws and do the broadwalk games before moving into Jurassic park - Tommy’s choice.</p><p>He convinced Agatha to do the jurassic ride by telling her it was “mostly sightseeing.” The drop soaked her through.</p><p>“You’re walking home,” she told him, deadpan, as water dripped from her skin.</p><p>Tommy, unbothered and grinning, bought her a dinosaur plush as an apology. She carried it for exactly twelve seconds before shoving it into his backpack.</p><p>At Minion Park, Billy tried banana churros while Tommy bought popcorn in a Minion-shaped bucket. Agatha tasted the churro, chewed thoughtfully, and declared it tasted fake and declared “Artificial fruit flavours are a moral failing.”</p><p>That became the TikTok caption for the video of her eating it.</p><p>- I NEED A COOKBOOK OF HER INSULTS<br/>- ARTIFICIAL FLAVOUR IS A MORAL FAILING = MY NEW LIFE MOTTO<br/>- No because I love minions - this is like my two favourite things combined</p><p>As they approached midday, Billy had decided their “true Universal experience” required all 6 rollercoasters, multiple times. Agatha disagreed. Loudly.</p><p>“You’re forgetting one key factor,” she told them while in line for Hollywood Dream. “I have self-preservation instincts and I don’t like rides.”</p><p>Tommy grinned, posting another video of Agatha looking for once slightly unsure as they approached the next ride. “And we’re ignoring that right now.”</p><p>Caption:Dragging Aunt Agatha to the edge of death.</p><p>- IF SHE THROWS UP ON CAMERA I WILL PASS AWAY<br/>- My baby she just needs a lay down and a hug 🤗</p><p>Hollywood Dream had her gripping the safety bar, jaw set and eyes tightly closed.</p><p>The Flying Dinosaur had her muttering something about “filing a formal complaint.”</p><p>By the time they staggered off Space Fantasy: The Ride, her sunglasses were on, but her complexion was just shy of sage green.</p><p>Billy immediately went live.</p><p>- SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE’S SEEN THE AFTERLIFE<br/>- Protect this woman<br/>- WHO MADE HER DO THREE IN A ROW</p><p>Tommy waved at the chat, reading over Billys shoulder, grin wide as he waved and shoved a donkey king wild hotdog into his mouth.</p><p>“We did. You’re welcome, thank her for the VIP express passes.”</p><p>Half an hour later, while Agatha was sitting very still at a shaded table of jungle beat shakes while the boys rode mine cart madness, her phone buzzed.  Rio💋💀.</p><p>She answered without thinking.</p><p>“Sweetheart?” Rio’s voice was soft, a little concerned.<br/>Agatha exhaled, still slightly shaking. “They’ve tried to murder me. Multiple times. I’ve survived. Barely.”</p><p>“I saw the live,” Rio said, voice smiling. “You looked… adorable. And also like you needed to lie down for a week.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked despite herself. “You’re supposed to say I looked dignified.”</p><p>“You always look dignified,” Rio murmured. “Even when you’re about to throw up on a rollercoaster. I just, I wish I could kiss your perfect pouty face right now.”</p><p>There was a beat where neither spoke, just the sound of the park in the background.</p><p>“I miss you,” Agatha admitted, low enough that the next table didn’t catch it.</p><p>“I miss you too,” Rio said. “Drink some water, boss the boys around, and call me tonight, yeah?”</p><p>Agatha ended the call looking fractionally less green. Billy, of course, caught the tail end of it on camera as they approached to move on to a new section of their ark.</p><p>- WAS THAT RIO???<br/>- THE SOFT VOICE SHE USES OMG<br/>- SHE’S IN LOVE AND WE’RE WITNESSING IT</p><p>The rest of the afternoon had Agatha pacing herself, letting the boys run wild while she lingered in shaded spots, occasionally threatening to “leave them in Minion Park forever” if they didn’t text to keep her in the loop of where they were.</p><p>As the park lit up for the evening parade, they found themselves by the lagoon. Billy filmed Agatha standing still for once, the neon glinting off her sunglasses that were perched on her head. Tommy whispered something in her ear that made her roll her eyes—but she didn’t move away.</p><p>Caption: She pretends not to love it, but we know.</p><p>- SHE’S SOFT FOR THEM I CAN TELL<br/>- I’m waiting for them to get their own show</p><p>They stayed until closing, Agatha herding them toward the car as fireworks exploded overhead.</p><p>“This has been the best day” Billy said from the backseat, eyes drifting as he leant against an already asleep Tommy.</p><p>She smirked. “No arrests, minimal injuries, and no one threw up. That’s a win.”</p>

<p>Nights at the hotel became sacred. Room service. Tatami mats. Baths that felt like baptisms.</p><p>Billy edited TikToks with his legs up against the window. Tommy fell asleep on the floor more than once. Agatha read on the balcony, robe wrapped tightly, her hair braided in two braids, more often than not ending the night on facetime with Rio, Face soft in the Tokyo dusk.</p><p>“I think I could live here,” Billy said, half-asleep.</p><p>Agatha looked up. “Then you’d better find a way to make content into currency.”</p><p>“I already have,” he grinned. “ I just need to post you.”</p><p>Morning sunlight spilled into the Aman suite on their third full day, catching on the glass walls and scattering over the low black table where Agatha had set out breakfast from room service.</p><p>Miso soup, grilled fish, fluffy tamagoyaki. Billy was still narrating every bite for TikTok while Tommy was already halfway through his second helping, asking why the Japanese ate a full lunch menu for breakfast.</p><p>- WHY IS HER BREAKFAST LOOKING LIKE A PAINTING??<br/>- Agatha in Japan is my Roman Empire<br/>- Billy mweo luffs youuuuuu</p><p>Billy panned to Agatha—hair swept back, robe cinched tight, sipping green tea.</p><p>“Is today the one with the pandas?” Tommy asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied without looking up. “But you’re forbidden from attempting to smuggle one home.”</p><p>Ueno Park was an expanse of green and calm, broken only by the chatter of school groups and other tourists. The twins made a beeline for the zoo. Billy live-streamed the panda enclosure, whispering like a wildlife documentarian:</p><p>Caption: Agatha spotted in her natural habitat.</p><p>Camera swung to her, arms folded, sunglasses on but clearly cooing over the baby pandas.</p><p>- SHE’S MUMMING THE PANDA<br/>- God she’s hot when she’s soft<br/>- Why, why do you guys get such an amazing life!!!!</p><p>At Shinobazu Pond, Tommy convinced her into renting one of the swan pedal boats. Ten minutes later she was regretting it.</p><p>“This is not exercise. This is an elaborate way to get sunburned while floating in a bird-shaped coffin,” she said, steering hard to avoid another boat. Although this part wasn’t live streamed, Tommy did post a short video.</p><p>He’d used a split screen: Tommy laughing his head off and the other side Agatha glaring at them with her ‘murder face’ look.</p><p>- She’s done with them already<br/>- Why is this woman my hero?<br/>- Not mother in a swan boat without Daddy Rio 😭😭😭😭</p><p>They finished the day under the cherry trees, slurping matcha ice cream. Billy filmed her taking a bite.<br/>- SHE EATS MATCHA?!<br/>- AGATHA + GREEN = CANON<br/>- I did not have mother pegged as a matcha girly 🥰❤️🥰💋🥰❤️</p><p>Day four they arrived early enough at Disneyland Tokyo to watch the gates open. Billy had dressed in a pastel Mickey jumper, Tommy in an Avengers tee. Agatha… black silk shirt, tailored trousers, Birkenstocks and immaculate lipstick.</p><p>“You look like you’re here for a corporate hostile takeover,” Tommy observed.</p><p>They were swept along in the tide of families and pastel-hoodied teenagers as the park opened, Agatha had however secured VIP access and fast passes for everything.</p><p>The twins were practically vibrating with excitement. Agatha… was not.Tommy posted the moment they entered the park and Agathas exasperated expression as she looked around.</p><p>Caption: “Disneyland with the modern day maleficant</p><p>- I WOULD LET HER RUIN MY LIFE<br/>- Minnie is shaking<br/>- The fact that she’s back in a theme park two days later after nearly vomming shows how much she loves you both ❤️🤗<br/>- She’s not built for this kind of fun 😂😂😂</p><p>“You realise,” she told them as they queued for Space Mountain, “that I’m sacrificing spinal alignment for you.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “And we’re deeply grateful.”</p><p>Space Mountain was a disaster. The twins were screaming with delight while Agatha sat rigid, jaw clenched. The ride photo caught her mid-eye-roll, looking like she was tolerating a particularly bad board meeting.</p><p>“She’s green,” Billy announced the moment they stumbled off.</p><p>“I am fine,” she replied, which was exactly the sort of thing someone not fine would say.</p><p>Splash Mountain was next.</p><p>“I will get wet,” she observed as they climbed into the log. “I will hate it. And you will both owe me.”</p><p>By the final drop, her hair was damp and her blouse clung in ways the TikTok chat found… distracting.</p><p>The comments were flooded.</p><p>- THE WATER DID WHAT I DREAM OF 💀<br/>- This woman could glare the sun into submission<br/>- I’m sorry but maam, I can now see you lingerie (and im not sorry!) 🥵💋💦</p><p>Then came Big Thunder Mountain. The twins insisted on front row seats. Agatha didn’t argue, just adjusted her sunglasses and muttered something about “signing her own death warrant.”</p><p>The live-stream afterwards showed her sitting very still on a bench, face slightly ashen and lips pursed tight as though she was trying not to vomit.</p><p>Billy: “She’s pale.”</p><p>Tommy: “She’s very pale.”</p><p>Agatha: “You’re both being abandoned now.</p><p>- She’s actually unwell and STILL went on it for them??<br/>- That’s love<br/>- Yall better appreciate the lengths she goes to for you</p><p>They broke for snacks, mochi ice cream shaped like alien heads, Mickey churros, sparkling melon soda with jelly. Agatha sampled each with measured precision. The camera caught a tiny, traitorous smile at the churro.</p><p>The evening parade saw them parked on Main Street, twins on the curb, Agatha standing behind with a protective hand on each shoulder. Every time a float went past, Tommy tried to get her to wave. She refused… until a group of performers dressed as pirates yelled “Ahoy!” at her, and she gave the smallest of two-finger salutes.</p><p>The fireworks went up, Billy live-streamed, the chat exploded:</p><p>- SHE’S SMILING!!!”<br/>- Someone tag and tell Rio her wife is glowing.</p><p>Tommy leaned back to look up at her. “Worth the rollercoaster nausea?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, eyes on the sky. “…Just about.”</p><p>Their final days in Japan were much more cultured.</p><p>The shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto was blissfully quiet—until it wasn’t. Tommy had acquired some sort of snack box that crinkled louder than the train itself, and Billy was editing yesterday’s Disneyland clips with running commentary.</p><p>Agatha sat between them, legs crossed, immaculate as always, sipping green tea from a travel cup like she was single-handedly holding the carriage together.</p><p>“You know,” she said without looking up from the view, “I could have flown. Alone. In silence.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “And miss this?”</p><p>On their final afternoon, Agatha had reluctantly arranged a kimono fitting. Billy insisted on the full experience—kimono, obi, the works. Tommy was in before Agatha could object. She stood there, arms folded, watching them wrap layers of silk around her like she was being inducted into an ancient ritual.</p><p>“I look like I’m about to host a tea ceremony,” she muttered.</p><p>“You look amazing,” Billy said without hesitation.</p><p>When she finally stepped out, the shop attendant beamed, the twins stared, and Billy’s live-chat lost its collective mind.</p><p>- I AM ASCENDING<br/>- She looks like the protagonist of a period drama<br/>- Rio is going to SCREAM 😱</p><p>She adjusted her sleeve, entirely aware of the effect she was having. “If this ends up on some thirst account, I’ll sue.”</p><p>“Too late.” Billy responded as Tommy pulled faces at the influx of thirsty lesbians to the live.</p><p>Their final evening they dined at a traditional kaiseki restaurant. Courses arrived like art: sashimi shaped like petals, soup steamed in lacquered boxes. Tommy misidentified one dish; Billy blinked in astonishment; Agatha just… tasted each course with grace, nodding once in approval before instructing them on etiquette.</p><p>That night they returned to the quiet of their suite. Agatha sorted laundry, paying to have everything dry cleaned before their final leg. Tommy snapped pictures of room slippers embroidered in kanji. Billy reviewed footage.</p><p>They slipped into matching Kyoto robes—kimono-style, dark linen with embroidered crests and curled into cushions by a low table with yuzu tea.</p><p>Tommy rested his head on Agatha’s knee. Billy leaned in from the other side. In the window, lights twinkled like tiny candles.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was soft: “This is what I want. Quiet and you two.”</p><p>Billy said, “We love you.”</p><p>Tommy mumbled, “You’re calm and we’re chaos.”</p><p>Together they sat. Three silhouettes. Against the hush of the city.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the USA, Rio had the gym to herself, thunderous music pulsing from overhead speakers, sun cutting through the high windows, glinting off the row of kettlebells like trophies. She had her hair up, sweat already glistening at her temples, sleeves rolled tight around powerful shoulders.</p><p>She started the live casually, phone balanced at an angle.</p><p>Caption: Mobility, strength, and no distractions 💪🏽</p><p>For the first ten minutes, she was in the zone, resistance bands, planks, explaining core alignment and breathing techniques with her usual clipped, calm energy.</p><p>But TikTok? TikTok had other plans.</p><p>- IS THAT A RING?<br/>- LEFT. HAND. RING.<br/>- IS THAT… AGATHA’S RING??<br/>- HOLD ON HOLD ON IS SHE TAKEN-TAKEN??<br/>- ZOOM ZOOM ENHANCE.</p><p>Rio didn’t notice at first, until her chat box began flooding with ring emojis. She paused mid-lunge, frowned, looked at her phone, and sighed.</p><p>“Really?” she muttered, glancing down at her hand, the delicate, sharp-cut ring snug on her finger. She blushed despite herself. “It’s not that deep.”</p><p>TikTok exploded anyway.</p><p>- IT IS THAT DEEP.<br/>- I want love like this<br/>- LESBIANS REALLY DO NOT WAIT AROUND</p><p>Rio smirked and shook her head. “You’re all outta control.”</p><p>Then, a moment later, quieter: “She just gave me something to remember her by while she’s away.”<br/>She turned from the camera and bent to adjust her mat. “Not that I needed it. I remember her fine.”</p><p>Agatha’s call came through while Rio was meal prepping, she dropped the tongs the second she saw the name flash on her screen.</p><p>The screen blinked to life. Agatha’s face appeared.</p><p>There was noise in the background, the twins bickering about packing and the last thing to order from room service.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but looked back at Rio, tilting her head. “So. A little birdie tells me you wore something rather… shiny on TikTok today.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You saw that?”</p><p>“Billy sent me the clip,” Agatha said, smirking. “Apparently you’re married to me now. Congratulations. I didn’t even get to pick a dress.”</p><p>Rio flushed, grinning as she held up her hand to the screen. “It’s on the wrong finger.”</p><p>“For now,” Agatha corrected dryly.</p><p>For a moment, the twins’ chaos faded behind them. Rio stared into the screen, softened.</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice gentled. “I know. One more week.”</p><p>Then, back to sarcasm, with a bite of affection: “Try not to elope with a kettlebell before I get home.”</p><p>The tiktok comments continued to circulate into the night.</p><p>- THE RING. THE CONFESSION. I’M IN TEARS<br/>- She said remember me and left jewelry like a QUEEN<br/>- We all collectively want to be Rio right now.<br/>- Agatha’s in Japan like a brooding novel villain and Rio’s bench pressing in her name<br/>- WHERE’S THE WEDDING REGISTRY</p>

<p>Their final flight landed in Victoria Falls under the rising, honey-gold sun of Zimbabwe. The air smelled of sand dust and warm grass, warm even in the early morning.</p><p>The Anantara Stanley &amp; Livingstone Victoria Falls Boutique Hotel was pure holiday brochure  Africa, wide verandas, ceiling fans that turned lazily, and, from their suite, a view stretching over a private reserve where wildlife grazed in the distance.</p><p>Billy walked straight to the balcony, saw the view and immediately went live.</p><p>Caption: WE CAN SEE GIRAFFES FROM OUR ROOM??</p><p>- I’m sobbing this is insane<br/>- Aunt Agatha in safari chic WHEN<br/>- The way she just casually booked a whole view of the wilderness???<br/>- Genuine question, just how rich is rich auntie? 💰 🤑 💰</p><p>Agatha stepped into frame in a wide-brim hat and cream linen co-ord, sunglasses sliding down her nose. “We are here to relax and appreciate the natural world, not to taunt  tiktok with shaky phone footage.”</p><p>Tommy turned with a grin,  “Too late, we’re going full Attenborough documentary this week.”</p><p>The sun had barely fully rose in the sky when Agatha led the twins outside towards an open-top Land Cruiser. The air was cool, scented faintly with earth. Their guide, Tendai, stood by in a khaki jacket and a smile that widened noticeably when Agatha approached.</p><p>“Good morning, madam,” he said warmly, helping her up into the front passenger seat by her hand. “You’ve picked the perfect morning to arrive with us. We’ll see plenty today, I promise.”</p><p>From the back, Tommy mouthed to Billy, ‘He’s in love.’</p><p>Tendai handed out soft blankets and spoke in a low, lilting voice about the morning’s route.</p><p>Agatha sat between the twins, one hand resting on the bar in front of her, squashed in the middle of the two but clearly not minding. She looked peaceful. The most peaceful of any of their trip. The city stripped away, eyes focused on the horizon, nothing but nature and wildlife surrounding them.</p><p>They drove out into the reserve, wheels crunching over the dirt track.</p><p>Their first animal sighting was a herd of impala darting through the scrub, their sleek bodies almost golden in the rising sun.</p><p>“Graceful little things,” Agatha murmured, eyes sparkling as she watched them.</p><p>Tendai chuckled. “Like yourself, perhaps?”</p><p>From her side, Tommy nearly choked.</p><p>Next came a tower of giraffes. One, curious, stepped closer to the vehicle. Billy caught Agatha looking up at it with something dangerously close to awe.</p><p>As they ate their pre packed breakfast croissants, Billy edited a few clips of their morning along with Tendais witty one liners towards Agatha, sharing it to his page.</p><p>Caption: Breakfast with Giraffes 🦒</p><p>- The guide is lowkey flirting??<br/>- Protect this energy at all costs<br/>- Sir. Shes married. Or close enough. Thankyou<br/>- Oh wow, this is gorgeous</p><p>Mid-morning brought elephants, seven of them, including two calves that trailed their mothers.</p><p>The smaller calf wobbled over a patch of grass and plopped down on its haunches.</p><p>“Oh, I want to keep him,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Tendai laughed. “You’d need quite the garden.”</p><p>“Look at the baby!” Billy whispered into his phone, live streaming the whole experience on tiktok.</p><p>Agatha smiled, a real true smile, without looking at the camera, blue eyes locked on the now rolling calf.</p><p>“Nature doesn’t need your commentary Billy.”</p><p>- SHE’S SO HAPPY I’M CRYING<br/>- She’s glowing. Literally glowing<br/>- You all look amazing, cant believe you’ve been there a few hours and are already seeing things like this!!!!</p><p>Later came a pride of lions sprawled in the grass.</p><p>Tommy whispered, “Do you think we could—”</p><p>“No Toby,” Agatha cut in. “Whatever you were about to suggest, the answer is no.”</p><p>Their drive continued under the blazing afternoon sun, the heat rising - they spotted wildebeest, zebra, and a lone jackal before looping back toward the lodge.</p><p>Agatha slipped Tendai a folded wad of cash as she stepped down. His grin was immediate, and possibly permanent.</p><p>Evening light turned the savanna copper and rose gold. They’d settled for dinner at a lookout where they could see the Zambezi River glinting in the distance. Agatha sat with a glass of chilled white wine, the boys sipping root beer.</p><p>Billy filmed her against the sunset. “This is the desktop wallpaper content people live for.”</p><p>She turned, smirking. “And yet, you’re all looking at me instead of the scenery.”</p><p>Caption: Sunset ft Aunt Agatha</p><p>- She’s like the main character in Out of Africa but with better eyeliner<br/>- Even the wildlife is probably in love with her<br/>- I’ve followed your whole trip so far but this is the best bit so far ☀️</p><p>At dawn the follwing morning, after a breakfast platter of porridge and fresh fruits, they followed Tendai out to the jeep for another day of safari.</p><p>The boys were in shorts and t-shirts and agatha in a khaki sundress and her hair in plaits that Tommy kept tugging playfully on the end of, laughing as Agatha batted him away.</p><p>They caught sight of a herd of buffalo, zebra, and briefly a black rhino moving through tall grass.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, completely absorbed, her hand unconsciously resting on Tommy’s arm when the rhino lifted its head and stared straight at them.</p><p>By now, the boys were in full Attenborough mode, narrating every sighting dramatically.</p><p>Billy panned the camera to a Kudu antelope, “Here, we have the elusive snack of the predators, sometimes called lunch.”</p><p>Agatha shushed him, “If you scare it off, you’re walking back.”</p><p>Tendai steered them towards a shaded area where another group of elephants were dust-bathing, coating themselves in fine red earth. The boys were mesmerised. Agatha was filming, discreetly, with her own phone - wanting to send the video to Rio.</p><p>Later, under an amber sky, they came upon a pride of lions, three females lounging, one male half-asleep in the shade. One of the lionesses lifted her head, eyes fixed on the vehicle.</p><p>Tendai dropped his voice. “She’s assessing you.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “I do tend to have that effect.”</p><p>They stopped at a ridge that over looked the reserve, giraffes frames against the setting sun, it was Tommy who live streamed.</p><p>- THIS IS CINEMATIC<br/>- The guides is totally crushing<br/>- Lion king 3 🦁<br/>- Imagine your aunt being this cool AND being your legal guardian???”</p><p>That night, they sat out on the balcony with blankets, watching the reserve under starlight.</p><p>Somewhere far off, a lion roared.</p><p>Tommy leaned back in his chair. “Best trip ever.”</p><p>“Agreed. Even if she made us wear hats.”</p><p>“Sunburn is not a souvenir boys, ever.”</p><p>The following day, Tendai was determined to get them as close as possible to the Big Five.</p><p>They started with Cape buffalo, moving in a dense herd. Then came a rhino, a rare sight, potentially the same rhino seen the previous day, but possibly a different one. The vehicle went still as the animal turned its head toward them, ears flicking. Tommy’s hand brushed Agatha’s knee, just a small, unconscious reach for reassurance that he was safe in the truck.</p><p>A little later, they spotted leopard tracks but no leopard, which Agatha insisted was “probably for the best.” They did, however, find more elephants, one bull crossing right in front of them.</p><p>Tendai, grinning, whispered to Agatha, “He’s showing off for you.”</p><p>“Men do try,” she replied dryly. “Always without success.”</p><p>By the next day, they were all in the rhythm of safari mornings, early coffee on the balcony, Agatha half-awake but still somehow looking immaculate, the twins bounding around with binoculars like hyperactive meerkats.</p><p>Today’s plan was slower. Tendai pulled up at nine instead of dawn, beaming as usual.</p><p>“Today,” he said, “we walk the falls.”</p><p>The drive into Victoria Falls National Park was short. The air was warm but softened by the constant mist. The rumble of water was ever-present, a deep, living heartbeat in the earth. The closer they got, the more the spray coated their faces.</p><p>Billy, live-streaming from the path, angled the camera toward Agatha, hair curling slightly in the damp, sunglasses on, linen shirt immaculate despite the weather.</p><p>Caption: Aunt Agatha vs. The Spray</p><p>- She’s like an expensive cat 🐈‍⬛ tolerating water but not loving it<br/>- Why is she somehow glowing??<br/>- Imagine her as your travel buddy, oh my god.</p><p>They stopped at the first viewpoint and saw it, a rainbow arcing through the mist, so vivid it almost looked painted. Behind them, the water cascaded in roaring sheets, throwing up clouds that caught the sun.</p><p>Tommy grinned. “Okay… that’s actually unreal.”</p><p>Agatha leaned on the railing, eyes narrowed like she was trying to memorise it.</p><p>“You realise this is as close as nature gets to being tacky,” she said. “Waterfalls, rainbows around the gays, dramatic lighting, absolutely unsubtle.”</p><p>Tendai, lingering nearby, smiled. “The rainbow is good luck.”</p><p>Billy immediately panned the camera to him. “For who? Us? Or just her?”</p><p>Tendai’s grin didn’t falter. “Perhaps for me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Oh, for God’s sake.”</p><p>Tommy shouted over the noise: “This is INSANE!”</p><p>“This is the real bucket list moment.” Billy responded.</p><p>“And neither of you are to fall in. That’s not a joke.”</p><p>They walked further along the trail, each new viewpoint offering another explosion of colour, sometimes double rainbows. The boys kept darting ahead, then running back, narrating facts from the park guide.</p><p>At one quiet bend, they stood in a patch of sunlight with the mist turning the air almost silver.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back, closed her eyes, and for a rare moment said nothing at all. Billy caught it on camera.</p><p>Caption: Soft Auntie Moment</p><p>- She’s… peaceful??<br/>- That’s my Roman Empire<br/>- Bookmarking this for rainy days</p><p>The final stop was the Knife-Edge Bridge, mist curling around their ankles, the sound of the falls thundering beneath. The twins posed with exaggerated smiles, and Agatha stood behind them, one hand on each shoulder but smile sincere. Billy posted it instantly, just the photo, no video, no noise.</p><p>Caption: Some people really do win the auntie lottery</p><p>- I’m not crying YOU’RE crying<br/>- She may be your aunt but you are deffo her sons ❤️❤️❤️❤️</p><p>That night, back on their balcony, they listened to the night, frogs, crickets, something larger moving in the dark.</p><p>Tommy leaned forward. “Do you think you’ll miss it here?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “Yes. But we’ve had an amazing time and I’m taking you home safe. That’s the main job.”</p>

<p>Tendai was practically buzzing when he picked them up the next morning.</p><p>“Today,” he told them, “you are meeting the smallest residents of our reserve.”</p><p>The private wildlife rescue sat just outside the park boundaries, tucked behind a grove of mopane trees. It wasn’t open to the general public. Agatha had booked the visit weeks ago after one phone call with the director, and judging by the reception they got, her donation had been… substantial.</p><p>A young woman in khaki shorts and a sunhat greeted them with an enthusiastic, “Welcome! We’re so glad you’re here - our babies have been waiting for you.”</p><p>The first enclosure held an elephant calf barely up to Agatha’s shoulder, its enormous ears flapping slowly as it reached out with a curious trunk.</p><p>Billy froze mid-step, whispering, “Oh my god, I’m not emotionally ready.”</p><p>The calf wrapped its trunk gently around Agatha’s wrist. She didn’t pull away, just tilted her head, smiling faintly.</p><p>“Well, aren’t you cute.”</p><p>Caption: Agatha Meets Baby Elephant</p><p>- The elephant looks obsessed with her???<br/>- OMG that is so cute!!!!!<br/>- Add ‘elephant whisperer’ to her resume<br/>- My shayla ❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰</p><p>The handler explained the calf had been found alone after its mother died of natural causes. Agatha listened closely, asking about feeding schedules, vet care, and how they monitored stress. She ended up holding the bottle for the calf, standing there in tailored linen trousers, diamond studs glinting, an absurdly expensive watch catching the sun, and the TikTok chat went feral.</p><p>- This woman is pure power AND pure softness.<br/>- I would commit crimes to be that elephant right now<br/>- Animals know when someones special 🥰❤️</p><p>Next, they were led to a shaded enclosure where a group of lion cubs tumbled over each other in the grass.</p><p>Tommy’s voice went high. “I’m sorry, are we allowed to TOUCH them?”</p><p>“Yes,” the guide said, “but they are very cheeky.”</p><p>The twins crouched down immediately, one cub flopping into Billy’s lap while another nipped at Tommy’s shoelaces. Agatha knelt, slowly, like she’d done this before and let the smallest one climb into her arms. The cub promptly tried to gnaw on her bracelet.</p><p>“That is twenty-two carat,” she told it, “and not on the menu.”</p><p>Tommy went live, showing his followers and viewers the cute cubs.</p><p>Caption: Lion Cub Chaos</p><p>- She’s holding a literal lion and still sassing.<br/>- Aunt Agatha vs. Baby Simba—place your bets<br/>- I love how soft Tommy looks<br/>- The twins honestly have the most amazing life</p><p>They also saw a baby giraffe that had been injured after getting tangled in a fence. Now mostly healed, it leaned its long neck down toward them with curious eyes. Agatha’s face softened again, something quiet and unguarded that Billy caught instantly on camera.</p><p>“You’re so soft,” she murmured, stroking its cheek.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tommy was in the aviary with a handler, letting bright green parrots perch on his shoulders.</p><p>Billy posted a compilation video of the sanctuary and their interactions.</p><p>Caption: Tommy becomes a Disney princess</p><p>- SOMEONE GIVE HIM A MOVIE<br/>- No because he does look like a prince<br/>- Two disney princes and our redeemed villain queen 👸</p><p>In the afternoon, they were invited to actually help at the rescue, mixing feed, cleaning enclosures, carrying buckets of water.</p><p>Agatha, who had spent the entire trip elegant and dressed like she’d stepped off the cover of a magazine, rolled up her sleeves and got to work.</p><p>Mud splashed her shirt; she didn’t care.</p><p>“Mark your calendars,” Tommy whispered into Billy’s live stream. “Aunt Agatha is voluntarily getting dirty.”</p><p>- I AM NOT OKAY<br/>- She’s glowing. Someone summon Rio<br/>- Someone needs to buy this woman a puppy 🐶</p><p>By the time they left, the rescue staff were almost as smitten with her as the animals. Tendai laughed as they climbed into the Range Rover.</p><p>“I think,” he said, “if you stayed another week, we would all refuse to let you leave.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, glancing out the window. “The feelings mutual.”</p><p>The morning after their visit to the wildlife rescue, Tendai arrived with his usual warm smile and pressed white shirt.</p><p>“Today,” he announced as they climbed into the Range Rover, “we leave the animals to their morning naps and discover the soul of our city.”</p><p>They began with the small but beautiful Victoria Falls Cultural Centre, where local artisans displayed wood carvings, beadwork, and hand-painted textiles. Billy filmed every stall, narrating like a professional travel host.</p><p>“This is art, and I’m broke,” he declared, holding up a carved elephant.</p><p>“You’re not broke,” Agatha corrected smoothly, “you’re just financially underdeveloped.”</p><p>He pretended not to notice when Agatha bought it for him.</p><p>Tommy however haggled for a beaded bracelet, and to everyone’s surprise, did well. “I think I’m a natural,” he told Tendai.</p><p>“You are,” Tendai laughed, “but don’t tell the sellers, they’ll charge you double next time.”</p><p>Tendai drove them out toward an old colonial railway station and told stories about the building of the bridge between Zimbabwe and Zambia, the history of trade routes, and how the falls had been a sacred site for generations before European explorers arrived.</p><p>Agatha was her sharp, attentive self, asking detailed questions about treaties, community displacement, and how traditions had been preserved. Tommy got bored halfway through and wandered toward the old steam locomotive, with Billy trailing after him for photos.</p><p>Caption:Twin Chaos while Agathas distracted</p><p>- THEY’RE ABOUT TO FALL OFF THAT TRAIN<br/>- Agatha in the background is giving documentary energy<br/>- Can someone put her in a history series already???<br/>- Maam, come and get your wayward sons 😂</p><p>That night, Tendai took them to his cousin’s small open-air restaurant. Lanterns hung from tree branches, the air smelled of grilled meat and maize meal. They ate sadza with peanut butter spinach, grilled bream, and nyama stew.</p><p>Tommy tried everything with reckless confidence; Billy hesitated at first, then went back for seconds of the spinach.</p><p>“See,” Agatha said dryly, “if you’re brave, sometimes you win.”</p><p>Tommy and Billy live streamed some of the meal and then themselves learning to dance with some of Tendais family.</p><p>Caption: Dinner With Locals</p><p>- THE VIBES ARE SO PURE<br/>- They look so relaxed here<br/>- Is there anything you guys dont get to do</p><p>At one point, Tendai mentioned, almost offhand, that he had three children, all bright, but school fees were getting harder each year.</p><p>Agatha didn’t comment then. She just listened, nodded, and asked questions about their ages and ambitions, smiling as he pointed to the three children currently dancing around Billy and Tommy.</p><p>The next morning, while the boys were packing, she made a call from the hotel terrace, arranging for a trust to cover all three children’s education through to university. No fanfare. No announcement. Just a quick call and done.</p><p>When Tendai came to collect them for their final drive to the airport, he found an envelope on the passenger seat. Inside: documentation of the scholarship. He read it silently, then looked up at her with tears threatening.</p><p>“You didn’t have to do this Miss Agatha.”</p><p>“I wanted to,” she interrupted, voice even. “Consider it an investment. Your children will do more for this country than any tourist could.”</p><p>Tendai stood beside her outside the airport. “We will miss you here.”</p><p>“And I will miss this,” she said quietly. “You’ve given us more than I could ever repay.”</p><p>The three of them stumbled through arrivals sun-tanned, travel-wrinkled, but still riding the high of Zimbabwe.</p><p>Billy was already live on TikTok, one hand on the suitcase handle, the other holding his phone at an angle that made Tommy groan.</p><p>“Hey goth court, so we’re officially back on US soil, the countdown to school has now officially begun!”</p><p>- WHERE’S RIO??<br/>- I bet she’s waiting with flowers<br/>- Agatha in jeans??? UNREAL 🥵🔥🥵</p><p>Rio was there, leaning against Agatha’s car, black leather jacket thrown over a white tee, hair loose from the wind. The moment she spotted them, her face softened, and she straightened, scanning through the crowd until her eyes locked on Agatha.</p><p>Billy swung the camera toward her. “There’s our chauffeur slash our aunt’s girlfriend.”</p><p>Tommy groaned. “Don’t embarrass her before we get to the car.”</p><p>“She signed up for this chaos,” Billy said smugly.</p><p>Agatha reached her first, the corners of her mouth tipping up into something private and warm as Rio picked her up effortlessly, planting tiny kisses all over her face whilst spinning her round, finally setting her on her feet and kissing her soundly.</p><p>Tommy flung his bag into the boot. “Gross guys. Please stop. Rio, we saw lions. And elephants. And Ashley nearly got trampled by a warthog.”</p><p>“That did not happen Tariq,” Agatha cut in sharply.</p><p>“Fine,” Tommy said, grinning, “she walked near a warthog and gave it a look that would’ve trampled anyone else.”</p><p>Billy slid into the passenger seat, still filming.</p><p>“Chat says you two need to recreate that kiss again. Their thirsty.”</p><p>“Chat can keep dreaming,” Agatha muttered, but her hand brushed Rio’s as she passed her the keys.</p><p>Rio handled the highway with one hand on the wheel, the other occasionally grabbing Agatha’s thigh, thumb rubbing instinctive touches that made the boys exchange looks in the back.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, “you going to tell me what you bought me in three different countries?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Patience. Or I’ll give your gifts to Billy.”</p><p>- They’re so married already 💍<br/>- Tommy in the corner looking so DONE<br/>- Agatha pretending she’s not in love is my favourite running bit</p><p>At Home they unloaded the suitcases. The boys vanished upstairs within minutes, arguing over who got to use the main shower with the multiple heads. Agatha lingered by the open boot with Rio.</p><p>“Three weeks I’ve been without you,” Rio said softly. “Felt like longer.”</p><p>“You survived without me.”</p><p>“Barely,” Rio replied, leaning in just enough for her forehead to rest against Agatha’s temple. “Welcome home sweetheart.”</p><p>Inside, the sound of Billy yelling at Tommy broke the moment but not before Agatha caught Rio’s hand and pulled her into a bruising kiss, like she’d been waiting the entire trip to do just that.</p><p>The house finally fell still as the sky turned dark.</p><p>Billy’s laughter had faded behind his closed bedroom door, Tommy’s playlist thumped low through a wall, and at last, Agatha could breathe in the kind of silence she hadn’t had for three weeks. The suitcase lay unopened at the foot of her bed, the silk scarf still knotted around the handle. She hadn’t the energy to deal with any of it.</p><p>She’d slipped into a silk robe, familiar, domestic, and padded barefoot into the kitchen, pouring herself a glass of wine. When she turned, Rio was leaning in the doorway, hair loose, smelling of Agathas soap.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha said, lifting her glass.</p><p>“Can’t help it.” Rio’s voice was low, wrecked with something deeper than exhaustion. “You’re home. Finally.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to make a quip, something sharp enough to break the weight of it. But then Rio crossed the tiles, took the glass gently from her hand, set it on the counter, and kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t hungry. Not at first. It was reverent. A return. The kind of kiss that said, I counted the days, and I’m not letting you out of my sight again.</p><p>Agatha’s hands, usually so controlled, slid into Rio’s hair and gripped tight. A muffled sound escaped against Rio’s mouth, half laugh, half gasp and Rio deepened it, slow but unrelenting, until Agatha let herself soften, melt, give in.</p><p>They made it upstairs somehow, the kind of blurred, stumbling urgency that would leave clothes abandoned on the landing if the boys weren’t home. Agatha fell back onto her sheets with a soft groan, propped on her elbows, hair a mess from Rio’s hands.</p><p>“You look wrecked,” Rio murmured, hovering above her.</p><p>“Charming,” Agatha said, but the quip was breathless, undone at the edges.</p><p>Rio kissed her again, then moved lower, over the line of her jaw, down the pale column of her throat. Each press was deliberate, unhurried. Worshipful.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, chest rising unevenly as Rio’s hands slid across her, coaxing her out of the stiffness that had settled in her muscles with all of the travelling.</p><p>“You don’t have to” Agatha began, but her words broke into silence when Rio bit gently at her collarbone.</p><p>“I want to,” Rio whispered against her skin. “You deserve to be touched like you’re everything. Because you are.”</p><p>Rio took her time. She traced every line of Agatha’s body as if learning it anew after absence, pausing to kiss the curve of her hip, the soft underside of her arm, the hollow just beneath her ribs. Each touch was a vow, each sigh from Agatha another unraveling thread of her restraint.</p><p>For once, Agatha didn’t hold back. She arched, she gasped, she let herself be adored, and Rio whispered against her, over and over, “Mine. Your mine.”</p><p>When Agatha finally came apart beneath her, Rio held her through it, hands steady, kisses grounding, voice breaking on soft encouragements until Agatha went pliant in her arms.</p><p>The sheets tangled around them, moonlight slipping through the curtains, both of them flushed and breathless. Agatha lay half on Rio’s chest, her hair wild, her breathing slowly settling.</p><p>Rio brushed the damp curls from her forehead and spoke into the quiet.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Agatha froze. Just for a second. Then she tilted her head up, ice blue eyes searching Rio’s face.</p><p>“You do?” she asked, voice smaller than she meant it to be.</p><p>“I’ve never been more sure of anything.”</p><p>The silence stretched, filled with heartbeat and breath. Finally, Agatha exhaled, pressed a trembling kiss to Rio’s shoulder, her jaw and finally to her lips, pulling back to whisper, “I love you too.”</p><p>They fell asleep like that, wrapped around one another, the house at last quiet, the chaos of travel and TikTok behind them. Bare skin against bare skin.</p>

<p>Agatha’s office was still lit long after sunset, a stack of briefs on her desk, the phone pressed between her ear and shoulder. Her voice was sharp but fraying at the edges.</p><p>“Yes, but if the counter-offer comes from monico  by morning and I’m not available, this entire case goes sideways,” she snapped, then pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p>On her ipad, an incoming message from Billy lit up:</p><p>Billy 🖤:What’s for dinner?? Tommy’s threatening toast again</p><p>Also the fridge is sad. Drinks and condiments - no propper food 😢</p><p>Agatha typed a reply whilst firing legal questions in rapid fire french: I’m stuck at work teen, might need you to order takeout - there’s $50 under the vase in the hall</p><p>Seconds later, another text from Billy pinged on screen.</p><p>Billy 🖤: Auntie. Your leaving cash in random hidden spots. That’s vibes. 😂😂😂</p><p>She groaned, tipping her head back. She couldn’t leave the office on time, not tonight, not with clients in three time zones with language barriers and a filing deadline looming. Frustration prickled at the edges of her composure.</p><p>She was mid-spiral, having ended the call and now following up on email, when her phone buzzed again. This time an incoming call, Rio 💋💀.</p><p>“Hey my love.”</p><p>“Hi sweetheart. You sound stressed,” Rio said, gentle.</p><p>“I’m chained to this case. And the twins…”Agatha’s tone cracked on a yawn. “They’re sixteen, they can survive without me making dinner, but I hate, God, I hate feeling like I’m failing them.”</p><p>“Babe,” Rio interrupted softly, “breathe. I’ll go over. I’ll cook them something real. They won’t even notice you’re late back.”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>“I want to. Let me show up for them. And for you.”</p><p>By the time Rio got to Agatha’s place, the twins were in full stupid teenager mode. Billy had his phone propped on the counter, narrating to TikTok about the desolate state of the fridge.</p><p>Caption: We’ve been abandoned by Aunt Agatha. Dinner = depression</p><p>- CALL CHILD SERVICES (jk jk don’t)<br/>- WHERE’S QUEEN AGATHA???<br/>- You’ve just got back from a three week holiday, of course the fridge is empty 🤣🤣<br/>- #Firstworldproblems</p><p>“Oi,” Rio called from the doorway, arms full of grocery bags. “End the pity party. Reinforcements have arrived.”</p><p>Billy swung the camera around and screamed, “IT’S RIO.”</p><p>The comments went feral instantly.</p><p>- THEY SUMMONED STEP-MUM ENERGY<br/>- RIO TO THE RESCUE.<br/>- Agatha better put a ring on that</p><p>Tommy looked up from here he was laid on the sofa, smirking. “Oh, this is gonna be good.”</p><p>Rio unpacked the bags onto the counter, pasta, fresh vegetables, herbs, real cheese. Billy hovered, filming everything like a nature documentary.</p><p>“Observe,” he whispered, “the rare domesticity of a fitness instructor, out of her natural habitat, cooking in our kitchen.”</p><p>Rio threw a tea towel at his head. “Stop filming, you’re chopping onions.”</p><p>Billy cackled, but obeyed, setting the phone aside to actually help.</p><p>It became strangely easy, Billy stirring sauce under Rio’s guidance, Tommy setting the table with dramatic flair, Rio humming softly while she grated parmesan. The house smelled like garlic and basil by the time they sat down, bowls steaming.</p><p>Billy twirled his first forkful and froze. “Wait. This is… actually good.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Rio arched a brow.</p><p>“I mean… you can cook again,” Billy deadpanned, before cracking into a grin.</p><p>Tommy snorted. “Careful, Billy or we’ll be stuck with her.”</p><p>“Adoption paperwork’s pending,” Billy said, with the kind of dry wit that could have only come from being around Agatha.</p><p>After dinner, the three of them sprawled across the sofa, too full to move. Tommy scrolled through memes, occasionally showing his phone to Rio.</p><p>Rio was fully relaxed in the twins company, despite Agatha not been home, she was leaned back in the middle of the sofa with her feet on the coffee table. A nature documentary played on the flatscreen.</p><p>Billy studied her, phone forgotten for once. “You make her happy,” he said suddenly.</p><p>Rio turned, caught off guard. “What?”</p><p>“Aunt Agatha. She’s… different since you showed up. Happier. Just… like she finally has someone looking after her instead of the other way around.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio couldn’t speak. Then she swallowed hard. “She looks after you both so fiercely. It’s the least I can do.”</p><p>Billy gave a small nod, serious for once. “Don’t hurt her.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promised, voice steady.</p><p>Tommy piped up from the corner, without looking up: “I already warned her, we’ll destroy her and ruin her life if she does.”</p><p>Billy nodded seriously, “Forever.”</p><p>Rio laughed so hard she nearly cried after reassuring them that their threats were noted but not needed.</p><p>Of course, as the evening wore on, Billy couldn’t resist one last live.</p><p>Caption: She cooks. She jokes. She survived us on her own 🖤❤️🖤</p><p>- WE APPROVE<br/>- SOMEONE WIFE HER ALREADY<br/>- Rio &gt;&gt;&gt; every step-parent on this app 🥰</p><p>Rio ducked out of frame, embarrassed, but Tommy leaned in, grinning, “Breaking news: Aunt Agatha’s not the only responsible adult in this house.”</p><p>Billy added, “But she’s still the queen, she just has her prince now.”</p><p>The comments agreed, spiraling into edits of Agatha, Rio, and the twins like some chaotic found family fandom.</p><p>Later that Night, when Agatha finally came home past midnight, drained and feeling guilty, she found the kitchen spotless, leftovers neatly in the fridge, and the boys already asleep in their beds.</p><p>Rio was waiting in the living room with a glass of wine and a tired but proud smile, wearing Agathas silk short pajamas.</p><p>“They ate, they laughed, we didn’t burn the place down,” Rio reported softly. “Mission accomplished.”</p><p>Agatha set her bag down, crossed the room, and pressed her forehead to Rio’s shoulder with a sigh. “I don’t deserve you.”</p><p>“Yes, you do,” Rio murmured, kissing the top of her head. “But lucky for you, I’m staying anyway. I love you.”</p><p>“I love you, so much.”</p><p>As usual, Agatha was the first one awake.</p><p>Sunlight threaded pale gold through the curtains, spilling across Rio’s sleeping form. Her hair was a dark tumble against the pillow, her lips parted just slightly, the muscles in her shoulders relaxed, one arm thrown over Agathas waist.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just… watched.</p><p>She was slowly getting used to mornings like this, mornings that didn’t start with emails, frantic phone calls, or the twins raiding the kitchen.</p><p>Mornings where she could simply take in the sight of someone she loved, breathing steadily beside her.</p><p>She slipped out of bed quietly, padding barefoot into the kitchen.</p><p>She poached eggs, toasted sourdough, sliced avocado with the precision of a cross-examiner, and brewed coffee strong enough to wake a corpse.</p><p>She balanced the tray, plates, mugs, a small vase with a freshly picked bundle of lupins from the garden, and carried it upstairs.</p><p>Rio stirred as Agatha set the tray down. no.</p><p>“You made me breakfast in bed,” Rio mumbled, blinking blearily.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. “I wanted to thank-you properly, for looking after the boys last night.”</p><p>Rio sat up fast, grinning, hair a chaotic halo. “You didn’t have to. This is… wow.” She reached for Agatha’s hand before even reaching for the food.</p><p>“No one’s ever done this for me.”</p><p>Agatha slid onto the bed beside her, feigning nonchalance even as her throat tightened.</p><p>“No ones stepped in and supported me with the twins either.”</p><p>Rio leaned over and kissed her, slow, warm, grateful. The eggs went cold while they stayed wrapped in each other.</p><p>By mid-morning, the house had woken in full teenage force. Billy’s footsteps thundered down the hall, followed by Tommy’s muffled complaints.</p><p>They cornered Agatha in the kitchen as she was rinsing mugs.</p><p>Billy got straight to the point. “We like her.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Who?”</p><p>“Don’t play dumb, Andrea,” Tommy said, leaning against the counter. “Rio. She’s… good.”</p><p>Billy folded his arms, studying her like he was giving sworn testimony. “She makes you less scary. In a good way.”<br/>Agatha let out a low laugh. “Charming.”</p><p>“No, we mean it,” Tommy pressed. “She actually listens. She made dinner. She roasted us but like, lovingly. Like you do. And…” He hesitated, surprising even himself. “We wouldn’t mind if she was here more. Like, a lot more.”</p><p>Agatha stilled, dish towel in hand.</p><p>Billy glanced at Tommy, then back at her. “We’re saying… if you wanted her to move in, we wouldn’t hate it.”</p><p>The words landed heavier than they expected. Agatha’s instinct was to deflect with sarcasm, but her throat tightened. For once, she couldn’t. Instead, she pressed the towel against the counter, grounding herself.</p><p>“You two don’t make declarations like that lightly,” she said quietly.</p><p>Tommy shrugged. “We’re sixteen. We’re not idiots. We know when someone’s real.”</p><p>Billy softened, rare vulnerability creeping through. “She’s real, Auntie. And she’s good for you.”</p><p>Agatha carried their words with her as she climbed the stairs. She found Rio still curled in bed, reading through emails on her phone. She looked up, smiling instantly.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha sat down on the edge of the bed, brushing a strand of hair from Rio’s cheek. “The twins ambushed me.”</p><p>“Oh god. What did I do wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha murmured. “They… said they wouldn’t mind if you moved in.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “They said that?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a softness breaking through her usual poise. “Apparently, you’ve passed the initiation.”</p><p>Rio laughed, then sobered, reaching for her hand. “And what about you? What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, pressing her lips to Rio’s temple, lingering there. “I want you. Here. With us. But I didn’t think…”</p><p>“You didn’t think I’d want the chaos?” Rio finished gently.</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was muffled against her skin. “Exactly.”</p><p>“Newsflash,” Rio whispered, drawing her closer, “I’ve never wanted anything more.”</p><p>They sank back against the pillows, limbs tangling. It wasn’t frantic or hurried, just steady, grounding, tender. Agatha traced lazy patterns across Rio’s skin as though memorising the shape of her, while Rio pressed kisses along her jaw and neck, every touch reverent.</p><p>The sunlight pooled across them, the world outside hushed. For the first time in years, Agatha didn’t feel like she was holding everything together alone. She felt… chosen.</p><p>And when Rio murmured “mine” against her lips, Agatha realised she finally believed it.</p><p>The following days, Rio’s flat was a mess. Not filthy, but chaotic in a way that reflected her life, sneakers by the door, training gear draped over chairs, half-finished sketches pinned to the wall alongside pictures from nights out.</p><p>Boxes had started to pile in corners, and her suitcase lay open on the bed waiting to be filled.</p><p>Alice, Rio’s roommate and best friend, popped her head out of the kitchen as Rio opened the door. “Ohhh, so this is the famous Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha, leaning in the doorway with her arms crossed, gave her a slow once-over. “And you must be the roommate.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Guilty.”</p><p>Rio groaned, lugging a box into the living room. “Please don’t gang up on me.”</p><p>Alice ignored her, sweeping forward to shake Agatha’s hand. “I’ve been dying to meet you. She talks about you constantly. You’re basically the only thing she talks about.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Really - what does she say, good things I hope.”</p><p>Rios face flushed with embarrassment, internally begging Alice to not answer.</p><p>Alice cackled,  “Ohhh, so let me tell you what she said when she first kissed you…..”</p><p>For the next half-hour, Alice teased Rio mercilessly as all three sorted through boxes. “You’re bringing this ugly lamp? Why? Agatha’s house is sophisticated, not IKEA clearance suitable.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, plucking the lamp cord from Rio’s hands. “She’s right. This stays here.”</p><p>Rio groaned, burying her face in her hands. “This is bullying.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, voice warm but wicked, “This is quality control.”</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the house, Billy had sniffed opportunity. He went live the second he heard the words packing.</p><p>Billy was sprawled on the sofa with Tommy in the background eating cereal, “So. Aunt Agatha is literally at Rio’s flat, sorting her boxes. Which means… yep. This is happening.”</p><p>Chat, as usual, went feral</p><p>- THE DOMESTIC ERA???<br/>- RIO HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TWINS.<br/>- WHO GETS THE MASTER BEDROOM—HER OR AUNT A?”</p><p>Tommy leaned into frame, spoon dangling from his mouht. “They’re gross. We caught them making out over our breakfast this morning.”</p><p>“Yeah. But it’s cute and now we have two adults to cook for us so Rio can stay.”</p><p>- BILLY FULLY SHIPS AGATHARIO AND IM HERE FOR IT ❤️❤️❤️</p><p>Later, as Agatha folded Rio’s jackets with military precision, Alice leaned against the bedpost, whispering conspiratorially. “She snores, you know.”</p><p>Agatha deadpanned, “I know. Like a warthog.”</p><p>Rio threw a pillow at both of them. “This is treason!”</p><p>Alice cackled harder. “Wait until I tell you about the time she cried at a dog food commercial.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes gleamed with delight. “Oh, I’m absolutely going to need that story in full detail.”</p><p>Rio, mortified, muttered, “I’m never forgiving either of you.”</p><p>But beneath the teasing, there was a hum of intimacy. Every time Agatha folded a shirt, she smoothed it like it mattered. Every time Rio passed her a box, their fingers lingered just a second too long. Alice clocked it with a knowing smile but said nothing.</p><p>At one point, when Alice ducked out to grab takeaway, Agatha paused mid-fold and looked at Rio. “Are you sure about this? Leaving your space, your life here… it’s not a small thing.”</p><p>Rio leaned against her, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re my home now. That’s all that matters.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her hands tightening on the fabric she held. She didn’t trust her voice, so she kissed Rio instead, all lips and tongue, trying to show without words how much this meant to her too.</p>

<p>The house buzzed with a strange kind of energy the morning Rio officially started moving her things in.</p><p>Agatha had taken the day off work, which in itself was monumental. She wore jeans and a linen shirt, still crisp, still immaculate, but with her hair twisted up into something less deliberate than usual. She supervised, naturally, while Rio lugged boxes up the steps two at a time.</p><p>Billy and Tommy had stationed themselves at the window like paparazzi. Tommy leaned against the sill, recording everything on his phone.</p><p>“Breaking news! Rio is spotted carrying suspicious boxes into the house. Speculation: she lives here now.”</p><p>Billy added commentary for TikTok, voice low and dramatic, “Some say true love is eternal. Some say it’s putting your sneakers next to Aunt Agatha’s Louboutins.”</p><p>Caption: Rio moving in = three becomes four?</p><p>- SHE’S REALLY DOING IT???<br/>- AUNT A LETTING SOMEONE INTO HER PRISTINE HOUSE?? UNREAL.<br/>- WAIT IS THAT A CORVETTE???</p><p>Tommy zoomed in on the driveway where Rio’s sage Corvette gleamed. He whispered dramatically, “And there it is… what a beauty.”</p><p>Agatha emerged from the garage, dust streaking her jeans (the twins caught the evidence gleefully). “Your car will fit. Try not to scratch it against my car, or I’ll make you park on the drive forever.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh echoed. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>Billy cut in from the background. “No, she’s serious about stuff like that. She billed me once for breaking a bowl.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Correction, I billed you for breaking three bowls and two mugs, and trying to cover it up by rearranging the cupboard so it fell out when I opened it.”</p><p>Tommy was wheezing laughter, gleefully reminiscing on a time when Billy was the one in trouble.</p><p>- PETITION TO SEE THE CORVETTE CONTENT<br/>- I can feel the car bros descending on this live 😂😂😂</p><p>Rio, in mock solemnity, bowed at the waist. “I promise to respect the sanctity of the garage.”</p><p>By afternoon, Agatha had another reveal. She led Rio up the narrow staircase above the garage into what had been an empty annex used for storage. Now it gleamed with polished wood floors, full-length mirrors, and state-of-the-art gym equipment already installed.</p><p>Rio stopped short. “You… you did this for me?”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, feigning casual. “This is your job. I have the home office. The gym downtown is fine, but here you’ll have privacy. And I’d rather not have dumbbells dropped on my floors inside the house.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly, taking it all in, the punching bag, the racks, even a little fridge stocked with sports drinks. Her voice went soft. “This is insane. No one’s ever done something like this for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s sarcasm faltered for once. “It’s hardly a grand gesture. Just a gym annex.”</p><p>“Just a gym annex,” Rio repeated, smiling crookedly. “It’s everything.” She reached out and pulled Agatha close, pressing a kiss to her jaw, then her mouth, while the twins groaned from the doorway.</p><p>“Disgusting! We can’t escape it at all now!”</p><p>Billy, still filming chimed in, “Day one of Rio moving in, Aunt Agatha just casually built her a private gym. Nothing to see here.”</p><p>- AGATHA IS A PROVIDER<br/>- Imagine someone doing THIS for you.<br/>- I’m crying she loves her sm<br/>- No because her love language is for sure acts of service 😭😭😭😭</p><p>The rest of the day was commemorated on tiktok via both Billy and Tommys accounts, both uploading a series of chaotic short videos.</p><p>Billy posted Rio’s sneakers lined up next to Agatha’s polished heels in her closet, new balance mixed with laboutins.</p><p>Tommy posted a video captioned: Opposites attract, which showed Agatha tutting over Rio’s T-shirt drawer, refolding them into perfect rectangles while muttering, “Fold properly your not a teenage boy.”</p><p>Billy narrated another video like David Attenborough. “Here we see Aunt Agatha in her natural habitat, taming Rio’s gym wear collection.” Agatha simply pursed her lips and carried on sorting them into sets rather than the mess of mixed items and colours they were before.</p><p>- SHE BUILT HER A GYM + SPACE IN THE  WALK IN?? MARRIAGE SOON??<br/>-  Lets not forget this all happened because of the twins. Twins - I love you 🥰<br/>- The cutest family I swear</p><p>As evening approached, the house felt subtly different. Rio’s jackets hung on the hooks in the hall closet. Her guitar leaned against the wall in the living room. Pictures were added to the shelves. The barely used sunroom now had a plethora of Rios plants filling the space.</p><p>She sat cross-legged on the rug while the twins showed her old TikToks she hadn’t seen, Billy excitedly showing her which famous people had commented, Tommy adding sarcastic remarks from beside her.</p><p>Agatha watched from the sofa, glass of wine in hand. She wasn’t the type to gush, but there was a softness in her gaze that the twins both noticed.</p><p>Tommy smirked at her. “You’re looking disgustingly happy tonight Alice.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Hush Timmy. You say that as if it’s a crime.”</p><p>“We’re just saying… its nice”</p><p>Agatha left them to it, moving to the kitchen to finish dinner.</p><p>The house smelled divine with her cooking, the smells luring the living rooms habitants to the kitchen. Garlic, paprika, and warm cream curled through the air.</p><p>Agatha was in her element, hair pinned up and sleeves rolled back as she stood at the oven, searing chicken thighs in one pan, chorizo sizzling in another, while a tray of garlic-dusted potatoes roasted to golden perfection in the oven.</p><p>Billy snook to the doorframe and went live from a safe distance.</p><p>“TikTok, behold. Aunt Agatha is cooking again, it smells live an actual restaurant in here.”</p><p>Caption: Lawyer, TikTok queen, now chef goddess.</p><p>- GARLIC + CREAM + CHORIZO??? I’m faint<br/>- SHE CAN COOK TOO?? THIS IS UNFAIR.<br/>- RIO DON’T LET HER GO. WIFE HER UP 💍<br/>- No because pookie really said let me show you I’m wife material 🤣🤣🤣</p><p>Agatha sprinkled parsley over the salad with practiced precision. “You can stop filming me like I’m some kind of kitchen spectacle.”</p><p>Billy moved the camera closer, “Oh but you are. Like Nigella, but scarier.”</p><p>They gathered around the dining table, Rio at Agatha’s side, Billy and Tommy opposite, plates piled high. The crispy potatoes shattered under forks, the creamy chorizo sauce clung to chicken, and the salad was crisp.</p><p>Billy groaned happily. “This is delicious.”</p><p>Tommy nodded through a mouthful of potato. “I think I love you more than Rio does.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Please don’t. My heart can only handle one lovesick person at a time.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her, cheeks heating, but Agatha reached beneath the table and pressed her fingers lightly against Rio’s knee. It grounded her, anchored her in the warmth of this table, this chaos, this family.</p><p>Billy continued filming his plate like it was a Michelin star event.</p><p>Tommy played up to the camera, dramatically announcing, “And for this dinner, we thank our sovereign, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio was caught on camera, smiling brightly, moving so one arm was draped around the back of Agathas chair, fingers playing with the ends of her hair as she ate with her other hand.</p><p>- Rios such a dad OMFG, the arm 🥵🔥🥵<br/>- When I tell you I would kill to be at this table<br/>- Nah, Rios the GOAT pulling Agatha and uhauling into their house 😭🤣❤️</p><p>After dinner, Billy tugged Rio into the sunroom, where her plants were now displayed throughout the room, including new additions Agatha had purchased, creating an indoor floral paradise. Fiddle-leaf figs, orchids, a row of tiny succulents lined up like jurors.</p><p>Billy crouched, tracing a leaf with reverence. “These are beautiful. You actually know how to take care of them?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It’s a hobby. My TikTok followers keep asking me to do a plant haul.”</p><p>Rio showed him how to test soil moisture with a finger, how to trim dead leaves, how not to overwater succulents. Billy filmed snippets, her voice calm and steady over the background chaos.</p><p>Caption: Rio X Plant Mom - From the gym to the jungle 🌿</p><p>- RIO TEACHING BILLY ABOUT PLANTS IS SO PURE 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤<br/>- PEAK STEP-MOM VIBES OMG<br/>- Look how proud Agatha is in the background, don’t think we don’t see you queen 👸</p><p>Agatha was proud. She leaned in the doorway, wine glass in hand, watching Rio kneeling among green leaves with her nephew, explaining things with so much patience. Her lips curved into a smile that was small, private, and entirely unguarded.</p><p>Later, when the twins were tucked away upstairs, Agatha and Rio finally escaped to their room. The thought made Rio beam, their room, hers and Agathas.</p><p>The house was quiet except for the occasional creak of the floorboards.</p><p>Rio stood at the edge of the bed, overwhelmed. “I don’t even have words, Agatha. Tonight… your cooking, the boys, the plants, the gym you’ve made me…” she broke off, laughter bubbling in her throat. “I feel like I don’t deserve any of this.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, fingers brushing along her jaw. “Nonsense. You belong here. With us. With me.”</p><p>When they finally came together, it wasn’t just about heat. Rio felt worshipped, cherished, each touch slow and deliberate, Agatha’s hands mapping her with certainty. The world beyond the bedroom disappeared, leaving only the quiet rhythm of breath and the ache of being loved so wholly.</p><p>By morning, when sunlight spilled across tangled sheets, Rio lay against Agatha’s chest, her heart a steady drum. She whispered, soft but certain, “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand threaded into her hair. “Good. Because I intend to keep you, I love you too.”</p>

<p>That weekend, when the excitement of a new member of the household had finally calmed, Agatha broached something she’d been putting off.</p><p>“School starts in a few weeks. We’ll pop out today for supplies.”</p><p>Rio should’ve known the moment Agatha slipped into the drivers seat wearing sunglasses and a shark like smile how the day would progress.</p><p>Tommy bounced in, already live. Billy slid in after him, mouthing to camera, pray for her bank account.<br/>Agatha snapped her fingers once. “Phones away until we get to the stores, deal?”</p><p>“Deal,” the twins chimed.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, lacing their fingers together without a thought. “You’re really excited about school supplies, huh?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth tilted. “I’m excited about making sure September isn’t chaos.”</p><p>Rio whispered back, smiling, “I love you when you’re like this.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around hers for a second, the other fiddling with the bluetooth connection to link to Spotify, the speakers now playing Hozier, Agatha and Billy singing along much to Rios delight.</p><p>The twins practically vibrated out of their seats as Agatha pulled the G Wagon into a parking spot, already arguing about what store to hit first.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha announced, tone sharp but amused. “We conquer sneakers first. Then new electronics. Then whatever absurdities you insist on wearing for the first term.”</p><p>“Absurdities?” Tommy scoffed. “It’s called personal style.”</p><p>“Yours is definitely a personal choice thats for sure,” Agatha muttered, marching ahead.</p><p>Rio covered a laugh, already sensing this day was going to be chaos.</p><p>They hit the Nike store first, where Tommy immediately grabbed three pairs of Jordans. Billy held up limited-edition Dunks in a radioactive colour, trying to pout and pull of the puppydog look to Agatha.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, eyeing the sneakers with disgust.</p><p>“Aunt Agatha, these are rare,” Billy whined.</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said, plucking them from his hand. “They’re hideous.”</p><p>“Please, they’re iconic,” Billy groaned.</p><p>She raised a brow. “Their ugly, do you want to be made fun off. By me?”</p><p>Billy dramatically dropped to his knees, not caring for the looks that he received, having a tendency to be dramatic (which he fully blamed Agatha for).</p><p>“My favourite aunt has forsaken me.”</p><p>Tommy was whisper narrating on tiktok live, bouncing the feed between Billy now clinging to Agathas pant leg with a pout, Agathas bemused expression and Rios horrified look.</p><p>“And here, we see Annie, crushing dreams of a poor orphaned gay child, who’s only wish is to stand out in a crowd with fuck ugly shoes.”</p><p>“Oi, dollar in the jar when we get home you little shit.” Agatha rolled her eyes as she corrected him, kicking her leg to shake Billy off and pointing him in the direction if some more muted but still rare dunks.</p><p>What the live didn’t miss was her then quietly telling the sales assistant, “I’ll take them, can you wrap them please, thank you.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait, you’re buying them for him?”</p><p>“You’ll all thank me for it later,” Agatha replied dryly. “Billy is very hood at sulking, and I don’t enjoy disappointing him.”</p><p>- I love how now embarrassed Agatha is 😂<br/>- Auntie rich rich 🤣🔥❤️<br/>- Not the twins flexing on us all<br/>- Rio looks overwhelmed</p><p>Billy shrieked when he realised at the register, “AUNT AGATHA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!”</p><p>The boys ended up with more than two pairs of sneakers each and matching tracksuits. Agatha tapped her card without even glancing at the cost.</p><p>At the Apple Store, the twins made a beeline for the newest MacBooks.</p><p>“Don’t you both already have laptops?” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>Billy groaned. “Yes, but we used them all last year, there battered from our backpacks. Do you want the other kids to make fun of us?”</p><p>“Nope. Thats my job” she replied. “It’s my favorite hobby.”</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the cashier was bagging two MacBook pros, two iPads, and AirPods for each the boys. Agatha’s card tapped with the ease of someone ordering takeout.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened at the total, but before she could speak, Agatha placed a slim white bag into her hands.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Agatha, what is this?”</p><p>“Noise-cancelling headphones,” Agatha said breezily, not meeting her eyes. “You mentioned your gym speakers echo and give you a headache.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks burned. “You didn’t have to…”</p><p>“Oh hush. I wanted to.”</p><p>- HEADPHONES FOR RIO???<br/>- Education = MacBooks plural 😭<br/>- That’s not rich auntie money, that’s CEO money<br/>- Rio realising she’s dating a millionaire in 4K</p><p>The next stop was a Gucci boutique. The twins tried on belts, sneakers, and a ridiculous bomber jacket that made Tommy look like a K-pop idol.</p><p>Billy filmed Agatha leaning against the mirrored wall, sighing as though she’d rather be anywhere else.</p><p>“April, do you want to try anything?” Tommy asked, smirking.</p><p>She deadpanned, “Yes. Patience.”</p><p>But when Rio admired a deep olive leather bag in passing, touching it gently, then putting it back with a quiet sigh, Agatha made a note. Minutes later, as the twins argued over belts, a discreet sales assistant approached Rio with the bag, carefully wrapped.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No, I didn’t…”</p><p>“Compliments of your… party,” the woman said with a knowing smile, nodding toward Agatha who was holding each twin by the end of their hair, steering them towards plain jumpers.</p><p>Rio turned, cheeks hot, moving over to the woman she loved who was casually scrolling through emails like she wasn’t dropping thousands and thousands of dollars on back to school clothes.</p><p>Rio, quietly, to Agatha: “Do you always… spend like this?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, expression unreadable, internally trying to work out if Rio was bothered by it in a negative way. “Yes. It’s investment. I enjoy it. Watching them light up like that? Worth every cent.”</p><p>Rio’s chest warmed and twisted. It wasn’t just the money. It was how Agatha spent it - decisively, generously, without hesitation but in excess.</p><p>Instead of saying anything she kissed Agathas cheek and laced their hands together, watching the boys carefully selecting pieces for the upcoming school year.</p><p>- SHE BUYS THEM DESIGNER FOR SCHOOL???<br/>- Girl, did you see the trip they’ve just been on how are you even surprised<br/>- I’d cry if my aunt bought me Gucci sneakers.<br/>- Agatha standing there like she’s in Vogue.<br/>- Wife behaviour 💍<br/>- Agatha buying her girlfriend Gucci casually = goals.</p><p>They took a break from shooping for lunch at Nobu, the twins ordered sushi rolls by pointing at random things on the menu.</p><p>The twins devoured the rolls like they’d never eaten before. Tommy poked at sashimi suspiciously, then declared it “actually fire.”</p><p>Billy filmed Agatha pouring soy sauce like she was conducting a science experiment.</p><p>Rio leaned close, whispering into Agathas ear, “This isn’t… a normal mall lunch.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched as she leaned to whisper back. “I’m wearing YSL, my arse is not sitting on a greasy food mall chair…but if you ask nicely, I might sit on your face later.”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her miso soup, furiously blushing at the arousal that flooded her system at her girlfriends teasing.</p><p>Tommy broke the moment by using his chopsticks like drumsticks until Agatha swatted his wrist.<br/>Billy caught Rio mid-laugh, soft and glowing, posting a small compilation of their lunch to his timtok.</p><p>The chat ate it up as usual.</p><p>- RIO LOOKS SO SOFT AROUND HER<br/>- Agatha casually dropping $$$ on sushi like it’s Taco Bell.<br/>- Can they adopt me?</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was spent shopping for even more clothes, then stationary and backpacks.</p><p>By the time they returned to the home, the boot was full of branded bags. Billy dumped them across the living room floor and started another live, showcasing the multitude of bag filling the space.</p><p>Billy held the camera on Agatha, who had sat on the arm of the sofa, scrolling through her phone. “Thoughts, Auntie?”</p><p>She glanced up. “You’ll look like delinquents, but well-dressed delinquents.”</p><p>- SHE’S ICONIC<br/>- RIO LOOKS LIKE SHE’S HAVING A CLASS CRISIS.<br/>- AGATHA CAN SPONSOR MY EDUCATION PLEASE. 🙏<br/>- She’s so casually rich it hurts<br/>- WHEN IS THE HAUL??<br/>- wanna see those Gucci sneakers 👁️ 👁️<br/>- Billy we live for your chaos pls do a haul</p><p>Rio sat quietly on the sofa, overwhelmed, fingers brushing the Gucci bag in her lap. She had money, really good money - her sessions were hundreds of dollars an hour. She was secure, independent. But this? This was another level.</p><p>The twins thundered upstairs, dragging their bags of loot. Billy called over his shoulder, “Unboxing live coming in ten minutes, Rio you can help!”</p><p>The house quieted as their footsteps faded. The only sounds left was low hum of the fridge. Rio sat on the sofa, still slightly dazed, hands curled around a glass of water she hadn’t touched.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, brow raised. “You’re staring at me weird.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I… just wasn’t expecting today.”</p><p>Agatha settled beside her, “What part shocked you? The Gucci belts? The twin hysteria? Or my stunning ability to wield a credit card?”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked, but her eyes stayed serious. “All of it. I knew you were successful, Agatha, of course I did, but… today wasn’t just spoiling them. That was…” She hesitated. “That was another level.”</p><p>Agatha turned to face her fully,  gaze steady “You’re trying to find the polite way to say obscenely wealthy.”</p><p>Rio flushed. “I just… it’s overwhelming. For me. And for you, it seems effortless.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her temple then leaned back, exhaling slowly. “It is effortless. Now. But it wasn’t always.”</p><p>Rio tilted toward her, curiosity sparking.</p><p>Agatha’s voice went low, quiet but precise. “When the twins came to me, I promised myself they’d want for nothing. Not like I did when I was a kid. No wondering if dinner would appear. No second-guessing their worth because they didn’t have what other kids had. If that means they start the school year looking like Gucci mannequins, so be it. Everything I have Rio, I worked bloody hard for.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. Her chest tightened. “You didn’t grow up with money?”</p><p>“God no. My mother hated me. She hated me so much she wanted the world to hate me too. She dressed me in clothes she knew kids would mock. Shoes with holes in them, jumpers two sizes too small, charity shop coats that reeked. I wasn’t just poor, Rio. I was marked.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. “Agatha…”</p><p>“She did it on purpose,” Agatha continued, her tone stripped of sarcasm, clinical almost, as if laying out evidence in court. “She wanted me to feel humiliation. To believe I was less than everyone else. And it worked, for a long time. Kids laughed and made fun of me. Teachers pitied me. And every night, I went home to a woman who found satisfaction in my shame.”</p><p>Her hands were steady, but her eyes shimmered as she ducked her chin, hiding her face against Rios shoulder. “So no, I didn’t come from money. I came from nothing.”</p><p>Rio’s throat ached. She pushed away from the sofa to kneel in front of Agatha, her hands reaching for hers. “You never deserved that. Not one second of it.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at their joined hands, her composure finally cracking. “I swore to myself that if I ever had the power, the means, I’d never feel that small again. And anyone I was responsible for? They’d never know that kind of shame. Billy and Tommy will never wonder if their shoes will hold out the winter. They’ll never flinch at the lunch queue because they cant afford to eat. They’ll never feel lesser.”</p><p>Her voice caught on the last word, and Rio squeezed her hands, firm and warm. “You’ve given them the opposite. You’ve given them security. And love, even if you don’t parade it around. They know, Agatha. They know. And now I do too.”</p><p>Agatha searched her face, softening under the intensity of Rio’s gaze. “You don’t think it’s… excessive?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, fierce. “It’s love. Dressed in Gucci, maybe. But love all the same. And it’s yours. You earned it. You built it. No one can take that away from you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled into something not quite a smile but something more vulnerable. She leaned forward, resting her forehead lightly against Rio’s.</p><p>“I’ve never told anyone that before,” she whispered. “I don’t… share that part of my life.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her heart aching. “Then I’ll hold it carefully. Always. I love you so much.”</p><p>For a moment, she didn’t answer just let Rio’s hand rest against hers, thumb brushing once, twice. Then she leaned in, kissed Rio slow, deliberate, before pulling back, “ I love you.”</p><p>Above them, a crash echoed followed by Tommy yelling, “BILLY, DON’T TRY ON MY SHOES!” followed by the hysterical laughter of said twin.</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh, brushing her thumb over Rio’s hand. “Trust them to ruin the moment.”</p><p>Rio laughed too, tears burning. “It just proves you’ve done it. They’re happy. They’re safe. And you,” She kissed Agatha’s lips again. “You’re extraordinary.”</p><p>For once, Agatha didn’t argue. She just pulled her up onto the sofa, cuddling into her side.</p><p>“AUNT AGATHAAAAAA, RIO, CAN WE GO LIVE WITH YOU NOW?”</p><p>“NO, BILLY, I WANT TO DO THE INTRO!”</p><p>“YOU ALWAYS DO THE INTRO, LET ME!”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, tilted her head back against the sofa, and muttered, “Dear God, why didn’t I send them to boarding school?”</p><p>Rio snorted, nudging her. “You love them.”</p><p>“I tolerate them,” Agatha joked dryly.</p><p>Moments later, Tommy and Billy thundered down the stairs. Billy already had his phone propped on a tripod.</p><p>Caption: Gucci? Prada? Aunt Agatha went feral 🤑</p><p>Billy struck a dramatic pose in front of Agatha and Rio, ignoring them laughing at him (not with him). “Welcome back goth court, to the greatest haul of the century. Today…”</p><p>Tommy shoved him. “OUR haul. Don’t hog the fame.”</p><p>Billy smacked his hand away. “Fine. OUR haul, sponsored by the greatest human alive…”</p><p>He swung the camera to Agatha, still cuddled into Rios side, one arm and a leg thrown over the other woman.</p><p>Agatha, unbothered drawled, “Focus on your overpriced merchandise, not us.”</p><p>- QUEEN AUNT AGATHA 🤑🤑🤑<br/>- WAIT, POOKIES LOOK SO FUCKING IN LOVE!!!!<br/>- BACKGROUND COUPLE CONTENT 😭😭😭<br/>- THE SOFTEST QUEEN. I’M CRYING.<br/>- RIO IS BLUSHINGGGG<br/>- I seriously want a love like this 🥰❤️🖤🥰❤️🖤</p><p>Tommy leaned into the frame, eyes wide, whispering theatrically, “They’re in loooooove.”</p><p>Billy shoved him. “Shut up. This is a haul live not a lesbian romcom one!”</p><p>Tommy pulled out a pair of Gucci sneakers. “These are mine. Not Billy’s. Mine.”</p><p>Billy yanked them back, voice shrill. “Stop lying to the internet, those ones are mine!”</p><p>- SIBLING FIGHT IN 3…2…1…<br/>- Imagine having beef over GUCCI</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio was trying not to laugh. She looked down and caught Agatha’s eye, mouthing, they’re impossible.</p><p>Agatha’s smirk softened into something private, tender. She reached up, brushed her fingers along Rio’s wrist where it rest on her shoulder, almost absently, like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>When the live finally ended, after thirty chaotic minutes of sneakers, overpriced sweaters, and Tommy modeling sunglasses upside down, the twins collapsed in giggles on the sofa beside them.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, cheeks still pink from laughing, voice low.</p><p>“They’re ridiculous.”</p><p>Agatha leaned even closer, practically melded into Rio to whisper in the low timber she knew got Rio going. “Leave them to it, their going to bed soon and I remember something about sitting on your face.”</p><p>Rio laughed loudly, causing both boys to look at her like she was crazy. She could not wait for them to go to bed.</p>

<p>Agatha was out the door before dawn, suit sharp, her heels clicking down the hallway before sunrise. Away to court, an international case, high stakes, the kind of day that meant she wouldn’t be home until late.</p><p>Rio finished her morning personal training sessions at the gym and wandered back to home just before lunch. She had half a mind to collapse into the annex gym Agatha had built for her, but instead found Billy and Tommy slouched across the sofa, controllers in hand, a half-empty cereal box on the coffee table.</p><p>Tommy glanced up first, grin spreading. “She’s actually come home even though Ashleys not here. You owe me five bucks, Billy.”</p><p>Billy groaned. “Fine. But Rio don’t disappear. We need you.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow, dropping her duffel on the floor.</p><p>“Need me? For what? Training?”</p><p>Billy shook his head with dramatic flair. “Baking.”</p><p>Tommy chimed in, shoving the controller aside. “Andis in court all day. We want to surprise her with dessert. But we don’t actually know how to bake. You look like you can at least turn the oven on.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Hey, I can do more than turn the oven on. But fine. Let’s bake.”</p><p>Within minutes, the kitchen was a disaster. Flour dusted the marble counters like fresh snow. Tommy cracked eggs one handed like he was in a cooking show, except one landed on the floor and he was repeatedly fishing shell out of the mix.</p><p>Billy insisted on filming everything.</p><p>Caption: Attempting to bake… pray for us (Agatha don’t watch)</p><p>The camera panned to Rio with her hair tied back,  Agathas apron loosely knotted around her waist, trying to salvage the batter while Tommy licked a spoon behind her.</p><p>- WHY IS SHE LETTING HIM EAT RAW BATTER???<br/>- She’s giving big step mamma energy<br/>- AGATHA IS GOING TO KILL THEM FOR THAT MESS 😭😭😭<br/>- She looks so free with them 😍😊</p><p>“Stop licking things!” Rio barked, smacking Tommy lightly with a tea towel in an unnervingly similar manner to Agatha.</p><p>“It’s quality control!” Tommy defended.</p><p>Billy zoomed in on Rio’s serious expression as she measured sugar. “Look at her, taking this on like it’s a competition. Personal trainer, the Great British Bake Off edition.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but laughed. “I swear, if Agatha walks in on this crime scene, I’m blaming both of you.”</p><p>By the time the brownies were in the oven, they were all streaked with flour. Tommy had a dusting in his hair like premature grey, while Billy caught Rio laughing harder than she meant to when the mixer splattered cocoa across her t-shirt.</p><p>While the brownies cooled, Tommy tugged at Rio’s sleeve. “Hey. Can we go for a drive? I want to see what your Corvette can really do.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then smirked. “Seatbelt. Always. Let’s go.”</p><p>They tore down the long private drive onto the road, Tommy whooping with his head half out the window. At the end of the cul-de-sac, Rio slowed then grinned wickedly. “Hold tight.”</p><p>The car spun into a perfect donut, rubber screaming against asphalt, smoke curling.</p><p>Tommy cackled, recording on his phone.</p><p>Caption: Rio is the best (Agnes don’t see this)</p><p>- TOMMY LIVING HIS FAST &amp; FURIOUS ERA<br/>- Rio said ima be the cool one bet 😂<br/>- AGATHA IS GONNA LOSE HER GODDAMN MIND IF YOU LEAVE MARKS ON HER DRIVE 😂😂😂😂😂😂</p><p>When they rolled back up the drive, Tommy was breathless with adrenaline, hair wild. “That was… insane. You’re the coolest.”</p><p>Rio’s grin softened into something gentler. “Don’t tell Agatha we did that. But… thanks. I’m glad you enjoyed it.”</p><p>Back inside, Billy had rearranged the living room.</p><p>Ring light set, soft jazz humming in the background. He glanced at Rio with a mischievous grin. “Do you have any more work today?”</p><p>“No, why?”</p><p>“Sit. You’re my canvas.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p>“ASMR skincare video. Everyone wants it. You’ve got good skin, your the perfect subject.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Rio sat cross-legged. Billy pulled a haul of Agatha’s luxury products from her collection and whispered dramatically into the mic. “Today, we’re pampering our newest member of the family.”</p><p>Rio tried not to let the casual way he classed her as family show on her face.</p><p>He dabbed cleanser onto her cheeks with exaggerated gentleness. Rio tried not to laugh. “You know what you’re doing?”</p><p>“Of course,” Billy whispered into the mic, then winked at the camera. “I watch Aunt Agatha’s routine like it’s MasterClass.”</p><p>- BILLY IS TOO CUTE<br/>- Rio’s trying not to laugh 😭😭😭<br/>- AGATHA’S PRODUCTS??? $$$ SKINCARE.<br/>- The way their bonding today, you just know Agathas secretly watching and melting 🥰</p><p>When he finished, he misted her face with rosewater.</p><p>“Perfect. You’re glowing. Like a goddess. Sponsored by Aunt Agatha’s credit card.”</p><p>Rio laughed hard. “I can’t with you two.”</p><p>That evening, when Agatha stepped in, shoulders tight from court, expression unreadable. The smell of brownies wafted through the house. She paused in the doorway, arching a brow.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Billy and Tommy dragged her to the kitchen where the brownies sat, slightly uneven but glossy. “We baked! With Rio! Surprise!”</p><p>For the first time all day, Agatha’s poker face cracked into warmth. She gripped Rios arms as she came up behind her with a soft smile. “I can’t believe you survived them in the kitchen. That’s the real miracle.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “Wait until you see the video of us doing donuts in the Corvette.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped to Rio. “You what?”</p><p>Rio froze. “We… bonded?”</p><p>Billy quickly shoved a brownie in Agatha’s mouth. “Look, chocolate!”</p><p>Caption: Caught red-handed. But brownies soften the blow 🍫</p><p>- HER LOOK COULD KILL 😭😭😭<br/>- Agatha + Rio + nephews = family goals<br/>- Tommy telling on himself lmao</p><p>And despite the glare, Agatha’s eyes softened as she chewed, shaking her head with a sigh. “You three are going to kill me. But… this is good.”</p><p>Rio smiled quietly, watching the boys beam.</p><p>Agatha returned to her study after dinner, her silk blouse half unbuttoned, dark hair loose from the pins she wore in court. She carried the weight of the day in the rigid line of her shoulders, but her eyes kept flicking to the kitchen where Rio laughed with Billy and Tommy, tidying plates as if she had always belonged there.</p><p>By the time the twins were in bed, the house had settled into quiet. Agatha stood in the doorway of her bedroom, watching Rio tug off her hoodie, folding it carefully over the back of the chair.</p><p>“You let Tommy film you doing donuts in your Corvette.”</p><p>Rio froze mid-motion, turning with a sheepish grin. “He asked nicely.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, stepping closer until she could smell the faint tang of flour and Rio’s shampoo. “Nicely? Do you think I don’t know how much those tires cost?”</p><p>“Worth it for his face,” Rio said softly. “He looked… happy.”</p><p>The joke Agatha had ready melted on her tongue. She inhaled, chest tight, because Rio was right, she’d seen Tommy’s wild grin in the video. She exhaled slowly, shaking her head. “Your too soft.”</p><p>“And you like it,” Rio teased, voice dropping into something quieter.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted. She was used to control, to authority, to being the immovable one in the room. But with Rio standing in front of her, hands rough from gym equipment, smile bright, eyes burning with something unguarded, her control slipped like silk pooling on the floor.</p><p>“You terrify me,” Agatha admitted, her voice low, the kind she rarely let anyone hear.</p><p>Rio reached for her hand, callused thumb brushing the inside of her palm. “Good. Because you terrify me too. But in the best way.”</p><p>She let herself be pulled closer, Rio’s fingers skating up her wrist, over the smooth line of her arm. When Rio bent to kiss her, it wasn’t frantic, it was reverent. Their lips met slowly, as though they had all the time in the world, kissing not in hunger but in worship.</p><p>Agatha melted first, tilting her chin to deepen it, her hands slipping into Rio’s hair. The kiss turned molten, breath hitching between them. Rio pressed her back against the edge of the bed, careful but insistent, and Agatha let herself be guided down onto the sheets.</p><p>Silk slid beneath them.</p><p>Rio kissed along her jaw, down the line of her throat, lingering at the rapid pulse beneath her skin. Agatha shivered, clutching at the fabric of Rio’s wife beater, pulling her closer. She whispered something half-coherent, Rio’s name, a curse, a plea.</p><p>Rio drew back just enough to look at her. “I love you,” she murmured, voice breaking with sincerity. “Completely. Without conditions.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled out of her. Her throat tightened.</p><p>Rio kissed her again, softer now, each brush of lips against lips a promise. She trailed one hand along Agatha’s waist, fingertips tracing reverent lines. Agatha arched into the touch, eyes closing, surrendering herself piece by piece.</p><p>And then, as if Rio couldn’t hold it in anymore, she whispered it, so quiet Agatha almost thought she’d imagined it.</p><p>“You are mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open.</p><p>Her voice broke when she answered, but it was real. “Say it again.”</p><p>Rio did. And Agatha, for the first time in a long life of guardedness, fully submitted.</p><p>The rest of the night blurred into touch, into whispered confessions, into the sound of laughter muffled against shoulders.</p><p>By the time dawn edged into the curtains, Agatha lay in Rio’s arms, exhausted in the best way, a soft smile on her sleeping face.</p><p>For once, Rio stirred first. The house was silent, save for the faint hum of the A/C and the birds singing in the garden outside. She blinked against the early light creeping across the bedroom, then stilled.</p><p>Agatha was still asleep on her, hair fanned across the pillow, lips parted in the shallow rhythm of sleep. The sheets slipped down enough to reveal the delicate line of her shoulder, the elegant curve of collarbone.</p><p>Rio propped herself up on one elbow, heart thudding.</p><p>“God, you’re so beautiful,” Rio whispered.</p><p>She brushed a lock of chocolate hair away from Agatha’s face, careful not to wake her, letting her fingertips linger against warm skin. It felt sacred, to touch her like this, when no one else in the world would ever see Agatha this undone.</p><p>Rio settled back down and pressed a kiss against her temple, breathing her in. The faint trace of her perfume still clung to the sheets, but beneath that was something simpler - the warmth of skin, the quiet safety of being next to her.</p><p>For a moment, Rio let herself just exist there, half-asleep, staring at the ceiling, a smile tugging at her lips. She thought about last night, the way Agatha’s voice had broken when she asked Rio to say it again. She thought about how she never wanted to spend another morning without this.</p><p>Agatha shifted, murmuring something incoherent, and burrowed closer, hand seeking Rios in her sleep. That unconscious reaching undid Rio more than anything else. She wrapped her arm more securely around her, pulling her in, heart so full it ached.</p><p>And then…<br/>CRASH.</p><p>A door slammed somewhere down the hall.</p><p>Followed by Tommy’s voice, too loud for this early hour, “BILLY, STOP EATING THE GRAPES, THEY WERE FOR MY SMOOTHIE!”</p><p>A beat later, Billy yelled back, “YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE!”</p><p>Agatha groaned into Rio’s chest, half-asleep, voice muffled. “They are demons.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, pressing another kiss into her hair. “Yeah. But they’re your demons.”</p><p>Agatha cracked one eye open, fixing Rio with a look that said whatever she was going to say next would be funny. “Lets exorcise them.”</p><p>“I know a priest,” Rio whispered back, grinning.</p><p>Agatha curled closer, laughing softly as her eyes drifted back closed.</p><p>Down in the kitchen Billy had already gone live.</p><p>Their timtok viewers were treated to chaotic footage of him in pajama pants holding a half-eaten bunch of cotton candy grapes while Tommy tried to wrestle them away.</p><p>- WHERE’S AUNT AGATHA?<br/>- Boys it’s 7am on a weekend<br/>- RIO CAM WHEN?? WHERE IS SHE???</p><p>Tommy wrestled the phone out of Billy’s hands, breathless and laughing. “Rio’s probably still in bed with her, duh. Don’t be weird.”</p><p>The comments went feral instantly.</p><p>- CANON<br/>- RIO ENDGAME CONFIRMED<br/>- In bed 🍆💦😽</p><p>Back in the master suite, Agatha heard faint echoes of their chaos through the floor. She sighed and turned to Rio. “I best get up before they wreck our kitchen.”</p><p>Rio kissed her shoulder, smiling into her skin. “Or we could just stay here.”</p><p>Agatha swatted at her playfully, but the corner of her mouth twitched upward, betraying her as Rio kissed down her neck.</p><p>By the time Agatha coaxed Rio out of bed, the twins had already staged what sounded like a small war in the kitchen.</p><p>The scent hit them first something distinctly sweet.</p><p>“Tommy, you cannot put ketchup on a croissant. That’s a crime against humanity.”</p><p>“You can’t tell me how to live!”</p><p>Agatha tightened her robe as she strode in, expression flat but eyes glinting. “Good morning losers. Tell me why the blender sounds like it’s broken?”</p><p>Billy pointed at the counter sheepishly, where a smoothie of suspicious grey-green color sloshed in a glass. “Experiment.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow and tipped it down the drain without hesitation. “Failed experiment.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorway, watching the scene with quiet delight. This was Agatha in her element, commanding even in a robe, hair loose around her shoulders, taunting and teasing her boys.</p><p>“Sit. All of you,” Agatha ordered, tying back her hair with the precision of someone about to cross-examine a witness as she pointed to the bar stools against the island. “You’ll get proper breakfast.”</p><p>The twins exchanged a look, identical smirks.</p><p>Billy whispered to the live chat on his phone, “Aunt Agatha is a feeder.”</p><p>- I WOULD EAT ANYTHING SHE MADE<br/>- Please adopt me<br/>- RIO FULLY N LOVE ❤️</p><p>Rio didn’t even bother denying it. She was fully in love, and she couldn’t stop staring as Agatha moved with fluid, confident ease, cracking eggs and adding spinach into the pan like she’d been born in a kitchen.</p><p>“What’s on the menu?” Tommy asked, trying to swipe a chunk of bread from the counter.</p><p>Agatha smacked his hand lightly with the spatula. “Omelettes.”</p><p>Rio, grinning, slipped in beside her at the counter. “You’ spoil us.”</p><p>“And you’re distracting me,” Agatha murmured without looking up, though her lips twitched. She slid a spoonful of egg toward Rio. “Taste.”</p><p>Rio leaned in obediently, savoring the bite. The warmth of herbs lingered, but what made her pulse skip was the fact that Agatha fed her like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio said softly, kissing her without thought. “Like you.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a quick glance, blushing faintly. “Flattery will get you everywhere.”</p><p>Billy propped his phone up sneakily, filming Agatha at the stove.</p><p>“Chat, look at her. Michelin star behavior.”</p><p>- SOMEONE PUT THIS WOMAN ON HELLS KITCHEN<br/>- I’m sorry but how are you this lucky?<br/>- Rio staring like she’d rather eat Agatha 😂<br/>- That was the cutest, softest things I’ve ever seen 🙌🙌🙌</p><p>Rio, caught in frame, flushed but didn’t look away. She was staring.</p><p>When plates finally hit the table Tommy let out a dramatic gasp. “I take back every mean thing I’ve ever said. You’re an angel angela.”</p><p>Agatha arched one brow, laughing as she ruffled his hair.</p><p>Billy clutched his fork like it was sacred. “Best aunt. Best food.”</p><p>Rio just sat back, watching the three of them bicker and laugh, her chest tight with a sense of rightness, not just with Agatha but the twins too.</p>

<p>The hum of the gym filled the space and her ears, a mix of weights clanging, treadmills droning, and low bass from the speakers. Rio thrived here. Had built her living and her reputation within this space.</p><p>Chalk dust and sweat in the air, bodies in motion, her voice carrying over it all as she helped someone else achieve thier goals, finally at a point where her sessions were coveted (and she could charge hundreds an hour for the privilege).</p><p>She was midway through a one on one session with a long-time client, a finance guy in his forties who liked her because she never sugar-coated anything, had improved his form and dint try to upsell meal or nutrition plans.</p><p>“Chest up, Dan. You’re not trying to kiss the bar, save that for your wife,” Rio teased, adjusting his stance on the deadlift.</p><p>He huffed a laugh, straightening. “You’re brutal, you know that?”</p><p>“Efficient,” she corrected, smirking. “Five more then we’ll move to cool down.”</p><p>When he racked the bar, dripping sweat, he gave her a crooked grin. “So… my kids told me your famous on that tiktok thing because your dating some scary lawyer lady. That true?”</p><p>Rio’s chest swelled before she even thought about it. She leaned back against the squat rack, towel slung around her neck, and nodded. “Yeah. Agatha. She’s…” she paused, lips quirking, “she’s brilliant. Smart as hell. And somehow, she puts up with me.”</p><p>Dan chuckled. “That’s the smile of a woman in love.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even flinch. “Yeah, she’s worth bragging about.” The pride in her voice was undeniable, steady, warm, like it grounded her as she pulled up a photo to show him.</p><p>“My kids love her, they’re always watching her boys on that app.”</p><p>After Dans session, Rio had some time before her next appointment and decided to do a fitness live for her followers to do along with her while asking fitness questions.</p><p>Caption: Core workout - AMA</p><p>Rio adjusted her tripod, sweat glistening down her arms as she fielded questions from her usual mix of followers and clients tuning in.</p><p>- Coach Rio, what’s your secret for consistency?</p><p>“Form  over ego. Every time,” she answered smoothly, demonstrating a lunge in the correct form.</p><p>The comments flooded as more viewers joined the live, not all there for fitness content.</p><p>- TRAIN ME QUEEN<br/>- Does Agatha lift??<br/>- YALL SHE BLUSHED AT HER NAME<br/>- Whats the best meal plan to follow to tone??</p><p>Rio smirked as she glanced through, she didn’t deny the blush. “She doesn’t lift but she’s a machine on the stair climb. Devlin, the best meal plan is on my website, you’ll want high protein low carb to help tone but you need to exercise alongside the plan.”</p><p>As she was talking, her next client arrived, half an hour early, some wannabe influencer with rich parents. A girl she’d been training for a few months who spent more time taking photos in the mirror than actually training.</p><p>She slipped into the frame, ponytail flicking, lips glossy, phone in hand as Rio was half way through showing her viewers how to efficiently stretch.</p><p>“Heyyy Riooo,” she sang, leaning too close, enough to show it was deliberate. “Are you live now? We should do a couple’s workout. Imagine the views?”</p><p>Rio gave her a flat look, stepping neatly back and  out of reach. “We’re not a couple. Your my client.”</p><p>The influencer laughed, fake sweet. “Not yet, but if the offers there.” She gave a small giggle and looked into the camera quickly. “You’re single for me, right?” She winked at Rio’s camera, hungry for clout.</p><p>The chat went feral instantly</p><p>- EXCUSE ME??<br/>- WHO IS THIS GIRL??<br/>- NOT HER COMING FOR AGATHA AS IF SHE COULD COMPARE 😂😂😂😂</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. She didn’t raise her voice, didn’t need to. Her tone cut like glass. “I’m not single. I have a girlfriend, Agatha, I live with her, and I’m not interested in anyone else. Ever.”</p><p>The girl blinked, faltered, but tried to recover with a giggle. “Come on, just for views…”</p><p>Rio held up a hand, stopping her cold. “No. Respect me, respect my relationship, or we’re done.” She turned to her phone deliberately. “And for the record, Agathas the only person I want making couple content with me. Everyone else is simply me doing my job.”</p><p>The live chat exploded.</p><p>- She said what she said 🤜<br/>- RIO SAID ONE PERSON ONLY 😭😭<br/>- PROTECTIVE GF ERAAA<br/>- SHE SAID LIKE IT OR LEAVE LIVE OMG</p><p>“Don’t be like that, we’d look good together.”</p><p>Rio turned back to the influencer, tone still professional but icy. “Session’s cancelled. Find another trainer. We’re not a fit.”</p><p>The girl’s mouth dropped open. “You’re serious?”</p><p>Rio folded her arms, utterly steady. “Dead serious. Good luck.”</p><p>The space felt charged, other gym goers pretending not to stare, the live chat melting down, Rio’s pulse steady with adrenaline.</p><p>- YAAAAS QUEEN 👸<br/>- This is what I mean when I say I want someone loyal<br/>- OMFG AUNT AGATHA COME GET YOUR GIRL</p><p>Billy and Tommy were sprawled across the living room couch when Rio’s live came up on Billy’s For You Page. At first, they were just watching casually, snickering at the comments, Tommy actually taking note of the tips and tricks she talked through.</p><p>Then the influencer appeared.</p><p>Billy sat bolt upright as she said about a couples love. “Oh no. Oh no she didn’t.”</p><p>Tommy leaned closer, chips halfway to his mouth. “This is about to get good.”</p><p>The moment the girl said “your single for me, right,” the twins both screamed.</p><p>“NAH SHE DID NOT JUST—” Billy began.</p><p>“DISRESPECT OUR AUNT??” Tommy finished.</p><p>And then came Rio’s voice, flat, razor-sharp, steady as stone. “I’m not single. I have a girlfriend, Agatha, I live with her, and I’m not interested in anyone else. Ever.”</p><p>Billy gasped so loud the neighbors could’ve heard. “SHE SHOT HER DOWN LIKE THAT ON LIVE?? I LOVE HER.”</p><p>Tommy clutched his chest. “Oh my GOD Billy. Oh my god, ring Amanda, ring her!!!!”</p><p>“She’s in court today idiot, her phone will be off.”</p><p>The chat was blowing up across Rio’s screen, ONE PERSON ONLY trending in the comments, heart emojis flooding. Billy and Tommy immediately dove into the comments under their own accounts.</p><p>- @BillyMaximoff -  Rio. We love you. RESPECT 👑<br/>- @thecoolermaximoff - Amanda supremacy always 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰<br/>- @BillyMaximoff - Don’t come for our aunt, she’ll bury you and do it with a smile</p><p>They were howling, practically rolling off the sofa as Rios viewers liked and pinned their comments, the likes climbing into the thousands.</p><p>That night, Agatha came home late, coat over her arm, hair slightly undone from court, tired but sharp as ever. The boys pounced on her immediately.</p><p>“Agnes!” Tommy shoved his phone in her face. “You need to SEE this.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, confused. “Why are you yelling like feral banshees?”</p><p>Billy grinned and hit play. Rio’s voice filled the room: “I’m not single. I have a girlfriend, Agatha, I live with her, and I’m not interested in anyone else. Ever.”</p><p>The influencer’s stunned face followed. And then Rio’s icy, “Session’s cancelled. Find another trainer. We’re not a fit.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled halfway to unbuttoning her cuff. Her lips parted, her face flushed. She just… stared at the video.</p><p>Billy and Tommy watched her carefully. “Can you believe it?” Billy nudged. “She said that on live.”</p><p>Something in Agatha softened right there. Her eyes glistened faintly. She pressed her lips together, trying not to smile, but her hand reached instinctively for the phone again. “Play it once more.”</p><p>They did. She stood there, utterly still, listening to Rio claim her so openly. When the live ended, she exhaled slowly and whispered, “Is she home?”</p><p>Tommy nodded as he leaned on her shoulder. “She’s upstairs. She adores you, Amy.”</p><p>Billy added, a little softer, “She’s obsessed, you both deserve each other.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She cupped the back of Billy’s head with one hand, Tommy’s with the other. “You two pretend to be tough but your just big softies really.”</p><p>With that she moved upstairs, slipping into their bedroom where Rio was already curled in bed, scrolling on her phone. She looked up, sheepish. “The twins showed you my live, didn’t they?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Instead, she sat down beside her, fingers brushing Rio’s jaw. “You defended me. Us. Publicly. Fiercely. And not because you had to.” Her voice wavered just enough to betray how deeply it had landed.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. “Of course I did. You’re it for me, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hide how much Rios words affected her as she leaned in, kissed her slow, lingering. Then another, firmer, as if trying to pour her gratitude into it. She whispered against Rio’s lips, “You have no idea how much that means to me.”</p><p>Rio pulled her close, holding her like she was the only thing in the world. “Get used to it. I’m never letting you go.”</p><p>And Agatha simply buried her face in Rio’s neck, breathing her in. She pushed her gently back onto the pillows, eyes trailing every inch of her.</p><p>Rio whispered, voice trembling, “You’re staring.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid along Rio’s ribs, pausing at her waist, moving up and under the loose T-shirt she wore, thumb circling.</p><p>“I am. Because I can’t believe you’re real. And that your mine.” Her voice was lower than usual, husky with want. “Because you defended me like no one else has. And because I want you to feel exactly what that means to me.”</p><p>Her lips followed the same path as her fingertips across Rio’s collarbone, down the line of her sternum, each kiss reverent, lingering. Rio arched slightly under the touch, her breath catching.</p><p>“Agatha… The boys are awake.”</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha murmured, pulling her T-shirt off and pressing a kiss just below her breast. “You need to be quiet then.”</p><p>She moved at a  devastating pace, tracing Rio with her mouth like scripture, every sigh from Rio drawing her deeper. Her hands held firm, steady, worshipful as she kneaded her breasts, pulling tugging and chasing the sensation with her tongue and teeth.  Where Rio expected urgency, Agatha gave devotion, every kiss a promise, every caress a vow, drawing whimpers from her as she laid there.</p><p>By the time Agatha finally pulled herself up again, bracing over her, Rio’s eyes were blown with arousal.</p><p>“Don’t stop,” Rio whispered, voice breaking.</p><p>Agatha smiled, licking her way into Rios mouth. “Never. Not with you.” Her thumb brushed away along Rio’s cheek, the other moving to cup her underneath her joggers. Then she kissed her again, deep, slow, endless.</p><p>She pulled back and looked deeply into the big doe brown eyes below. "I want to taste you," she breathed.</p><p>She brought her face closer to her lips, brushing over and over as she spoke again. "Then I want to taste you again later, when I’ve rode you, when you'll taste like both of us."</p><p>Rios inner juices flooded her hand as she reacted to perhaps the most erotic thing that had ever been said to her. Her hips thrust against her hand and an eager sound whimpered in her throat.</p><p>When she finally released her mouth, she slowly kissed and sucked her way down to the very center of her, tugging the joggers down and throwing them away without care.</p><p>The tip of her tongue traced her slit slowly, up and down, dipping in, getting her first taste of her and once again drawing a soft whimper from Rio.</p><p>A long, slow lick followed, causing Rio to gasp Agathas name and as she arched off the bed. Agatha grinned against her, nosing at her clit as she settled in to feast on her, the urge to map every part of her overshadowing her need to bury Rio as deeply inside her as she could, at least for the moment.</p><p>Her tongue stroked, tasted, speared inside her, lapping as the juices that flowed to greet her, hands holding thighs steady, slowly kneading the muscles and keeping her steady. When she flicked over Rios sensitive clit, Rio nearly screamed; when she tugged the swollen bud into her mouth to gently suck on it, she did - hurriedly grabbing a pillow to muffle the sound lest the twins hear.</p><p>Rio flung one of her hands above her head to grab the firm wood of the headboard while she gripped Agathas head like a lifeline with the other,  her hips thrusting uncontrollably into her mouth.</p><p>"Agatha," she whimpered, crazy with need.</p><p>"Right here," she assured her in a gravelly tone that practically vibrated through her.</p><p>"Fingers, my love, I need your fingers," she gasped, her stomach tightening as the woman still between her thighs continued to plunge inside her, just not deep enough.</p><p>"Mmmm…" she agreed against her, the vibrations sending Rio higher and higher.</p><p>She tugged at her hair insistently. "Agatha…".</p><p>She finally looked up at her and the feel of her breath over her sensitized skin nearly sent her over the edge.</p><p>Agatha grinned as she nuzzled her once more, then with a last long velvety lick and a swirl of her tongue that made her moan yet again, she moved her hand beneath her chin.</p><p>Rio was entranced, never breaking eye contact as three fingers were buried inside her, completely encased by her slick heat. At that point, she closed her eyes to absorb every ounce of sensation she could.</p><p>Agatha paused to let her adjust to the intrusion, resting her forehead briefly on her thigh.</p><p>"Mmmmmm…" she sighed out in a throaty murmur, wiggling her hips to make her move.</p><p>"You okay?" Agatha husked.</p><p>Rio let out a breathless, sexy laugh and opened her eyes to find her brilliant blue ones. She ran her hand up and down her head, tugging at her hair, urging her back down onto her.</p><p>"It is safe to say that I have never been more okay in my life," she assured her, managing to get the words out despite her labored breathing and racing heart as Agatha finally began to thrust her fingers, scissoring them inside her in a delicious pattern that immediately had her inner walls clenching.</p><p>Faster and faster she moved, tongue circling her clit, inner walls being rocked by her fingers, the pressure building and building and building until Rio arched high and called out Agathas name desperately as the most powerful orgasm of her life claimed her.</p><p>Rio’s hand clutching at Agatha’s head, Agatha’s mouth still softly lapping at every inch of her until the world outside ceased to exist.</p><p>When Rio finally collapsed back against the mattress, shaking, mouth parted as she tried to pull in oxygen, Agatha moved up and wrapped herself around her, holding her as if she were priceless.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered against her temple, peppering her face with kisses.</p><p>Rio clutched her tighter. “Tell me again.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head so their foreheads pressed together. “I love you. More than anything. And I’ll prove it every day for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, imagining what their forever would look like. “You already do.”</p><p>They didn’t emerge from the bedroom for the rest of the night, Agatha making good on her promise to taste their combined arrival, Rio having brought her to orgasm on her strap more than once.</p><p>The night ended with both women completely exhausted, sweat sticking them together, the combined scent in the air, marks across each of them that they wouldn’t remember having made in the morning.</p><p>Rio stirred awake, cheek still pressed against Agatha’s bare shoulder. Her body ached in that delicious, lingering way that spoke of hours of being thoroughly seen. She turned her head to look at her girlfriend , already awake, hair tousled but eyes sharp, scrolling through her phone like the formidable lawyer she was.</p><p>Rio smiled lazily. “Thats not fair. You don’t even look tired.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, setting the phone aside. “I don’t tire easily.” The smirk she gave was enough to make Rio’s stomach flip all over again. “Lucky for you.”</p><p>Before Rio could retort, a knock came at the door sharp, unbothered, teenage.</p><p>“Ashley, Rio,” Tommy’s voice sang, muffled. “Breakfast is ready. Billy and I made it for you. Kind of. You have about a 50/50 chance of survival if you eat it.”</p><p>Rio sat up quickly, sheets clutched to her chest, eyes wide. “He’s right outside!”</p><p>Agatha, infuriatingly calm, stood and grabbed them each some pyjamas and a robe. “Yes, darling. They live here.” She shot Rio a sideways glance, clearly amused at her panic.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks burned. “It stinks in here of sex. What if he comes in.”</p><p>Agatha crossed the room, bent, and pressed a kiss to Rio’s hairline. “Relax. They won’t, not without knocking.”</p><p>When they entered the kitchen, it was a battlefield. Pancake batter smears, juice cartons half-open, and Tommy standing proudly like a chef despite the chaos. Billy was filming, of course, TikTok Live already rolling.</p><p>Caption: Chaos in the kitchen</p><p>Billy swung the camera toward Rio as she walked in, dressed in Agatha’s black robe that fell to her mid-thigh. “Ladies and gentlemen, the woman of the hour!”</p><p>The chat exploded instantly</p><p>- RIO IN THE ROBE. I REPEAT. THE ROBE<br/>- MOTHER AND MOTHER<br/>- We see those marks on your neck Rio 👀👀👀👀</p><p>Rio flushed crimson and tried to hide behind her coffee. “Do you two ever not record?”</p><p>“No,” Tommy deadpanned, flipping a pancake that looked slightly burnt. “Because our fans deserve this content.”</p><p>Agatha entered behind her in a longer purple robe, kissing Rios head automatically as she passed. “I trust no one has set the house on fire?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Billy grinned. “But Rio was glowing like when you kissed her. Want me to replay it for the live?”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her coffee. “BILLY!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink. She leaned against the counter, poured herself a cup of black coffee, and said dryly, “Of course she was. She’s mine.”</p><p>The chat went feral</p><p>- THE POSSESSIVENESS?? I’M SCREAMING<br/>- Agatha always delivers lines like she’s in a movie<br/>- Protect Rio at all costs<br/>- Nah fam, protect their relationship at all costs</p><p>Tommy carried over a plate, pancakes stacked precariously, bacon slightly crispy, eggs somewhat questionable. “Bon appétit.”</p><p>Agatha inspected the plate like evidence in court. “Well. I’ve seen worse.”</p><p>Rio, to everyone’s shock, dug in with a grin. “It’s actually good.”</p><p>Billy zoomed in on her. “SHE LIKES IT. CONFIRMED.”</p><p>Tommy beamed. “See? She’s family now, we cook for each other and stuff.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look over her coffee cup, but her mouth twitched, betraying a smile. “Don’t get sentimental, Theo.”</p><p>Billy whispered into the live, hand over his mouth. “Translation, she agrees.”</p><p>By the time breakfast ended, Rio was laughing freely, teasing the twins back, and Agatha’s eyes followed their interactions with a softness the rest of the world never really saw.</p>

<p>The twins stood in the foyer like models at a magazine shoot. Billy’s outfit was tailored within an inch of its life, Tommy’s shoes gleamed like they’d been buffed professionally, and both had their brand-new leather backpacks slung at casual but deliberate angles.</p><p>Agatha was standing before them with her arms crossed, surveying them like a general. “You look less like returning students and more like you’re about to walk the Milan runway,” she remarked dryly.</p><p>Billy spun on his heel. “As we should. First impressions matter.”</p><p>Tommy tilted his head, running a hand through perfectly styled hair. “It’s called aesthetic, Amy. Look it up.”</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorway, hiding her smile behind her coffee mug. They really did look like celebrities playing at being students. But what really caught her was Agatha, sharp, commanding but maternal in her own no-nonsense way.</p><p>Agatha snapped her fingers lightly to get their attention. “Right, rules.”</p><p>Both boys groaned in unison. “But—”</p><p>“No.” Her voice cut cleanly. “No phones during school hours. No TikTok. I don’t care if your fanbase goes into withdrawal. Straight A’s remain non-negotiable, you will be respectful to your teachers, and neither of you is to treat that school your personal film studio.”</p><p>Billy muttered, “It’s literally prime content opportunity…”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicked toward him, sharp enough to silence the room. “Content doesn’t get you into college. Grades and reputations do.”</p><p>Tommy leaned past to look at Rio, stage-whispering, “See? Full mom mode activated. Someone call for help.”</p><p>Rio bit back a laugh. Agatha looked between the two, eyes softening only slightly. “You will also be kind. You’re fortunate to attend this school. That privilege is not to be taken for granted.”</p><p>Billy shifted, chewing his lip, then nodded. “Yes, Aunt Agatha.”</p><p>Tommy sighed dramatically. “Fine. Yes, Amanda.”</p><p>Satisfied, she picked up her keys and gestured toward the door. “Good, then lets go.”</p><p>The G Wagon purred up the long private drive to SHIELD Academy, the private school that looked more like an Ivy League campus than a high school. Manicured lawns stretched wide, fountains sparkled, and the building itself towered with gleaming stone and archways.</p><p>Rio’s jaw nearly dropped. “This is their school?” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were steady on the wheel. “Fifth teen thousand a term, plus extracurriculars.”</p><p>Rio choked on her coffee. “Fifth teen thousand?”</p><p>Billy adjusted his cufflinks smugly. “We’re worth every cent.”</p><p>Tommy flicked his hair. “We raise the school’s average beauty points by at least twenty percent.”</p><p>Rio laughed under her breath, glancing at Agatha. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stayed forward, her tone cool. “I pay for them to be surrounded by opportunity, not limitation.”</p><p>As they pulled up, other students milled about in designer coats and polished shoes. Parents in equally as expensive, gleaming cars dropped their kids off, but even here, Agatha’s aura seemed to outshine.</p><p>Agatha pulled in to drop off parking, turned in her seat, and looked at the twins. “Last chance. Do I need to repeat the speech?”</p><p>Both shook their heads quickly.</p><p>“Good.” She smoothed Tommy’s collar, brushed imaginary lint off Billy’s shoulder, and her voice softened for just a moment. “Go. Make me proud.”</p><p>The boys grinned, identical, mischievous, but genuine. “Always.”</p><p>They hopped out, immediately attracting stares.</p><p>Billy couldn’t resist pulling out his phone for a cheeky photo before Agatha shot him a glare. He stuffed it away, laughing, and the two vanished into the crowd of students that surrounded them.</p><p>Rio sat back in her seat, watching them disappear. “You’re really incredible, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha fastened her seatbelt, unfazed. “Hardly. It’s just parenting. Though admittedly, it does help that I have such a flexible budget.”</p><p>Rio turned, still a little in awe, still a little lovestruck. “No, Agatha. It’s not just money. It’s in the way you make them listen. The way you care about them.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a softer smile, before leaning across the seat to plant a kiss on Rios upturned lips. “I love them, and you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, staring at her like she was the only person in the world. “You’re impossible. And perfect.”</p><p>Agatha started the car, smirk tugging at her mouth. “Yes. So you keep telling me.”</p><p>Billy and Tommy had promised, under pain of Agathas death glare, that their phones would stay off during the school day. And shockingly, they stuck to it. Their backpacks were zipped tight, phones locked away.</p><p>But it didn’t stop the circus from starting the minute they exited the car.</p><p>By mid morning break, a group of classmates had already gone live on TikTok, their phones propped against water bottles or balanced in shaky hands, showcasing Shield in all of its glory.</p><p>The twins were the most relevant on the app, had the highest follower count and were therefore the centre of most of their classmates lives. Chaos was what they were known for and chaos was exactly what the twins delivered.</p><p>Billy had climbed onto the stone bench like it was his personal stage. His jacket was unbuttoned, still immaculate, but artfully so. He was narrating like David Attenborough, waving his hand about theatrically. “And here we observe the rarest of creatures… the private school teen, grazing on overpriced fruit and quinoa snacks.”</p><p>The crowd of kids howled.</p><p>Tommy, meanwhile, had stolen someone’s football and was doing elaborate throw and catches with exaggerated flair. “Ladies and gentlemen, I present, athletics, without effort.” He missed the last kick, the ball flying into a hedge, and he dropped into a bow.</p><p>The live chat on the unnamed student was flooding as people tagged the boys accounts.</p><p>- You go to school with the maximoff twins??<br/>- Billy pls marry me<br/>- Tommy giving NFL but comedy version  🤣<br/>- SOMEONE TAG AUNT AGATHA OR RIO</p><p>One of their classmates aimed the camera closer.</p><p>“Do something for the live, c’mon!”</p><p>Billy spread his arms wide, channelling his inner Agatha. “Darling, we exist, that’s already content.”</p><p>Tommy jumped onto the bench beside him. “And don’t worry, our agent,” He pointed toward Billy. “will negotiate rates for this later.”</p><p>The students surrounding them laughed and goaded them. The live viewers doubled in minutes.</p><p>The comments were relentless:</p><p>- Their aunt raised them TOO well<br/>- That school has no idea what’s coming.<br/>- They’re literally Disney Channel twins.</p><p>A teacher finally marched over, arms crossed, expression pinched. “Boys, off the bench. Phones away everyone.”</p><p>Billy hopped down instantly, smooth as ever. “Of course, sir.”</p><p>Tommy winked at the nearest camera.</p><p>The stream was cut, the classmate hurriedly pocketing their phone before the teacher confiscated it.</p><p>Agatha was in her chambers during a recess in court, perfectly put-together in a navy suit, sipping espresso while reviewing case notes. Her phone buzzed once, a message from Rio 💋💀.</p><p>Rio 💋💀: Tiktok has you trending again. The twins. Playground. Their friends are filming. Absolute menaces</p><p>Agatha sighed through her nose, pinching the bridge of it with manicured fingers. Then, with the faintest smile, she typed back:</p><p>Agatha: At least they’re not the ones filming I suppose</p><p>What none of the students close to the twins knew was that another live had quietly gone up.</p><p>This one was filmed by a quieter girl in their year, her phone half-hidden between her books on a bench. Her caption was simple:</p><p>Caption: Billy &amp; Tommy Maximoff IRL</p><p>The camera caught Tommy crouched by the hedge, fishing out the football he’d launched earlier. Instead of laughing it off, he handed it back to a younger boy who looked on the verge of tears.</p><p>“Here you go, mate. Sorry for nicking it.” He ruffled the kid’s hair, easy and genuine before tossing the ball back and forth, giving the younger boy some pointers as he did.</p><p>Her chat lit up, only a handful of viewers slowly growing as people realised who she was filming.</p><p>- WAIT Tommy apologized???<br/>- Protect this child<br/>- He’s actually sweet omfg</p><p>Across the playground, Billy was sitting on the stone bench again, but quieter now, his long fingers tapping on an open textbook. No one missed the shy broad teenager leaned against him. But there was also a girl on the other side, asking him something about their earlier science class. The live caught his patient tone as he explained, step by step, showing her what the teacher had talked through.</p><p>“See, once you rearrange it, it makes sense. Don’t stress, it’s literally the teacher making it sound harder.”</p><p>The comments continued to flow in as the girls viewer count climbed.</p><p>- BOY GENIUS?<br/>- He tutors too? Agatha’s genes are strong (yes I’m aware their not blood related)<br/>- HE’S SO RESPECTFUL WTH</p><p>The live stayed on for the remainder of their break It caught moments that never made the twins’ own TikToks or their friends chaotic tailored streams.</p><p>Tommy holding the door for a cluster of kids carrying instruments.</p><p>Billy politely greeting a teacher with “Good morning, sir” and a nod.</p><p>Both twins stopping their banter long enough to quietly share the snacks Agatha had packed, neat containers of fruit and crackers.</p><p>The comments reflected the surprise.</p><p>- Not them eating grapes like princes<br/>- I thought they were chaos goblins but they’re literally… gentlemen???<br/>- Agatha’s parenting is 🔥 🔥🔥🔥</p><p>By the end of the school day, two very different clips were circulating</p><p>The chaotic live where the twins were performing, teasing, being larger-than-life, playing up to their friends viewers.</p><p>Then the second, quieter live, showing the twins when they thought there weren’t any cameras, showing the twins being respectful, helpful and genuinely kind.</p><p>Together, they painted a bigger picture, the boys were not just viral personalities, but well-raised kids thriving under Agatha’s care.</p><p>When Billy and Tommy burst through the front door with jackets slung over their shoulders, they were talking over each other.</p><p>“Okay, so we may or may not have—”</p><p>“—blown up TikTok again”</p><p>“but it wasn’t us this time!”</p><p>Rio, curled up on the sofa with her laptop, looked up. “Oh, I saw. The playground circus and the secret little live. You two are like a PR campaign all by yourselves.”</p><p>Agatha followed the boys in moments later, heels clicking, case files still in hand, swinging her car keys around one finger.</p><p>“I’ve had to listen them go on and on about it on the drive home. I don’t want to know anymore,” she said dryly. “Unless it involves disciplinary calls from the school. Does it?”</p><p>Both twins chorused, “No!” too quickly.</p><p>Rio grinned, pulling up the wholesome live on her phone which had been screen rvorded. “Actually… you might want to see this.”</p><p>Agatha paused, watching her nephews on the screen. Tommy’s easy kindness, Billy’s quiet patience. Her expression softened despite herself.</p><p>When the video ended, she cleared her throat and said, “Well. At least I won’t be mortified at parents’ evening.”</p><p>The twins exchanged triumphant looks. Rio mouthed to them, ‘She’s proud of you.’</p><p>And Agatha? She was. Terribly so.</p><p>By the time dinner plates were cleared, creamy mushroom stroganoff that Agatha had casually thrown together, the twins inhaling like they hadn’t eaten in days, the kitchen table was already buried under books, worksheets, and half-sharpened pencils.</p><p>Tommy groaned, stretching across the table dramatically. “Maths is a personal attack.”</p><p>Billy shoved him back upright. “It’s literally algebra, not a conspiracy.”</p><p>Rio, perched at the counter sipping water, chuckled. “I’m crap at maths but I can try help?”</p><p>Billy and Tommy spoke in unison, deadpan, “Thanks but maybe not.”</p><p>Agatha walked in from the study, hair down, glasses sliding down her nose. “Move over.”</p><p>The twins straightened instinctively. Even Rio blinked there was something about Agatha in glasses that turned the kitchen air a little sharper.</p><p>Billy slid a worksheet across. “It’s just quadratic equations, but the way the teacher explains it makes zero sense.”</p><p>Agatha scanned the sheet, tapping a manicured finger. “It’s simple. Look—” She pulled a blank page toward her and began sketching neat steps.</p><p>Her voice was low, deliberate. “It’s not about remembering the formula, it’s about recognizing the pattern. Once you see how the numbers talk to each other, you don’t forget it.”</p><p>Tommy frowned, but his eyes tracked every line.</p><p>“So like… it’s less numbers, more conversation?”</p><p>Agatha gave a rare, amused smirk. “Exactly. Numbers have better manners than most people.”</p><p>Rio, watching from the side, felt her jaw slacken.</p><p>The boys weren’t just listening, they were absorbing. And Agatha? She wasn’t just clever.</p><p>She was dazzling. The kind of mind that didn’t just solve problems but reframed them in a way both her and the teens could understand.</p><p>Within minutes, Tommy was scribbling correct answers. Billy leaned over his shoulder. “Wait—did you just… get it?”</p><p>Tommy grinned sheepishly. “Guess I speak number now.”</p><p>Agatha sipped her tea calmly. “Good. Now show me you can do three more without whining.”</p><p>English essays sprawled next. Billy had written half a page about To Kill a Mockingbird. Agatha read it silently, lips pursed.</p><p>“This is strong,” she said finally, “but you’re circling the obvious. Don’t tell your teacher that Scout sees injustice, tell them why she sees it differently than the adults. Risk your opinion, not your summary.”</p><p>Billy blinked, pen hovering. “You make it sound… kind of fun.”</p><p>“It is,” Agatha said softly. “Words can cut sharper than any blade. Use them well.”</p><p>The kitchen fell quiet except for pens scratching.</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, watching the scene unfold, Agatha, hair falling forward as she guided them, Billy frowning, then lighting up when her phrasing clicked.</p><p>It hit her like a punch, she’d always known Agatha was powerful in court, commanding in her career.</p><p>But seeing her here, unarmored, pouring her sharpness into these boys, it was another kind of brilliance altogether. It was obvious how she’d succeeded.</p><p>Rio whispered without meaning to, “You’re amazing.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up over her glasses, eyebrow raised. “I’m helping with homework, not curing cancer.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t look away. “No. You’re showing them how to think.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, expression flickering, the faintest blush. She smoothed it quickly. “It’s nothing. Tommy still thinks algebra is a conspiracy.”</p><p>Tommy, without looking up, “It is.”</p><p>Of course, Billy had quietly propped his phone up against the fruit bowl.</p><p>Caption: Aunt Agatha vs. Homework (she’s scary good at it)</p><p>The comments poured in</p><p>- IS SHE A PROFESSOR OR A LAWYER???<br/>- The twins actually look… studious???<br/>- Rio in the back, she’s in love 🥺</p><p>When Agatha noticed, she gave Billy her most withering look. “Delete that.”</p><p>Billy grinned. “Too late. It’s a live not a video. You’re trending as #AgathaHotTutor.”</p><p>Agatha groaned into her tea. Rio just laughed, she was definitely making a mental note to make Agatha keep the glasses on in bed tonight.</p><p>When the pencils were finally down. Tommy stretched like he’d survived a war. Billy stacked his papers neatly, trying to look casual.</p><p>Agatha, perched at the end of the table with her glasses still low on her nose, tapped her glass with one finger. Her tone was deceptively mild.</p><p>“So, Billy. Who was that boy leaning against you in the TikTok live?”</p><p>Billy froze. Tommy immediately lit up like Christmas.</p><p>“Ohhhhhh,” he drawled, grinning ear to ear. “That would be Eddie.”</p><p>Billy’s face turned scarlet. “Shut up, Tommy!”</p><p>Tommy leaned across the table. “He’s got floppy hair, Amanda. Proper ‘indie boy’ vibes. Looked very comfortable leaning on Billy, if you ask me.”</p><p>Billy buried his face in his hands. “I hate both of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk was slow, surgical. She set her glass down and folded her arms.</p><p>“So this Eddie,” she said, “friend… or friend?”</p><p>Rio nearly spat out her water. She was shaking with suppressed laughter. “Agatha,” she whispered, “leave him alone.”</p><p>Tommy slapped the table. “FRIEND with capital letters!”</p><p>Billy groaned so loudly it was theatrical. “We’re just friends, oh my God. You guys are insane.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, watching him squirm. “Well,” she said lightly, “friends are always welcome here. If you’d like to invite Eddie over for dinner sometime, I’ll set another place at the table.”</p><p>Billy peeked through his fingers, eyes wide. “Are you serious?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha replied, voice velvet with amusement. “I’d like to meet the boy who makes you blush redder than marinara sauce.”</p><p>Rio cackled. “She’s not wrong, kiddo.”</p><p>Tommy seized the chance. “Can he come tomorrow? I wanna interrogate him. Make sure he’s worthy.”</p><p>Billy threw a balled-up piece of paper at him. “You’re not interrogating anyone!”</p><p>Agatha arched one brow. “Actually, I rather like that idea. Cross-examination builds character.”</p><p>Billy groaned again, but there was the tiniest upward curl at his lips. “You’re all evil.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Tommy had captured the whole thing and uploaded a clipped version.</p><p>Caption: Billy has a BOYFRIEND???</p><p>The comments poured in</p><p>- NOT AUNT AGATHA CALLING HIM OUT 😭<br/>- Tommy is the best wingman slash worst brother ever.<br/>- If Eddie doesn’t show up, we riot<br/>- Agatha inviting him over = MILF MOMENT</p><p>By the time Billy noticed, the video already had 200k views. He flopped dramatically onto the sofa, face buried in a cushion.</p><p>“I hate you, Tommy.”</p><p>Tommy grinned, triumphant. “You love me. And Eddie.”</p><p>Billy launched the cushion at his head.</p><p>Agatha, watching the chaos with an amused smirk, leaned toward Rio and murmured so only she could hear, “I can’t wait to meet him.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved. “You’re going to scare him on purpose aren’t you?”</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha agreed smoothly, settling back into Rios embrace. “ Have to make sure he’s good enough.”</p><p>Rio simply laughed and tugged her closer.</p>

<p>Billy had been pacing the kitchen since getting in from school.</p><p>He’d changed shirts three times.</p><p>“Does this look like I’m trying too hard?” he asked, tugging at the collar of a pale blue button-up.</p><p>Tommy didn’t even look up from his phone. “It looks like you’re trying not to sweat through it. Which you are. So, yes.”</p><p>Billy groaned. “You’re literally useless.”</p><p>From across the room, Agatha’s voice cut like a whip. “You’ll be fine. Stop fidgeting, it shows your nervous.”</p><p>Billy spun around. “I’m not nervous about anything!”</p><p>Her smirk was merciless. “Convince me, then.”</p><p>Rio, leaning against the counter, eyes tracking Agatha as she stirred a sauce in the pan, finally intervened. She smiled at Billy with that calm, grounding warmth he was secretly coming to adore. “You look good, sweetheart. He’s coming over to hang out with you, he’s not going to care about your shirt.”</p><p>Billy exhaled, shoulders sagging. “Thanks, Rio.” He muttered it so quietly Agatha pretended not to hear but her soft smile to Rio betrayed her.</p><p>At six sharp, the doorbell rang. Tommy whooped like it was a gameshow buzzer.</p><p>“EDDIE’S HERE!”</p><p>Billy’s ears went crimson. “Shut. Up.”</p><p>Agatha moved smoothly to the door, her black silk blouse immaculate, heels clicking. She opened it to find Eddie, slightly tall, floppy brown hair, nervous smile, holding flowers. Actual flowers.</p><p>“Good evening,” Agatha said, her tone deceptively polite. “You must be Eddie.”</p><p>He nodded quickly, thrusting the bouquet forward. “Uh—these are for you. Thank you for having me to dinner.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched ever so slightly. She accepted the flowers with a gracious nod. “Manners. Thats a good start.”</p><p>Tommy immediately leaned into the hallway, grinning like a cat. “Isn’t he cute.”</p><p>Billy appeared a second later, mortified. “Tommy, stop! Eddie, come on, ignore him.”</p><p>Eddie gave a small, sheepish laugh as Billy dragged him toward the dining room.</p><p>Agatha’s dining room glowed with warm light, candles lit down the table, places set like something out of a magazine.</p><p>Rio helped carry the plates through, Roasted chicken with a garlic and mushroom sauce, herbed roast potatoes, asparagus, fresh bread.</p><p>Eddie looked slightly overwhelmed as he sat.</p><p>“This is… wow. My mum usually just orders pizza.”</p><p>“Billy said you like chicken but I can make you something else?”. Agatha offered smoothly, pouring wine for herself and Rio, juice for the boys.</p><p>“No, no, this is great, it smells amazing.”</p><p>Billy gave Eddie a don’t mind her look. Eddie smiled nervously.</p><p>Tommy leaned in, whispering far too loudly, “She’s about to go full cross-examination mode.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved. “Correct.” She set her glass down and fixed Eddie with a lawyer’s stare. “So. Eddie. Tell me about yourself.”</p><p>Eddie straightened. “Um, I’m sixteen. I play guitar. I like history. And… uh…”</p><p>Billy jumped in. “He’s actually really good at guitar. Like, seriously. And he tutors people in math.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze sharpened, shifting back to Eddie.</p><p>“Tutoring. That’s commendable.”</p><p>Tommy stage-whispered, “That’s lawyer talk for ‘you pass, for now.’”</p><p>Rio nearly choked on her wine, laughing.</p><p>Eddie flushed but smiled. “Billy talks about you a lot. About both of you,” he added, glancing between Agatha and Rio.</p><p>Billy’s face was scarlet. “Oh my God.”</p><p>Agatha allowed the faintest softening in her expression. “I see. And what do you think of my nephew, Eddie?”</p><p>Billy hissed, “Aunt Agatha!”</p><p>Rio cackled, trying to disguise the sound with a sip of wine, fingers reaching under the table to grip Agathas thigh.</p><p>Eddie, to his credit, didn’t falter. He looked at Billy, then back at Agatha. “I think he’s really funny. And smart. And… he makes me feel comfortable.”</p><p>The table went quiet for a beat. Agatha regarded him like she was weighing evidence, then finally inclined her head.<br/>“Well said.”</p><p>Billy ducked his head, ears burning.</p><p>Of course Tommy had been stealth-recording under the table. Within an hour, he’d posted his covert video.</p><p>Caption: Billy’s BOYFRIEND passes Aunt Agatha’s interrogation (barely).</p><p>- SIR BROUGHT FLOWERS?? Gentleman award 🏆<br/>- Agatha’s face when he said Billy’s smart 😭😭😭<br/>- Rio cackling is my new Roman Empire<br/>- Tommy = agent of chaos as always</p><p>Billy begged Tommy to delete it. Tommy refused.</p><p>Later, after dessert (homemade chocolate mousse, because Agatha never bought boxed desserts), the boys went into the living room.</p><p>Eddie and Billy sat awkwardly close on the sofa, laughing over some game on Billy’s phone.</p><p>Agatha lingered in the doorway, arms folded. Rio slipped up beside her, whispering with a grin, “You like him.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened just a fraction. “He’s polite. Honest. I appreciate that.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “And he looks at Billy like Billy hung the moon.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, but her lips curved ever so slightly.</p><p>The evening had mellowed into that warm, hazy contentment that followed a good dinner. Eddie had relaxed, Billy had finally stopped blushing, and even Tommy had been kept mostly in check (though only because Rio kicked subtly twice).</p><p>When the clock edged toward ten, Eddie glanced at his phone. “Uh, I didn’t realise it was getting late. I should probably head home. My mum will be here in five.”</p><p>Billy jumped up instantly. “I’ll walk you out.”</p><p>Tommy leaned back on the couch with a smirk. “Ooooh, the walk him to the door moment.”</p><p>“Shut. Up.” Billy hissed, shoving his brother’s shoulder as Eddie laughed nervously.</p><p>Billy led Eddie toward the front hall, muttering frantic apologies for Tommy the whole way. Eddie only smiled. “He’s funny. You’re lucky, you guys are… like, chaos, but good chaos.”</p><p>Billy rubbed his neck, embarrassed but clearly pleased. “Yeah. Something like that.”</p><p>Agatha was waiting at the door, already holding Eddie’s jacket. She slipped it into his hands with the kind of grace that made even a simple gesture feel like a performance.</p><p>“Thank you again for coming, Eddie,” she said, voice smooth, poised. “It was a pleasure having you.”</p><p>Eddie blinked, clearly not sure if she meant it or not. “Thank you for… uh, for dinner. It was amazing.”</p><p>Billy gave Agatha a nervous please don’t scare him look.</p><p>Rio appeared behind her, leaning casually in the doorway arch, clearly ready to watch the whole thing like a theater show. Tommy had darted up to the bannister above, peering down from the stairs, phone in hand, grinning like the little menace he was.</p><p>Agatha stepped onto the porch with Eddie while Billy hovered nervously beside them. The air was cool, cicadas humming faintly in the trees. She clasped her hands behind her back, chin lifted, studying Eddie as though he were giving testimony.</p><p>“Eddie,” she began, voice measured, calm. “You seem like a very respectable young man. You treated my nephew kindly tonight. You looked me in the eye when you spoke. You even brought flowers. These are all good signs.”</p><p>Eddie swallowed but nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Billy groaned. “Aunt Agatha. Omg please.”</p><p>But Agatha continued, eyes still on Eddie. “I need you to understand something. Billy means the world to me. He and his brother have been through more than most boys their age ever should. I will not—” her voice softened, but the steel remained “—allow anyone to hurt him. Not even unintentionally.”</p><p>Eddie’s eyes widened, but instead of stammering, he nodded again. His voice was quiet, but steady. “I would never. I really like him. I just want… I just want to be someone he can count on.”</p><p>Something flickered in Agatha’s eyes then, surprise, then warmth. She inclined her head, almost regal. “Another good answer.”</p><p>Billy muttered, face red, “Could you not act like you’re the in Supreme Court right now?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into the faintest smile. “Habit.”</p><p>She reached out then, resting a surprisingly gentle hand on Eddie’s shoulder. “You’re welcome back here anytime.”</p><p>The boy’s expression shifted from nervous to proud in an instant. “Thank you, ma’am. That means a lot.”</p><p>From inside, Rio whispered to Tommy as they peeked.<br/>“She’s being terrifyingly kind.”</p><p>Tommy snorted. “She’s like a mafia boss but with manners.”</p><p>Rio grinned, nudging Tommy as they both peeped. “Oh, he passed the test. Look at her. That’s Agatha being soft.”</p><p>Tommy zoomed in on Billy’s scarlet face with his phone. TikTok already had its next chaotic upload lined up.</p><p>Caption: Aunt Agatha: Scary? Yes. Soft? Also yes.</p><p>- THE SHOULDER TAP 😭<br/>- Eddie holding eye contact?? MVP<br/>- Billy dying of embarrassment live on camera</p><p>Finally, Billy walked Eddie down the path as his moms car pulled up by the gates, both of them laughing awkwardly. Eddie promised to text when he got home safe, and Billy waved until he was out of sight.</p><p>When Billy came back in, his ears were still glowing red. “You had to do that, didn’t you?” he accused.</p><p>Agatha arched one elegant brow. “Yes.”</p><p>Tommy practically fell down the stairs laughing. “You scared him and he still said he liked you, Billy. That’s love.”</p><p>Billy shoved him. “Shut up.”</p><p>But the way Billy’s smile lingered as he pulled out his phone suggested he didn’t really mind at all.</p><p>It wasn’t too long before he decided to check in. Pulling up Eddies contact:  🖤.</p><p>Billy: Made it home okay?</p><p>🖤: Yeah. But also…WHY have you not let me come over before??? Your aunt is terrifying but also?? Like… amazing. And Rio is cool as hell. I feel cheated, Billy.</p><p>Billy flopped face-down on his bed, muffling a groan into the duvet. His cheeks still burned from the porch scene replaying in his head.</p><p>From the next room, Tommy’s muffled voice carried through the wall. “BILLY WAS BLUSHINGGGG.”</p><p>TOmmy was laid on his own bed, doing an AMA, the live watching as he yelled through the wall.</p><p>Billy shouted back, “SHUT UP.”</p><p>- Sibling energy unmatched.<br/>- Protective aunt + flirty new boy = Netflix original<br/>- WHO IS THIS EDDIE</p><p>Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Agatha was placing their wine glasses into the dishwasher when Rio leaned against the counter, arms folded, grin wide.</p><p>“Your such a good mom,” Rio said casually.</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. “I’m not a mom.”</p><p>“No, you are.” Rio nodded her head. “In all the ways that count. They might not call you that but you are those boys parent. Did you not see how Billy looked when you were nice to Eddie. Like you hung the moon.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched despite herself. “I wasn’t particularly kind to him.”</p><p>“You were very kind. Terrifying, but kind.” Rio bumped her hip against Agatha’s, playful. “I think you deserve a reward.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Rio threw her over her shoulder, smacking her ass she threw her down on the couch before climbing on top of her to pepper her with kisses.</p><p>Billy’s phone pinged again upstairs, he could hear Agatha and Rio laughing together downstairs, he wanted that with Eddie.</p><p>🖤: So, can I come back? Like, soon? Maybe Thursday?</p><p>Billy bit his lip, grinning despite himself.</p><p>Billy: Yeah… I’ll ask. But yes.</p><p>🖤: Good. Don’t hide me again, Billy. I like being around you. And your family. Their great</p><p>Billy lay there staring at the words, his chest tight in the best way.</p><p>Agatha rarely overslept. But the following morning, the alarm went unheard, the sheets twisted, and Rio’s arm draped heavy across her waist.</p><p>It had been her fault. Rio had been relentless, soft kisses turning into heat, heat turning into hours of worship. By the time the sky had began to change shades, Agatha had tapped out, whispering, “Enough, I’ll be useless tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio had only grinned against her collarbone and kept her wordless, pliant, and undone until dawn.</p><p>Now, at eight, Agatha bolted upright.</p><p>“Shit,” she hissed, shoving hair out of her face. “I’m late, I’m meant to be in chambers at nine, and the boys…”</p><p>Rio, blinking awake, propped herself on an elbow, hair a messy halo. “Relax.”</p><p>“Relax?” Agatha was already half out of bed, tugging at her robe, muttering. “The twins aren’t ready. Their lunches aren’t done.”</p><p>She opened the bedroom door, “Twins! Get up, we’re late.”</p><p>“We’re dressed!” Tommy yelled.</p><p>Billy followed, “We’ve got our own lunches! Chill!”</p><p>Rio smirked, rolling onto her back. “See? Crisis averted. I’ll take them.”</p><p>Agatha froze. “You’ll…?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio slid out of bed with infuriating calm, tugging on sweatpants and a tee. “I’ll do the school run. You, Miss High-Powered Lawyer, are going to be late if you don’t shower and drive my Corvette like it was meant to be driven.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “Rio…”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Rio interrupted, leaning close, voice low, warm and tinged with just a tiny bit of smugness. “I fucked you so well that you slept through your alarm, so technically, this is my fault. Let me help.”</p><p>Agatha went pink to the tips of her ears before rolling her eyes and leaning in for a kiss. “You are insufferable.”</p><p>“And you love it.” Rio kissed her again, quick, then clapped her hands. “Boys! Grab your bags. We’re rolling out.”</p><p>Five minutes later, Rio was in the driver’s seat of Agathas G Wagon, the twins in the back, both buzzing with amusement.</p><p>Tommy grinned. “So Amy’s still in bed?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “No, she’s trying to fix her hair and look like she didn’t get absolutely rai… “, realising who she was talking to she abruptly cut herself off, flushing red, “…a rough night. She had a rough night.”</p><p>“Rio, ewwwwwww, my brain needs bleach. You cant say things like that about Amanda!”</p><p>Billy wheezed. “OH MY GOD, I can’t. TikTok would actually die.”</p><p>Tommy, to distract himself, decided to go live. Panning the camera to Rio driving.</p><p>Caption: When Aunt Agatha sleeps in 👀</p><p>“We’re parent-swapping today.” Tommy said to the camera, focusing on Rio.</p><p>Billy, deciding to wind Tommy up even more, chipped in with. “ Aunt Agatha’s… indisposed.”</p><p>The camera did not miss Rios unconscious smirk.</p><p>- WHAT DO YOU MEAN INDISPOSED 😭😭<br/>- RIO LOOKS TOO PLEASED WITH HERSELF Agatha?? Sleeping in?? Not possible???</p><p>Tommy groaned at the comments, scowling as Billy laughed and relayed the message to Rio,“ Rio, they don’t think its possible for her to sleep in.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s possible. Trust me.” She winked into the camera, sticking her tongue out childishly at Tommys whinging.</p><p>- Where else has that tongue been Rio 😂😂😂<br/>- No because this is so chaotic I love it<br/>- IS RIO THE REASON 😴 🍆💦🥵</p><p>Agatha stood in the driveway, robe belted, watching her car pull away with a sense of bemusement. For a moment, the image made her throat tighten: Rio with the boys, all laughter and ease, like they’d always been hers too.</p><p>Then she glanced at the Corvette, gleaming in the garage lighting, and muttered, “God help me,” before grabbing Rios keys.</p><p>She slid into the leather seat, heels on the pedals, and for once allowed herself the indulgence of peeling out of the driveway. The engine roared, and Agatha, late but grinning despite herself, felt something in her chest loosen.</p>

<p>Over breakfast the next morning, Tommy wasted no time. “Soooo, Billy. When’s Eddie coming over again?”</p><p>Billy tried to hide behind his orange juice. “None of your business.”</p><p>Agatha looked up from packing their lunches (club sandwiches on sourdough, fruit skewers, yogurt and a bag of chips each) expression neutral. “Tomorrow, apparently.”</p><p>Billy choked. “How did you…”</p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee, unbothered. “You talk louder than you think when you’re on the phone.”</p><p>Rio covered a laugh with her hand. “Oh, Billy. You didn’t think you could keep that from her, did you?”</p><p>Tommy whooped. “Our house is officially the place to be.”</p><p>Billy muttered, “I hate all of you.” But the tiny smile tugging at his mouth betrayed him.</p><p>Thursday arrived with a crisp edge in the air and a quiet buzz running through the house. Eddie was coming over again, and the twins had spent half the previous evening FaceTiming him about what snacks Agatha needed to buy in for their “boys’ night.”</p><p>Billy pretended to be casual, but even Agatha noticed how often he checked his phone.</p><p>By six, when Rio returned home from her final PT session, Eddie was sprawled on the rug with Billy, arguing about whether pizza or Chinese was the superior takeout option and which they would get with the $100 Agatha had given them for dinner.</p><p>Tommy hovered near, pretending to scroll, but he was smiling at his brother and his boyfriend.</p><p>Agatha, however, was upstairs. She’d been unusually secretive all day, and Rio was beginning to wonder if something was wrong. But when she walked into their bedroom, her breath caught.</p><p>Spread neatly across the duvet was a brand new black dress, soft fabric catching the light, paired with a pair of red bottom heels that made her mouth go dry, fresh in the box, in a gorgeous forest green. Her recently gifted gucci bag was next to it.</p><p>“Put these on,” came Agatha’s voice, low and deliberate. She stepped out of the closet already dressed, and Rio’s pulse skipped.</p><p>She was wearing her own silky black dress that was floaty and ended mid calf. Her heels clicked softly against the wood floor as she crossed the room, elegance wrapped around her like armor.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Are we… going somewhere?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “The boys will survive without us for a few hours. I’ve already given them money for take out.”</p><p>Rio laughed, a little breathless and a little overwhelmed at the thought that had clearly gone into this. “You planned a date for us?”</p><p>“Correct,” Agatha replied, her mouth twitching into a smile. “While the teens are distracted by Eddie. Now chop chop. Reservations don’t wait.”</p><p>Agatha drove them into the city, laughing when Rio tossed her own keys to her. She sat beside her, Agathas hand on her thigh, thumb absentmindedly rubbing circles into the bare skin, the purr of the corvette filling the silence as she stole glances at the sharp line of Agatha’s jaw in the glow of passing traffic lights.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me where we’re going?” Rio asked.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, lips curving slightly, but her fingers tightened imperceptibly on her leg. “It’s a surprise, you’ll find out when we get there.”</p><p>When they did, Rio stepped out of the car and tipped her head back in wonder. A rooftop Michelin restaurant stretched above them, glass walls glittering against the skyline, fairy lights strung like stars across the terrace. Inside, the host whisked them straight to a secluded corner overlooking the city.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha pulled her chair out for her, movements precise, almost too careful. “You deserve to be taken places,” she said quietly. “I know we’ve mostly stayed at home and haven’t had many dates since you moved in. But I can do better. I want to do better.”</p><p>Something in her tone made Rio still.</p><p>When Rio looked at her properly, she saw past the polish, the tailored dress, the perfect posture, to the flicker of tension in her eyes. Agatha’s voice was steady, but her eyes betrayed her.</p><p>Agatha continued, gaze unwavering. “You’ve given up so much to move in with me and the boys. I know their alot, and you do so much for them, for me. And I…I’ve barely made time for you outside the house. That’s not on purpose, but still. I don’t want you to feel stuck at home. Or to one day wake up and realize it’s not enough. That I’m not enough.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened.</p><p>She reached across the table and covered Agatha’s hand with her own, grounding her.</p><p>“Agatha, look at me.”</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes finally met hers, Rio’s chest ached at the vulnerability laid bare there, the fear that she would slip away.</p><p>“You’ve done more for me than anyone else ever has,” Rio said, her voice thick. “You opened your home to me. You let me into your world, into your family. Built me a gym and a mini indoor florists. That isn’t small. That’s everything. Yes, the boys are a lot sometimes, but they’re yours, and I love them. I love you. I don’t outings to champagne rooftops or expensive date nights to prove that.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, blinking too quickly. “But I want to give them to you. I don’t ever want you to feel like you settled for this… for me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a soft smile, even as her chest cracked open. “Agatha, I didn’t settle. Anyone would be jumping at the chance to be with you. I chose you. And I’d choose you a thousand times over. You don’t have to do better. You already are my better.”</p><p>The city glittered around them, but Rio only saw Agatha, her strength and her doubt, her sharp edges and the way she softened only with her. And in that moment, she thought there was nowhere else she’d rather be.</p><p>She traced slow circles over the back of Agatha’s hand, studying the woman across from her.</p><p>Usually Agatha radiated control, sharp, decisive, utterly unshaken. But tonight, beneath the candlelight and the glittering skyline, there was a crack in her armor.</p><p>“What brought all this on?” Rio asked softly. “You’re usually so sure of yourself.”</p><p>Agatha gave a quiet laugh, but it was brittle. She took a sip of wine, as though buying herself a second, then lowered the glass with careful precision.</p><p>“I’ve never been anyone’s choice before,” she said at last. Her voice was low, steady on the surface but tight beneath. “The boys… they didn’t get to choose me. I’m just the person they ended up with. And my own mother—” Her mouth twisted. “She used to remind me daily that she never wanted me. That I ruined her life, that no one could ever love me, not really. And I believed her. For a long time… And then I met you. You have women all over the internet thirsting over you daily, I want to make sure you know how much I appreciate you choosing to be with me.”</p><p>Rio’s heart lurched.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze drifted away, out toward the glittering city, though her fingers still clung to Rio’s as if she couldn’t bear to let go. “I don’t want to do anything to lose you. And I know—” she hesitated, her throat working. “I know I’m not easy. I know the house is chaos and I bury myself in work and schedules, and I don’t… I don’t make enough space for us outside of being home with the boys. For you. You deserve more than just the scraps I can manage after everything else.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>But Agatha pressed on, words tumbling faster now, like a confession. “You walked into my life and took on everything that came with it. You’ve been so patient with the boys. With me. You do things for them without even thinking. Without needing to, you just do. And sometimes I lie awake at night and think what if one day you wake up and realise you could have something easier? Someone with less baggage. Someone who takes you out, who doesn’t just do home cooked dinners and evenings in bed with you.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened, the weight of Agatha’s words sinking into her. She looked at the woman across from her and saw the girl underneath, the one who’d been told over and over by her own blood that she was unwanted.</p><p>Gently, Rio squeezed her hand. “You’re wrong,” Rio whispered. “About all of it. Your boys may not have been born to you, but they love you. And as for me? I chose this. I chose you. Every day, I choose you again. Not in spite of the twins, or the chaos of tiktok or the hectic schedules. Because of you. Because you’re worth it. All of you. Even the parts you think aren’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s composure cracked. Her lips trembled, and she looked down, blinking hard, as if afraid that if she let the tears fall, she wouldn’t be able to stop.</p><p>Rio reached across the table and gently tipped Agatha’s chin back up. “You don’t have to prove yourself to me. I love being at home with you, and with them. That’s all I want.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh, her hand tightening around Rio’s like it was an anchor. “You have no idea how much I love you, and how terrifying that is for me.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her own eyes burning. “I love you too, my love.”</p><p>The waiter slipped in and out quietly, leaving behind plates of food neither gave their full attention to.</p><p>Rio reached across the table more than she ate, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles, letting her palm rest against hers, or curling their fingers together.</p><p>Agatha tried to hide it but every time Rio’s hand lingered, every time her fingertips traced over the ridge of her wrist, Agatha melted just a little more.</p><p>When Rio leaned across to taste a bite from her plate, her arm brushed against Agatha’s, and she didn’t move away. Instead, she turned her hand palm-up beneath the table, and Rio slid hers into it without hesitation. Their joined hands rested in Agatha’s lap the entire meal, Rio tracing idle shapes against her skin while they talked about nothing in particular.</p><p>By the time dessert arrived, Agatha wasn’t eating much at all. She was watching Rio, almost like she couldn’t quite believe she was there with her, black dress hugging her body, eyes warm, mouth curved in a smile meant only for her.</p><p>And Rio felt it too, every brush of knees beneath the table, every accidental touch that lingered longer than it should. She felt it in her soul, this woman was hers.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the house the camera bobbed as Tommy narrated dramatically, “One evening without adult supervision. Morale is high, soda intake is higher and Billys boyfriend is here.”</p><p>Eddie popped into frame, holding chopsticks wrong on purpose just to annoy Billy. “Dumpling king!”</p><p>Billy shoved him, laughing. “Stop embarrassing yourself!”</p><p>The chat  was a flurry of comments.</p><p>- EDDIE IS BACK 😭<br/>- This is boyband energy<br/>- WHERE’S AUNT AGATHA &amp; RIO 👀</p><p>When Agatha and Rio returned, the house was quiet. The boys had collapsed into a pile of blankets on the sofa, empty boxes and soda cans scattered around them.</p><p>Eddie’s head rested precariously against Billy’s shoulder, Tommy snored softly in the opposite corner.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Looks like they survived.”</p><p>“Barely,” Agatha muttered, lips twitching. Then, with her usual decisiveness she called out, “Shoes on, Eddie. I’ll drive you home.”</p><p>Eddie blinked awake, startled. “Oh—uh—yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Billy sat bolt upright, a pout on his lips and a scowl on his face. “He can’t stay?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not on a school night. He’s welcome this weekend, provided his parents agree. But I won’t have you half-dead at class tomorrow.”</p><p>Billy tried to argue but Agatha’s tone left no room. “School first, everything else after.”</p><p>The G Wagon hummed down the quiet streets, Eddie in the passenger seat, looking both nervous and grateful.</p><p>“Did you enjoy yourself tonight?” Agatha asked, eyes on the road but her voice softened.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. Thank you for letting me come over. Billy—uh—Billy’s always said no when I’ve asked before.”</p><p>Her lips curved faintly. “Billy doesn’t invite people home. Consider it a compliment.”</p><p>Eddie grinned, awkward but sincere. “I really like him. And Tommy’s hilarious. And your girlfriend’s—uh—cool.”</p><p>Agatha actually chuckled at that. “Rio is… very cool, yes.”</p><p>When they reached Eddie’s house, she insisted on walking him to the door. His parents answered tired but polite as Agatha introduced herself.</p><p>Within five minutes, she’d explained who she was, that Eddie was welcome to sleep over at her home on weekends, and that she would personally ensure he was safe and well-fed if they agreed.</p><p>His mother looked relieved that her sons boyfriends family was so accepting. His father shook her hand like it was a business deal, promising it was fine for Eddie to stay tomorrow and Saturday night.</p><p>Eddie whispered as he ducked inside, “Thank you, ma’am. See you soon.”</p><p>By the time Agatha returned, the twins were in their own beds, doors closed. Rio was waiting on the porch, arms crossed, smiling knowingly.</p><p>“You didn’t just drop him off, did you?” she teased.</p><p>“Of course not. I spoke to his parents. Made sure they knew he’s welcome here. I don’t want them thinking their son has fallen in with a pack of feral children with no adult supervision.”</p><p>Rio laughed, tugging her closer by the lapel.</p><p>“You’re incredible, you know that?”</p><p>“Not incredible. Responsible.”</p><p>Rio kissed her, hard, cutting her off. “No. Incredible.” Then she tugged Agatha’s hand. “And we’re going upstairs. Right now.”</p><p>The moment their bedroom door closed, Rio pressed Agatha against it, kissing her hard before reaching for Agatha’s face with both hands, brushing her thumbs along her jaw.</p><p>“I know we covered most of it at the restaurant, but you’ve been carrying it all evening,” she murmured. “Talk to me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She closed her eyes, leaning into Rio’s palms, then turned her head just enough to press a kiss to the base of her thumb. When she opened her eyes again, there was no pretense left.</p><p>“My mother used to tell me I was poison,” Agatha said, voice raw in the dim lamplight. “That no one could love me, not really. That people might pretend, but they’d always leave. And I believed her. I still hear it sometimes, like an echo I can’t shake.”</p><p>Rio’s hands slid from her jaw to her shoulders, down her arms, grounding her with warmth. She stepped closer until there was no space left between them, until she could feel Agatha’s heart hammering against her chest.</p><p>“You are not poison,” Rio whispered fiercely. “You’re the most extraordinary woman I’ve ever known. And if your mother couldn’t see that, that’s her failure not yours.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist, clinging as though she might disappear otherwise. Her forehead pressed against Rio’s, her voice breaking now. “I don’t know what to do with this. With you. You love me so easily, and I’m terrified of breaking it. Of breaking you.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again, slow, tender, her lips moving like a promise against hers. When she pulled back, her fingers slid into Agatha’s hair, nails grazing lightly at her scalp. “You won’t break me. You won’t lose me. The only thing you have to do is be you.”</p><p>For a long moment, Agatha simply held on, her hands trembling slightly against Rio’s back. And Rio touched her everywhere she could, her hair, her jaw, the slope of her shoulders, the small of her back, anchoring her to the present, reminding her with every brush of skin that she was wanted, chosen, cherished.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha’s breathing steadied, her face pressed into the crook of Rio’s neck. When she finally spoke, her voice was muffled, but the words carried a fragile honesty, “I think this is the first time I’ve ever believed someone when they said they loved me.”</p><p>Rio tightened her hold and whispered back, “And I’ll keep proving it. Every day.”</p>

<p>The sun wasn’t even properly up yet when Rio padded barefoot into the kitchen, the hem of Agatha’s robe brushing her thighs. Her hair was a wild halo, skin still carrying the faint flush of the night before.</p><p>Agatha was already at the counter, coffee steaming between her hands, dressed in grey slacks and a crisp white blouse as if she hadn’t been writhing and gasping under Rio’s mouth hours ago.</p><p>Rio leaned lazily against the doorframe, drinking her in, lips curling into a grin she couldn’t suppress. The sheer composure of Agatha in lawyer mode only made the memory of her, messy and unrestrained as Rio brought her to completion over and over, burn hotter in her chest.</p><p>Agatha glanced over, arching a brow, her lips twitching despite herself. “You look far too pleased with yourself for this hour.”</p><p>Rio pushed off the frame and closed the distance without a word. She caged Agatha against the pantry door, her palms flat on either side of her head, her body crowding close. The scent of coffee, expensive perfume, and the lingering trace of skin warmed between sheets wrapped around them.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio whispered, her voice low and rough, lips brushing the corner of Agatha’s mouth. “You look dangerous like this. Gorgeous. Beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her chin up, her eyes brightening, betraying the heat pooling beneath her restraint. “Thank you,” she replied softly, her control already fraying at the edges.</p><p>Rio smirked, her mouth ghosting along Agatha’s jaw. “I want you back in our bed. Legs open, begging for more. I want to taste you until you’re trembling. Keep you filled and aching with my tongue, then my strap, until the only word you remember is my name. Until you’re so throughly fucked you can’t walk for the rest of the day.”</p><p>Her lips found Agatha’s in a kiss that started slow, teasing, coaxing, but quickly deepened. Tongues tangling, teeth grazing, a wet, hungry clash that pulled a low sound from Agatha’s throat despite her best efforts.</p><p>Agatha’s hands betrayed her, sliding up Rio’s arms, curling into her shoulders, clutching like she needed an anchor. The sharp lines of her blouse crushed against the thin silk of the robe, every brush of fabric and skin sparked fire between them.</p><p>Rio pressed harder, letting her body fit against Agatha’s, thigh nudging between hers, just enough friction to make Agatha’s breath hitch audibly. The heat built quickly, their mouths breaking only long enough for Rio to drag her lips down Agatha’s neck, tasting the softness there, lingering over her pulse until Agatha’s head tipped back against the pantry door.</p><p>For one breathless moment, it seemed Agatha would surrender. Her composure cracked, her lips parted, her body leaning into Rio’s as though craving more.</p><p>But then, with a trembling exhale and a reluctant laugh, she pressed her palm to Rio’s chest and forced a sliver of distance between them. Her lips were swollen, her breath ragged.</p><p>“Rain check,” she whispered, her voice husky, pupils blown, betraying how much she wanted to say yes. “I have court.”</p><p>Rio grinned, wicked and certain, brushing one last kiss against her mouth, slow and lingering. “Then I’ll hold you to that rain check.”</p><p>Before Agatha could retort, the twins barreled in like chaos incarnate. “Why are you pinning Amanda to a door like a caveman?” Tommy demanded, already reaching for a cereal bar and fake gagging. “We do not need to see this, keep it PG, please.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, kissing Rio once more before ducking under her arm, smoothing her blouse with unsteady fingers, but the flush in her cheeks and the tremor in her breath said she was already thinking about tonight.</p><p>“You have everything you need for today?”</p><p>At confirmation from both boys, Agatha grabbed her keys with one more quick kiss to Rios lips and a cheeky squeeze to her arse, they bustled out to school and work, leaving Rio grinning like an idiot.</p><p>Friday evening, the house buzzed louder than usual. Billy paced the hallway with his phone clutched in his hand, checking the time for the hundredth time.</p><p>Tommy was sprawled on the sofa with his gaming headset, bellowing insults into the mic like his life depended on it.</p><p>When the knock finally came, Billy nearly tripped over his own feet racing for the door. Eddie stood there, a little awkward but smiling, holding a bag of snacks like peace offerings, a backpack slung over one shoulder as his mom drove away with a wave over her shoulder.</p><p>“Uh, hi,” Eddie said, giving Billy the kind of shy grin that immediately made Tommy wolf whistle from the couch.</p><p>“Boooooyfriend alert!” Tommy sing-songed into his mic. “Oh my god, Billy’s blushing. Somebody call NASA, his face is a supernova.”</p><p>Billy groaned, dragging Eddie inside by the sleeve. “Shut up, Tommy.”</p><p>Before he could say anything else, Agatha appeared in the hall, arms folded, blouse still perfectly crisp despite being in court all day and it being Friday night. One eyebrow arched in surgical precision. “Eddie.”</p><p>Eddie straightened instantly, like a soldier caught slouching. “Ma’am.”</p><p>Billy’s blush went nuclear. “Aunt Agatha, please don’t embarrass me again.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was cool, precise, but there was the faintest glint of amusement in her eyes. “You are more than welcome here, Eddie. But you will sleep in the guest room. That is non-negotiable. Clear?”</p><p>Billy dragged a hand down his face. “Yes, Aunt Agatha.”</p><p>Eddie nodded obediently. “Of course, ma’am.”</p><p>“Good boys.” She patted their cheeks in perfect deadpan before sweeping back toward her study, calling over her shoulder that she’d start dinner once Rio was home.</p><p>From the doorway, Tommy was recording on his phone, cackling.</p><p>- SHE REALLY SAID OBJECTION, NO SHARED BED 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀<br/>- Guest room 😭<br/>- Eddie looks like he just survived a inquisition</p><p>Billy swiped at him, mortified.</p><p>Later, the kitchen smelled of tomato and basil, a homemade lasagne baking in the oven, a crisp salad waiting in the fridge.</p><p>Rio was fresh from the gym, hair tied up, tank top showing off muscles Tommy pretended not to be impressed by.</p><p>Somewhere between dinner and the movie, Rio slid her hand under the table to squeeze Agatha’s knee. Agatha didn’t flinch, but her lips curved, just barely, into the kind of smile that made Rio grin like a fool. The teens noticed, of course, Tommy made gagging noises, Billy kicked him under the table.</p><p>“You two are disgusting,” Tommy muttered.</p><p>“Your just Jealous,” Rio shot back, stealing a bite of Lasagne off Agatha’s plate without looking.</p><p>Agatha only rolled her eyes, but she didn’t move her hand away when Rio laced their fingers together.</p><p>After the movie ended and the chaos died down, Agatha found Eddie in the guest room, setting his backpack by the bed. She set an extra blanket at the foot and, for once, her voice softened.</p><p>“I meant what I said earlier,” she told him. “You’re welcome here, Eddie. Whenever you want. Just because you have to sleep separate doesn’t mean you aren’t.”</p><p>Eddie’s shoulders relaxed instantly, relief washing over his face. “Thank you ma’am.”</p><p>She smiled, a real smile, “You can call me Agatha.”</p><p>“Thank you Agatha.”</p><p>Her lips twitched at his correction, pleased. She gave his arm a small squeeze before leaving him to settle in.</p><p>Later, when the boys were upstairs brushing teeth, Eddie nudged Billy with a grin. “You know… your aunts are really cute together.”</p><p>Billy groaned, burying his face in his hands but he didn’t correct him on the term for Rio. “Don’t say that, don’t encourage them.”</p><p>Eddie laughed. “I’m just saying. It’s nice. They clearly love each other.”</p><p>Billy peeked through his fingers, pouting. “Yeah, It’s cute. I usually ship them. Whatever. Doesn’t change the fact you can’t sleep in my room.”</p><p>“Rules are rules,” Eddie teased, leaning closer.<br/>Billy flopped dramatically back onto his bed. “It’s torture.”</p><p>From the hallway, Tommy’s voice called, “Cry louder, Shakespeare, maybe Amy will turn a blind eye if you sneak him in after she’s gone to bed.”</p><p>“Shut UP, Tommy!”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>Billy and Agathas voices chorused together.</p><p>By the Saturday morning, Eddie was more than comfortable in the maximoff/harkness/vidal household.</p><p>Agatha nursed her coffee, eyes glinting over the rim. “Jen and Lilia are coming over tonight. Rio, you should invite Alice.”</p><p>Rio perked up immediately. “She’s going to adore that, let me text her.”</p><p>Tommy leaned across the table toward Eddie. “Just so you know, once the wine starts, they go feral.”</p><p>Eddie shrugged. “Fine by me. I’ll just hang with you two.”</p><p>Billy kicked Tommy under the table, daring him to intrude on his time with his boyfriend while Agatha was distracted.</p><p>Jen and Lilia stormed in first, bearing wine and hugging Rio like they’d known her forever. Alice arrived next, arms full of snacks, already talking a mile a minute.</p><p>Alice beamed at Agatha. “Your place is gorgeous. Total vision board material - no wonder Rio couldn’t wait to move in.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, smirk on her face. “That and the sex.”</p><p>Alice cackled. “God, I love her.”</p><p>Jen immediately dragged Alice into a whirlwind of chatter. Lilia tried to argue with Agatha about wine pairings and was shut down with surgical precision.</p><p>Rio sat back with her glass of sauvignon, glowing at how easily herself and Alice fit into the group.</p><p>At one point, Rio leaned across and kissed Agatha’s cheek mid-debate. “You’re the hottest wine snob alive,” she teased.</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “You’re biased.”</p><p>“Obviously,” Rio said, proud.</p><p>Tommy, Eddie, and Billy had claimed the sofa instead of staying in the garden with the adults, disappearing upstairs as it approached 11pm, Eddie trailing after them with sleepy goodbyes.</p><p>Tommy called down, “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” before Agatha raised one sharp eyebrow that sent him bolting the rest of the way up the stairs.</p><p>Once the teenagers disappeared upstairs, the mood shifted. The fairy lights glowed like embers, the playlist softened to sultry jazz and the group lounged in the garden furniture under the stars.</p><p>Alice refilled everyone’s glasses with a flourish that nearly sloshed red across the table. “To sapphic chaos,” she proclaimed.</p><p>Jen snorted. “That is… actually fitting.”</p><p>Lilia raised her glass, eyes sparkling. “I think it’s a perfect toast.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, one arm draped around Agatha’s shoulders. Her girlfriend melted into her touch, tilting her head against Rio’s collarbone like it was the most natural pillow in the world.</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha murmured low, voice molten, meant only for Rio. “You smell so good.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “That’s the wine, my love.”</p><p>But Agatha shook her head. “No. That’s you. Irritatingly perfect. Unfairly so.” She dragged her finger around the rim of her glass, eyes never leaving Rio’s face. “I love how you smell.”</p><p>Rio froze. Agatha was being exactly as she always was, even in front of their combined friend group.</p><p>Alice gasped dramatically and leaned across the table toward Lilia. “Oh. My. God. She’s sappy drunk. Does this happen alot?”</p><p>Jen nearly dropped her glass. “Never. In the decade I’ve known her I’ve never seen her like this. She’s clinically allergic to affection unless it’s the twins.”</p><p>Rio only laughed, her heart threatening to crack open, and kissed the top of Agatha’s head. “Guess I’m the exception.”</p><p>Agatha tilted up, gaze heavy and unguarded. “You are.”</p><p>The table went still. Even Alice didn’t dare joke but eventually the three women drew one another into a heated debate about tarot - ignoring the two hosts.</p><p>Agatha shifted suddenly, sliding almost catlike into Rio’s lap with zero shame, blouse rumpled, long legs draped across Rio’s thighs. She clutched at Rio’s jaw with steady fingers, staring at her like the room had vanished.</p><p>“Do you know,” she whispered softly, “how unfair it is? You move anywhere near me and suddenly I forget how to breathe.”</p><p>Rio flushed crimson, utterly undone. “Agatha.”</p><p>Alice slapped a hand over her mouth. “SHE’S FLIRTING. OUT LOUD.”</p><p>Lilia was doubled over, whispering through giggles, “She’s purring. She’s literally purring into Rio’s neck. What is happening.”</p><p>Agatha ignored them all, tugging Rio closer until their noses brushed. “Say you’ll never leave me,” she demanded, voice husky with both wine and something rawer.</p><p>“Never,” Rio promised, breathless. “Not in a million years.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then, hungry, all wine-sweet lips and laughter. Rio kissed back, one hand cradling Agatha’s jaw as though she might dissolve if she let go.</p><p>Alice nearly fell out of her chair. “HELLO?? Is no one else witnessing this??”</p><p>Jen’s mouth hung open, utterly stunned. “I think I need another drink.”</p><p>The rest of the night blurred into giddy chaos.</p><p>Lilia told outrageous stories about her work as a psychic  that had everyone howling. Alice and Jen launched into a ridiculous competition of over-the-top flirting with one another until Alice ended up wearing Jen’s jacket, one leg draped across the other woman.</p><p>Rio kept sneaking Agatha sips of water, only for Agatha to stubbornly press kisses to Rio’s palm instead.</p><p>At one point Agatha tried to serenade Rio, collapsing into giggles halfway through, her face buried in Rio’s neck. Rio couldn’t stop laughing, couldn’t stop kissing her hair, couldn’t stop glowing under the weight of her girlfriend’s shameless adoration.</p><p>By the time yawns overtook laughter and empty bottles lay scattered, the house softened into a sleepy hush.</p><p>Alice and Jen had vanished into the other guest room together, Lilia curled on the couch with a blanket, and only Rio and Agatha remained awake.</p><p>Agatha had gone boneless across Rio’s lap, hair wild. When Rio tried to stand, Agatha made a noise of protest, clinging tighter.</p><p>“Bedtime, my love,” Rio coaxed, brushing a strand of dark hair from her flushed cheek.</p><p>Agatha blinked up, slow and feline. “…Only if you carry me.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, sliding one arm under her knees and another behind her back. Agatha squeaked in mock outrage, then immediately wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck like a queen claiming her throne.</p><p>“Of course she lifts her,” Alice’s sleepy voice called faintly from the top of the stairs. “I knew it.”</p><p>Agatha only smirked against Rio’s collarbone. “Good girl,” she whispered smugly, drunk and utterly unfiltered.</p><p>Rio nearly tripped on the stairs, laughing so hard she thought her chest might burst.</p><p>After she’d deposited a still giggling Agatha on their bed,  Rio paused outside each twins’ door. She nudged them open gently with her foot.</p><p>Tommy was sprawled across his bed in what could only be described as a starfish position, one leg dangling, earbuds still in.</p><p>Billy was curled neatly, a book open on his chest, fast asleep. Thankfully Eddie was still within the confines of the first guest bedroom, meaning she didn’t have to burst Agathas happy bubble.</p><p>As Rio moved back into their bedroom, Agathas pulled her down onto the bed with her, lips finding Rio’s with an urgency that startled them both.</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Agatha murmured against her mouth, voice wrecked with wine and want. “All day and night I’ve been thinking about what you said this morning.”</p><p>Rio cupped her cheek, brushing her thumb over flushed skin as she gave a cheeky gap toothed grin. “That was the goal.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was breathless, half-broken on a moan as Rio pulled her top over head, lips latching onto her chest, tongue lathing before trailing back up to her lips.</p><p>Rio kissed her like an answer, deep and lingering, her hands sliding into Agatha’s hair. Agatha sighed into it, almost a whimper, and tugged Rio until she was straddling her lap.</p><p>Rio’s body pressed to hers, heat sparking where silk met bare skin. Agatha arched up, a little wild, as she tangled her legs around Rio’s waist.</p><p>She traced Agatha’s collarbone with trembling lips, leaving a trail of kisses across her throat.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her fingers clutching at Rio’s shoulders with surprising desperation.</p><p>“More,” Agatha whispered, head falling back. “Don’t stop. Don’t you dare stop.”</p><p>Rio pulled back just long enough to look at her cheeks flushed, hair loose, eyes dark with hunger and nearly lost her breath.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Rio whispered fiercely. “Do you even know what you’re doing to me?”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly, though her voice cracked with truth. “Please Rio. I want you. I need you.”</p><p>The words spilled raw, reckless, and Rio kissed them right off her lips, hungrily, reverently, as though she could devour every doubt Agatha ever had.</p><p>She moved her lips then to her forehead, her cheeks, the tip of her nose, all the way up her ears and down her neck, all while desperately trying to create friction by rocking against the woman under her.</p><p>Agathas moans grew higher before ending in a whine as Rio pulled away, biting her lip as Rio stripped down until she was in nothing but a harness. Attached to it was her favourite strap.</p><p>Rio moved in between Agathas legs and kissed her again. Her hands groped at her breasts and Agatha couldn’t help but moan, grabbing a pillow to muffle the sound lest any of their guests or her boys overhear.</p><p>She was already so stimulated that every touch felt like a bonfire surging through her.</p><p>Rio focused on Agathas chest, sucking at the delicate skin, marking her as she spread Agathas legs open, extremely thankful for Agathas flexibility as she threw her leg up onto her shoulder.</p><p>The sight ofAgatha, completely undine and open for her sent a wave of heat down Rios stomach.</p><p>Her fingers plunged into Agatha easily and came out covered in slick, she tasted them with a moan before moving them back inside, teasing her entrance with soft thrusts. Agathas back arched and she moaned Rios name again, all while gripping at the sheets around her.</p><p>Rio didn’t spend much time teasing, too eager to fuck her as thoroughly as she promised that morning. She positioned her hips, the edge of her strap poking at her entrance. She slid the strap in inch by inch until she was fully buried, both women groaned at the sensation.</p><p>Rio leaned forward so that their foreheads were touching as she began to thrust slowly, one hand reaching for Agathas, wanting as much of her touching as possible.</p><p>Agatha pulled her into a kiss, all tongue as she panted against Rios lips, moans and whimpers escaping at each thrust, pupils blown.</p><p>Rio shifted her hand to spread her even further, pressing even deeper as she quickened the pace, the strap hitting her clit at just the right angle that she worried she wouldn’t last.</p><p>She changed the angle slightly to hit the spot inside Agatha that made everything go white and fuzzy with lust. Agatha bit her lip to muffle the sounds she was making, hands reaching to pull Rio even closer.</p><p>Rio continued to thrust harshly, bringing her hand down to rub circles around Agathas clit - it was all too much in all the best ways.</p><p>Her movements were harsh and desperate, pushing up and into Agatha so that the strap went deeper inside and hit that special spot again and again. Her movements became shorter and choppier until her climax finally hit and everything froze. Agathas body clenched around her strap at the same time, mouth parted in a silent scream, eyes scrunched tight. Rio almost came again just from looking at her.</p><p>Rio left the strap inside as she tenderly kissed Agatha, brushing sweaty strands of hair back from her forehead with a grin, taking in Agathas exhausted state.</p><p>She only gave her a minute before softly rolling her hips again, “I’m going to keep you just like this all night.”</p><p>It was a promise that she kept.</p>

<p>It hit Rio before dawn. One moment she was fast asleep, the next she was bolting upright, stumbling for the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha woke instantly, her instincts sharper than an alarm clock. She sat up in bed, dark hair loose around her face. “Rio?”</p><p>The sound of retching from the ensuite answered for her.</p><p>Agatha padded across the room, pushed the door open gently. Rio knelt miserably on the tiled floor, arms wrapped around her middle, forehead resting against the cool porcelain. She groaned without lifting her head. “I think I’m dying.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, half concern, half amusement at the dramatic declaration. “It’s stomach flu, not the plague.” She crouched, sweeping back Rio’s sweaty hair with careful fingers. “Though you do look rather tragic.”</p><p>Rio let out a weak laugh that turned into another groan. “Don’t be mean to the sick one.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha said softly, pressing a cool washcloth against her forehead. “I’m staying home today to look after you.”</p><p>Rio cracked one eye open. “You’ve got court.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her damp temple. “I’ll file for a continuance or ask Jen to cover me. They’ll survive. You need me at home.”</p><p>She set Rio up on the sofa before bustling around sorting out the twins lunches ready for school drop off.</p><p>Billy and Tommy hovered, fascinated by the sight of Rio completely out of commission (after checking over and over that it was nothing serious and she’d be okay.)</p><p>“Should I TikTok this? Nurse Agatha in the wild?” Billy whispered, phone half-raised towards her.</p><p>Agatha shot him a glare sharp enough to slice steel. “If you film her like this, I’ll confiscate your phone and bar Eddie from staying over for a month.”</p><p>Tommy snorted, ducking behind the armrest. “Aprils scary nurse mode activated.”</p><p>Rio croaked from under the blanket. “Thank god. I look like a cryptid.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but tucked the blanket tighter around her, smoothing Rio’s hair back. “You look like someone I intend to fuss over all day. Don’t argue.”</p><p>As soon as she’d dropped the boys off, Agatha set up her laptop at the kitchen island, emails flying between sips of coffee. Every so often she abandoned her work to check on Rio, who was bundled under a blanket on the sofa with tissues, ginger tea, and a bucket nearby.</p><p>Agatha’s version of nursing wasn’t clumsy or chaotic, it was precision care, like everything she did. She brewed ginger tea, squeezed lemon into warm water, laid out dry toast on a porcelain plate. Every hour she checked Rio’s temperature, tutting at the flush in her cheeks.</p><p>When Rio drifted into feverish half-sleep, Agatha adjusted the blanket and sat with her, scrolling quietly through case notes with one hand while the other rested on Rio’s hip beneath the blanket.</p><p>At one point, Rio stirred and rasped, “You should work.”</p><p>“I am working,” Agatha murmured, eyes still on her screen. “And caring for you. I can multitask.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, eyes closing again. “Lucky me.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down and kissed her forehead.“Yes. Lucky you.”</p><p>Rio, as it turned out, was not an easy patient.</p><p>By midmorning, she was restless under the blanket, shifting like a cat trapped in a box. “I hate being horizontal,” she complained, flinging the covers halfway off her overheated body.</p><p>Agatha, still beside her with her laptop open, didn’t even look up. “Stay put.”</p><p>“I feel gross.”</p><p>“You are gross at the moment,” Agatha replied dryly, finally glancing over. “But you’re also feverish, which is why you’re not moving.”</p><p>Rio groaned and pulled the blanket back over herself. “You’re bossy.”</p><p>“You love it,” Agatha said calmly, typing a reply to an email. “Drink your tea.”</p><p>When Rio reached for the mug too quickly and sloshed ginger tea onto her pajama top, she cursed softly. Agatha was up in a second, towel in hand, blotting at the spill without irritation.</p><p>“You’re impossible,” she murmured, but her fingers smoothed Rio’s damp shirt tenderly before tucking the blanket back in around her.</p><p>By noon, the fever had spiked again. Rio sprawled dramatically, forearm over her eyes. “This is how I die. On your nice sofa. At least bury me with my plants.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the theatrics. She returned from the kitchen with a bowl of ice water and a stack of soft cloths. “You are not dying,” she said, wringing out a compress. “You are, however, going to hold still.”</p><p>She pressed the cool cloth against Rio’s flushed forehead. Rio sighed audibly, tension melting from her shoulders.</p><p>“That’s unfair,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“What is?”</p><p>“You being so good at everything.” She tilted her head toward Agatha’s careful hands. “Like a five-star spa treatment for flu.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow but didn’t let go of the compress. “Do you require cucumber slices for your eyes as well?”</p><p>Rio cracked a weak smile. “Only if you feed me grapes.”</p><p>“Be serious,” Agatha chided, but her lips curved too.</p><p>Later, when Agatha brought out homemade chicken broth (real stock, simmered for hours, not from a carton), Rio wrinkled her nose. “I don’t want food.”</p><p>“You need food.”</p><p>“I’ll throw it up.”</p><p>“You’ll try,” Agatha said firmly, settling beside her on the sofa with the bowl. “Open your mouth.”</p><p>Rio gave her a look like a sulky teenager. “You’re enjoying this too much.”</p><p>Agatha smoothed her hair back, utterly serene. “I enjoy keeping you alive.”</p><p>Under her steady gaze, Rio finally accepted a spoonful. She grimaced, then blinked. “Wait. That’s actually good.”</p><p>“I am an exceptional cook,” Agatha said smugly, feeding her another spoonful.</p><p>“You could weaponize this soup.”</p><p>“I just did,” Agatha replied. “And it worked.”</p><p>By evening, the boys had been bribed with pizza delivery, barricaded in their rooms with video games and homework. Rio’s fever had dipped, leaving her achy and exhausted. She tried shifting to her side, wincing at the stiffness in her back.</p><p>Agatha noticed instantly. “Turn over,” she instructed.</p><p>“What, why?”</p><p>“Because you’re sore.” She patted the sofa. “Do as I say.”</p><p>Too weak to argue, Rio rolled carefully onto her stomach. Agatha’s hands, cool and strong, found her shoulders and began to knead with quiet precision.</p><p>Rio groaned into the pillow. “Oh my god. You’re wasted as a lawyer.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was low, almost fond. “Don’t think masseuses make as much money.”</p><p>Every knot of tension seemed to unravel beneath Agatha’s touch, her thumbs firm, her movements steady and deliberate. For the first time all day, Rio let herself truly relax, sinking under the warmth of Agatha’s care.</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” she mumbled, half-asleep already. “Who even…does this much?”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, lips brushing the nape of her neck. “Someone who loves you.”</p><p>After turning Rio nearly boneless, she returned back to the sofa carrying another bowl of soup, crackers, and a glass of cold water.</p><p>Rio managed a small laugh. “Michelin star chef.”</p><p>Agatha perched beside her, spoon-feeding her again like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>“Don’t mock me. I could have made you something heavy, but you’d hate me for it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed the broth gratefully, blinking at her. “Why are you so good to me?”</p><p>Agatha set the spoon down, her expression softening. “You are to me too.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. She reached for Agatha’s hand, squeezing weakly. “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha stilled, then leaned in, brushing her lips across Rio’s knuckles. “And I, you. Always.”</p><p>Agatha knew it was coming as soon as she woke up. She walked into the kitchen in silk pajamas, hair pinned up, already internally prepping Rio’s tea tray, when she found Billy slumped over the Island like a collapsed marionette.</p><p>“Morning,” he croaked.</p><p>“You sound like you swallowed gravel,” Agatha observed, setting the tray down and brushing his forehead with her palm. “You’re burning up.”</p><p>From the hallway came a pitiful groan. Tommy shuffled in, dragging his blanket around his shoulders like a cape, pale and glassy-eyed. “I think I’m dying too.”</p><p>Agatha blinked once. Then, very calmly, she said, “Of course. Of course it’s all of you.”</p><p>Within an hour, her living room had been converted into a sick bay. The twins were set up on each side of the sofa with duvets, pillows, and a rotation of water bottles and tissues. Rio lay stretched out in the corner, bundled up and sulking.</p><p>Tommy, pale and sniffling, glaring at his phone like it had betrayed him gave Rio the side eye “You gave me your flu.”</p><p>Rio sat upright, wrapped in a blanket cocoon, hair sticking up in seventeen directions. “Excuse you—my germs don’t have that much range.”</p><p>Billy sneezed explosively. “They did.”</p><p>From the kitchen, Agatha’s voice drifted, maddeningly composed: “They did not. Wash your hands, both of you.”</p><p>Agatha moved like a general, orchestrating everything. Bowls of broth, trays of ginger tea, a strict medicine schedule. She’d swapped her court clothes for joggers and a soft sweater, hair still pulled back but a towel slung over one shoulder like she was running triage.</p><p>“Soup is ready,” she announced, coming in with three bowls steaming in her hands.</p><p>Billy groaned, face half-buried in a pillow. “Soup?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Do we get choices?” Tommy asked weakly.</p><p>“No.” Agatha set the bowls down on trays, unbothered by their whining. “It’s this, or nothing.”</p><p>Rio raised a finger from her cocoon. “I want toast.”</p><p>“You’ll eat soup.” Agatha slid a spoon into her hand.</p><p>By midday, the group text from classmates had exploded. Someone had clearly caught wind that both twins were sick, and a flurry of TikTok comments followed underneath their most recent videos.</p><p>Billy, despite the “no tiktoks in the sickroom” order, tried sneaking a live from under his blanket.</p><p>Caption: The household plague, ft. Aunt Agatha as Florence Nightingale.</p><p>- WHY DO THEY STILL LOOK EXPENSIVE WHILE SICK<br/>- WHY IS SHE HOT EVEN WITH A DISH TOWEL???<br/>- Rio looks like a vampire 😂😂😂😂<br/>- MOTHER HEALING THE MASSES<br/>- This is the flu ward I want admitted to</p><p>Agatha noticed the faint glow of a screen and plucked the phone from Billy’s hands with practiced ease. “Confiscated,” she said.</p><p>“Not fair,” Billy groaned.</p><p>“Neither is the flu,” she replied smoothly, tucking the phone into her sweater pocket.</p><p>She rotated cold compresses across three foreheads, dispensed cough syrup with the efficiency of a chemist, and even coaxed Tommy into sipping rehydration salts when he swore he’d rather die.</p><p>Rio, for all her usual strength, had regressed into the whiniest patient of them all. “My back aches. My head hurts.”</p><p>By day two of all of them being ill, Agatha had given up on getting any work done.</p><p>Billy sniffled pitifully. “My throat hurts.”</p><p>Agatha handed him honey and lemon water without a word.</p><p>Tommy whined. “I’m cold.”</p><p>She replaced his compress with a warmed one.</p><p>Rio groaned. “I hate lying down.”</p><p>Agatha fixed her with a look sharp enough to cut glass. “Stay. Down.”</p><p>Rio sank back instantly. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>The twins snorted, deliriously entertained that Rio, the gym-hardass, folded faster than they did.</p><p>Tommy covertly recorded from her left side, whispering into camera. “She has her trained. It’s terrifying.”</p><p>- RIO IS A GOLDEN RETRIEVER IN A BLANKET<br/>- Mother Agatha: 3 / Chaos Gremlins: 0<br/>- Agatha really said I dare you BET</p><p>That night, all three patients were asleep, spread across the sofa like fallen soldiers. Agatha sat between them with her case files open, glasses perched on her nose, hand reaching out occasionally to check foreheads.</p><p>By the next morning, Agatha hadn’t slept much, but the house was quiet. Three sick, snoring bodies were wrapped in blankets, still on the sofa, utterly dependent on her.</p><p>She allowed herself one small smile, smoothed Rio’s hair back, and went to refill the soup pot.</p><p>By the next day, the worst of the plague had passed.</p><p>Rio was propped up on the sofa, still bundled in a blanket, but looking marginally less like death.</p><p>Tommy had color back in his cheeks, and Billy, predictably, was first to reclaim his phone for chaos.</p><p>He had Tommy send him the footage taken over the last few days to make a compilation video.</p><p>It merged Agatha carrying soup trays like military rations to her pressing a cold cloth to Rio’s forehead. Her tucking both twins in at once while balancing a case file under her arm and a slow-mo shot of her pouring them all tea and bring bowls of soup.</p><p>Caption: Our Queen 👸</p><p>- SHE’S NOT A LAWYER SHE’S A HEALER<br/>- Adopt me pls<br/>- Rio better marry her rn<br/>- Nah because when I had flu my mom just sent me to bed 😭😭😭</p><p>By afternoon, Tommy was upright enough to make toast. When Agatha caught him in the kitchen wobbling with the butter knife, she leaned against the counter, arms folded.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to be upright yet.”</p><p>Tommy smirked. “Gotta done Agnes, I’m turning into soup.”</p><p>Agatha snorted despite herself. “Dramatic.” She slid the knife out of his hand, buttered the bread with frightening efficiency, and handed it back. “Eat.”</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, refused to sit still. By day four, she was stretching in the living room, rolling her shoulders like she was minutes away from a workout.</p><p>Agatha walked in mid-sentence, saw her, and stopped cold. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Loosening up.”</p><p>“You still have a fever.”</p><p>Rio gave her a grin, sheepish but cocky. “What if I stretch while horizontal? Compromise.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “I am surrounded by idiots.”</p><p>Billy filmed the whole exchange, whisper-narrating into his phone, “And here we see Amanda trying to control a golden retriever. Wish her luck.</p><p>- RIO SIT DOWN OR SHE’LL MAKE YOU<br/>- The way Agatha’s patience is saint-level 😭<br/>- Protect my pookie at all costs 🥰🥰🥰</p><p>Eventually, Agatha marched over, planted her hand firmly on Rio’s shoulder, and pushed her back down onto the couch with one smooth motion.</p><p>Rio, blushing, whispered, “You’re so hot when you boss me around.”</p><p>Tommy gagged audibly. “I’m still sick, please, don’t do this to me.”</p><p>By the fifth day, all three were laughing again.</p><p>Billy was back to editing chaotic clips. Tommy was nibbling cotton candy grapes from the fridge.<br/>Rio was curled under Agatha’s cashmere throw, looking up at her with open adoration.</p><p>Agatha came in with a tray, chamomile tea, fruit, and neatly folded toast soldiers with soft boiled eggs.</p><p>Rio sat up. “Again? You’ve done enough, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, lips twitching in something dangerously close to a smile. “Don’t be ridiculous. You three are my problem.”</p><p>Billy looked up from his phone. “She loves us.”</p><p>“Confirmed.” Tommy chimed in.</p><p>“I know.” Rio added with a look of pure love, sticking her tongue out at Tommy as she realised he was about to do a live.</p><p>Caption: The plague is leaving our house finally!!!</p><p>He panned the camera over to Billy in his blanket, waving dramatically like a Victorian invalid before moving to Rio. He caught her sneezing, then grinning brightly at Agatha off-camera.</p><p>Agatha moved into frame, completely oblivious, with more honey and lemon tea, hands reaching to check each of their foreheads before disappearing off to the kitchen.</p><p>- SHE’S THE MOM WE ALL DESERVE BUT DONT ALL GET<br/>- The way she looks at Rio<br/>- No, the way Rio looked at her 😍<br/>- Imagine being sick &amp; having this squad to hang with</p><p>That night, all of them were freshly showered and in their own beds before 10pm.</p><p>“You’re… incredible, you know that?” Rio murmured from where she was cuddled against Agathas side.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look down. “Nonsense.”</p><p>“No, seriously. Most people would’ve gone mad looking after us.”</p><p>Agatha finally glanced her way, soft, tired, but still luminous. “Yes, well. You’re worth the madness.”</p><p>Rio leaned up, kissed her temple, and whispered, “I love you too.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning carried a heaviness from the moment the house stirred.</p><p>It wasn’t chaos that filled the air, no rushing for shoes, no teasing over toast. Instead, silence pressed down like an extra presence in the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha had already called the school and booked the twins out for the day. There would be no pretending this was ordinary.</p><p>The kettle hissed. China clinked faintly.</p><p>Agatha moved about the kitchen with her usual elegance, but her composure was softened, fragile at the edges.</p><p>She set plates of toast and scrambled eggs before the boys with a gentleness that wasn’t often so openly shown. Her hand lingered on Tommy’s hair for a heartbeat longer than usual; she squeezed Billy’s hand without him looking up.</p><p>She didn’t urge them to eat, only made sure something was there, a quiet gesture that said ‘I am taking care of you, even if you can’t take care of yourselves today.’</p><p>Rio, sensing the change, didn’t fill the silence. She followed Agatha’s lead, steady and present, her being there a quiet anchor the twins seemed to lean on without realising.</p><p>By late morning, the car rolled down narrow, tree lined lanes, the world outside a muted grey despite the late-summer sun. No one spoke. The silence was heavy but necessary.</p><p>When the iron gates of the cemetery came into view, Billy’s hand twitched, gripping the bouquet of roses tighter. Tommy shifted restlessly in his seat, pressing his lips together.</p><p>The twins carried their flowers, white roses cut fresh from the garden, carefully chosen by them that morning. She let the boys walk ahead, not leading, not instructing, just following. It was their path to take first.</p><p>Seven years.</p><p>The headstone stood waiting, polished and severe against the grass. Wanda and Vision - Loving parents to Billy and Tommy. Forever remembered, forever missed.</p><p>Someone, Agatha, of course, had already left a large bouquet of gorgeous flowers. But Billy and Tommy knelt to add their own. Billy crouched low, his sleeve sweeping across the marble, as though clearing away the dust might clear away the years. Tommy placed his roses down carefully, aligning them just so, and then stepped back, his jaw trembling with the effort of keeping his composure.</p><p>Agatha stood behind them, her tailored coat a shield, her strength the only thing keeping the day from fracturing. She reached out, resting a steadying hand on each boy’s shoulder. Her voice carried the depth of love she always felt for them.  “They would be proud of you. Both of you.”</p><p>Billy blinked hard, swallowing something sharp in his throat. His voice cracked when he muttered, “Yeah.”</p><p>Tommy didn’t speak at all, he only leaned into Agatha’s side, his body trembling with the weight of the loss he was too young to have carried so long.</p><p>Behind them, Rio stayed still, respectful, a silent witness. She watched Billy scrub at his eyes with his sleeve and Tommy cling wordlessly to Agatha’s coat. When Billy’s hand reached blindly for hers, she didn’t hesitate. She closed her fingers around his, stepped forward and held him tight.</p><p>When they returned home, the heaviness didn’t lift but Agatha had one more ritual. She brought out balloons, some deep blue and some crimson red, Vision and Wandas favourite colours, each with a small notecard tied to the ribbon.</p><p>“For your mom and dad,” she said softly, her voice steady though her eyes betrayed the storm beneath. “In the garden.”</p><p>The four of them stepped outside. The air was hushed, the kind of stillness that seemed to hold its breath for grief.</p><p>Billy wrote quickly, shoulders hunched, shielding his card as though the words were too raw to share. His knuckles were white on the pen. Tommy hesitated, chewing the end, frowning hard, struggling with words too big for his age. In the end, he scrawled something short, but his hand lingered over it as though wanting to write more.</p><p>Agatha wrote last. She didn’t read her note aloud, didn’t explain. Her hand lingered on the red ribbon, the balloon trembling faintly as though even it could feel the ache she pressed into the ink.</p><p>She had been her best friend, the one she laughed with, confided in, fought alongside - the first person to ever love her unconditionally, until she too left her.</p><p>The silence between her and the card was heavy with all the things she would never get to say again. She looked up only when she felt Rio’s eyes on her.</p><p>“Would you like to do one?”</p><p>Rio startled. “Me?”</p><p>Tommy nodded, eyes shining. “Yeah. You too.”<br/>Billy’s voice was low but firm. “You’re family now. You should.”</p><p>There was no hesitation in their words, only certainty.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. She took a red balloon, gripped the pen carefully, and wrote slowly, deliberately, I promise I’ll look after them all for you.</p><p>When at last they let go, the balloons rose in a cluster, drifting against the fading sky. The boys tilted their heads back, watching until the last speck of red and blue disappeared into the horizon. Billy whispered something inaudible; Tommy rubbed his face with the back of his hand.<br/>Agatha reached her arms around both twins, pulling them close.</p><p>For a moment her head bowed, eyes closed, her strength flickering, revealing the raw wound of her own grief, the best friend she’d lost, the sister she still mourned. But she held steady, because right now it was about the boys.</p><p>Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s free one. The four of them stood rooted together in the garden, silent.</p><p>Tommy spoke first, childlike in his question. “You’ll be here next year too, right?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Next year?”</p><p>Billy nodded, serious. “For the balloons. And the cemetery. Like… every year. You’ll  be here?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but Rio spoke before she could. Her voice was soft, steady. “I’ll be here. Always.”</p><p>The twins looked satisfied, like they’d received an answer to  something important. They leaned into Agatha, who let them, her eyes shining in the dim light.</p><p>Rio caught her gaze over their heads. Agatha mouthed, Thank you.</p><p>Agatha was the one to guide them inside, her hand firm at the small of each boy’s back. She didn’t push, but she knew the rhythm of these anniversaries by now, what the boys needed, what they couldn’t quite say aloud.</p><p>“Come,” she murmured. “I’ll make us some tea and toast.” Neither boy acknowledged why it was tea and toast, that Wanda had fully believed tea and toast could cure any hurt.</p><p>The kitchen lights glowed warm as Agatha moved with quiet precision, pulling out the proper porcelain teapot she rarely used. She set it down with reverence, as if today required ceremony.</p><p>“Chamomile, lavender, and a little honey,” she explained. “It settles the chest when things are heavy.”</p><p>The twins sat at the island, unusually subdued, their faces pale with exhaustion from holding in too much. Rio stood nearby, unsure if she should help. Agatha gave her a small nod toward the cups, and together they prepared four mugs, a plate of simple butter biscuits and a stack of buttered toast.</p><p>When Agatha poured, the steam rose like a blessing. She set the cups before the boys with both hands, crouching to meet their eyes. “Sip slowly,” she said softly.</p><p>Tommy blew on his tea and stared into it. Billy cupped his mug, knuckles white, before taking a tentative sip.</p><p>Agatha brushed her fingers across his cheek just once and then sat down beside them.</p><p>After tea, Billy shifted in his seat, restless, eyes darting toward Agatha and then away again.</p><p>“Can we…” He didn’t finish the question, but Agatha knew, it was part of their ritual, what they always did on today.</p><p>“Yes,” she said softly, no hesitation.</p><p>They moved into the living room. The curtains were drawn, dimming the room into a kind of sanctuary. Agatha crossed to the cabinet and pulled out a box, her fingers brushing the lid with reverence.</p><p>Rio saw it the care in her every movement, as though memory itself was fragile and might shatter if handled too quickly.</p><p>She set up the player, slid the first disc into place, and soon the screen bloomed with light.</p><p>The film flickered to life.</p><p>Wanda appeared first, her laugh filling the space like sunshine through glass, red hair sticking to her cheeks as she leaned over a picnic blanket.</p><p>Vision was beside her, stiff but smiling, trying to flatten the cloth in the wind while still wrapping one awkward arm around her waist. Wanda shoved him playfully, then kissed him, unbothered by his fumbling.</p><p>A baby’s shriek cut through the image, Tommy, toddling off balance past the camera, while Billy clutched a toy truck twice his size and shouted unintelligible words, demanding to be heard.</p><p>Billy bit down hard on his lip, trying to hold himself together, but tears spilled anyway. Tommy’s sleeve was already pressed to his face. Agatha didn’t hush them. She didn’t tell them to be strong. She only opened her arms wide, pulling them in, wrapping her arms around both boys as if she could anchor them through sheer presence.</p><p>Rio sat close, still, her eyes stinging. She felt like an intruder in something unbearably private until Billy lifted his wet face toward her, whispering hoarsely, “Can I have a hug from you too?”</p><p>Her heart cracked. She moved instantly, sliding down beside them.</p><p>The reel flickered, shifted.</p><p>Now Vision’s voice came from behind the camera, warm and careful and awed,  “All right honey, she’s coming, are we ready?”</p><p>The scene was a hospital room. Wanda, pale but glowing, cradled two tiny bundles. Her tired eyes lit up as the door burst open. There was Agatha, hair shorter than it currently was, curls windblown, coat half-on, tears already running down her face. She didn’t hesitate, she went straight to Wanda, brushing past Vision as though he barely existed.</p><p>“My God, look at you, you did it,” Agatha gasped, voice breaking.</p><p>She bent down, pressing her forehead to Wanda’s, crying and laughing all at once. In her hands was a takeout bag, which she plunked onto the counter with exaggerated flourish.</p><p>“I brought you the best sushi from Nobu and a pornstar cocktail. Don’t tell your nurse.”</p><p>Wanda’s laughter filled the room, weak but radiant, as she leaned her head against Agatha’s shoulder. “You’re insane. I love you.”</p><p>Vision zoomed in on the bundles, and the faint squeak of a newborn’s cry filled the audio.</p><p>Agatha wiped her eyes furiously and looked down at them, her expression utterly undone. She whispered something too soft for the mic, but whatever it was made Wandas eyes shine brighter.</p><p>On the couch, Tommy let out a choked sound, hiding his face deeper into Agatha’s sweater. Billy pressed his hands hard against his eyes, as if holding the memory in place would stop it from slipping away.</p><p>The reel changed again.</p><p>Rain pounded against the lens. The picture shook with thunder. Wanda and Agatha stood in the middle of the street, soaked to the skin, holding hands and laughing like maniacs, barefooted.</p><p>They spun each other in circles, their hair plastered to their faces, mascara streaked down Wanda’s cheeks. The rain came down in torrents, but neither cared. Vision’s voice again: “You’re both going to catch pneumonia.”</p><p>“Worth it!” Wanda screamed through her laughter. Agatha laughed in agreement, pulling her into another spin. Two women, inseparable, alive in a way that burned.</p><p>In the den, Agatha’s throat tightened, her lips pressing into Billy’s hair as if to keep herself from breaking.</p><p>The screen shifted again, so many clips stitched together:</p><p>Wanda crouched in the grass, blowing raspberries into Tommy’s belly while Billy tackled Vision from behind.</p><p>Agatha sprawled on a clumpy sofa, both boys climbing her like a jungle gym, her mock-protests drowned in shrieks of laughter as vision and Wandas ignored them all, dancing around them.</p><p>A birthday cake, candles flickering, Wanda’s hands guiding the boys’ smaller ones as they blew.</p><p>Vision filming Agatha and Wanda side by side in the kitchen, Wanda stirring batter while Agatha sneaked chocolate chips, the pair bickering and laughing like sisters with a toddler each on a hip.</p><p>The twins running across a field, Vision’s laughter audible behind the lens, Wanda calling after them, “Slow down, little loves!”</p><p>Wanda behind the camera, laughing and giving encouragement as vision, tommy and billy built sandcastles at the beach.</p><p>A softer video, one filmed by Agatha, Vision and Wanda putting the boys to bed in their old shared bedroom, reading aloud from a fairy tail book, each one pressing kisses to the boys heads.</p><p>On and on, a life. A family. Proof that the way they lived now was not how it had always been.</p><p>By the third reel, Tommy was crying openly, chest heaving, his whole small body wracked with it. Billy pressed his face against Agatha’s side, trembling, no longer trying to hide.</p><p>Agatha’s composure finally wavered. She bent her head, kissing Tommy’s damp hair, rubbing Billy’s back in slow, steady circles. Her voice, low and sure, wove through her own steady tears, “Let it out, my darlings. Every bit of it. It’s safe here. Your safe to feel how you feel.”</p><p>Rio’s throat ached. She reached blindly for Tommy’s hand from beside Billy, and when he grabbed it like a lifeline, she held on tight.</p><p>The final clip came without warning. Wanda, turning the camera toward herself. Her smile was tired but dazzling, her eyes warm, her voice clear despite the old tape: “If you’re watching this boys, you’re so loved. Don’t you ever forget that.”</p><p>The screen went black.</p><p>The silence in the room was broken only by muffled sobs.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, pressing her cheek to the top of Billy’s hair, her own tears falling silently. Her voice shook but did not falter, “They loved you beyond measure. I will never let you forget that.”</p><p>The boys cried themselves into exhaustion.</p><p>Agatha tucked them onto the couch with blankets, letting them curl against each other like they had when they were very small.</p><p>Rio helped gather the mugs, her hands shaking faintly. “She was beautiful,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha gave her a look, tired but soft. “Yes. She was.”</p><p>They lingered in the doorway together, watching the twins sleep. Billy’s face was blotchy, Tommy’s lashes still wet, but their breaths had evened.</p><p>Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s, thumb stroking over her knuckles. “That you allowed me to be part of this, that you all wanted me here. That meant everything.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head, pressing a kiss to Rio’s temple. “Your more than wanted, we love you.” Her voice dropped lower, almost breaking. “Thank you for not turning away from the heaviness of it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head fiercely. “Never.”</p><p>Agatha moved forward, smoothing a curl off Tommy’s forehead, tugging the blanket higher over Billy’s shoulder. She stayed like that longer than necessary, just watching them, like she always did on this night each year. As though if she stared hard enough, she could will their pain into her own body instead.</p><p>Rio hovered in the doorway, hesitant. She didn’t want to break the moment, but she also knew Agatha needed time to grieve herself.</p><p>When Agatha finally stepped back, she looked… drained. A queen stripped of her crown.</p><p>Shoulders low, eyes glassy.</p><p>Rio crossed the room quietly and slid her arms around her from behind. “They’re okay,” she whispered. “You did everything right today.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, leaning back into her. “I’ll never know if it’s enough.”</p><p>“You’re more than enough,” Rio said fiercely, pressing her lips against Agatha’s temple.</p><p>They slipped away, upstairs, careful not to wake the boys.</p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, io knelt down in front of her, gently brushing her hands over her thighs. Agatha’s face was shadowed, wet at the corners.</p><p>“It’s okay to cry,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked. “I promised myself I would be their anchor. Anchors aren’t supposed to break.”</p><p>Rio’s hands cupped her knees, grounding her.</p><p>“But anchors can rust. And even anchors need someone to hold them.”</p><p>For a long moment, Agatha said nothing. Then her shoulders trembled, and she broke properly, sobs that shook her whole frame.</p><p>Rio slid up beside her and gathered her close, letting Agatha bury her face in her chest. “Shh,” Rio whispered, rocking her slowly. “It’s okay. It’s just me. You don’t have to be strong with me.”</p><p>They lay back eventually, tangled in sheets, Rio stroking the back of Agatha’s hand with her thumb.</p><p>“I’m so afraid of failing them,” Agatha admitted in a whisper, the words like broken glass. “Of not being enough. Wanda was… light. I’m not. I’m dark and sharp, and…”</p><p>Rio kissed her mid-sentence, tender, stopping the spiral. She pulled back just enough to breathe the words against her lips: “You are everything they need. Light, dark, sharp edges, soft center. You’ve kept them alive, loved, and brilliant. Do you have any idea how lucky they are to have you?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, eyes searching, as though Rio might disappear if she believed it too hard.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said again, firmer this time. “I love you, and nothing in this world could make me think you’re not enough. For me or for them.”</p><p>Agatha’s tears welled again, but softer now. She touched Rio’s cheek with trembling fingers, brushing over the curve of her jaw as though memorizing her.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her again, not to start anything, just to ground her.  Every brush of lips, every brush of fingertips across skin said the same thing, ‘you are allowed to be human, you are allowed to need, and you are loved.’</p><p>Agatha clung to her like she was the only solid thing in a world of grief and ghosts. For the first time all day, she let herself exhale fully.</p><p>As Agatha drifted against Rio’s chest, her breathing even at last, Rio whispered into her hair: “You’ve been carrying the world. Let me carry you for a while.”</p><p>Agatha, half-asleep, murmured the only reply she could manage. “Don’t ever leave me.”</p><p>Rio kissed the crown of her head. “Never.”</p>

<p>Morning light spilled across the polished marlble of the kitchen island, gleaming off chrome and catching in the slow curl of steam from Agatha’s freshly poured coffee.</p><p>She lounged against the counter, hair twisted into a sleek knot, blouse crisp, glasses balanced on the bridge of her nose as she sorted through neat stacks of case files. Her pen scratched with calm precision, calmly organising things before the day properly began.</p><p>Which, of course, lasted all of seven seconds before the twins padded in like feral cats.</p><p>Tommy immediately stole her coffee without asking, took a sip, and made a face so violent you’d think he’d swallowed battery acid.</p><p>“Why does it taste like poison?” he coughed.</p><p>“That,” Agatha replied without looking up, “is the taste of responsibility. You’ll learn to appreciate it when your older.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Billy was squinting into the reflection of the fridge, fussing with his hair.</p><p>“Being iconic requires effort,” he muttered, smoothing one curl, then another, then another.</p><p>Agatha slid plates across the counter, pancakes stacked high, fruit surrounding them.</p><p>“Eat properly. Brains do not run on aesthetics alone, boys. You have tests today.”</p><p>“Spoken like the queen you are,” Rio smirked over the rim of her own coffee.</p><p>Agatha’s only response was a faint arch of her brow as she tucked files into her briefcase.</p><p>Rio leaned across the counter, eyes glinting. “You know,” she began casually, “I was thinking of going live with a workout this morning. Maybe a full-body circuit.”</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha didn’t look up. “Sounds fun.”</p><p>“With you.”</p><p>That made Agatha pause. Her pen froze mid-note. “…With me?”</p><p>“Yes, with you.” Rio caught her hand before she could withdraw it, brushing her knuckles with her thumb.</p><p>“Everyone already thinks you’re some untouchable goddess. Imagine their reaction when they see you, sweating, next to me.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I do not sweat. I glisten.”</p><p>“Then glisten with me.” Rio kissed her knuckles with deliberate sweetness. “You’ve got time. Please?”</p><p>A long, theatrical sigh. “The things I do for you people.”</p><p>Thirty minutes later, the annex gym was chaos.</p><p>Rio stretched on the mat, phone propped at the perfect angle. Agatha, now in a deep green gym set, stood beside her with a fond expression on her face as she watched Rio move.</p><p>The twins, of course, had followed. Tommy leaned dramatically against the wall with Billy, both watching with grins on their faces.</p><p>Rio grinned at the camera. “Okay, you begged, she agreed. It’s happening. The one and only Agatha Harkness is doing a couples workout with me.”</p><p>Off-screen, Agatha’s dry voice floated onto the live, “I agreed after significant pestering and blatant emotional blackmail.”</p><p>The comments went feral instantly.</p><p>- MOTHER IS MOTHERINGGG<br/>- Did you say couples workout 🥵🔥🥵<br/>- i love you both!!!!!!!<br/>- RIO. WHEN IS THE WEDDING???</p><p>Agatha stepped into frame, brushing a hand across Rio’s back like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Tommy and Billy were both on their phones on the live, reading through the comments with snickers.</p><p>Rio cracked up as she saw the comments centred around Agatha. “Don’t scare her off, please. Okay, we’re doing squats first.”</p><p>Agatha executed perfect textbook squats beside Rio, heels planted, back straight, face utterly impassive, smiling indulgently as Rio talked her viewers through each movement.</p><p>- HELP ME IM OBSESSED<br/>- id marry her just watching this<br/>- RIO YOU NEED TO WIFE THIS WOMAN 💍</p><p>Push-ups came next. Rio blitzed through hers. Agatha lowered herself with precise, terrifying control, jaw clenched, following Rios guidance.</p><p>“Sweetheart, breathe,” Rio reminded.</p><p>“I am breathing. Very efficiently.”</p><p>- SHE SAID EFFICIENTLY 😭<br/>- RIO IS WHIPPED AND IT SHOWS<br/>- propose rn or we riot</p><p>Rio leaned across mid-push up to kiss the back of Agathas neck, tongue darting out without thought to lick a bead of sweat. Agatha’s ears flushed pink; the comments went nuclear.</p><p>Tommy gagged loudly. “Oh my god. PDA in 4K.”</p><p>“Let them cook.” Billy responded, shoving him.</p><p>Planks nearly killed the chat. Agatha’s body was ruler-straight, her expression cool, not a hair out of place. Rio, beside her, was actually sweating.</p><p>“Not bad for someone who swore she doesn’t sweat,” Rio teased, manoeuvring Agathas form into the perfect plank.</p><p>“I said I glisten. Don’t misquote me.”</p><p>- THE DELIVERY 😩<br/>- she’s not sweating she’s ✨glistening✨<br/>- god please give me a woman who glistens during planks</p><p>Finally, Rio pulled her upright, arm looping under Agatha knees to lift her one handed, keeping her air born and face to face. “See? You survived.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks were flushed, pupils dilated, but her composure held steady. “Barely. But I suppose it wasn’t… completely dreadful.”</p><p>Tommy made exaggerated vomiting sounds in the background. Billy muttered something about therapy funds.</p><p>Rio kissed her temple, then her lips before slowly lowering her to her feet. The chat detonated.</p><p>- The way she lifted her 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br/>- MRS. HARKNESS ERA CONFIRMED<br/>- petition for the wedding to be live streamed<br/>- this is THE power couple now<br/>- Rio please step on me and spit in my mouth 🥵🔥💋</p><p>Rio winked at the camera. “Okay, that’s enough for today. Stop thirsting over my girlfriend. Go hydrate.” She shut off the live with a final wave.</p><p>Agatha immediately skewered her with a dry look after reading the last comment. “Do they always respond to you like that?”</p><p>“Most of those comments were about you,” Rio chuckled, tugging her closer.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, brushed a kiss over her lips with deliberate slowness, just to make the twins groan in unison, and murmured, “Don’t ask me to do this often.”</p><p>Rio’s grin softened, eyes warm. “Once was enough. I’ll treasure it.”</p><p>Tommy whispered to Billy as they fled the room, “We’re never recovering from this.”</p><p>“No, but like… tell me you didn’t ship it a little.”Billy said.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>After the workout, Agatha disappeared with the kind of efficiency that suggested she had already mentally boxed the entire ordeal and locked it in a cabinet labeled Never Again (unless Rio pouts and asks nicely).</p><p>By the time Rio had finished cleaning down her gym and answering a few stray DMs, Agatha was back downstairs, fresh from a shower, transformed once more into her immaculate self. Hair swept back, blouse perfectly pressed, briefcase in hand, and the faintest hint of blush still lingering on her cheeks.</p><p>“Shoes,” she instructed the twins, who were sprawled like starfish across the sofa. “Backpacks. Now.”</p><p>Tommy groaned. “I swear, school is child labor.”</p><p>Agatha’s glasses slid down her nose an inch. “If you do not move this instant, I will march into that school and tell every student, on live, how you both begged to sleep in my bed after watching the conjuring the first time.”</p><p>That got them moving.</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe, grinning like a fool. “Terrifying and threatening. My favorite combination.”</p><p>Agatha paused at the door, briefcase balanced in one hand, the other lifting to cup Rio’s cheek. She pressed a kiss to her lips, soft, lingering, utterly domestic and murmured, “Have a good day, my love.”</p><p>Rio blinked, heart stuttering, smile too wide for her face. “You too.”</p><p>Then Agatha was sweeping the twins out like a general leading an unwilling platoon.</p><p>By the time they pulled up to the school, both boys were arguing over who would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse. Agatha merely mussed both their hairs in quick succession, ignored their spluttering, and said, “Go, have a good day.”</p><p>“Love you, Auntie!” Billy shouted as they tumbled out.</p><p>“Don’t make anyone cry today!” Tommy added.</p><p>Agatha’s only response was to roll down the window to flip them off before driving away.</p><p>Back at home, Rio was replaying that goodbye kiss in her head while fiddling with her phone. The chat’s comments echoed relentlessly.</p><p>- RIO PROPOSE BEFORE I DO<br/>- WHEN IS THE WEDDINGGGGG<br/>- SHE’S ALREADY YOUR WIFE STOP PRETENDING<br/>- WIFEY…. FOR LIFEY</p><p>Rio rubbed a hand over her face. She knew she wanted Agatha forever, there was no one else in the whole universe for her.</p><p>Breakfasts, dinners, school drop-offs, workouts, the way Agatha’s kiss still burned on her lips, the way she was practically in-lawing herself with the twins at this point.</p><p>But Marriage. Would Agatha want that?</p><p>She grabbed her phone and hit speed dial before she could overthink it.</p><p>“Rio?” Alice’s voice answered, groggy. “It’s barely nine. Is someone dead?”</p><p>“No, no one’s dead. But like… I might die. Emotionally.” Rio flopped back onto the sofa, staring at the ceiling like it might provide wisdom. “Alice, the internet wants me to marry Agatha.”</p><p>“Okay…Do you want to marry Agatha?”</p><p>“That’s not the point!” Rio groaned. “Well, okay, maybe it’s a little the point. But like, marriage? Isn’t that supposed to be terrifying? It’s forever.”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said flatly, “you are obsessed with Agatha and against all odds, she’s equally as obsessed with you. You’re already forever.”</p><p>Rio made a noise somewhere between a groan and a laugh, clutching her chest. “Oh god. Why am I spiraling? I’m spiraling.”</p><p>“Yup.” Alice sighed. “Alright, panic over FaceTime. I want to see the disaster live.”</p><p>The phone was balanced on a cushion, Alice’s face filling the screen in her pajamas, hair a mess, mug of tea in hand.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said, squinting at her, “walk me through this emotional apocalypse of yours.”</p><p>Rio threw an arm over her eyes. “The chat said I should marry her.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Rio peeked out between her fingers, scandalized. “And?! Alice, that’s like, huge. White dresses, vows, taxes.”</p><p>“Don’t pretend Agatha doesn’t already do your taxes” Alice cut in.</p><p>Rio froze. “That’s not the point.”</p><p>Alice sipped her tea. “Mmhm. You adore her. You adore her kids. You tell everyone you meet about her. She worships the ground you walk on, she cooks you amazing food, she made you a gym. Face it, babe, you’re not just dating. You’re basically in season four of marriage already.”</p><p>Rio let out a strangled laugh and kicked at the coffee table like it had personally offended her.</p><p>“Oh my god. I’m doomed. I’m wife-coded already.”</p><p>“You’re wife-coded and you love it,” Alice smirked. “Don’t even lie.”</p><p>Rio threw her arm over her face dramatically. “But what if she doesn’t want that? What if she just wants me to stay in the fun, hot, gym-girlfriend box and not, like… full-on vows and rings and anniversaries? What if I ruin it by saying the word marriage out loud and she bolts?”</p><p>Alice arched a brow. “Rio. The woman constantly tells you she loves you. She tells you to never leave her. She lets her guard down around you when frankly she can be a scary bitch to everyone else.”</p><p>Rio laughed despite herself, covering her face. “I know. She’s perfect. I’m…” She gestured down at herself, still in her purple gym set, hair frizzy from sweat. “This.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice said dryly, “a hot, loyal, ridiculously smitten woman who makes her laugh and who she loves. Truly unworthy.”</p><p>Rio threw a cushion at the phone. “Stop making sense, it’s gross.”</p><p>“Fine,” Alice said, mock-soothing. “Spiral responsibly. What’s the worst-case scenario you’re picturing?”</p><p>Rio sat up, running both hands through her hair. “I picture… me kneeling with a ring, the twins making gagging noises and objecting, Agatha sighing that long sigh she does when she’s annoyed and then she says something devastating like, ‘Darling, matrimony is an outdated concept, please stop kneeling on my expensive rug.’”</p><p>Alice burst out laughing so hard she had to put her tea down. “Oh my god, yes, that’s exactly how she’d reject a proposal if she was going to.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders slumped. “See?? I’d die.”</p><p>Alice softened, her smirk turning into something gentler. “Okay, but flip it. Picture her saying yes. Picture her with you forever, officially, rings and all. What does that look like?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. She swallowed, eyes darting away from the phone.</p><p>“…It looks like… Like her in the morning. Coffee, hair all neat, bossing the twins around. It looks like her coming to the gym sometimes with lunch, pretending she hates it but staying as long as she can. It looks like her kissing me goodbye before work and kissing me hello when she gets home, every day, forever.”</p><p>Her voice went quiet. “It looks like home.”</p><p>Alice’s smile softened. “And you’re scared of that why?”</p><p>Rio groaned, collapsing back against the cushions again. “Because I love her so much it makes me stupid.”</p><p>“That’s not stupid. That’s just being in love. And judging from the way she looks at you, babe? You’re fine. She’s already there.”</p><p>Rio peeked out from under her arm again, her voice very small. “…You really think so?”</p><p>“Please.” Alice rolled her eyes. “That woman nursed you back to health without complaining even once. Your a pain in the arse when your sick. Emotionally she’s your wife already.”</p><p>Rio laughed so hard she nearly dropped the phone, her heart light but still pounding, she had plans to make.</p>

<p>The weekend started with noise. Billy and Tommy had barely finished their waffles before they launched into a double-team assault.</p><p>“Annie,” Tommy began sweetly, “Rio, have we told you both how much we love you recently?”</p><p>Agatha, sitting next to Rio, still in her silk robe, smirked and then sipped her lemon tea without looking up from her emails, one hand entwined with Rios under the table.</p><p>She’d had to forgo her coffee after waking up vomiting, luckily the nausea had already subsided. “What are you hinting for? What do you want?”</p><p>Billy grinned. “We just think… We’re sixteen. Responsible. Emotionally mature.”</p><p>Agatha arched one perfectly shaped brow. “Your idea of ‘emotionally mature’ is nearly hyperventilating when your eyeliner is crooked? And Toby, you were screaming at imaginary footballers on your game like it was real last night.”</p><p>“That referee was blind!” Tommy argued, pointing with his fork to emphasise his point.</p><p>Rio, who had been leaning against Agathas shoulder sleepily, thumb rubbing soft circles across her knuckles, tried not to laugh. “Okay, but hear them out. What are you talking about?”</p><p>Billy’s eyes lit up. “A dog.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha’s response was immediate, flat, absolute. She set her mug down with finality. “End of discussion.”</p><p>But Rio leaned forward, playful, fingers dancing up Agathas arm. “Why not?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to her. “Because they’re hard work. They chew. They bark. They require walks at inconvenient hours. And let me remind you, when these two inevitably forget to feed it, or don’t want to go out in the rain - who do you think would be left picking up the slack? Me.”</p><p>Tommy leaned across the table dramatically. “Or… it could be a chance for us to prove our responsibility.”</p><p>Billy added, “And dogs are scientifically proven to reduce stress. Imagine it, Auntie, you, courtroom queen by day, curled up with a cute puppy by night.”</p><p>Rio bit back a grin. “Honestly, that does sound kind of perfect. I’ve always wanted a dog.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look, dropping Rios hand to dramatically clutch her chest. “Et tu, Rio?”</p><p>Tommy chimed in, sensing Agatha caving due to Rios input, mouth still full of syrupy pancake. “Yeah, and dogs are good for mental health. Amanda, you love mental health, you want us to have good mental health right.”</p><p>“Your attempt at manipulation is impressive but it needs work.”</p><p>“But imagine it,” Billy pressed on, widening his eyes. “You, Rio, us, and a loyal retriever sitting by the fire. It’s cinematic. Content gold.”</p><p>“Absolutely not.” Agatha responded with a quiet finality. “Dogs are not for content. Their for life, they need training and love and attention.”</p><p>Rio caught Agathas eye, fighting back a grin. “Have I told you how much I love you, my love. And how much I also really like dogs.”</p><p>Agatha’s rolled her eyes, knowing that she was definitely going to give in with Rio looking at her like that.</p><p>Tommy clasped his hands dramatically. “See! Rio agrees.”</p><p>Billy, already pulling out his phone, announced, “We’re going live, see what our viewers have to say.”</p><p>Caption: Convincing Aunt Agatha to let us adopt a 🐶 = pray for us</p><p>The comments poured in.</p><p>- SHE NEEDS A DOG<br/>- Agatha + golden retriever = powerful energy<br/>- Imagine the TikToks??<br/>- OMG!!!! Yes! Please get a dog</p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbing her temple. “I will not be bullied into a pet by children and an app.”</p><p>Rio leaned her chin into her hand, soft smile playing on her lips. “Not bullied. Just… nudged. Maybe we could go to the shelter. Just to look. Then you can make a decision.”</p><p>Billy and Tommy froze, then screamed in unison, “YES!”</p><p>Agatha pretended to look betrayed but her eyes were shining with amusement. “Rio.”</p><p>But Rio only shrugged innocently. “It doesn’t hurt to look. If nothing feels right, we don’t get one. Simple.”</p><p>- RIO IS ONE OF US<br/>- She said watch me change her mind 🔥🥵<br/>- SHE SAID LOOK WE WON<br/>- Aunt Agatha folded the minute Rio gave her puppy dog eyes 😂😂😂😂</p><p>Agatha sank back in her chair, muttering, “I should have stayed in bed.” But there was no real bite behind it.</p><p>The twins were already sprinting upstairs for their shoes.</p><p>Rio tilted her head, cupping Agathas face between her hands, earnest now the twins had disappeared. “Am I overstepping? Tell me if I am.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a beat, her eyes softened. “You’re not.” Then she gave a devilish smirk, “I’m simply unaccustomed to betrayal before nine in the morning. You’re just going to gave to make it up to me, tonight.”</p><p>Rios grin was manically wide as she closed the gap, capturing her lips in a devastating kiss.</p><p>The local animal shelter smelled faintly of disinfectant and sawdust. Dogs of all ages and sizes barked from behind gates, claws clicking against linoleum floors, tails wagging so hard their bodies shook.</p><p>Volunteers in faded polo shirts guided them down rows of kennels as the dogs pressed eager faces to the bars.</p><p>Tommy gasped audibly. Billy was already filming.</p><p>Tommy gasped dramatically at each pen. “That one! No wait—that one!”</p><p>Agatha walked between them like a queen in exile, hand clasped with Rios, eyes darting into each kennel with an aloof curiosity.</p><p>At the far end of the row, a hulking Great Dane stood in her enclosure, sleek black coat, amber eyes, body like carved marble. A volunteer noticed Agatha eyeing her and shook her head.</p><p>“She’s not usually good with people,” she warned. “Doesn’t let anyone near her. We’ve had a tough time with her.”</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, the Great Dane huffed a whine, pushed against the gate, and when it was opened, padded straight past everyone else. She went directly to Agatha, massive head bowing as she pressed against her stomach like she belonged there.</p><p>The twins jaws dropped.</p><p>Billy whispered to his live, “The terrifying horse-dog just imprinted on Aunt Agatha.”</p><p>Tommy added, wide-eyed, “That dog looks scary as hell.”</p><p>Even Rio blinked in surprise, fingers tentatively stroking the dogs back where it brushed against her to press against Agatha, then smiled slowly. “Guess she likes what she sees.”</p><p>Agatha crouched slightly, carefully, deliberately,  and the Great Dane wound around her like a oversized cat, nearly knocking her over with her weight. She actually laughed. A low, surprised sound. “You’re gorgeous,” she murmured, scratching behind her ears.</p><p>TikTok chat detonated.</p><p>- THE GREAT DANE CHOSE HER<br/>- No because that dog looks evil but totally suits her<br/>- I’m crying this is a Disney movie<br/>- Of course the most terrifying dog picks her</p><p>The volunteer gaped. “I… I’ve never seen her do that, she doesn’t let any of us touch her.”</p><p>Rio watched the way Agatha’s face softened, the stiffness draining out of her shoulders as the dog leaned against her, tail wagging furiously.</p><p>Agatha never looked vulnerable unless they were alone. But here she was, in a dog shelter, being quietly undone by an animal that wasn’t supposed to like anyone.</p><p>Billy whispered into the live, “She’s gone. Game over.”</p><p>Agatha gave the Dane one last scratch before standing, brushing invisible dust from her sweater. “Fine. I’ll  reconsider us potentially getting a dog.”</p><p>The twins exploded. “SHE SAID YES!”</p><p>Rio leaned close, voice low. “Potentially, huh?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, eyes still on the Great Dane. “I said we’d consider. Not that I’m stupid enough to not already know how this ends.”</p><p>The volunteer tried to pull the dog back to the kennel but even as the volunteer coaxed, tugged, tried to guide her back to her kennel, the hulking dog simply pressed closer to Agathas stomach like an immovable shadow.</p><p>Agatha slowly stroked her muzzle and muttered, “This is extortion, in canine form.” Her fingers kept absently stroking the dogs head then down her sleek neck, betraying how quickly she was growing attached.</p><p>While she remained pinned under the weight of one very devoted giant, the volunteer hesitated, then added, “She actually came in with a litter. We’re just about to open applications for the pups.”</p><p>Billy’s head snapped up. “Puppies?”</p><p>Tommy’s eyes went wide. “Did you just say puppies?”</p><p>Rio laughed, catching the volunteer’s nervous glance. “You might’ve just made their week.”</p><p>Caption: Apparently the scary horse-dog is a mom…</p><p>- PUPPIES PUPPIES PUPPIES<br/>- This is a cinematic universe<br/>- Great Dane &amp; Heirs</p><p>The volunteer led them down a side corridor, opening a quieter room lined with playpens. And there they were, five tumbling, squeaking bundles of fur. Great Dane mixes, all oversized paws and floppy ears, clambering over each other in clumsy chaos.</p><p>The twins practically fell to the floor.</p><p>Billy dropped to his knees. “This is the happiest I’ve ever been in my life.”</p><p>Tommy already had his phone out, filming himself getting mobbed. “Exclusive content: I die by puppy attack.”</p><p>Tommy was flat on his back, three puppies climbing over his chest as Billy was holding one pup up Lion King–style.</p><p>Rio had followed them in and was crouched, laughing as a puppy gnawed on her shoelace.</p><p>Agatha appeared in the doorway, the scary looking Great Dane still glued to her hip like a bodyguard. She arched an eyebrow at the spectacle. “Of course. Pandemonium within minutes.”</p><p>One puppy in particular, the runt, female with mottled grey fur and sharp little eyes, stumbled straight toward Billy. She tried to climb onto his lap, failing three times before managing to sprawl across him.</p><p>Billy gasped, clutching her. “This one. It’s fate. She chose me.”</p><p>Tommy protested, moving closer to his brother to stroke the puppy. “She chose us.”</p><p>Rio, sitting cross-legged with another pup asleep in her lap, smiled warmly, glancing at the twins and then back to Agatha.</p><p>Billy’s voice cracked. “Auntie. Please, please let us take her home.”</p><p>- HE NEEDS THAT PUPPY<br/>- Agatha pls be the fairy godmother again<br/>- Twin + puppy = healing arc<br/>- But what about the big scary dog!?!?</p><p>Agatha crossed the room, the giant dog padding after her, and regarded Billy with mock severity.</p><p>“You already have one expensive, exhausting creature in your life - yourself.”</p><p>Billy looked down at the puppy now snoring gently, half on him and half on Tommy, then back up at her with wide, desperate eyes.</p><p>For a long moment, the room held still.</p><p>Then Agatha sighed, one hand sliding to stroke the Great Dane’s massive head. “Apparently my home is destined to become a zoo.”</p><p>The twins erupted. Billy kissed the puppy’s head; Tommy tried to lay claim by hugging them both at once. Rio shook her head, smiling at Agatha with something softer.</p><p>“What do we need to do for her” she pointed at the giant attached to her hip “and the puppy to come home with us?”</p><p>The volunteer beamed that they were taking one of their hardest to place pooches. “So she actually came in with a collar. Her names Maleficent, puppys unnamed. Let me get you the papers.”</p><p>Agatha muttered, “This is catastrophic,” but her hand never left the dogs head, and her eyes lingered on Billy cradling the tiny puppy like treasure.</p><p>- AGATHA &amp; RIO ARE MOMMIES !!!!<br/>- Billy is glowing<br/>- We need names immediately</p><p>Maleficent sat squarely in the middle of the back seat of the G Wagon. Her long legs folded awkwardly, her sleek back pressed against the twins on either side. Every few minutes she extended one giant paw forward, pressing it neatly between the driver and passenger seats until it touched Agatha’s arm, as though checking she was still there.</p><p>Agatha, one hand steady on the wheel, the other on Rios knee, sighed. “I’ve acquired a stalker.”</p><p>Tommy, buried under the snoozing grey puppy sprawled across his chest, grinned. “She’s guarding you. Like your giant knight.”</p><p>Billy was already live.</p><p>Caption: Meet Maleficent + Puppy (name pending)</p><p>The chat detonated the moment the camera panned to Maleficent sitting regally, head tilted, eyes solemn.</p><p>- I WOULD DIE FOR HER<br/>- She looks like a villains familiar<br/>- That paw on Agatha is KILLING ME</p><p>Billy angled the phone closer. “This is Maleficent. Yes, as in the Disney villain. No we won’t be changing it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even glance back. “She is elegant, misunderstood, and terrifyingly protective. Her name fits.”</p><p>- AGATHA BEING CHOSEN BY THE VILLAIN DOG IS SO ON BRAND<br/>- MOTHER OF DRAGONS VIBES<br/>- Imagine being these dogs rn. They don’t know how lucky they are<br/>- Maleficent’s paw on Agatha lives rent free<br/>- House of Agatha is officially a sanctuary</p><p>Meanwhile, Tommy whispered into the camera, stroking the puppy’s floppy ears. “We’re still deciding on this one. Suggestions?”</p><p>Polls flooded in instantly: Luna, Storm, Pebble, Heiress, Biscuit, Queenie.</p><p>Tommy wrinkled his nose. “Not Biscuit.”</p><p>Billy read out one feral suggestion. “Somebody said Mini Maleficent.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, low and sharp. “Absolutely not. She deserves her own name.”</p><p>The car filled with laughter, bickering, puppy yawns, and Maleficent’s deep sighs. Her head rested on Billy’s shoulder after a while like a weighted crown, while her paw remained on Agatha’s elbow the entire drive and the short stop to the pet store.</p><p>As soon as they were home, the twins tore through the house, dragging blankets, bowls, and toys from bags they’d insisted on buying on the way home.</p><p>Tommy threw down giant dog mattresses in a rich forest green in both the living room and the kitchen, then spread a fleece across the floor of the sunroom, just in case. Billy tested squeaky toys like he was reviewing them for TikTok.</p><p>Rio and Agatha stood in the kitchen doorway, Maleficent against Agatha again and Rio carrying the puppy, watching the storm.</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “I don’t recall authorising the transformation of our house into a kennel.”</p><p>Rio leaned against her shoulder, voice soft so only she could hear. “You love it already.”</p><p>And Agatha’s gaze flicked to Maleficent, watching her pad over to the mattress, then  stretching out  like a queen on a throne, head lifting every time she lost sight of her. The puppy stayed curled in Rios arms, fast asleep.</p><p>By evening, the dogs had beds throughout the house, though Maleficent soon made her preference for the sofa known and the puppy continued to rotate across Rios and the Twins laps.</p><p>Agatha moved quietly among them, tidying toys, refilling water, her sarcasm muted by something else. A secret fondness that softened her eyes when she thought nobody was watching.</p><p>But Rio saw. And for her, that look, the woman who’d built everything herself, who carried the weight of two teenage boys, now bending down to tuck a blanket around a puppy, was almost too much to bear.</p><p>By ten o’clock, the house was… mostly calm.</p><p>At least, as calm as it could be with a Great Dane the size of a small horse sprawled across the living room rug and a twelve week-old puppy attempting to chew its way through Billy’s limited edition sneaker laces.</p><p>Agatha had retreated to the sofa with a mug if camomile tea, barefoot, cuddled into Rios side. Maleficent lay directly in front of her, a dark monolith of muscle and fur, paws crossed like a sphinx. Every so often the dog lifted her massive head, staring at Agatha with that unsettling gaze that seemed both protective and worshipful.</p><p>“Why is she staring at you like she’s your bodyguard?” Tommy asked, crouched on the floor with the puppy climbing up his hoodie.</p><p>Agatha sipped her tea. “Because she has taste.”</p><p>Billy, phone out, whispered into the camera.</p><p>Caption: Maleficent has chosen her queen (spoiler: it’s Agatha)</p><p>- That dog is literally in love with her<br/>- Agatha: breaker of hearts, tamer of beasts<br/>- Tommy is just furniture to that puppy rn</p><p>Every now and then Rio would glance up from scribbling her training schedule for the week to smile at the ridiculous circus around her.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha finally said, setting down her mug. “The beast can’t shadow me forever and their not sleeping in our room. They’ll take it in turns in your rooms, Trent, first shift.”</p><p>Tommy froze. “Wait, for real? She’s… she’s huge.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “And you’re not? You’ll cope, you have a king sized bed. Maleficent, upstairs.”</p><p>The dog, impossibly, rose with slow regality and lumbered down the hall, and up the stairs, nails clicking. She stopped, glanced back once at Agatha, who pointed to Tommy door, then she disappeared into Tommy’s room.</p><p>Billy’s jaw dropped. “She listens to you and only you. That’s insane.”</p><p>Caption: Aunt Agatha commands, Maleficent obeys</p><p>- THE DOG is obsessed with her???<br/>- She’s giving queen of beast vibes<br/>- Imagine having this much control over us AND giant evil dogs</p><p>Agatha smirked, stretching her legs across Rio’s lap as the boys and the puppy followed Maleficent upstairs.</p><p>The puppy yawned dramatically and sprawled against her mother while Maleficent positioned herself on the bed by the doors side like a personal bouncer.</p><p>Tommy jumped into bed with glee, cuddling up to the dogs with a smile as bright as christmas morning, throwing an arm over the giant dog and her baby.</p><p>Maleficent huffed in response before closing her eyes. The puppy stuck her head into Tommys neck.</p><p>Downstairs, Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed against Rio’s shoulder, her breath slowing.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured softly, brushing a stray curl of hair from her face, “you sure your not mad at me for suggesting we go to the shelter?”</p><p>Her words fell into the quiet warmth between them. Agatha made a small, content sigh, snuggling closer. “Of course not,” she whispered, voice drowsy. “We’re partners, Rio. We make decisions together. That’s what love is.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened with the familiar ache of affection, every time Agatha said something, she wanted to rush ahead and tie her to her permanently. Instead, she kissed the top of Agatha’s head. “Good,” she murmured. “Because I love this. Them. You.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip loosened, her body melting against Rio as she gave a very sleepy “Mmmhhmh love you too.”</p><p>She drifted fully into sleep, the tension gone from her features.</p><p>Careful not to disturb her, Rio shifted, lifting Agatha into her arms. She moved with practiced gentleness, each step measured, “Shh… I’ve got you,” she whispered. “You’re so precious. I’m so happy we’re together… all of us.”</p><p>Carrying her to bed, Rio rested Agatha down, tucking the blankets around her. She brushed her hand over Agatha’s hair, watching the calm rise in her chest as sleep claimed her completely. “I love you so much,” Rio said softly. “I love them all. And you make me so, so happy.”</p><p>After brushing her teeth she climbed into bed, lops brushing Agathas neck as she fell into sleep against the woman she loved.</p><p>At six a.m., Agatha’s head hovered uncomfortably over the porcelain, her stomach staging a rebellion yet again, when a muffled yell ricocheted down the hallway.</p><p>“AMY! THE PUPPY PEED ON MY FLOOR!”</p><p>Rio groaned, burrowing deeper into the pillow, wondering if anyone had applied a laugh track to her life. “Honestly,” she muttered into the mattress, “our lives are a sitcom.”</p><p>She rolled over, groping blindly for Agatha, sitting up with a sleepy smile as she emerged from the bathroom, reached for her robe, and padded barefoot down the hallway.</p><p>Rio swung her legs over the bed, bracing herself against the doorframe, smiling softly. The soft chaos of the household hit her in waves: Billy live-streaming from Tommy’s doorframe like a paparazzo in training, the muffled yelps of the tiny puppy, and the faint scent of expensive candles mingled with... well, less pleasant scents.</p><p>Caption: Puppy 1, Tommy 0</p><p>- Why is Aunt Agatha in a silk robe wrangling dogs at dawn???<br/>- Queen looks a bit pale this morning<br/>- Rio in the background giving exhausted wife energy</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Maleficent had claimed her throne between the twins at the breakfast table, while the tiny puppy attempted increasingly ambitious leaps onto Billy’s lap.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, a faint crease of fatigue across her forehead, stirring tea with elegant precision. “I told you both,” she said, voice carrying a mix of exasperation and fondness, “dogs are responsibility. Not just cute little chaos machines you chase around for tiktok views.”</p><p>Tommy pointed at Maleficent, unabashed. “She’s extra cuddly at night. I’m not complaining.”</p><p>Billy grinned, already editing clips on his phone. “And this one’s a baby menace. Perfect balance. I cant wait for them to sleep with me tonight.”</p><p>Rio slid an arm around Agatha’s waist from behind, resting her chin gently on her shoulder. Agatha leaned back instinctively, softening, and Rio pressed a kiss into the top of her hair.</p><p>“She needs a name,” Rio murmured. “You can’t just keep calling her ‘puppy.’”</p><p>The boys erupted in suggestions.</p><p>“Luna!”</p><p>“No, what about Star?”</p><p>“That’s so basic! What about Snow?”</p><p>“She’s not white, you idiot. Cersei!”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft laugh that made Rio’s chest feel lighter, the sound warm and intimate. Both women shared a look that said, somehow, we survive these mornings together.</p><p>Tommy turned expectantly toward them. “Okay, do you have any better suggestions?”</p><p>Rio crouched to scoop the puppy into her arms, feeling its tiny paws knead at her. She pressed her cheek into the soft fur. “What about Aurora? To match her mom… without being as dramatic, hmm?”</p><p>The puppy wiggled in approval or at least in confusion but Rio didn’t care. She leaned back, holding the little chaos ball against her chest, speaking in a high, sing-songy baby voice, “You’re just a clumsy little baby, aren’t you? Yes, you are.”</p><p>The boys watched silently for a beat, then smiled.</p><p>“Aurora. It suits her,” Tommy said finally.</p><p>Agatha rested a hand over Rio’s, squeezing it lightly. “Yes,” she murmured, voice softer than the silk of her robe. “Aurora is perfect.”</p><p>Rio leaned down, brushing her lips against Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Perfect… like you,” she said, and for a moment, the chaos faded into quiet warmth, just them, the puppy, and a house full of love in disarray.</p>

<p>The house was unusually quiet the following weekend, Eddie had stayed over the Friday night but had a family event over the weekend so had left for home earlier that morning.</p><p>Aurora had finally crashed in Tommy’s lap after an hour of tearing up squeaky toys and being a general menace and Maleficent lay sprawled like a marble statue across the sofa, tail thumping every time Agatha entered her line of sight.</p><p>Agatha sat in the kitchen her with a legal pad in front of her, though she hadn’t written a word, instead she called the boys into the kitchen with her.</p><p>Billy and Tommy had noticed the serious air, exchanging looks as they slouched into the chairs opposite her, nervous giggles barely suppressed.</p><p>Rio hovered in the kitchen doorway, silently offering moral support with a mug of tea cradled in her hands.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>“Alright, you two,” Agatha began, folding her hands like she was about to deliver closing arguments in court. “We’re having the talk.”</p><p>Tommy blinked. “Uh, the talk? Like, birds and bees? I already know how everything works, thanks.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “If only your grasp of biology were as good as your sarcasm. Sit up straight. I only want to do this once, trust me, it’s as painful for me as it is for you.”</p><p>Billy leaned forward, lips twitching with barely suppressed laughter. “I knew this day would come. Aunt Agatha, sex educator extraordinaire.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a razor-sharp stare, but there was a flicker of amusement in it. “Let’s not romanticize. This is about safety. For you. For whoever you choose to be with. For the world you’re stepping into as young men.”</p><p>She exhaled, and for a moment her expression softened.</p><p>“Your sixteen. If I don’t say this now, one of you is going to come home in six months with an STD pamphlet or a girlfriend crying on my porch.”</p><p>Billy snorted. “Not me. I’m gay. No girlfriends here.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a look. “Just because you’re gay doesn’t mean you don’t need to hear this. Viruses don’t care who you kiss. You still need the talk. And Toby, don’t smirk, just because you’re the only straight one in this house doesn’t mean you’re special. Equal-opportunity humiliation for both of you.”</p><p>Billy chewed his lip. Tommy fiddled with the Auroras ears as he blushed.</p><p>“First thing. Straight or gay, the rules are the same: consent, respect, safety. Billy, some people will act like gay relationships are different, less serious, less valid, or more dangerous. They’re not. Their the same as any other relationship.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dipped lower. “But, there are risks, depending on who you’re with. For men and women. You both know women can carry children together, yes?”</p><p>Tommy’s head shot up. “Wait, actually?”</p><p>Billy smacked his arm. “Idiot, we learned that in health class. The gene thing.”</p><p>Tommy squinted. “I thought that was, like, optional science fiction.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “Optional science fiction? No, it’s biology. If a woman has the gene, she can get another woman pregnant. Not common, but possible. Which means” her eyes flicked briefly toward the kitchen, where Rio was trying very hard to remain serious but was hiding a shit eating grin behind her mug, “relationships between women come with responsibilities too.”</p><p>Tommy flushed, then muttered, “You don’t have to, like, overshare Abigail. We don’t need to know that part.”</p><p>“Oh, I assure you, I won’t,” Agatha replied dryly. “But you need to understand: life is not as simple as romance novels or TikTok edits.”</p><p>Billy tilted his head. “So basically… no being reckless idiots.”</p><p>“Exactly.” She sipped her water.</p><p>Tommy groaned and shoved his face Auroras fur. “Kill me now.”</p><p>Billy smirked, but his voice wobbled. “Pretty sure we already got the school version of all of this. You know, bananas and… uh… latex.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “I sincerely hope your school did better than just bananas and latex with the amount I pay them.”</p><p>The twins snorted.</p><p>“I still don’t think two women can make a baby, I don’t remember that in health class.”</p><p>“They can,” Agatha cut in, voice even. “It’s rare. There’s a genetic marker, one in a million, perhaps rarer, but if one woman carries it, she can make another woman pregnant.”</p><p>Tommy’s jaw dropped. “...No way. That’s like X-Men.”</p><p>Billy’s phone was already out, fingers flying. “Chat is gonna die when they hear you doing this.”</p><p>Agatha skewered him with a look that could end careers. “You stream this, I’ll have Rio post all of your run way shows from when you were eight. You had your underpants on your head.”</p><p>Billy put his phone down. Slowly.</p><p>Tommy, still reeling, asked, “Wait. Do you have it?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line. “No. Thank heavens.”</p><p>They both turned in unison to Rio, eyes wide.</p><p>Rio froze mid-sip. “Me? Oh, uh. I don’t think so. Pretty sure not.” She gave a sheepish shrug. “I’ve never tested, but I doubt it. Like your Aunt said, super rare, theres less than a hundred female/female births a year.”</p><p>“Okay, but like, how does that work?” Tommy innocently asked.</p><p>Rio hid her face so Agatha wouldn’t see her laughing at the slight blush that rose up her neck.</p><p>“If a woman has the gene, and her… fucking hell how do I say this without being crude…vaginal secretions.”</p><p>(Rio completely lost it at this and hid behind the door frame like an immature child).</p><p>“If her vaginal secretions enter another woman it works like sperm, can fertilise the egg and voila, a baby.”</p><p>Both boys pulled a face, beet red in the face.</p><p>“Okay, back to you two. Hormones.” Agatha took a long sip tea. “You’re both marinating in them right now. They will tell you stupid things. Like ‘sex will make them like me,’ or ‘this person is the one’ after three weeks, or ‘the backseat of the car is a good idea.’ Spoiler alert: it’s not. Hormones are like chaotic drunks running your body. They don’t care about consequences. You need to think with your brains. So repeat after me: my penis is not qualified to make life decisions.”</p><p>Both boys groaned in unison.</p><p>“Say it,” she insisted.</p><p>Tommy muttered, “My penis is not qualified to make life decisions.”</p><p>Billy, trying not to laugh, echoed, “Same.”</p><p>“Tommy, you get the pregnancy speech. Sex can and will make babies if you’re not careful. Babies that scream. Babies that cost money. Babies that end your sports career before its even started.”</p><p>Billy grinned. “He’d make a terrible dad.”</p><p>“As a teen, yes,” Agatha agreed. “Which is why condoms exist. They’re not optional, not embarrassing, not ‘weird.’ And Tyler — pulling out is not birth control. It’s wishful thinking and comes with child support.”</p><p>Tommy groaned again. “I hate this.”</p><p>“Not as much as you’d hate diapers,” Agatha shot back.</p><p>“Now, Billy. No pregnancy worries for you, congrats. But don’t get smug. You have other risks, the same ones as Tank. HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia. It’s like a gross bingo card, and you don’t want to win. Anal sex without protection? It’s like skydiving without a parachute. High risk. That’s why condoms are your best friend, plus lube that won’t melt the condom. You need silicone or water-based. If you use oil-based? Say goodbye to your protection and hello to awkward clinic visits.”</p><p>Billy wrinkled his nose. “This is worse than I imagined.”</p><p>“Good. Fear builds character.”</p><p>Rio lost it at that point and had to duck into the living room with Maleficent but the boys could hear her laughing into the cushions.</p><p>“And here’s another golden rule: nobody looks ‘clean.’ You cannot tell by someone’s face whether they’re carrying chlamydia. If you’re going to do anything, especially without protection, you get tested. Regularly. If someone refuses? You kick them to the curb. You don’t owe anyone access to your body if they don’t respect your health.”</p><p>Tommy looked horrified. “Wait, you can’t always tell?”</p><p>“Tito,” Agatha said, deadpan, “you can’t even tell when you have mustard on your shirt. Do you really think you’ll notice microscopic bacteria? No. That’s why testing exists.”</p><p>Billy laughed so hard he almost fell off the chair.</p><p>“Now, the golden rule, consent. A definite yes, or you do nothing. Not ‘well, I guess.’ Not silence. Not a shrugged shoulder. If the person isn’t giving you a complete yes, you stop. End of story. Toby, this means you don’t listen to idiot locker room talk. Billy, this means you don’t let anyone tell you that being gay means you’re automatically up for anything. No one owes you intimacy. Respect is sexy. Entitlement is disgusting. Got it?”</p><p>Both boys nodded, looking slightly sick.</p><p>“Alright, let’s wrap this up with the main points.<br/>Condoms are sacred. Straight, gay, whatever. Use them, if you don’t have them, you don’t do anything. Lube wisely. Billy, that one’s mostly for you. Tyler, don’t look confused, you’ll thank me someday. Test, test, test. Clinics exist. Use them. Consent is king. No yes = no go. Respect yourself. If someone disrespects your safety, they don’t deserve to see you naked.”</p><p>She drained the last of her tea and sighed. “There. I think I’ve made the point. Unless I need to get out diagrams?“</p><p>Tommy mumbled, “Do we get therapy after this?”</p><p>Maleficent broke the tension by padding into the kitchen, lapping a drink of water before sitting beside Agatha, head on her stomach and tail thumping softly.</p><p>“You can both tell me anything okay, I wont make fun of you. If you need to come to me, you do.”</p><p>Both boys nodded the affirmative but scattered as soon as they could, both slightly red faced.</p><p>Rio slipped into the kitchen, scooping up Aurora as she did. “That was…” she smiled softly, “so mom coded but totally hilarious. Did you see their faces.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her temple, feigning exasperation. “That actually made me feel a little bit sick.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, came closer, and touched her arm. “They’ll remember, when their older, that you cared enough to sit down and tell them that.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, the corner of her mouth tugging upward despite herself. “And what did you remember from the talk, hmm?”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning down so her lips brushed Agatha’s ear. “That you’re scarily good at making vaginal secretions sound… sexy.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was low, unexpected, and entirely soft.</p><p>After giving everyone time to decompress the awkwardness of the morning, they decided to take the dogs to the dog park that afternoon.</p><p>When they arrived it was already a circus, golden retrievers chasing tennis balls, corgis bumbling like loaves of bread, one pug snorting like a tractor.</p><p>The moment Agatha stepped in, every head turned. Not at her, though she cut a formidable figure in sunglasses and boots, but at Maleficent.</p><p>Gasps. Whispers. One child clutched her mother’s leg and began to cry.</p><p>Billy went live immediately.</p><p>Caption: Pray for the corgis</p><p>- THAT’S NOT A DOG THAT’S A HORSE<br/>- Agatha’s personal bodyguard??<br/>- The way she heels like a military officer omg<br/>- Aurora  is stealing a stick behind her LMAOO</p><p>And indeed, while Maleficent sat dignified at Agatha’s heel, showing no interest in the other dogs, Aurora zoomed into the grass like a cannonball, attempting to fit an entire fallen branch into her tiny jaws. Tommy chased after her, laughing so hard he could barely run.</p><p>A labrador approached, tail wagging, only to freeze when Maleficent’s amber eyes narrowed. One deep, quiet huff of breath, and the lab backed away like it had reconsidered all its life choices.</p><p>Rio chuckled, linking her hand with Agatha’s. “She doesn’t even growl. Just… vibes threats of violence.”</p><p>“She’s like me in dog form,” Agatha replied, lips twitching.</p><p>And then, without warning, Maleficent did something no one expected. A toddler toddled past with a half-eaten biscuit in hand. Maleficent bent her head, sniffed, and very gently allowed the child to press a sticky palm against her snout.</p><p>The mother gasped, but Maleficent just leaned into it, eyes half-lidded, tail giving one slow thump.</p><p>Billy caught the moment live.</p><p>- OH SHE’S A NANNY DOG??<br/>- FROM NIGHTMARE TO ANGEL IN ONE FRAME<br/>- Maleficent has a soft spot for kids like Agatha 😭😭😭😭</p><p>Meanwhile, Aurora was chaos incarnate. She stole a tennis ball, tripped over her own legs, and at one point ran directly between Agatha’s legs, nearly sending her over.</p><p>Billy was breathless with laughter. “Aurora 1, Aunt Agatha 0!”</p><p>“Careful, Billy,” she said, recovering her balance, “or I’ll leave you here and make you walk home.”</p><p>After an hour, Aurora collapsed panting, belly to the sky, while Maleficent sat sentinel beside Agatha’s bench after half heartedly chasing the ball when Agatha threw it for her a few times.</p><p>Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s, her voice soft. “You know… you look good like this. Like you were meant to have dogs.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Meant to? I was blackmailed into this.”</p><p>But her hand squeezed back, firm and warm, and she didn’t move it until the boys dragged them all home.</p><p>Over the following week, patterns had set in.</p><p>Aurora was a tornado of fur and teeth, chewing slippers (and one of Agathas Laboutins but the boys had quickly hidden it so she didn’t know), dragging Rio’s hoodie down the hall, falling asleep mid-zoomie.</p><p>Maleficent, on the other hand, had fully declared her allegiance, wherever Agatha went, she was there, except for bedtime.</p><p>It was subtle at first, padding to the kitchen, lying just out of the way while Agatha cooked.</p><p>Whenever she could, Maleficent would lower her massive head carefully onto Agatha’s stomach. On the sofa. At her desk. Even once when she was standing at the counter, the dog sitting regally upright, pressing her chin against Agatha’s hipbone with the quiet patience of a sentinel.</p><p>“Why does she only do that to you?” Tommy complained one night, sprawled on the rug with Aurora gnawing at his shoelace.</p><p>“Because,” Agatha said, scratching her ears without looking up from her book, “she has taste.”</p><p>Billy wasn’t about to let that go undocumented.</p><p>Caption: Our dogs are basically them.</p><p>He flipped the camera between Maleficent, paws and head draped elegantly across Agatha’s lap, and Aurora half-asleep on Tommy’s chest with a paw in his mouth.</p><p>“Okay, hear me out,” Billy said. “Maleficent is literally Aunt Agatha. Aloof. Gorgeous. Terrifying. Selective affection.”</p><p>- THE SHADE 😭<br/>- Agatha is a queen, confirmed<br/>- That dog is more regal than the British monarchy.<br/>- Selective affection 😂😂😂😂😂</p><p>Tommy snorted, ruffling Autoras fur. “And Aurora? She’s totally Rio. Clingy, chaotic, loves attention, likes to exercise.”</p><p>“Excuse you!” Rio called from the kitchen, but she was laughing too hard to sound offended.</p><p>- STOP THIS IS TOO ACCURATE<br/>- Aurora: sunshine gremlin. Rio: sunshine gremlin.<br/>- Agatha is rolling her eyes but she’s not denying it 👀</p><p>“If you children are done reducing me to a caricature of my dog, may I return to my book?”</p><p>But Maleficent chose that exact moment to sigh deeply and push her head higher against Agatha’s ribs, almost protective, completely tender, tail steadily thumping in time with Agathas scratches. The camera caught it. The chat combusted.</p><p>- NO BC THE DOG IS LITERALLY IN LOVE<br/>- She’s her emotional support Great Dane.<br/>- You know full well Agatha absolutely adores that dog and gives her lots of affection</p><p>Rio leaned on the doorway, watching with a smile before making her way over, slotting herself underneath Agathas legs with a kiss to her lips and then Maleficants head.</p><p>Aurora, as if determined to prove the metaphor true, launched herself into Rio’s lap. She licked her face over and over, tail whacking like a helicopter blade.</p><p>“See?” Tommy said smugly. “She’s is you.”</p><p>Rio pretended to scowl but melted instantly, wrapping the wriggling puppy to her chest. “Fine. Then I say she’s allowed to chew through all your expensive shoes.”</p><p>Agatha looked up over the rim of her glasses. “Not mine,” she said dryly, although her eyes narrowed when the twins shared a nervous glance.</p><p>Maleficent huffed, ignoring her wayward child next to the spare human as she cuddled with her favourite.</p>

<p>The scent of coffee slithered through the kitchen in cruel little tendrils. Agatha, trying to sip her peppermint tea and pretend she was impervious to the nausea that continued to plague her, went pale in record time. She bolted for the bathroom, again, silk robe flaring behind her, extremely thankful that they had one downstairs.</p><p>Maleficent thundered after her, claws clicking on the hardwood, and planted herself in front of the door like an armored knight guarding a castle. Every time Agatha gagged, Maleficent’s chest rumbled with a low huff that promised violence to whoever had dared to cause this indignity.</p><p>By the time Agatha emerged again, pale but composed, Rio was waiting with a steadying hand and a glass of water. She tucked herself against Agatha’s side, lips brushing her temple.</p><p>“You sure it’s just the flu?” Rio murmured, too softly for the boys to hear, tone tinged with concern.</p><p>Agatha’s smile was thin. “It’s must be the same bug you all had last month. I’ll live.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hummed, unconvinced.</p><p>Half an hour later, Agatha was loading the twins and the dogs into the car as Rio was getting ready to set off too.</p><p>“You’re seriously taking them to…” Rio began, but stopped, because of course Agatha was, she loved the dogs already as much as she loved the boys.</p><p>Maleficent leapt gracefully into the back seat, sitting upright like co-counsel ready for deposition. Aurora tried to follow in after her, paws too big for her body, ears flopping like parachutes and immediately got stuck halfway up, back paws scrabbling on the metal until Tommy lifted her in with an affectionate, “You’re hopeless.”</p><p>Billy jumped into passenger, not wanting dog hair or drool on his carefully selected outfit.</p><p>“I want to take them with me, I don’t like leaving them at home,” Agatha muttered, embarrassed that she was so attached to the dogs. “Better to take them with me than come home to whatever catastrophe Aurora creates, besides it’s my firm, I can do what I want.”</p><p>Rio laughed then kissed her softly before calling goodbyes to the boys and the dogs from the rolled window of her corvette as she pulled out ahead for a day of personal training.</p><p>Once the boys were dropped off and they’d pulled up to work, Maleficent wasted no time establishing her presence within the building.</p><p>She marched into Agatha’s office, side by aide with her head pressed to Agathas hip, then circled the space twice like a general surveying the perimeter, dropping heavily onto the newly acquired giant dog bed behind Agatha’s desk once she’d deemed there were no threats.</p><p>Her eyes however stayed trained on Agatha like a loving breathing security system.</p><p>Aurora had no such sense of loyalty, the minute Agatha placed the wriggling puppy down on the floor she was straight out of the open door.</p><p>She tottered into the bullpen, all giant paws and floppy ears much to the delight of the associates already in the building.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Yelena squealed, dumping her coffee to scoop the puppy up like a prize at a carnival. “You’re the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>What she was, in reality, was a productivity disaster.</p><p>Emails were abandoned. Phone calls went unanswered. Depositions were pushed back. Aurora became the gravitational center for most of the junior associates.</p><p>Yelena, who everyone knew was Agatha’s secret favorite, immediately claimed guardianship.</p><p>“I’m looking after her today. She’s staying here with me.”</p><p>“Pretty sure you’re not giving her a choice,” one of the paralegals muttered with a tinge of jealousy, watching Aurora try to chew on a highlighter.</p><p>Yelena monopolized her most of the morning, letting the others pet Aurora when they passed by, but keeping the puppy mostly curled in her lap while she typed with one hand or by her feet chasing after an empty coffee cup, except when Agatha collected her for a potty break.</p><p>She narrated the whole experience into her phone camera, “Today is the best day, I’m babysitting the boss’s baby dog.”</p><p>Agatha continued to appear at hour intervals like a nervous parent, Maleficent looming in tow, peering into the open office to check if Aurora was still alive, content, and being watched. Each time she appeared, the associates straightened in guiltily, caught in the act of playing hooky.</p><p>“She’s fine,” Yelena assured her brightly, holding Aurora aloft like Simba.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “She’d better be.”</p><p>Behind her, Maleficent rumbled as though to say: Look after my baby.</p><p>By mid-morning however Maleficent had gained a very similar reputation to her owner.</p><p>No one dared walk down the hall without checking if Agatha’s bodyguard was on patrol.</p><p>Rumors spread like wildfire.</p><p>“She growled at me when I coughed outside Agathas office door when she was on a call.”</p><p>“She stared me down for standing next to Agatha at the drinks machine.”</p><p>Even Jen, who was for once present in the office,  had started knocking twice before entering, muttering prayers under her breath that the giant dog wouldn’t glare at her.</p><p>But the legend cracked when one brave junior associate, a new hire named Ralph, dropped his sandwich on the floor in front of her as Agatha was changing their water bowls.</p><p>Maleficent bent down and delicately picked it up between her teeth. Instead of swallowing it whole, she placed it gently back in his hand, then sat down with a huff and the dog version of an eye roll.</p><p>Ralph, stunned, whispered, “What a good girl!”</p><p>Within the hour, everyone was sneaking visits to Agatha’s office, pretending they had urgent questions or documents for signature, only to crouch down and scratch behind Maleficent’s ears as they spoke. Both dogs had an ever-expanding fan club within the walls of Harkness and Kale.</p><p>Agatha pretended to be annoyed, but when she peeked over the edge of her brief to find a junior associate almost lying on her floor, rubbing Maleficent’s belly while asking about redrafting clauses, she couldn’t quite hide the smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p>Aurora, on the other hand, remained chaos incarnate.</p><p>She had stolen two pens, a Post-it pad, and a single high heel from someone’s office (Jens) before lunchtime. She chewed through one corner of a deposition transcript and shredded a paralegal’s shopper bag while they were distracted on a call.</p><p>“She’s like a toddler with a sugar rush,” one clerk groaned, watching Aurora attempt to climb onto a swivel chair.</p><p>“She’s an icon,” Yelena corrected firmly, scooping her up.</p><p>Aurora sneezed on her blouse and then licked her cheek. Yelena melted. “See? Adorable.”</p><p>The real test came after lunch.</p><p>Agatha had a critical in person meeting with one of their most critical clients. She couldn’t very well march in with both dogs in tow.</p><p>Standing in the office space, she leveled her most serious stare at Yelena, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor with Aurora curled in her lap like a baby, completely ignoring what she was supposed to be doing.</p><p>“Yelena,” Agatha said, tone sharp enough to make half the associates jump and focus back on their screens. “I need you to do something for me.”</p><p>Yelena straightened, eyes wide. “Yes, of course. Anything.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then gestured at Maleficent, who was pressed against her like a shadow. “Take them out for a walk.”</p><p>The bullpen went silent. You could’ve heard a legal pad drop.</p><p>“Walk them?” Yelena repeated, eyes darting between Maleficent, the sleek, terrifying beast, and Aurora, a floppy disaster currently trying to eat her own paw.</p><p>Agatha’s expression softened, just a fraction.</p><p>“Yes. Both. Together. While I hold this meeting. Can you handle that?”</p><p>Yelena beamed so brightly she might’ve lit the whole office. “Can I handle it? Agatha, I was born for this.”</p><p>She leapt to her feet, Aurora still in her arms, and took the leash from Agatha.</p><p>The rest of the associates leaned over cubicle walls, whispering like they were watching a coronation.</p><p>“She got chosen.”</p><p>“That’s not fair, I wanted to walk them.”</p><p>“She’s literally holding Agathas trust in her hands right now.”</p><p>Yelena straightened her blazer like she was about to lead the firm into battle. “Come on, girls. Let’s go have fun, say bye bye to your mommy.”</p><p>Maleficent glided beside her, head swivelling to watch Agatha over her shoulder. Aurora immediately tried to chew the leash.</p><p>And as Agatha turned toward her meeting, she allowed herself the tiniest, secret smile. She really did like Yelena.</p><p>The moment they were outside, Aurora demanded freedom from the confines of Yelenas arms, wriggling and yapping.</p><p>Yelena obliged, setting her down on the sidewalk. The puppy immediately launched herself face-first into a patch of grass and started trying to eat a dandelion.</p><p>“Okay, that’s fine,” Yelena narrated into her phone camera, which she had whipped out the second they were outside the building. “She’s exploring. Intellectual curiosity is important in any Harkness and Kale associate.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Maleficent trotted alongside her with detached grace, head high, pace perfectly matched to Yelena’s stride. She looked less like a dog and more like a four-legged CEO inspecting her empire.</p><p>Pedestrians literally moved out of her way, terrified of the imposing animal, despite her calmness.</p><p>Yelena was already recording, flipping her camera between the two, “See? Balance. Harkness and Kale breeds both excellence and elegance,” Yelena quipped as she walked.</p><p>At one point Aurora tangled herself around a lamppost, forcing Yelena to stop and unwind the leash while Maleficent sat patiently, watching her child cause chaos.</p><p>By the time they looped back to the office, Yelena had uploaded a short compilation with captions, music, and her voiceover commentary.</p><p>Within half an hour, the video had exploded with over 30k likes, 5k comments and at least 20 members of the firm tagging their friends saying ‘this is literally our office, I told you the dogs were here!’</p><p>Comments rolled in.</p><p>- Love this for you Yelena<br/>- Lmfao those are Agathas dogs<br/>- SHE TOOK THE DOGS TO WORK. THIS IS NOT A DRILL 🐶</p><p>Yelena strutted back in with both dogs an hour and a bit later. Auroras mottled grey fur was covered in grass stains. Maleficent beelined straight for Agathas office, whining to be let in.</p><p>When Agatha finally emerged from her meeting, she found half the office gathered around Yelena’s phone, watching the video on repeat.</p><p>She pinched the bridge of her nose. “What did you do?”</p><p>Yelena spun the screen around proudly. “Nothing, I just elevated the firm’s online presence.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the TikTok. Watched as Maleficent glared regally from behind the screen, as Aurora sneezed on cue, and Yelena’s voice cheerfully narrating “Of course the boss has the best dogs.”</p><p>For a long moment, Agatha said nothing. Then she turned to Maleficent, who was once again nuzzling against Agathas stomach, and sighed, “If you don’t start actually doing some work, their staying in my office all day tomorrow.”</p><p>“I’m working!” Yelena chirped, throwing herself back to her desk.</p><p>The next day, most of the associates brought in dog treats “for morale.” Clients whispered “is that the dogs from TikTok?” as they signed contracts in the lobby, eyeing them playing behind Agathas glass doors.</p><p>Someone had printed a giant photo of Maleficent’s face with the caption “Get some work done or I’m telling my mom” and pinned it up in the copy room.</p><p>Aurora, meanwhile, had become the doggy version of the office intern in earnest. She wandered from desk to desk, shamelessly begging for treats and belly rubs.</p><p>She stole stress balls, lone paralegal’s scarf (she tried to drag it under Maleficent’s bed before being discovered) and bothered Yelena constantly.</p><p>Nobody had the heart to stop her.</p><p>Yelena watched as Agatha march grimly through the office towards her to collect said nuisance when she became a little too excited, when Agatha went very, very still.</p><p>Her face drained of color. She froze mid-sentence, lips parted. And then she bolted straight to the nearest bathroom.</p><p>Maleficent thundered after her, nearly knocking Yelena over in her urgency.</p><p>Everyone went dead silent. Then stared at Yelena.</p><p>“Uh,” she said, blinking, “someone watch Aurora, I’ll go check on them.” And she jogged after them.</p><p>She found Agatha in the bathroom, bent over the toilet, silk blouse askew, one hand braced on the cistern as she gagged miserably. Maleficent had planted herself between Agatha and the open cubicle, rumbling at Yelena like if you even breathe wrong, I will end you.</p><p>“Hey, Mal” Yelena whispered, hands up like she was negotiating a hostage crisis. “It’s okay, I come in peace.”</p><p>Maleficent narrowed her eyes. But when Agatha sagged against the wall with a weary groan, the dog stepped aside, allowing Yelena to slip in.</p><p>For a long beat, Yelena just hovered, awkward but trying. “You, um. You okay, boss?”</p><p>Agatha, impossibly, smoothed a hand over her hair and said, hoarse but stubborn, “Perfectly fine.”</p><p>She made to stand and her knees promptly buckled. Yelena lunged forward, catching her before she hit the tiles.</p><p>“Yup, perfectly fine,” Yelena said brightly, adjusting her hold as Maleficent hovered like an anxious shadow. “Nothing says ‘fine’ like collapsing in your associate’s arms in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon.”</p><p>Agatha made a strangled noise that was somewhere between a laugh and a groan.</p><p>“Don’t you dare say anything to anyone,” she muttered weakly.</p><p>“Oh sure,” Yelena deadpanned. “I’ll just tell everyone our terrifyingly scary boss is throwing up like a college freshman and pretending it’s fine. She’ll definitely not murder me.. or fire me.”</p><p>Agatha cracked the faintest, exhausted smile.</p><p>Maleficent whined, shoving her nose into Agatha’s palm, as though scolding her too.</p><p>Yelena’s voice softened. “Seriously though… are you okay?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m fine.”</p><p>Yelena, trying to tread the line between respect and her usual cheekiness, shrugged. “Do I need to say congratulations?”</p><p>Agatha groaned and pressed her face into her hands. Maleficent barked once, sharp, like she was pleased someone had finally verbalised the possibility.</p><p>“God help me, no, it’s a bug,” Agatha muttered. Her shoulders shook with a small, unwilling laugh, and when she lowered her hands, her eyes were damp, slightly wide and overwhelmed.</p><p>Yelena grinned, still holding her upright. “You know… if you were pregnant, tiktok would go feral.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her, but there was no heat in it. And Yelena tried very hard to hold back her reaction when Agatha gratefully squeezed her arm on the way back out of the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha drove home in a kind of trance, one hand on the wheel, the other pressed unconsciously against her stomach. She kept telling herself she was fine, that Yelenas joke was just that. A joke.</p><p>Flu, exhaustion, stress, whatever it was, it had to be another reason to THAT.</p><p>She had depositions next week. She had dinner to cook. Sports and parent teacher conferences for the boys. She had a houseful of people and animals who depended on her.</p><p>So when Rio leaned against the doorframe of the kitchen that evening, arms folded, watching her fuss with pasta and sauce like nothing was wrong, she wanted to believe it.</p><p>Wanted to let her have the illusion.</p><p>“You look pale, my love.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, the twins barreled through the kitchen mid argument about video games, Aurora tripping after them, ears flopping. Agatha raised a hand for calm, a queen trying to rule her court, when it happened.</p><p>The scent of garlic and simmering tomato hit her like a brick wall. Her whole body lurched forward. She spun toward the sink, hand over her mouth, and bent forward with a strangled sound as the first wave tore through her.</p><p>The boys froze mid-step.</p><p>Rio barely made it in time to hold her girlfriends hair back as Agatha retched miserably into the sink.</p><p>“Agatha?” Tommy’s voice cracked, terrified, the shock of the situation making him use her real name for once.</p><p>Billy hovered beside him, wide-eyed. Aurora barked, confused, and scrambled onto Billy’s feet.</p><p>Rio moved to switch the oven off,  not wanting tue sauce to burn, but before she could reach it, Agatha’s body went limp. Her knees buckled. She crumpled sideways, collapsing against the island before sliding toward the floor.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio’s voice cracked as she caught her just in time, gathering her against her chest.</p><p>Maleficent let out a sharp, broken whine, a sound none of them had ever heard from her before.</p><p>She pressed herself against Agatha’s side, pawing desperately at her arm like she was trying to shake her awake. Another whimper tore from her throat, high and anxious, and she nudged her nose into Agatha’s stomach gently, over and over, crying.</p><p>Rio’s own hands were shaking as she brushed curls back from Agatha’s face. “Sweetheart, hey, hey, my love, open your eyes. Come on, come back to me.”</p><p>Agatha stirred faintly, a groan slipping out, but her eyes stayed shut.</p><p>Billy had frozen, phone clutched in his hand. “Do I…do I call 911?” he stammered.</p><p>Tommy was already moving, grabbing a kitchen towel and running it under cold water. “Here!” He pressed it into Rio’s hands with trembling fingers.</p><p>Rio laid the cloth gently against her girlfriends forehead, her chest tight. “She fainted but she’s breathing. She’s okay boys. She’s okay,” she said, for them, for herself, for the dog pawing and whimpering like her heart was breaking.</p><p>Aurora barked once, sharp and confused, before clambering up Tommy’s leg, whimpering for comfort.</p><p>Maleficent curled herself around Agatha and Rio, pressing her great body close, crying in low, mournful whines every time Agatha didn’t stir at her pawing. She rested her chin on Agatha’s hip, eyes wide and wet.</p><p>Rio bent low, kissing Agatha’s temple, whispering fiercely into her hair: “Don’t do this to me. Don’t you dare.”</p><p>Agatha stayed limp in Rio’s arms, pale and looking impossibly fragile, while her family hovered in a terrified silence around her.</p><p>Then everything broke at once.</p><p>“Auntie!” Tommy’s voice cracked, raw with fear, and tears welled in his eyes as he tried to shake her limp arm. “Wake up, please, please!”</p><p>Billy’s hands fumbled with his phone, his eyes wide and wet. “I’m calling 911, oh god, I’m calling.” His voice was shaking so hard he could barely speak.</p><p>Maleficent was still whining and crying, while Aurora yapped in panic, dancing around both boys legs.</p><p>Rio’s own heart was hammering so loudly she thought she might faint too. But she looked at the boys, their faces blotchy with fear, their hands trembling and something in her snapped taut.</p><p>She didn’t get to panic. Not right now. Their kids needed her.</p><p>“Hey, hey, look at me.” Her voice was firm, sharp enough to cut through their hysteria. Both boys’ tear-streaked faces lifted toward her. “Agathas breathing. She fainted, but she’s still with us. Okay?” She said it like a command, like if she believed it hard enough, it would be true.</p><p>Tommy sniffled, wiping his nose with his sleeve. Billy’s fingers shook as he dialed, tears spilling fast.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and made her voice calm, even though her chest felt like it was splitting.</p><p>“Billy, yes, call the ambulance. Tell them she fainted, she’s breathing, and we need them to come now.”</p><p>Billy nodded frantically, stumbling toward the door for better reception, repeating Rio’s words into the phone as best he could.</p><p>Rio turned to Tommy, who was clutching Agatha’s wrist like he could keep her tethered. “Tommy, sweetheart, I need you to grab me a pillow. We’ll lay her down flat, help her stay comfortable.”</p><p>Tommy scrambled up at once, tears still streaking his cheeks, and returned with one of the sofa pillows. His hands shook as he passed it to Rio, who eased it beneath Agatha’s head.</p><p>“There we go,” Rio murmured, brushing her hand through Tommys hair in a gesture she’d seen Agatha do a thousand times. She swallowed hard against the lump in her throat, speaking more to calm the boys than anything else. “See? She’s okay. Just needs to rest until the doctors get here.”</p><p>Maleficent whimpered again, pressing her face into Agatha’s stomach. Rio reached out with her free hand and stroked the dog’s fur, her voice gentling. “Shh, girl. We’re helping her. It’s okay.”</p><p>Aurora, sensitive to the mood, climbed onto the pillow too, curling up against Agatha’s side like an anxious mini guardian.</p><p>When Billy returned, his phone still pressed to his ear, his face blotchy with tears, Rio gathered both boys closer with one arm, even as she held Agatha with the other.</p><p>“You did so good,” she told Billy firmly. “And you, Tommy, perfect thinking with the towel.” She kissed the tops of their heads, her own tears burning at the edges. “We’re a team, remember? We’ve got her. We’re gonna be okay.”</p><p>The boys clung to her, their small, panicked sobs muffled against her shoulder. Maleficent gave another low, mournful cry.</p><p>And Rio sat there on the kitchen floor, her girlfriend limp in her arms, twins pressed to her side, their dogs encircling them and Agatha.</p><p>She was terrified down to her bones, but she held them steady, because this was her family.</p>

<p>The kitchen, despite being massive, felt too small, too loud with the boys’ panic as they waited for the ambulance.</p><p>Tommy was still kneeling beside Rio, tears steadily dripping down his face. “She’s not waking up fast enough, why isn’t she waking up?” His voice cracked, teetering back toward hysterical.</p><p>Billy paced tight circles, phone clutched to his chest now that the dispatcher had confirmed the ambulance was on the way. “They’re coming, they’re coming, they said to stay calm but what if it takes too long? What if, what if she doesn’t…”</p><p>His breath hitched, wild and shallow.</p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted at the desperation in their voices. She knew why they were so scared. The thought of losing her was unthinkable and to the boys, it obviously felt like history was repeating itself.</p><p>“Listen to me,” Rio said firmly, her arms pulling Tommy in close as she reached her free hand to steady Billy’s shoulder again. She was shaking inside, but her voice was steel. “She is not going anywhere. You hear me? This isn’t the same, I promise you. She fainted, but she’s breathing. She’s right here.”</p><p>Billy’s lip trembled, his eyes glassy. “But, what if”</p><p>“No.” Rio cut him off gently but fiercely. She pressed their foreheads against her shoulders like she could shield them with sheer willpower. “I promise you, she is going to be okay. I won’t let anything happen to her.”</p><p>The twins clung to her cries muffled and hot against her skin. Maleficent whined at their feet, nosing at Agatha’s still hand, while Aurora tucked herself under Tommy’s arm, ears pinned flat.</p><p>Rio pressed her lips to the top of Tommy’s head, then Billy’s, whispering, “I’ve got you. I’ve got all of you. We’re a team. We’re her family, we need to be strong for her.”</p><p>She pulled her phone out, planning ahead, there was one person she knew she needed to call, who Agatha would trust to stay with the boys. She hit call on Jen.</p><p>“Jen,” Rio said the moment she answered, her voice breaking just a little. “It’s Agatha, we’re at home. She fainted, the ambulance is coming. Can you get to the house? Stay with the boys while I…”</p><p>“No!” Both twins’ voices cracked in unison, panicked, almost frantic.</p><p>Tommy shook his head so hard his hair stuck to his damp cheeks. “I’m not staying here. I’m coming to the hospital.”</p><p>Billy grabbed Rio’s arm, desperate. “Please, Rio. Please don’t make us stay. If something happens, we can’t be at home. Not again.”</p><p>The words ripped through Rio’s chest like claws.</p><p>Their fear was raw, primal, the kind that came from scars that never really healed.</p><p>“Okay. Okay, you’re coming. We’ll do this together.” Into the phone, she said quickly, “Jen, scratch that. Meet us at the hospital.”</p><p>Jen’s voice came through sharp, “I’m already halfway to yours, I’ll be there in five.”</p><p>When Rio hung up, she pressed her forehead against Agatha’s temple, breathing her in, holding onto the tiny rise and fall of her chest.</p><p>The faint sound of sirens began to swell in the distance.</p><p>Rio looked up at the  boys, their boys in all the ways that mattered, their eyes red and terrified but fixed on her like she held all the answers.</p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen,” she said, voice steady again. “Tommy, your going to go in the hall to buzz open the gates. Billy, switch the oven off, we don’t want a fire as well. When they take Agatha we’ll be right behind her. No one’s getting left behind. Got it?”</p><p>Both twins nodded.</p><p>The wail of sirens cut through the kitchen, getting louder as they drove up the drive, until flashing lights spilled across the walls.</p><p>“Paramedics!”</p><p>Rio squeezed the boys once, then called out, “Come in, we’re in the kitchen!”</p><p>The door burst open and two EMTs swept in, equipment bags slung over their shoulders, voices calm but brisk.</p><p>“Female, late thirties?” one asked.</p><p>Rio nodded, throat tight. “She fainted about 10 minutes ago. She’s been sick on and off for over a week, we thought flu, but…”</p><p>They were already moving, crouching on either side of Agatha, checking her pulse, fitting the oxygen mask over her nose and mouth.</p><p>Maleficent didn’t move. The giant dog had wedged herself against Agatha’s side and the kitchen Island, pawing at the EMT’s gloved hand when he reached for Agathas arm. Her eyes were wide, pleading, her cries breaking like she was trying to say, Don’t take my person away from me.</p><p>“She won’t hurt you,” Rio said quickly, reassuring the paramedics, stroking Maleficent’s flank, trying to soothe her even as her own voice shook. “She just thinks she’s protecting her.”</p><p>“Big girl’s got loyalty,” one EMT muttered as he patted the dogs head.</p><p>Rio got down low, cupping Maleficent’s face in both hands, pressing her forehead to hers. “Hey, Mal. Let them help. It’s okay. I’ve got her. I’ll stay with her.”</p><p>Maleficent whined again, then reluctantly shifted just enough for the medics to work, still pressing her head into Agathas stomach.</p><p>The twins stood frozen, watching wide eyed as monitors beeped and cuffs inflated. Aurora pressed herself between them, tail tucked, ears flat.</p><p>“She’s stable,” one EMT said finally. “We’re going to transport her to Westview general.”</p><p>The boys surged forward instantly, voices cracking in unison. “We’re coming!”</p><p>Rio stood, steadying them both with her hands on their shoulders. “We’re all going,” she said firmly. “We’ll ride right behind the ambulance.”</p><p>Maleficent whined again as the stretcher clicked into place, and Rio had to tug gently at her collar to keep her from climbing up after Agatha, shutting the dogs in the house behind them.</p><p>Agatha stirred faintly, lids fluttering, a low moan muffled by the mask. It broke Rio’s chest clean open. She pressed a kiss to her knuckles and followed as they wheeled her out.</p><p>Outside, the boys were still crying as Agatha was loaded, begging to climb into the back too until Jens porsche skidded into the driveway, car still running, her heels clattering across the pavement.</p><p>“Whoa, whoa,” Jen said, wrapping her arms around both twins before they could throw themselves into the ambulance. “She needs space right now, okay? Rio, go with her. We’ll follow right behind. I promise you, we won’t be more than a car length away.”</p><p>“She’s going to die!” Tommy’s voice cracked in half.</p><p>“She is not going to die,” Rio said fiercely, holding his face between her hands. “She is one of the most stubborn women I know. Your going to see her again at the hospital in a few minutes.”</p><p>Billy clutched at Rios sleeve, his voice breaking. “Don’t lie.”</p><p>Rio softened, kissing his temple. “I’d never lie to you. She’s going to be okay. Go on, go with Jen.”</p><p>The paramedic shut the ambulance doors, and Rio locked eyes with Jen through the window. Jen gave a sharp nod — I’ve got them.</p><p>Rio leaned over Agatha again, whispering against her hair, “The boys are safe. Jen’s with them. You just hang on for me, okay? Just a little longer.”</p><p>At the hospital the fluorescent lights were harsh, the air sterile and humming. Agatha had been wheeled through double doors, leaving Rio with the twins in the waiting area, both clinging to her hands again like much younger children than the teens they were.</p><p>Rio had signed the paperwork, her neat signature shaking ever so slightly.</p><p>“She’s okay,” Rio whispered over and over, kissing their heads, rubbing their backs, trying to reassure them. “They’re taking care of her. She’s okay.”</p><p>“How is she?” Jen asked.</p><p>“They’re running tests, she came around slightly in the ambulance,” Rio admitted, her own composure finally starting to fray. “She’s been sick for weeks and I should have done something, made her see a doctor, God, I thought it was flu, but…”</p><p>Jen squeezed her arm hard, grounding her.</p><p>“She’s tough. And stubborn. She’ll pull through.“</p><p>Finally, after what felt like centuries but couldn’t have been more than an hour, a doctor in scrubs appeared, clipboard tucked under one arm.</p><p>“Family of Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>All four shot to their feet at once. The boys clung to Rio’s hands, Jen’s palm pressing firm between their shoulders.</p><p>“That’s us.”</p><p>The doctor gave them the kind of practiced calm smile that usually preceded bad news. Rio braced herself for impact.</p><p>“She’s stable,” the doctor began, and the three words made all of them sag with relief. “Her vitals are strong, and she’s conscious. We’ll be keeping her overnight for observation, but she’s not in any danger.”</p><p>Tommy made a sound like he’d been holding his breath for hours and finally let it out. Billy buried his face in Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Can we see her?” Rio asked, straightening, her voice almost breaking on the words.</p><p>The doctor nodded. “She’s asking for you.”</p><p>The recovery room was dim, lit by a single lamp and the rhythmic beep of a monitor. Agatha looked impossibly small against the hospital bed, dark hair spilled across the pillow but her eyes were sharp as the door opened. “Rio?”</p><p>Rio was at her side in two strides, sinking onto the edge of the bed. “Hey, my love.” Her thumb stroked across her cheek. “You scared the hell out of us.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, the corners of her mouth twitching in a faint smile. “Wasn’t exactly my intention.”</p><p>“Agnes?” Tommy’s voice cracked as he edged closer, Billy right beside him. Both of them were blotchy, their eyes red from crying.</p><p>Agatha tried to sit up but immediately hissed at the tug of wires, Rio leaned forward. “Don’t you dare,” she murmured, gently pushing her back against the pillows. “You stay still.”</p><p>The boys hovered at the end of the bed, like they weren’t sure if they were allowed closer.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, her voice hoarse but firm. “Both of you.”</p><p>They scrambled forward, each seizing one of her hands. Billy sniffled, whispering, “We thought you were gonna—”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha interrupted softly, squeezing their fingers with surprising strength.</p><p>The door opened again. The doctor stepped in, smiling gently at the occupants of the room. “Ms. Harkness? Before I continue with diagnoses, are you comfortable with your family being present?“</p><p>Agatha hesitated only a second before glancing at Rio and the twins. “Yes, it’s fine.”</p><p>The doctor nodded. “First, you’re stable. Vitals are strong. We’ll keep you overnight for observation, but you’re not in any danger,” the doctor paused and then, “after running some tests, the fainting was caused by hormonal changes. Your pregnant.”</p><p>The word detonated in the silence. For a long moment, no one spoke, just the sound of the monitor keeping time with Agathas breathing.</p><p>Rio’s hand flew to her mouth, eyes huge. Agatha froze, staring at the doctor like she’d misheard. “…What?”</p><p>“Eight to Ten weeks, by our estimate,” the doctor said gently.</p><p>For a moment, no one breathed.</p><p>Then Tommy blurted, “Oh my god, you’re pregnant?!” His voice cracked into a laugh.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes “…Apparently.”</p><p>He grabbed Billy’s arm. “Dude, we’re getting a baby!”</p><p>Billy’s shock melted into a grin so wide it hurt. “This is insane. This is, holy crap, we have to tell everyone. TikTok is gonna lose it.”</p><p>“They are going to go mad,” Tommy crowed, already pulling out his phone.</p><p>“Absolutely not!” Agatha barked, louder and more serious than she had ever been. The monitor spiked in response to her agitation. “No TikToks. No videos or comments. You do not post about this.”</p><p>Billy froze mid-laugh, then smirked. “Agatha, you literally gave us the safe sex talk last week. And now you’re the one pregnant? This is too good not to share.”</p><p>Tommy doubled over, wheezing. “The irony. The irony!”</p><p>Agatha pinned them with her most famous murder look. “Boys. I’m serious. Please.”</p><p>The boys nodded in agreement before collapsing onto the visitor chairs, whispering conspiratorially about baby names.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t moved.</p><p>She was still sitting in the chair, staring at Agatha with a look that was less shock now and more haunted. Her hand had slipped from Agatha’s, resting limp against her knee. Her silence stretched too long.</p><p>Agatha’s heart stuttered. The twins’ relieved laughter blurred into white noise. All she could feel was Rio’s quiet like a weight.</p><p>She swallowed, voice thin. “Boys, why don’t you go with Jen and get some dinner.”</p><p>The twins glanced at each other nervously, caught between excitement and the sudden tension in the room. Sensing that she needed to speak to Rio in private, Jen nodded and led them away with the promise of a McDonalds.</p><p>As soon as the door closed Agatha broke the silence. “You didn’t know?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “…What?”</p><p>“That you carried the gene,” Agatha clarified, eyes fixed on the ceiling. “For…” she hesitated,“female-to-female conception.”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed. “No,” she admitted softly. “I swear, Agatha, I didn’t know. If I had, I would’ve told you the second we became intimate. I wasn’t, this wasn’t…” She swallowed hard, fingers grasping for Agatha’s. “I didn’t do this to you on purpose.”</p><p>Agatha finally turned her head, studying her. Rio’s eyes were glassy, guilt written in every line of her face.</p><p>“You think I honestly believe you’d ever trick me into something like this?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>Rio’s breath stuttered. “I just… I don’t want you to think I’ve…”</p><p>Agatha cut her off with a faint, tired huff of laughter. “Rio, if anyone’s capable of manipulating a situation into her favor, it’s me. Not you.”</p><p>That coaxed a wet laugh out of Rio, who ducked her head, brushing her forehead against the back of Agatha’s hand. “You’re not angry?”</p><p>“I’m…” Agatha trailed off, searching for the word. “Overwhelmed. Terrified. Still quite nauseous.” A pause. “But not angry. Never at you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily.</p><p>“I thought it wasn’t possible,” Rio whispered, finally pressing both hands to her face, thoughts spiralling. “I never would have…” She stopped, shaking her head hard.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. Panic fluttered under her ribs, cold and sharp. “So this is a mistake.”</p><p>“No!” Rio dropped her hands at once, leaning forward, urgent. “No, not a mistake. Just… a shock. A massive shock.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice wavered. “You’re sure?”</p><p>Rio seized her hand, grip fierce, grounding. “I’m sure. I want you. I want the boys. I want this, whatever it looks like. I just… I can’t believe it’s real. But we’ll figure it out. Together.”</p><p>Agatha released a trembling breath, not quite relief, not quite calm.</p><p>Rio carefully shifted onto the bed, sliding in beside her, propping them both up against the pillows. She wrapped an arm tight around Agatha’s waist, tucking her against her chest, like she could hold her together.</p><p>“I’m here,” Rio murmured, voice fierce through the tears. “For all of it. Whatever we decide, whatever you need—I’m here. Always.”</p><p>Agatha broke then, a quiet, gasping sob slipping out as she buried her face against Rio’s shoulder. Her lips trembled against Rio’s collarbone, her steel unraveling into something raw.</p><p>The room had gone quiet again, the monitor’s beeps filling in the silences between their breaths.</p><p>Rio’s hand traced circles against Agathas back, restless, her mind racing too fast to quiet. She could feel Agatha’s breathing, shallow against her chest, and every inhale was a reminder that they were in a place neither of them had ever imagined being.</p><p>Rio swallowed, her throat tight. She almost didn’t want to speak, afraid that saying the words would make them real. But she had to.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>A hum, low and exhausted, against her shoulder.</p><p>“I need to ask you something. And I need you to be completely honest.”</p><p>That tugged Agatha’s gaze up, her sharp eyes glassy but still steady. “Go on.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, shaky. “Do you… want to get rid of it?”</p><p>The words hung between them, heavy and raw.</p><p>Agatha stilled completely.</p><p>Then, her eyes flashed, fire cutting through the haze of fear and nausea. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>The words came fast, fierce, with no doubt or uncertainty. Her hand clenched in Rio’s shirt like she could anchor herself there.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. Relief and guilt warred in her chest, crashing against each other until she felt dizzy. “Okay,” she whispered, nodding, eyes burning. “Okay. I had to ask. I didn’t want you to feel like you couldn’t say it, if that’s what you wanted.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head hard, hair spilling against the pillow, her grip loosened just enough for her to search Rio’s face, her voice trembling. “But if you don’t want this…” She forced the words out, even as her lips trembled. “That’s okay. You can walk away.”</p><p>The offer gutted Rio.</p><p>Her chest ached like something inside her had been torn open. She caught Agatha’s face in both hands, cupping her cheeks, forcing her to meet her gaze.</p><p>“Don’t you dare say that to me,” Rio rasped. “Don’t you ever think I’d leave you. I’m scared, yes. God, I’m terrified. But I’m not going anywhere.” Her voice cracked, fierce with love. “I told you ready. You’re it for me, Agatha. You and the boys. And now, our baby too. I’m in. All the way in.”</p><p>Agatha blinked hard, the tears spilling before she could stop them. Her laugh was wet and broken. “You always know exactly what to say to unravel me.”</p><p>Rio kissed the salt of those tears, her forehead pressed firm against Agatha’s. “God, I love you so much.”</p><p>Agatha let herself collapse into her arms then, trembling, clutching Rio like she was the only steady ground left in the world.</p><p>The tears ebbed slowly, leaving both of them raw but lighter, as if the worst of the storm had broken. Rio kept her arms wrapped tight around Agatha, grounding her, kissing her hairline every so often like she was reminding herself this was real, that Agatha was still here.</p><p>For the first time since the doctor had said the word pregnant, the silence didn’t feel suffocating.</p><p>Agatha sniffed, dragging the back of her wrist across her damp cheeks.</p><p>Rio tilted her chin so their eyes met. “It is. It’s happening. You’re… we’re…” She laughed then, breathless and incredulous. “We’re having a baby. Can you imagine? A tiny person with your impossible sass and gorgeous hair and my energy?”</p><p>Agatha let out a watery laugh, pressing her forehead to Rio’s. “God help us all.”</p><p>The door eased open then, and the boys slipped back in with Jen trailing behind them, the smell of French fries clinging to their clothes. They were buzzing, jittery with held-in excitement.</p><p>“You’re really having a baby?” Billy whispered, like the words were too big to say at full volume:</p><p>Agatha lifted her hand, beckoning him closer. “Looks that way.”</p><p>Tommy nearly bounced out of his shoes, his grin wide and unstoppable. “This is insane. We’re gonna be big brothers. We’re gonna teach them everything.” He spun to Billy, eyes sparkling. “We need to start a list. Of baby names. And stuff we’re gonna teach them.”</p><p>Both womens hearts melted at the term brother.</p><p>“And outfits! I’m going to dress them in so many amazing clothes” Billy added, almost tripping over his own words. “And read them fairytales and teach them how to be kind.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. Agatha watched them, her heart tightening in her chest until she thought it might split at how happy they were. For the first time since she’d woken, she felt a spark of something beyond fear.</p><p>Her voice was quiet, but steady when she said it: “This baby’s already got the best family in the world.”</p><p>Rio’s hand found hers again, squeezing tight. “Damn right they do.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the pillows, the monitor beeping steadily, the boys’ laughter spilling through the room. The corners of her lips curved up with an unguarded softness.</p><p>By the time Agatha was discharged, she was exhausted from fluorescent lights and beeping machines. Hospitals, she decided, were designed to make even the healthiest person feel like death warmed over.</p><p>Rio kept a protective hand at her back the entire way out, ignoring Agatha’s muttered protests. The twins practically jogged ahead, carrying her overnight bag like it was royal luggage.</p><p>The front door hadn’t even shut before Maleficent barrelled into view.</p><p>She launched herself at Agatha with the grace of a freight train, massive paws thumping against Agatha’s thighs. The dog whined high and desperate, pressing her face into Agatha’s stomach like she was trying to merge with her.</p><p>“Mal,” Agatha laughed, bracing herself against the doorframe. “Darling, I was gone for one day, not ten years.”</p><p>Maleficent ignored her, licking her wrist with dramatic slurps, tail wagging hard enough to rattle the sideboard.</p><p>Then Aurora came hurtling around the corner, ears flapping like sails. She yipped, tried to leap directly into Agatha’s arms, and nearly toppled backward before Tommy swooped in to catch her mid-air.</p><p>“See? She’s been feral without you,” Tommy said, depositing the squirming puppy into Agatha’s hold.</p><p>Aurora immediately licked her chin, paws scrabbling against her chest, as though to say don’t you dare leave again.</p><p>Agatha sank down onto the sofa with both dogs piled with her, Maleficent pressed protectively against her side, Aurora wriggling like a toddler who’d had too much sugar. The twins collapsed beside her, one on each end, while Rio hovered in front of her.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just sat there, staring at the absurdity of it all, her lap full of fur, her sides bracketed by boys who were trying to act cool but were clearly still shaken, Rio watching her with those dark, steady eyes.</p><p>Maleficent gave a loud, satisfied huff and rested her head on Agatha’s belly. Aurora copied her, snuggling her nose against the same spot.</p><p>Rio caught it, her lips twitching upward. “Guess they already know.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the two dogs nestled against her stomach, then up at Rio, her brows lifting. “That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed, lowering herself onto the arm of the sofa, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s temple. “So’s this whole family. That’s the point.”</p>

<p>Steam still clung faintly to Agatha’s skin, fresh from the bath, her hair falling in damp, dark ribbons over her shoulders as she sat propped against the headboard. The glow of the lamp softened the sharp edges of her cheekbones, shadow from the book in her hand casting against the wall. She looked peaceful, almost.</p>
<p>Rio lay curled beside her, head nestled into the curve of Agatha’s shoulder, their fingers intertwined with a grip that refused to loosen. Her other hand rested firmly at Agatha’s waist, thumb rubbing over her navel where their child was growing.</p>
<p>She had not stopped watching her. Not once since they had walked through the door. Every tilt of Agatha’s head, every turn of a page, every quiet exhale, Rio’s gaze followed, drinking her in with an intensity that bordered on reverence.</p>
<p>It should have been suffocating. It should have been maddening. Instead, it left Agatha trembling somewhere deep inside, caught between irritation and a kind of raw, unbearable tenderness.</p>
<p>“You’re staring. Again.” Her voice was dry, her mouth quirking despite herself.</p>
<p>Rio didn’t even try to deny it. Her voice came low, unsteady. “I can’t stop. I was so worried yesterday.” Her thumb traced slow, protective circles over Agatha’s stomach, the pattern both soothing. “And now… you’re carrying our child. How am I supposed to look anywhere else?”</p>
<p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She had meant to make light of it, to throw up some teasing defense, but the look on Rio’s face, the nakedness of it, rooted her in place. The love burning in those eyes was fierce, almost frightening in its purity.</p>
<p>“You’re going to smother me,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Rio didn’t hesitate, lifting her head to press a kiss against Agatha’s lips, soft, certain, unashamed. “I will. You can call me overbearing, obsessive and ridiculous later. I don’t care. Right now, just let me have it.”</p>
<p>The quiet finality in her tone stole whatever retort Agatha had left. For a while, the world shrank to the sound of turning pages, the cadence of breathing in rhythm, the steady weight of Rio pressed against her side.</p>
<p>But then Agatha spoke again, her voice low, almost fragile.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“Mhm?”</p>
<p>A long pause stretched, filled with hesitation. Agatha’s hand tightened on the blanket bunched in her lap. “Do you think… you might already have children out there?”</p>
<p>The silence that followed hit like a stone dropped into still water. Rio blinked, startled, her head lifting as though she hadn’t heard correctly. “What?”</p>
<p>Agatha couldn’t look at her. Her gaze stayed fixed on the fabric, fingers clenching. “If you carry the gene, it stands to reason it could have happened before. Without you realizing. With someone else.” The words spilled out like poison she had no choice but to drink, bitter and heavy, and each one cost her something to say.</p>
<p>Rio’s hand tightened instantly around hers, firm, grounding.</p>
<p>“Agatha,” she said, her voice low and steady, an anchor against the storm. “Look at me.”</p>
<p>Slowly, reluctantly, Agatha lifted her eyes. She braced herself for anger, for wounded pride, for dismissal. Instead she found Rio’s gaze, sharp, unwavering, absolute.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any others,” Rio said, every syllable deliberate, carved from truth.</p>
<p>Agatha’s throat closed. “How can you be sure?” she managed, her voice breaking with the tremor she couldn’t hide.</p>
<p>Rio didn’t flinch. “Because I was on contraceptives,” she answered without hesitation. “Not even for birth control, just to manage my periods. From being a teen. I only stopped less than a year ago, when my doctor changed my prescription. And in that time,” she leaned closer, her words fierce and tender all at once, “you’re the only person I’ve been with. The only one. There hasn’t been anyone else.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s breath hitched. The wave of relief that surged through her was sharp, almost painful, leaving behind the sting of guilt.</p>
<p>“You’re sure,” she whispered, fragile as glass.</p>
<p>Rio cupped her cheek with a reverence that made Agatha want to sob. Her eyes blazed with unshakable certainty. “I swear on everything I am, Agatha. There is no other child, no hidden past looming over us. This,” her hand slid down to rest reverently against Agatha’s abdomen, the touch tender, “this is the first. Ours. Yours and mine.”</p>
<p>That touch undid her. Agatha’s laugh broke, fractured into a sob as she folded into Rios embrace, her whole body trembling.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she gasped, muffled against her shirt. “Even asking that, it wasn’t fair on you, and it wouldn’t matter, but I…”</p>
<p>Rio’s arms came around her instantly, cradling her close, pressing kisses to her hair, her temple, her forehead, as though she could cover every wound Agatha carried with love alone. “Don’t you dare apologise. Don’t you dare. I love you. I’m obsessively, stupidly, hopelessly in love with you. And maybe the universe knew, maybe that’s why this happened. Why we happened.” Her lips brushed Agatha’s skin with every vow. “I’m not going anywhere. Not ever.”</p>
<p>Agatha clung to her, fists tightening in her shirt, her voice raw and small. “I don’t deserve you.”</p>
<p>“Too bad,” Rio answered fiercely, pulling her even closer. “You’re stuck with me. I’m going to be impossible about it, hovering, fussing, carrying you everywhere, driving you insane with how much I love you.” Her laugh shook, half tears, half joy. “You’re going to hate me.”</p>
<p>Agatha lifted her head, her eyes shining, her lips pulling into the faintest of smiles. “I could never hate you.”</p>
<p>And then Rio kissed her, slow and reverent, pouring everything she couldn’t say into the press of her lips. She guided Agatha down gently against the pillows, her hands worshipful, her devotion unrelenting, as if each caress could etch her love into Agatha’s very skin. Long into the night, she loved her, fierce, tender, unstoppable, until words were no longer needed at all.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the twins were quivering with excitement. Ever since they’d left the hospital, their energy hadn’t dimmed for a moment. Lists of “cool” names sprawled across scrap paper and half-crumpled notebooks, arguments over nursery themes happened over dinner and every waking second seemed to orbit around the baby. Around Agatha.</p>
<p>And around keeping her insight.</p>
<p>They hovered, endlessly, every time she so much as shifted in her chair, Tommy was there, darting forward to grab her elbow as though she might crumble to dust if unsupported.</p>
<p>Billy had developed a sixth sense for her sighs, appearing instantly with a blanket or a pillow or a glass of water if she so much as breathed heavily.</p>
<p>Their chatter filled every corner of the house, but their bodies were never far from hers, constantly keeping vigil.</p>
<p>For the first day, it was sweet.</p>
<p>For the second, endearing.</p>
<p>By the third, when Billy followed her right up to the bathroom door and announced solemnly that he’d wait in case she fainted, Agatha decided enough was enough.</p>
<p>“Twins,” she called, her voice slicing through the house with that particular note of authority that brooked no argument.</p>
<p>Two guilty faces appeared instantly around the corner.</p>
<p>“Living room. Now.”</p>
<p>They obeyed with all the eagerness of soldiers marching to their execution, shuffling to the sofa and sitting stiffly side by side. Rio lingered in the doorway, arms folded, one brow arched, silently amused as she leaned her shoulder against the frame.</p>
<p>Agatha stood opposite them, arms crossed, her gaze sharp enough to pin them both in place.</p>
<p>“We need to talk.”</p>
<p>Tommy blurted out first, his voice too high. “If this is about the midnight feast for the dogs, I swear it was Billy’s idea.”</p>
<p>“Hey!” Billy smacked his arm. “You gave them half of it!”</p>
<p>Agatha lifted one hand, and silence fell immediately. The room seemed to still under her gaze.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about midnight feasts for the dogs, though yes, we will talk about that later.” She let the words hang, then softened, her voice lowering. “This is about me. And you. And this family.”</p>
<p>The twins glanced nervously at one another before looking back at her.</p>
<p>She stepped forward, her voice soft and certain. “I know you were scared when I fainted. I saw it in your faces at the hospital. You thought I might disappear.” She drew a slow breath, willing her words to settle in them. “Listen to me. I am not going anywhere. Not willingly. Not ever.”</p>
<p>They froze, caught in the emotion of her words.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she said, her voice trembling with conviction. “As if you were my own sons. And nothing, no dizzy spell, no sickness, no twist of fate, will ever change that. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>Billy’s lip trembled. Tommy swallowed hard, blinking rapidly.</p>
<p>“Do you understand?” Agatha pressed, softer now.</p>
<p>“Yes,” they whispered, twin voices small. Their shoulders loosened all at once, and the boys leaned unconsciously closer to each other.</p>
<p>“Good,” she said, straightening. Her hand drifted, almost without thought, to her abdomen.</p>
<p>“Because the truth is, life happens. Accidents, surprises, miracles. Things we don’t plan for.” She let her palm rest there, quiet but sure. “Like this baby. But whatever comes, you two are my family. My kids too. Always.”</p>
<p>Tommy’s grin cracked through the tension, wild and boyish, while Billy wiped hastily at his eyes, trying to hide tears he couldn’t quite stop from pooling.</p>
<p>Agatha let them have their moment before arching a brow, her tone sharpening like a blade.</p>
<p>“That said… I am pregnant, not an invalid. If either of you tries to follow me into the bathroom again, you’ll be scrubbing the floors with a toothbrush.”</p>
<p>Twin shades of red crept up their necks.</p>
<p>Rio, still leaning against the doorway, snorted into her fist.</p>
<p>Agatha smirked. “Hover less. Trust me more. Deal?”</p>
<p>“Deal,” Billy muttered, shamefaced.</p>
<p>Rio finally crossed the room, slipping behind the sofa and looping her arms around both in a sudden, firm hug. They startled, then melted into her touch. She pressed her cheek briefly against Tommy’s messy hair, then Billy’s, before meeting Agatha’s gaze over their heads. Her eyes shone.</p>
<p>The laughter and relief settled slowly into a warm hush. Tommy leaned forward, grinning wide, while Billy scrubbed his eyes with his sleeve, cheeks pink with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, tension unwinding in her chest. She let her gaze linger on the twins, soft and unwavering.</p>
<p>“You two drive me absolutely mad,” she said, lips twitching. “You’re loud, reckless, and you eat like a plague of locusts.”</p>
<p>Tommy smirked. “Thanks?”</p>
<p>“And yet,” she continued, voice dipping, “I can’t imagine a single day without you. You’re mine. Blood or not. You’re mine.”</p>
<p>That silenced them. Tommy’s grin faltered into something softer, more tentative. Billy ducked his head, shoulders curling inward as though trying to hide from how much the words pierced.</p>
<p>Rio’s throat bobbed as she pressed her lips together, blinking back her own emotions.</p>
<p>Agatha leaned forward, elbows braced on her knees, looking at each boy in turn. “You’re going to be amazing big brothers.”</p>
<p>Rio moved then, standing beside Agatha, her hand slipping into hers, fingers twining tight. She didn’t speak at first. She didn’t need to, the look on her face was thick with pride and awe.</p>
<p>But then she shifted, her gaze falling to the boys. Her voice, when it came, was quiet but firm.</p>
<p>“And I want you both to hear this from me, too.”</p>
<p>They looked up, startled, caught by the rare seriousness in her tone.</p>
<p>Rio leaned forward slightly, eyes holding them steady. “I love you. Both of you. More than you realise.” She swallowed, her voice gaining strength. “When I walked into this family, I didn’t know what I was getting. I thought maybe, maybe I’d always be on the outside, just a visitor.” Her eyes burned, and she blinked hard. “But you let me in. You made me part of this. And I swear to you, I will never let you down. I’ll be here. For you. Always. Just like I’ll be here for your aunt.”</p>
<p>She squeezed Agatha’s hand, then drew both boys in tighter against her chest. “You’re mine now too. And nothing changes that. Ever.”</p>
<p>Tommy’s mouth worked, but no sound came. He settled for pulling her forward into a hug, his grin bright but his eyes wet. Billy made a small, broken sound, then pressed his face into Rio’s shoulder, hiding the tears he couldn’t hold back.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand tightened in Rio’s, her heart thudding at the sight of them, her chaotic little family.</p>
<p>Tommy cleared his throat, muttering, “We get it. You both love us.”</p>
<p>Billy sniffled and elbowed him weakly. “Shut up.”</p>
<p>Agatha smirked faintly, eyes glinting. “Good. I’ll hold you to that when I’m old and cranky and you’re threatening to put me in a home.”</p>
<p>The boys groaned in unison, but laughter broke through the tears, easy and unrestrained, filling the room with life.</p>
<p>Rio pressed a kiss Agatha’s temple, murmuring against her skin, “You’re terrible.”</p>
<p>Agatha leaned briefly into her touch, smirking. “And you love it.”</p>
<p>“Obsessively,” Rio whispered, for her alone.</p>
<p>Agatha’s gaze softened, her voice warm but sly. “Good. Now, again, hover less, all of you. And yes, that includes you, Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio arched a brow, her lips curving. “I’m not hovering. I’m… vigilantly loving.”</p>
<p>Agatha rolled her eyes, settling back against her chair, though the faintest smile tugged at her lips. “Right. Vigilantly loving. Just don’t smother me into an early grave. The baby can’t handle that kind of nonsense yet.”</p>
<p>Rio chuckled, pulling her closer despite her words, her arms a steady shield around all of them.</p>
<p>And for the first time in days, Agatha’s heart felt wholly, entirely at peace.</p>
<p>By 11pm, Agatha was asleep, curled on her side, one hand resting protectively near her stomach. Her breathing was steady, deep. Rio lay beside her for a long while, unwilling to move, just watching the faint rise and fall of her chest.</p>
<p>She brushed a kiss against Agatha’s parted lips, then carefully slid out of bed, padding barefoot into the hallway. The boys had sworn they’d go to bed on time but she had a feeling they weren’t sleeping.</p>
<p>Rio smirked to herself and started with Billy’s room.</p>
<p>The door was cracked just enough to see the faint glow of a phone screen. She pushed it open quietly.</p>
<p>Billy was sprawled half across his bed, one arm flung around Aurora, the puppy snoring blissfully against his chest. His phone was balanced precariously on the pillow beside him.</p>
<p>Rio leaned against the doorway, her heart squeezing at the sight. “You’re going to smother her if you sleep like that, kiddo.”</p>
<p>Billy startled, blinking up, his curls a wild halo. “I was just asleep!”</p>
<p>Rio snorted. “Sure you were.” She crossed the room, lowering her voice. “You okay?”</p>
<p>Billy hesitated, then nodded, his face softening as he looked down at the puppy. “Yeah. Just thinking about stuff.”</p>
<p>Rio’s chest ached. She brushed a hand through his curls, kissing the top of his head. “You don’t have to carry all those thoughts by yourself. I’ve got you. Always.”</p>
<p>He gave a small nod, “Yeah, I know. Don’t go all mushy on me, Rio.”</p>
<p>She smirked. “Too late.”</p>
<p>He groaned, but leaned against her hand anyway, soaking in the affection he pretended to hate.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Billy.”</p>
<p>“Night, Rio.”</p>
<p>She left him with Aurora curled tight against him, then padded down the hall to Tommy’s room.</p>
<p>Maleficent was sprawled across most of the bed, leaving Tommy perched sideways near the edge with his blanket bunched under his chin. The dog’s massive head rested over his legs like a protective weight.</p>
<p>“You realise she takes up more space than you do,” Rio teased softly, stepping inside.</p>
<p>Tommy grinned sheepishly. “Yeah, but she keeps me warm.” He stroked the dog’s ear. “She won’t let anything bad happen.”</p>
<p>She crouched at the edge of his bed, resting her arms on her knees. “I won’t let anything bad happen to you either.”</p>
<p>He looked at her, caught by the steadiness in her voice.</p>
<p>“Promise?”</p>
<p>“Promise.”</p>
<p>His smile wobbled, but he nodded, and for a moment he was quiet, vulnerable in a way he rarely let himself be. Then, suddenly, his grin turned sly. “You know, we’re live right now.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p>
<p>Tommy angled his phone toward her, screen glowing. The TikTok live feed showed hearts and comments racing up the side. Thousands of viewers were watching.</p>
<p>Rio gaped. “You little…”</p>
<p>Billy’s voice echoed faintly from down the hall. “You weren’t supposed to tell her!”</p>
<p>Rio pressed her face into her hands, laughing despite herself. “You two are impossible.”</p>
<p>- Omg Rio is momming so hard rn 🥺<br/>
- The dogs are literally co-parents at this point<br/>
- Protective dog + protective step mami = safest kids ever<br/>
- This family is the definition of goals</p>
<p>Tommy leaned toward the camera, smirking. “See? They love it. Tell them how much you love us.”</p>
<p>Rio groaned, shaking her head but smiling. She looked directly at the phone, her voice soft but sure. “Alright, tiktok. These two? They’re my boys, my family. And I’d walk through fire for them. I love them but they need to go to bed.”</p>
<p>The comments exploded in hearts and crying emojis. Billy poked his head in the doorway, Aurora in his arms, grinning. “They’re obsessed with you, Rio.”</p>
<p>“Great,” Rio muttered, rolling her eyes, though her smile gave her away. She leaned over and kissed Tommy’s hair, then reached out to ruffle Billy’s curls when he came closer.</p>
<p>“Now both of you, off live and in bed. Some of us actually need sleep.”</p>
<p>They groaned in unison, but Billy ended the stream to a flood of protests in the chat.</p>
<p>Rio stood, hands on her hips, giving them both a look that was equal parts stern and fond.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, ridiculous children.”</p>
<p>“Night,” they chorused, grinning.</p>
<p>As she slipped back down the hall, she paused at the door to her own room. The laughter of the boys still echoed faintly, warm and alive. Inside, Agatha slept peacefully.</p>
<p>Rio exhaled, a slow, quiet smile curving her lips. She finally let herself fully believe it, this chaotic, messy, wonderful life was hers to keep.</p>
<p>And she would guard it with everything she had.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Chapter 42</h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The week after Agatha’s hospital trip, the house had slipped back into something resembling normal, or at least, the version of “normal” achievable when you lived with two teenage boys, one perpetually love-struck woman, a dog the size of a small horse and a chaos gremlin in puppy form along with a baby brewing that no one but a handful of people knew about.</p>
<p>The sharp, panicky edges of worry had dulled.</p>
<p>Her talk with the boys had soothed them, though not enough to keep them from suddenly materializing in doorways like awkward ghosts.</p>
<p>They’d wander in under the flimsiest excuses, “Do you need water? Want me to hold the remote? Are you sure you’re okay? How about now?”, until Agatha had to laugh and reassure them she wasn’t about to keel over. She indulged them with patience, just thankful that they weren’t constantly pestering her like they had the first few days.</p>
<p>Rio was worse. Absolutely, horrifically worse.</p>
<p>She’d promised herself she wouldn’t hover, wouldn’t trail after Agatha like some lovesick puppy (or like Maleficent), but she failed miserably.</p>
<p>Rio was trying, genuinely trying, not to stare at her constantly in open awe, but the effort was pitiful at best. Every time Agatha walked into a room, Rio’s head snapped around like she was a meerkat on high alert - her version of subtlety was about as convincing as a cat trying not to knock over a glass. Every glance gave her away, pure adoration, pure awe, and an almost comical level of disbelief.</p>
<p>Maleficent, of course, was the most shameless of them all. The dog had imprinted on Agatha the moment they’d locked eyes at the shelter and no amount of coaxing could make her budge. She followed her from room to room, all one hundred and fifty pounds of canine bodyguard, pressing her massive head to Agatha’s stomach as though sheer force of loyalty could shield the baby inside, loping away at bedtime with the boys with a mournful look over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Aurora, not to be outdone, had taken to climbing into Agatha’s lap, awkward with her growing limbs, wedging herself between Agatha and any paperwork, coffee cup, or laptop that was in her way.</p>
<p>Agatha had returned to the firm after a single day’s leave, slipping back into boss mode with the kind of grace that made it look as though nothing had changed. The truth, of course, was in the small cracks, her occasional dashes to the bathroom to throw up and her stubborn refusal to admit fatigue despite growing paler in the afternoons.</p>
<p>She’d decided to keep the pregnancy under wraps until the next doctor’s appointment scheduled for a two weeks time.</p>
<p>Though Jen usually worked from her cozy home office with the exception of court days or client meetings, she’d been present at the office much more often that week. Sometimes she pretended it was for “files,” but more often she was sprawled cross-legged on Agatha’s office rug, scratching Maleficent’s ears, with Aurora half-asleep in her lap.</p>
<p>Agatha would eventually sigh in mock exasperation and agree to take a break. Jen would smirk, victorious without saying a word.</p>
<p>It was subtle, but it was her way of keeping a watchful eye and making sure her friend was ok.</p>
<p>By Friday, after a particularly brutal day in court where she’d won, of course, but felt ready to collapse, Agatha came home and immediately exhaled.</p>
<p>She kicked her heels off by the door, traded her courtroom power suit for soft silk pajamas, tied her hair into something that resembled a curly bun, rolled up her sleeves, and headed straight to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Dinner wasn’t going to be fancy. Not tonight, not with Eddie over, and definitely not with her stomach still staging occasional mutinies during dinner prep with strong scents. No, tonight was comfort food territory - creamy mac and cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy.</p>
<p>Predictably, the twins and Eddie hovered around the kitchen island like vultures. They stole handfuls of shredded cheese with zero subtlety, swiped spoonfuls of gravy, and muttered flimsy excuses when Agatha caught them.</p>
<p>Eddie, after a token protest towards the twins pestering, gave in and joined their petty thievery, earning himself a proud slap on the back from Tommy and an eye-roll and a blushing cheek kiss from Billy.</p>
<p>Agatha swatted at them all half-heartedly, laughing at Eddie, who looked more and more at ease with every stolen bite.</p>
<p>Dinner was loud, messy, and perfect. The boys bickered over the last spoonful of mac and cheese, Tommy teased Billy and Eddie until Eddie turned scarlet, and Tommy nearly started a gravy war before Agatha threatened to assign time out on the naughty step like their mom had done when they were toddlers.</p>
<p>Agatha sat back in her chair, Rio beside her, hands entwined under the table, watching the chaos unfold. Her exhaustion hummed in her bones, but it was softened, sweetened, by the glow of it all, her home, her family, full of laughter and warmth, the kind that filled every corner of the room.</p>
<p>By the time the dishes were rinsed and stacked neatly in the sink, exhaustion had caught up with Agatha like a tidal wave. She didn’t so much sit on the sofa as collapse onto it, blanket in hand, letting gravity do most of the work.</p>
<p>The boys made their retreat upstairs, Eddie trailing after them like he wasn’t quite sure what he’d signed up for. Billy was already dragging him with gleeful promises of utter annihilation on their newest game, while Tommy insisted loudly from the hallway that Billy couldn’t beat a toddler in Mario Kart, let alone me.</p>
<p>Agatha, meanwhile, found her destination in Rio’s lap. She draped herself across it with the dramatic finality of a queen throwing herself onto her throne after a long day of ruling. She burrowed in as though she’d been waiting all day for this exact spot, and Rio, caught between delight and worry, could do nothing but wrap her arms around her.</p>
<p>Agatha tugged the blanket around them, lips parting slightly against Rios neck in the haze between waking and sleep, her composure stripped away, cocooned in fleece, she looked impossibly soft.</p>
<p>One hand dangled loosely on the sofa, the other curled with quiet possessiveness into Rio’s dark hair, fingers twining like she had no intention of letting go.</p>
<p>Rio shifted slightly, allowing her to tug Agatha even closer, too reverent to move more than that. Her awe had nowhere to hide now, it was written plainly across her face, wide-eyed and unguarded. She smoothed a hand over the blanket, feather-light, terrified of disturbing the peace etched into Agatha’s now sleeping features.</p>
<p>On Agatha’s other side, Maleficent dropped heavily onto the sofa with a sigh that could have come from a war veteran finally off duty, nosing to rest against the flat of Agathas stomach, while Aurora made a less graceful leap into the far corner, sprawling with her paws in the air like a toddler in a sugar crash.</p>
<p>The house settled into stillness, broken only by the quiet hum of the fridge and the occasional video-game battle cry from upstairs.</p>
<p>By the time 11pm rolled around, Rio finally dared to move, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s temple before gathering her carefully in her arms. Agatha stirred just enough to sigh, burying her face against Rio’s neck before drifting off again. Rio carried her upstairs like she was made of glass.</p>
<p>As she passed the boys doors she called out a “wrap it up soon”, before she disappeared into the master bedroom.</p>
<p>A half hour after her footsteps faded, Tommys door creaked open. He peeked out with the exaggerated sneakiness of someone who had never once been subtle in his life, Aurora tucked under his arm like a co-conspirator.</p>
<p>Billy was already leaning against the wall in his pajamas, arms crossed, Maleficent looming behind him like their enormous four-legged bodyguard.</p>
<p>Billy grinned. “Midnight feast?”</p>
<p>Tommy smirked. “Midnight feast.”</p>
<p>Aurora barked once, tail wagging like she’d been waiting for the suggestion all night. Maleficent gave a grunt that sounded suspiciously like disapproval.</p>
<p>Eddie’s door opened next, his hair sticking up in about twelve directions. He squinted at the twins. “It’s past midnight. You maniacs know people actually sleep at this hour, right?”</p>
<p>“Boring people,” Billy shot back.</p>
<p>“People who don’t understand the sacred tradition of midnight feasts,” Tommy added solemnly.</p>
<p>Eddie rubbed his face, muttering, “Why do I feel like I’m about to get dragged into chaos?”</p>
<p>“Because you are,” Billy said cheerfully. “Now shut up and come on.”</p>
<p>Together, the boys crept down the hall like they were pulling off the world’s least stealthy heist, Maleficent’s nails clicking against the hardwood with every step, Aurora wriggling in Tommys arms and trying to lick his ear.</p>
<p>By the time they hit the kitchen, they were already bickering, Billy insisting the leftover mac and cheese had his name on it, Tommy claiming he’d seen it first, Eddie begging them not to wake Agatha because he valued his life, and Aurora attempting to nose the fridge open like she owned the place.</p>
<p>The twins had pulled every snack they could find: chips, biscuits, fruit already chopped and plated, cheese, a half-empty bag of marshmallows, even a tub of ice cream. Aurora trotted excitedly in circles, while Maleficent sprawled across the kitchen floor like a sphinx, her giant head occasionally lifting whenever one of the boys passed by.</p>
<p>And, of course, the boys were live on TikTok again.</p>
<p>The camera, propped against a cereal box caught it all, Billy dramatically whispering commentary like a nature documentary host, Tommy shoving an entire cookie in his mouth, Aurora trying to climb onto the table with Eddies help and Maleficent catching tossed popcorn mid-air with terrifying accuracy.</p>
<p>- NOT THE DOGS AT THE FEAST 😭<br/>
- Aurora is the cutest lil baby 🐶<br/>
- Mal is literally bodyguard AND vacuum cleaner<br/>
- This is the content we signed up for</p>
<p>Billy leaned toward the camera, cheeks stuffed with chips. “For legal reasons, if Agatha and Rio find out, this was totally Tommy’s idea.”</p>
<p>Tommy threw a marshmallow at his head.</p>
<p>Upstairs, Agatha stirred first. She frowned, groggy, hearing distant clatters and muffled laughter drifting up the stairs.</p>
<p>She nudged Rio’s shoulder. “Are they raiding the kitchen? What time is it?”</p>
<p>Rio groaned into the pillow. “It’s past midnight.”</p>
<p>“I bet you their live on tiktok. I can feel it.”</p>
<p>She sat up, hair mussed, eyes narrowing with the instinctive glare of a woman about to enforce order. “Alright. Time to remind them who runs this house.”</p>
<p>Rio smirked, wicked plan forming even as she was half-asleep. “Let’s scare them.”</p>
<p>Downstairs, the boys were mid feast, laughing and shoving each other as they read the chats comments, Billy holding Aurora aloft like she was Simba so Eddie could feed her cheese.</p>
<p>The kitchen was a disaster zone of snacks when the lights flickered and went out completely, plumging them into semi-darkness.</p>
<p>Billy froze mid-bite of microwaved chicken. “Uh…Tommy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with the electrics?”</p>
<p>Tommy shrugged at him. “It’s never done that before!”</p>
<p>- DID THE LIGHTS JUST DIE 💀💀💀<br/>
- Not y’all manifesting ghosts mid-feast 😂<br/>
- Maleficent will eat the intruder, stay calm<br/>
- I swear if Agatha appears I’m throwing my phone</p>
<p>The boys tried to laugh it off, illuminated by only the under lights from the kitchen cabinets, not noticing as Maleficent’s ears pricked up and she disappeared into the darkened sun room.</p>
<p>Aurora barked, wriggling around their ankles.</p>
<p>Billy whispered, “Okay…the lights have gone out and haven’t come back on.”</p>
<p>Then came a sound. Slow. Sinister. The faint scrape of something dragging across the floor in the hall.</p>
<p>The camera jostled as Tommy whipped around.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>- HELLO??? DRAGGING NOISE???<br/>
- Why is this scarier than horror movies<br/>
- WHAT WAS THAT SOUND<br/>
- 👻👻👻👻👻👻 RUNNNN</p>
<p>Out of the darkness, the faint outline of a figure appeared, low to the ground. Crawling backwards.</p>
<p>Rio.</p>
<p>Her hair fell over her face, her crawl slow and jerky, like every bad horror movie monster rolled into one.</p>
<p>Billy shrieked, scrambling onto the Island and pulling Eddie in front of him with Aurora clutched to his chest.</p>
<p>Tommy yelled as the figure continued to stalk jerkily towards them, “NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.”</p>
<p>- THEY’RE SCREAMING LIKE TODDLERS I’M DEAD<br/>
- Billy climbing the counter and using Eddie as bait 😂😂😂😂😂<br/>
- Maleficent said y’all on your own lmao wheres she gone<br/>
- Someone screen record this RIGHT NOW</p>
<p>Then came the footsteps. Deliberate. Heavy. From the other side of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Billy clutched Aurora like a teddy bear. “This is it. We’re dying on live.”</p>
<p>The footsteps drew closer, closer, until another shadow loomed in the sunroom doorway. And just when the boys thought it couldn’t get worse, Agatha struck.</p>
<p>She burst out at them with a cackle, arms flaring wide grabbing for the boys, her silhouette monstrous in the dim light of the cabinets.</p>
<p>“WHAT,” Agatha’s voice cut sharp, theatrical and low, “are you three doing?”</p>
<p>Both twins screamed so loudly the audio distorted, Eddie was wide eyed and valiantly trying to shield Billy.</p>
<p>Tommy dropped his phone; the camera caught nothing but a tilted view of the ceiling as chaos erupted, Aurora barking, Billy howling, Tommy tripping over himself as he scrabbled away.</p>
<p>The chat absolutely lost its mind.</p>
<p>- AGATHA CACKLING I’M SOBBING<br/>
- JUMPSCARE QUEEN 👸<br/>
- This is Oscar-worthy parenting<br/>
- Can we petition to get this uploaded as a horror short?</p>
<p>The lights snapped back on. Rio stood doubled over laughing, hair wild from her crawl. Agatha leaned against the doorframe, smug as a cat, her smirk pure wicked triumph. Maleficent the traitor was pressed to her side, head to hip, wagging and staring up at Agatha as if to say ‘it wasn’t me mom’.</p>
<p>Tommy had collapsed on the floor, wide-eyed, staring at them like betrayed prey.</p>
<p>“You” Billy panted, pointing accusingly. “You’re evil!”</p>
<p>“Pure evil,” Tommy agreed, voice cracking.</p>
<p>Agatha arched one brow. “And yet… it was very effective.”</p>
<p>- LMAOOOO ‘pure evil’ as if Agatha could ever 💀<br/>
- Rio on the floor had me wheezing<br/>
- Best parenting duo of the century<br/>
- THIS WAS SO CHAOTIC I LOVE YOU ALL</p>
<p>Rio reached down, picked up the phone, and leaned into the camera, grinning. “Lesson of the night, don’t raid the kitchen at midnight. Your parents or guardians will find out.”</p>
<p>Billy groaned, pressing to Eddies side. “Chat, avenge us.”</p>
<p>Tommy flopped back dramatically, hand over his chest. “We at least die as legends.”</p>
<p>Agatha plucked a marshmallow from the counter and popped it into her mouth. “Legends who are close to being grounded.”</p>
<p>- 💀💀💀💀💀<br/>
- THE WAY THEY SCREAMED<br/>
- AGATHA IS TERRIFYING OMG<br/>
- 10/10 parenting 🥰😂</p>
<p>Tommy pointed at the phone. “It was for the content.”</p>
<p>Billy added quickly, “And the dogs were hungry!”</p>
<p>Agatha arched one brow, witchy and regal. “The dogs,” she said slowly, “do not need midnight feasts.”</p>
<p>The chat was full of laughing emojis, begging for forgiveness on the boys’ behalf.</p>
<p>Rio leaned down, deadpan. “Say goodbye to your viewers.”</p>
<p>The live ended with the twins wailing in despair, Eddie sheepishly apologising, the dogs happily cleaning up the floor, and TikTok already immortalizing the ‘Midnight Feast Haunting’ as the greatest live stream of the month.</p>
