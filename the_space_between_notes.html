<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>World renowned pianist Agatha Harkness likes structure, precision, and a well-placed musical note.</p><p>Rockstar Rio Vidal leads one of the most popular rock bands today -- The Coven. Rio is chaos wrapped in leather, tattoos and guitar strings. Literally everything Agatha hates when it comes to music. After all, rock doesn't have the elegance and structure and beauty of classical music.</p><p>Their worlds collide when Rio’s teenage daughter starts taking piano lessons from Agatha, while Agatha’s starstruck 10-year-old son latches onto Rio like a groupie.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>So this was born out of an annoying writer's block for Luminous. I needed to get my writing juices flowing again and this story just happened. I don't know how long it's going to be. All I know is that I'm already in love with these characters who keep talking in my head, and I hope you guys like them.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen as Agatha Harkness stood by the counter, stirring a splash of cream into her cup with slow, methodical movements. The world was quiet in the mornings—before the phone started ringing, before her music school filled with students, before life demanded anything from her. Mornings were hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or at least, they used to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across the table, her 10-year-old son, Nicky, practically vibrated with excitement as he shoveled cereal into his mouth like he hadn’t eaten in days. His tablet sat propped up beside his bowl, replaying one of the most recent </span>
<em>
<span>The Coven</span>
</em>
<span> concerts, the sound low but unmistakable—the pulse of drums, the wail of a guitar, the unmistakable growl of her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you see that solo?” Nicky asked, barely pausing to breathe before launching into full-on hero-worship. “Did you see how Rio Vidal absolutely destroyed that riff? She’s so cool, Mom. Like, actually the coolest person on the planet. Maybe the universe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and turned a page of the Los Angeles Times. “Must we do this over breakfast?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky ignored her, too caught up in his own enthusiasm. “I mean, she’s a legend. Top five greatest living guitarists—maybe top three! And that song? </span>
<em>
<span>Ugh. Perfection</span>
</em>
<span>.” He made a dramatic hand gesture, nearly knocking over his orange juice in the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, steadying the glass before it spilled. “Language, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? I didn’t even say a bad word!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said ‘destroyed’ and ‘ugh’ with entirely too much feeling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because it </span>
<em>
<span>deserved</span>
</em>
<span> feeling,” Nicky insisted, exasperated. He turned the screen toward her, rewinding the video. “Just look at this—watch her hands, the way she moves—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed again, glancing up briefly. The camera panned in on Rio Vidal, all wild long dark hair and tattooed arms, her guitar slung low as she played like the instrument was a part of her body. The crowd roared, the stage lights bathed her in red, and she grinned, eyes half-lidded, like she knew she had them in the palm of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back to her paper. “Yes. Very impressive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t even watch!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I watched enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Truthfully, Agatha had heard of Rio Vidal. It was impossible not to when the woman’s face was plastered on billboards along Sunset Boulevard, her smirk promising a good time to anyone reckless enough to take the invitation. She was the kind of musician who burned fast and bright, the kind who made headlines as often as she made music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha had no patience for that kind of chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Nicky’s admiration was relentless. “If she ever—ever—walked into your school, I think I’d actually pass out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “Then I suppose it’s good we don’t take in rockstars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After dropping Nicky off at school—where he barely managed a rushed, “Bye, Mom!” before darting off to find Billy and Tommy—Agatha made her way to Sonata Grove.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nestled in a quiet Los Feliz neighborhood, Sonata Grove was both Agatha’s sanctuary and her life’s work. She had founded the school eight years ago, not just to teach music but to create a place where discipline and artistry could coexist. A place where structure could nurture talent instead of stifling it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Housed in a restored Spanish-style building, the school had an undeniable charm—arched doorways, warm wooden floors, and walls lined with framed concert programs and black-and-white photographs of classical greats. A baby grand piano sat in the main lobby, flanked by a few well-loved guitars, their polished surfaces reflecting the soft morning light. The sound of music filled the air at all hours—piano scales drifting from one room, a violin being tuned in another, and the occasional hesitant pluck of a guitar from a student still finding their footing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stepped inside, the familiar scent of aged sheet music and cedar wrapped around her. The building always smelled like this—a mix of history and possibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, boss,” came Wanda’s voice from down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha found her best friend standing at the front desk, glasses perched on the bridge of her nose, scanning the day’s schedule on her tablet. A cup of tea—Agatha’s, no doubt—sat beside her, already steeped to perfection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Agatha replied, setting down her bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Busy day,” Wanda said, barely glancing up. “And before you ask—yes, your tea is ready, because I am an angel sent from above.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled in relief, taking the cup. “Remind me why I keep you around?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My sparkling personality, cutting wit, and the fact that I single-handedly keep this place from descending into anarchy,” Wanda said, deadpan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Debatable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on, we both know you’d rather deal with an off-key oboe than handle scheduling conflicts and tuition disputes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, sipping her tea. It was perfect, as always—Earl Grey, just the right temperature, brewed exactly the way she liked. Wanda had long since memorized her preferences, which Agatha supposed was a mark of both their friendship and Wanda’s preternatural ability to keep Sonata Grove running like a well-oiled machine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The front door opened, letting in a warm breeze along with Lilia, who strode in with her usual dramatic flair, a script tucked under one arm and an oversized coffee in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, darlings,” Lilia greeted, tossing her sunglasses onto the desk. “Agatha, dear, I need you to settle a debate—” She paused, sniffing the air. “Ah, tea’s been handled. Wanda, you’re a goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Wanda smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “I haven’t even finished my first cup, and you’re already dragging me into one of your nonsense debates?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia placed a hand over her heart. “Nonsense? Nonsense? Agatha, please. This is a theatrical emergency.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s been arguing with her director about whether Lady Macbeth should or should not wear heels in Act Two,” Wanda supplied, not looking up from the tablet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “That’s the emergency?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia huffed. “Heels change posture, posture changes presence, presence changes performance, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “You’ll wear whatever your director tells you to wear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia gasped, deeply betrayed. “Et tu, Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Moving on,” Agatha said dryly, holding out a hand for the schedule. “What’s on the agenda today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda handed over a folder instead. “You’ve got a new student. Fifteen-year-old, piano. Her mom filled out the paperwork online last night. You’re meeting her at four.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the folder, skimming the application.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers stilled. The last name tugged at something in her mind—familiar, but not immediately concerning. Then her gaze flicked lower, to the emergency contact section.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Parent/Guardian: Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew that name. Everyone did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the folder with a crisp snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, who had been watching her, raised an eyebrow. “Something wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set the folder down. “Not at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she took another sip of tea, she suddenly wished it were something stronger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The name Rio Vidal echoed in Agatha’s mind long after she set the folder down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just that Rio was famous. That much, Agatha could handle. She had spent enough of her career rubbing shoulders with renowned musicians, attending events where legends floated through the room like ghosts, their names spoken in hushed, reverent tones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio Vidal wasn’t just famous. She was loudly famous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lead guitarist and vocalist of </span>
<em>
<span>The Coven</span>
</em>
<span>, one of the biggest rock bands of the last decade. Known for blistering solos, whiskey-soaked vocals, and an unpredictable energy that made her performances electric. The kind of musician who played by instinct rather than theory, who thrived on improvisation rather than careful composition.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The complete antithesis of everything Agatha valued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, her daughter was about to become Agatha’s student.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her lips together, forcing the thought aside. This wasn’t about Rio. This was about Amelia. Whatever reason Rio had for enrolling her daughter in Sonata Grove, it was none of Agatha’s business. If Amelia was serious about classical music, Agatha would teach her like she would any other student.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would be professional.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, some part of her—the same part that still remembered Nicky babbling excitedly about Rio Vidal’s guitar solo this morning—couldn’t quite shake the sense that this was going to complicate her life in ways she had no time or patience for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Earth to Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s voice yanked her back to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, realizing she had been staring at the same spot on the desk for longer than was reasonable. Wanda and Lilia were both watching her with varying degrees of amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never space out like that,” Wanda said, crossing her arms. “What gives?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha said smoothly, picking up her tea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia narrowed her eyes and picked up the folder, opening it immediately. “Oh no. That was definitely something. Who’s Amelia Vidal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A new student,” Agatha replied, a little too quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes flicked to the folder. “Vidal… As in Rio Vidal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, knowing resistance was futile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she admitted. “Apparently, I’m teaching her daughter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Lilia let out a delighted cackle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, this is rich,” she declared. “Agatha Harkness, teaching </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Rio Vidal’s kid. A rockstar’s offspring in your perfectly curated temple of classical precision. This is fate, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a flat look. “Fate has a terrible sense of humor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just saying,” Lilia went on, clearly enjoying herself, “it’s rather poetic, isn’t it? The queen of structure and discipline, forced to interact with the wild, untamed force of nature that is Rio Vidal.” She grinned. “You two are going to hate each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t intend to interact with her at all,” Agatha said. “I’m teaching Amelia. That’s it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hummed, an infuriatingly knowing expression crossing her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” she said. “You keep telling yourself that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I am not engaging in this nonsense. I have work to do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, of course,” Wanda said breezily, already heading toward her office. “Just don’t say I didn’t warn you when this blows up in your face.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It won’t,” Agatha called after her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she gathered her things for her first lesson of the day, she couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling settling in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The afternoon sun cast long shadows through the arched windows of Sonata Grove as Agatha prepared for her final lesson of the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She straightened the sheet music on the piano, took a slow sip of her now-lukewarm tea, and exhaled. It was ridiculous how much she was thinking about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s just another student.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts. Wanda’s head peeked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your four o’clock is here,” she announced, tone entirely too amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smoothed a hand over her skirt. “Send her in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda disappeared, and a moment later, the door swung open again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl was tall for her age, all long limbs and sharp angles, her dark curls half-heartedly pulled into a bun that was already coming undone. She wore a loose hoodie over ripped jeans, and her expression carried the distinct air of someone who would rather be anywhere else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely looked at Agatha as she stepped inside, shifting the strap of her bag higher on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ah, Agatha thought. A challenge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Amelia,” she greeted, offering a small nod. “I’m Agatha Harkness. Welcome to Sonata Grove.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl stiffened slightly at the sound of her own name. “Uh, yeah. Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead and take a seat,” Agatha instructed, gesturing toward the bench. “I’d like to start with a scale. Just to get a sense of where you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia hesitated, then moved to sit at the piano, her fingers hovering over the keys. There was tension in her shoulders, a sort of uncertainty that Agatha immediately clocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A long moment passed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Amelia played.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first few notes were tentative, careful. Then the next. And the next. A simple C major scale, played with textbook precision but none of the fluidity that came with confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms. “Again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia shot her a glance but complied. This time, it was slightly smoother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm,” Agatha murmured. “You’ve had training before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sort of,” Amelia muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sort of?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl’s fingers twitched. “I picked up a little on my own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Self-taught?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia nodded once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your technique is solid,” Agatha said, moving to stand beside the piano. “But you hesitate. That tells me you’re thinking too much about each note instead of feeling the movement between them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia’s jaw tightened. “I don’t hesitate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, just slightly. Teenagers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not,” she said lightly. “Let’s try again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out, gently adjusting the position of Amelia’s hand. The girl didn’t flinch, but there was a shift—subtle but telling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A discomfort with being corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A need to prove herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha recognized it well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again,” she instructed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, the scale was smoother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia exhaled sharply, but there was the barest flicker of satisfaction in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded. “Good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, Amelia met her gaze directly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha knew, in that moment, that this was going to be very interesting indeed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lesson continued in carefully measured steps. Agatha assessed Amelia’s posture, her finger placement, the way she carried tension in her shoulders. The girl took corrections with a quiet kind of resistance—she listened, but she didn’t like it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha had taught enough students to know when someone was genuinely invested, and despite Amelia’s apparent aloofness, the way her fingers moved across the keys spoke volumes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just didn’t want Agatha to know that she cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me,” Agatha said as she watched Amelia attempt a simple etude, “what made you interested in classical music?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A muscle in Amelia’s jaw ticked. She didn’t answer right away, and for a moment, Agatha assumed she wouldn’t answer at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like how structured it is,” Amelia muttered, not looking up. “It makes sense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “Unlike other kinds of music?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia’s fingers faltered for half a second before she recovered. “Rock is just noise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ah. There it is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed. “I imagine your mother might disagree.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words were barely out of her mouth before Amelia’s entire expression shuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we just focus on the lesson?” she said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted a brow but didn’t push.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Noted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They continued in near silence, the only sound between them the deliberate notes of the piano. Amelia was determined, Agatha would give her that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the end of the lesson, Amelia finally turned to face her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How bad was I?” she asked, bracing herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha regarded her for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re disciplined,” she said, “but you don’t trust yourself yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia frowned. “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It means you play like someone who’s afraid of getting it wrong,” Agatha said simply. “Technique can be taught, but confidence? That’s something you have to find for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia didn’t say anything for a long moment. Then, with a barely-there nod, she grabbed her bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you next week, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, she was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, turning back toward the piano. She let her fingers drift across the keys, playing a few soft notes as she considered the lesson.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then a voice from the door:</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that was tense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have to turn around to know who it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” she said dryly, still playing. “Do you always eavesdrop on my lessons?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only when they’re interesting,” Wanda said, stepping into the room with an all-too-knowing smirk. “And this one? </span>
<em>
<span>Very interesting</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “She’s just another student.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s smirk deepened. “Sure she is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised her hands in mock innocence. “Hey, I’m just saying—there’s a lot going on there. That girl’s got a chip on her shoulder the size of the Hollywood sign.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, well,” Agatha said, pressing a final chord before standing, “she’s not my problem outside these lessons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hummed. “Mmm. Unless her mother becomes your problem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned. “Oh, you don’t know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Know what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Rio Vidal just pulled up outside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went very, very still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda laughed. “Oh, this is going to be good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a slow, measured breath and followed her friend out to the main lobby.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t the type to be easily rattled. She had built an entire career on poise, precision, control. But there was something undeniably unsettling about the knowledge that Rio Vidal—rock legend, media darling, general force of chaos—was standing outside her music school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then the door swung open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal walked in like she owned the place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was dressed in ripped black jeans and a faded band tee (not even her own band, Agatha noted, but an old Fleetwood Mac tour shirt), a leather jacket slung over her shoulder. Dark hair framed sharp features, and her smirk was the kind worn by someone who had never been told no a day in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was aggravatingly attractive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened. </span>
<em>
<span>Not relevant.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze found her immediately, sharp brown eyes scanning her with obvious curiosity. Then she grinned, recognition flashing in her expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” she said, voice smooth and amused, “you’re the one giving my kid piano lessons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her stare evenly. “I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed. “Huh. Thought you’d be older.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “Thought you’d be taller.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the doorway, Wanda made a strangled choking sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked—then threw her head back and laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated how much she liked the sound of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Rio said, shaking her head. “I like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t recall asking,” Agatha replied smoothly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned like that only entertained her further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shoved her hands in her pockets, glancing around. “So, how’s she doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t need clarification. “Amelia has a natural ear for melody. Strong technique. But she’s holding herself back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. “How so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s precise, but hesitant. She plays like someone waiting for permission,” Agatha said simply. “She’s afraid of making mistakes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a short breath, nodding like that made perfect sense. “Yeah. That sounds about right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her. “She doesn’t want to be compared to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something flickered in Rio’s expression. For a moment, the playful ease dropped, and Agatha saw something much sharper underneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio muttered. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated before continuing. “I believe she enjoys classical music.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Rio snort. “Yeah, no shit. She listens to Chopin the way other kids listen to pop music. Don’t get me wrong, I love that she’s into music at all, but—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it’s not your music,” Agatha finished for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a wry look. “Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered her for a moment. Despite everything—her overwhelming presence, her effortless confidence—Rio Vidal was a mother first. And Agatha could see the complicated tangle of emotions in her expression: pride, confusion, maybe even a little hurt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t have to be you,” Agatha said carefully. “And I don’t think she wants to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a short, humorless chuckle. “Yeah. That’s the part I’m still wrapping my head around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair and checked the time on her phone. “Anyway. Thanks for being patient with her. She, uh… she quits things a lot. So, we’ll see how long this lasts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened. “If she stays, I’ll make sure she excels.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Yeah, I get that vibe from you, Miss Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to leave, then hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a split second, it looked like she wanted to say something else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she shook it off and shot her one last smirk. “See you around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, she was gone, apparently content to wait for her daughter on her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, only now realizing how tightly wound she’d been standing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, Wanda cackled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, scowling. “Not a word.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked. “Oh, darling. I wouldn’t dare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes. She had a feeling she was going to regret all of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had exactly three seconds of peace before he arrived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The front door swung open, and in barreled Nicky—freshly dropped off from baseball practice, still in his uniform, backpack slung haphazardly over one shoulder. He was mid-sentence about something, when he froze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could only watch in muted horror as his expression morphed from vague exhaustion to startled recognition, and then—</span>
<em>
<span>oh no</span>
</em>
<span>—outright elation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal was standing just a few feet away, casually leaning against the wall outside the bathroom, arms crossed, looking at her phone as she waited for Amelia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s baseball bag hit the floor with a dull thud. His mouth opened. No sound came out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could practically see the moment his brain caught up with reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like watching a car crash in slow motion, she knew what was about to happen, couldn’t stop it, and was entirely powerless to look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky inhaled sharply—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“OH MY GOD.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio startled slightly, glancing up. Then she blinked, eyes flicking to Agatha and back to the ten-year-old currently vibrating with barely restrained excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh my God</span>
</em>
<span>,” Nicky repeated, louder this time, practically bouncing on his toes. “</span>
<em>
<span>You’re Rio Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, grinning slightly. “That’s what they tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“MOM!” Nicky whipped around so fast he nearly tripped over his own feet, his expression caught somewhere between betrayal and ecstatic disbelief. “</span>
<em>
<span>You didn’t tell me you know Rio Vidal!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together, inhaling sharply through her nose. “I don’t know Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky turned back to Rio, eyes wide. “Do you know my mom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, clearly entertained, shrugged. “We just met.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky gasped as if this was the single most unfair thing in the entire world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“AND YOU DIDN’T TELL ME?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “Nicky—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have posters of you in my room!” he blurted, addressing Rio now, as if Agatha no longer existed. “And The Coven’s entire discography on vinyl! And mom got me a signed copy of Devil in the details for my birthday!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows shot up. “Damn. That’s commitment. Even I don’t have the vinyls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky let out a strangled sound, like he might actually combust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. This was exactly what she had been afraid of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could attempt damage control, the bathroom door swung open and Amelia stepped out, running a hand through her hair. She barely got two steps before stopping in confusion at the scene unfolding before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What,” she asked slowly, “is happening right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt an oncoming headache press at her temples.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” she said, voice deceptively calm, “this is Amelia Vidal. My student. And Rio is her mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky whipped back to Rio, stunned. “You have a daughter?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia crossed her arms. “Yeah. Hi. I’m right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, clearly having the time of her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s brain short-circuited. “</span>
<em>
<span>Mom</span>
</em>
<span>,” he hissed in a stage whisper, as if Rio couldn’t hear him, “</span>
<em>
<span>How did you not tell me this</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, exhausted beyond measure, exhaled slowly and decided she was going to fake her own death before the week was out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clapped a hand over her mouth to hide her laughter. “Damn,” she murmured, voice full of amusement. “You’re in trouble now, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, meanwhile, had turned his awe back on Rio. “Okay, but—you’re really here? Like, actually here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Last time I checked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky inhaled again, eyes shining with determination. “Can I play guitar with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia groaned audibly, rubbing her temples. “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh my God</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha silently wished for divine intervention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just grinned, looking entirely entertained.</span>
</p><p><br/>

<p>
<span>Rio Vidal had done a lot of nerve-wracking things in her life—played sold-out arenas, performed on live TV, even once climbed onto a rooftop mid-show just because Natasha dared her to—but none of that compared to the sheer, suffocating terror of driving her kid to her first piano lesson.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t supposed to be terrifying. It was just music. She knew music. But this wasn’t about her. This was about Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia, who had spent the past month dropping hints about maybe wanting to take piano seriously. Who had tentatively asked Rio if she thought it was stupid to want to study classical music instead of following in her mother’s rock-and-roll footsteps. Who, despite all her efforts to act like she didn’t care, was clearly nervous as hell about this lesson.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over at her daughter, who sat stiffly in the passenger seat, arms crossed like she was preparing for battle. The indie rock station played softly in the background—Mia’s choice, since she refused to let Rio play anything from The Coven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You good over there, honey?” Rio asked, tapping her fingers against the steering wheel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shrugged. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That was the most unconvincing ‘yeah’ I’ve ever heard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sighed, fiddling with the sleeves of her hoodie. “I just—what if she thinks I suck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That she being Agatha Harkness, the apparently brilliant, slightly terrifying classical pianist Mia had insisted on taking lessons from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Doubt it. But if she does, screw her. You’re the most badass kid I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia huffed a small laugh, shaking her head. “I want to be good at this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio softened. “Then you will be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached over and squeezed Mia’s knee. Her daughter didn’t pull away—Rio counted that as a win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, she pulled up in front of Sonata Grove, a name that sounded fancy as hell. She craned her neck, looking the place over. It was a beautiful house, Spanish architecture, and very fancy, just like the name. But it also exuded warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia exhaled sharply, gripping the door handle. “Okay. Here goes nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want me to come in with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave her a look. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Alright, alright. I’ll be back in an hour. Try not to become a world-famous pianist before I pick you up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes but smirked as she climbed out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her disappear inside, then let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in her life, she had no idea what came next.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio never really got to be alone. Not really.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even in the quietest moments—hotel rooms between tour stops, late nights writing lyrics while Mia slept upstairs—there was always something. A text, a call, the lingering pressure of a life that didn’t stop moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she treasured the rare moments like this, sitting in a tiny café a few blocks from Sonata Grove, where no one was looking at her, no one was asking for anything, and no one knew she was Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The baseball cap helped, pulled low over her long, straight hair. The sunglasses did the rest, covering most of her face. She stirred her espresso absently, half-listening to the soft hum of conversation around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a little hole-in-the-wall place, the kind of café that smelled like fresh pastries and burnt espresso, with a chalkboard menu that hadn’t been updated in years. A couple of college kids sat in the corner, hunched over laptops. A man near the window read a newspaper like it was still 1995. The barista, a guy in his twenties with a septum piercing and very strong opinions about oat milk, hadn’t even given her a second glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled out her phone, scrolling aimlessly. A few messages from Alice and Jen. Natasha had sent a voice memo that was probably just her screaming about something. Rio smirked but didn’t play it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, a text from Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Kiddo</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m about to go in. No idea what I’m doing. This was a mistake</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re fine. Don’t let your piano lady scare you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>No response. Which meant Mia was either too focused or too annoyed to text back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back in her chair, sipping her espresso. This was good. A normal, boring, quiet moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly, savoring it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had met a lot of impressive people in her life. Genius producers, guitar legends, icons who shaped the industry. People who could walk into a room and own it without saying a single word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. She was one of them. Like, big time. She’d looked her up before letting her kid enroll in her piano lessons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was annoying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio had walked into Sonata Grove expecting some stuffy, uptight, old, classical purist who’d look down her nose at a rockstar. Someone rigid, polished to the point of being unyielding. Instead, she got this—a woman who moved through the space like she belonged there, with a presence so sharp and self-possessed it was almost unfair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t just elegant; she was deliberate. The way she held herself, the way she spoke—low, even, no wasted syllables—made it clear she was someone who expected to be listened to. Not in an arrogant way, but in a way that said people always listened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then there was the music. She had seen videos the night before, thoroughly investigating her kid’s future teacher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had heard a lot of pianists in her time—some technically perfect, others expressive, a rare few who were both. But Agatha Harkness played like she breathed music. Every note was effortless, fluid, precise in a way that wasn’t calculated but innate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t showy. She wasn’t trying to impress anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the frustrating part.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio recognized greatness when she saw it, and Agatha had the kind that didn’t ask for your attention—it commanded it. The kind that made Rio’s fingers twitch like they needed a guitar in her hands just to do something with the energy buzzing under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t like the way Agatha’s presence threw her off balance. Didn’t like the way those sharp blue eyes met hers with a cool, assessing weight, like she was measuring her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had spent years being judged by people from the classical world. Professors, critics, musicians who thought rock was cheap, that it wasn’t real music. She’d fought tooth and nail for her place, for every bit of respect she’d earned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So if Agatha Harkness had any of that condescension in her—if she was about to look down on Rio like she was some undisciplined, talentless hack—well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was very good at being a pain in the ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe, just maybe, she’d enjoy being one a little too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had met fans of all ages in the past decade or so—kids, teens, grown-ass adults who cried when they met her. She was used to the wide-eyed stares, the excited stammering, the sheer shock that came with seeing someone in real life who had only ever existed on a screen or a stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But this kid?</span>
</p><p>
<span>This kid was next level.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He looked like he’d just discovered Santa Claus was real and currently standing in front of him. His hands curled into fists at his sides like he physically couldn’t handle his excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Holy crap,” he breathed, still staring. “You’re real. You’re actually real.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely had a second to react before he turned to Agatha again, bouncing on the balls of his feet like he might just vibrate into another dimension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom—Mom, you don’t understand. It’s </span>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she understood, alright.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was standing perfectly still, her expression carefully blank, but Rio didn’t miss the way her fingers twitched at her sides, like she was caught between physically dragging her kid away or throwing herself into traffic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And honestly? It was hilarious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio crossed her arms, fighting back a smirk as she turned to Nicky, who still looked like he might spontaneously combust at any second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” he said again, as if his brain was short-circuiting. “You don’t understand, I have all your albums. Like, </span>
<em>
<span>all of them</span>
</em>
<span>,” he repeated, like his mind still couldn’t compute that she was really there in the flesh, talking to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Rio grinned. “What’s your favorite?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Easy—Blood Moon Riot.” The answer came so fast, so sure, that Rio actually blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No hesitation,” she said, impressed. “I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s hands flapped wildly, like he didn’t know what to do with them. “It’s just—God—the guitar on that album?</span>
<em>
<span> It changed my life</span>
</em>
<span>. Your solo on Ritual Fire? I—I can’t even talk about it, I’ll start crying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio beamed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, meanwhile, looked like she was contemplating walking into the sea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which, honestly, made all of this so much better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, let me get this straight,” Rio said, shifting her weight to one side, gaze flicking between them. “You’re telling me Agatha Harkness’ kid is a massive fan of my band?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not just a fan—” Nicky cut in, voice desperate. “A huge fan. Loyal fan. Die-hard fan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low whistle, grinning. “Damn, Harkness, didn’t know you were raising a kid with taste.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s entire body went stiff. Her lips parted, blue eyes flashing with something sharp and dangerous, like she was moments away from committing a murder.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, this was fun.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glare could have set fire to a lesser woman. Unfortunately for her, Rio had spent years in a band with Natasha Romanov—she was immune to death glares.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, meanwhile, was still vibrating with excitement, shifting from foot to foot like he had too much energy in his body and nowhere to put it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait—wait, I need to process this.” He took a deep breath, as if steadying himself. “You—”, he pointed at Rio, “are standing in my mom’s music school, and you—”, now he swung toward Agatha, “know Rio Vidal personally. Personally! And you didn’t tell me?! Mom, I—” He cut himself off with a strangled noise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed two fingers to her temple, exhaling. “Nicky—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, no—you don’t understand—” Nicky spun back to Rio. “Do you know how many times I’ve asked her to take me to one of your concerts? And she just—” He made an exaggerated, disbelieving gesture at Agatha. “Nothing. Stonewall. </span>
<em>
<span>‘We’ll see. You’re not old enough.’ ‘Maybe next time</span>
</em>
<span>.’ Meanwhile, she just—casually meets you and doesn’t say a word?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Brutal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I know</span>
</em>
<span>!” Nicky looked genuinely betrayed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leaning against the wall as she watched them. This was hilarious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, relax, kid. I just got here today. Your mom and I aren’t exactly besties—”, she ignored Agatha’s sharp huff at that, ”—but I am gonna be around for a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s entire soul looked like it left his body. “Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave him a lazy grin. “You play anything, or you just a fan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guitar.” Nicky’s voice was dead serious. “I’ve been playing for three years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out an impressed hum. “Three years, huh? Electric or acoustic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both, but—” he gestured wildly ”—mostly electric. My mom made me learn classical guitar first, but—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As she should,” Rio said, nodding sagely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, but—” Nicky let out a frustrated groan. “I just—I just want to shred, you know? Like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barked out a laugh. “I respect that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, thank you.” Nicky threw his hands up dramatically, turning to Agatha. “See? </span>
<em>
<span>She gets it</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, who had been rubbing her temple like she was developing a massive headache, merely sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t suppose there’s a chance you’ll react like this to your math homework.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mom</span>
</em>
<span>.” Nicky glared. “Priorities.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed again, eyes crinkling with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she liked this kid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Nicky,” she said, smirking. “I guess I’ll be seeing you around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Nicky whispered, looking like he was about to collapse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes. “He’s never going to shut up about this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope,” Rio said, popping the p and enjoying every second of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they pulled into the driveway of their house—a sleek but lived-in modern home tucked in the Hollywood Hills—Rio had mostly shaken off the whirlwind that was Nicky Harkness. Mostly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she cut the engine, she glanced at Mia, who was scrolling through her phone with an expression that was just a little too neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said, tilting her head. “How was the lesson?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shrugged, way too casual. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Uh-huh. That’s it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated for a fraction of a second—just long enough for Rio to catch it—before saying, “I liked it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. She hadn’t expected that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another shrug, but this time, Rio could see it—the quiet thrill behind Mia’s usually guarded expression, the way her fingers twitched against her phone like she was holding back from saying more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “So, Agatha Harkness didn’t bore you to death, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That’s almost high praise, coming from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes but didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something warm settled in Rio’s chest. She knew how much her daughter hated being in the spotlight, how she resisted anything that might lump her in with her mother’s world. But right now, sitting in the car, Mia didn’t look like she was dreading this. She looked… interested. Maybe even excited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>? That was huge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio drummed her fingers against the steering wheel. “Guess that means you’ll be going back, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia glanced at her, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Yeah. I think I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>A week later, Rio found herself pulling up to Mia’s school—a way-too-fancy private institution that looked more like a museum than a place where teenagers were supposed to be learning about algebra and literature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely had time to shift the car into park before she spotted Mia making her way across the front steps, bag slung over her shoulder, head down. She stepped out of the car, ready to greet her kid. But before Mia could reach the car, Rio saw it happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two students in crisp uniforms—both girls, probably around Mia’s age—noticed her. Their eyes widened, and Rio could practically see the moment they decided to approach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, you’re Rio Vidal!” one of them squealed as they hurried up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio plastered on a polite smile. She could hear the click of a phone camera before either of them had even asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s me,” she said smoothly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Could you sign my notebook? My older sister is obsessed with The Coven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And maybe a quick photo?” the other girl added eagerly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t new. It was far from the worst fan interaction Rio had ever had. So she obliged, signing the notebook with a quick flourish before shifting to let them take the selfie they so desperately wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was over in less than a minute, the girls thanking her profusely before scurrying away, already posting about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and turned back to the car—only to find Mia standing a few feet away, watching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her expression was unreadable, but something in the set of her shoulders made Rio pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kiddo,” she greeted, trying to gauge her reaction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t answer right away. She just climbed into the passenger seat, pulled the door shut, and buckled in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned, getting into the car. “You good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded once, looking out the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to press—wanted to ask what that look had been about—but instead, she just pulled out onto the road, heading toward Sonata Grove.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive to the music school was mostly quiet. Mia scrolled through her phone, answering in monosyllables when Rio tried to make conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yup. Fine. No.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. She was upset about something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tapped her fingers against the wheel, glancing at Mia every few moments. She knew better than to push—Mia would talk when she was ready, not when Rio wanted her to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio let the silence settle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they reached Sonata Grove, Mia was already unbuckling her seatbelt before Rio had fully parked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure you’re good?” Rio tried again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine.” Mia reached for the door handle. “See you later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, she was out of the car, disappearing into the school without a backward glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Teenagers, man.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She climbed out of the car, locking it as she made her way inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The reception area was the same as last time—warm wood floors, soft lighting, the faint hum of piano drifting from somewhere down the hall. But this time, Nicky was already there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was sitting on one of the couches, guitar across his lap, fingers plucking out an admittedly pretty decent melody. As soon as he spotted Rio, his face lit up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” He shot to his feet, his baseball cap nearly falling off in the process. “You came back!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did.” She grinned. “You live here or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” he scoffed, then paused. “Well. Kinda. My mom owns the place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced up and spotted Agatha by the reception desk, sipping from a sleek black coffee cup. She was talking to a redheaded woman with sharp cheekbones and a violin case slung over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if sensing Rio’s gaze, Agatha turned her head, meeting her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her expression flickered to something she couldn’t quite discern yet—just for a second—before she composed herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took one last sip of her coffee before excusing herself from the redhead’s conversation. As she walked over, her heels clicked softly against the wooden floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. Vidal,” she greeted, her tone polite but distant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. Harkness,” Rio returned with a smirk, leaning against the reception desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eye twitched—just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia is already in the classroom,” Agatha informed her, as if that was the only thing worth saying. “We’re starting with technique today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exciting,” Rio said, tilting her head. “Does she seem… into it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, considering her answer before nodding. “She’s focused. She wants to improve.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t usually get excited about new people,” Rio admitted, glancing toward the hallway where Mia had disappeared. “So, thanks. For whatever you’re doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not magic, Ms. Vidal,” Agatha said dryly. “It’s discipline and proper instruction.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, yeah, totally,” Rio said, nodding in mock seriousness. “Sounds way less intimidating when you say it like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, clearly deciding she had better things to do than entertain Rio’s antics. She turned toward Nicky instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” she said patiently. “Did you finish your homework?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Nicky answered immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of it,” he corrected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, then turned back to Rio. “Try not to be a distraction.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises,” Rio said easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a look, then turned on her heel and disappeared down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she was gone, Nicky turned back to Rio with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dude,” he whispered. “You just messed with my mom and survived.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “She’s not that scary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what they all say before she assigns them extra scales.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, ruffling his hair. “Good thing I’m not one of her students then, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed up at her, clearly delighted by this new alliance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” he said, shifting his guitar in his lap. “Are we playing today or what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the reception desk, arms crossed, smirking down at the kid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t waste any time, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time is precious,” Nicky said, way too seriously for a ten-year-old.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barked out a laugh. “You sound like my manager.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does your manager also want to jam with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not even a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took in his eager expression, the way he was practically vibrating with anticipation. It reminded her of herself when she was a kid, back when music felt like the only thing in the world that mattered. She glanced down at his guitar—clearly well-loved, a little too big for him but carried with confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, kid. Show me what you got.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes lit up like she’d just told him he’d won a lifetime supply of candy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really,” Rio said, pushing off the desk. “But let’s take it outside. Your mom already thinks I’m a distraction. If we start playing in here, she might actually murder me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky snorted. “Fair point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They made their way out to the small courtyard behind the building, where a couple of benches sat under a large oak tree. Rio sat down, stretching her legs out in front of her while Nicky practically bounced into place beside her, already adjusting the strap of his guitar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Rio said, nodding toward him. “Hit me with something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky took a deep breath, then started strumming—an enthusiastic but slightly choppy version of one of The Coven’s earliest songs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, a little caught off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait—hold up,” she said, holding up a hand to stop him. “Is that Wicked Games?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned. “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the hell do you know that song?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have ears, don’t I?” he said cheekily. “Also, YouTube exists.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whistled lowly. “Man, I don’t know if I should be flattered or worried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should definitely be flattered,” Nicky said, then immediately went back to playing, his fingers more confident this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched him for a few seconds, then nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright,” she said, grabbing the guitar out of his hands before he could protest. “Lemme show you something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She adjusted the tuning slightly, then started playing the same riff—only smoother, the way it was meant to sound, fingers gliding effortlessly over the strings. Nicky’s jaw dropped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa,” he breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Yeah, that’s the sound we’re going for. You’re almost there, kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was staring at her like she had just parted the Red Sea. “Can you teach me how to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked. “Oh, I don’t know. Didn’t your mom say I was a bad influence?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She says that about Billy and Tommy too, and I still hang out with them,” Nicky said, completely unfazed. “So, what do you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, kid. Let’s jam.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the next twenty minutes, Rio worked through the song with Nicky, slowing down the riff, showing him where to place his fingers for a cleaner transition. He was quick—eager and determined in a way she recognized all too well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re picking this up fast,” she admitted, watching as he repeated the phrase back, his movements already a little smoother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been practicing,” Nicky said, his face scrunched in concentration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It shows,” Rio said, tapping her fingers on the bench. Then she picked up the extra guitar Nicky had gotten for them. “Alright, let’s try it together. I’ll take lead, you follow. And don’t worry if you mess up—just jump back in when you can.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded so hard his cap nearly fell off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They started playing—Rio keeping the rhythm steady, letting Nicky find his way through. The first few tries were a little rough, but by the fourth run-through, he was holding his own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hell yeah, kid!” Rio whooped when they hit the last note. “That was solid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed. “You think so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dude, that was your first time playing it with me. Imagine what you’ll sound like after a few more sessions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, you’ll play with me again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, smirking. “I feel like I just got hustled.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky just grinned, completely unapologetic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could say anything else, the sound of the door opening caught her attention. She turned to see Agatha stepping out into the courtyard, arms crossed, one perfectly arched brow raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been in my building for an hour, and you’re already luring my son to the dark side?” Agatha drawled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “What can I say? The force is strong with this one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed, but at the look Agatha shot him, he had the sense to at least try and look guilty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, go grab your things. We’re heading home soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Mom—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No buts,” Agatha said, though her voice was more exasperated than stern. “Go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sighed dramatically but obeyed, heading inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the bench, stretching her arms out. “You know, you should be thanking me. Kid’s got talent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know he has talent,” Agatha said. “That doesn’t mean I want you filling his head with ideas of running off to become a rockstar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Relax, Harkness. I’m not trying to recruit him into The Coven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. Because my son is not going on tour with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn,” Rio said. “And here I was, ready to offer him a spot as our new lead guitarist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was something almost amused in the way she looked at her. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could push her luck, the door opened again, and Mia stepped out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m ready,” Mia said, her voice carefully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took one look at her and knew something was off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything okay, kid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated for half a second—so quick that most people wouldn’t have noticed. But Rio did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Just tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t believe that for a second, but she let it slide. For now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said, pushing off the bench. “Let’s head home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded and started toward the parking lot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to Agatha, giving her a two-fingered salute. “Until next time, </span>
<em>
<span>maestra</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed but didn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned as she followed Mia to the car, already looking forward to the next time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive home was quiet. Too quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept glancing at Mia, who sat with her arms crossed, staring out the window. No music, no humming, not even the occasional complaint about traffic. Just quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, kid,” Rio finally said, tapping her fingers against the wheel. “You gonna tell me what’s eating you, or do I have to guess?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia exhaled sharply, fingers tightening in the sleeves of her hoodie. “Some girls at school were talking about you today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “That’s nothing new. What’d they say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated, then muttered, “They were showing off pictures they took with you somewhere. Saying how cool you are. How lucky I am to have </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Rio Vidal as my mom.” Her voice was flat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “Okay… and that’s bad because?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia turned her head, shooting her a sharp look. “Because they don’t actually care about me. They just want to know if I can get them backstage, if I can get them to meet you. If I can get them closer to you.” She let out a humorless laugh. “One of them even asked if you were single.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grimaced. “Wow. That’s weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. No kidding. Then I get outside, and other kids are already stalking you,” Mia slumped deeper into her seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw. She hated this. Mia had been dealing with it since she was a kid—people who pretended to be her friend just to get to Rio. It wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That why you barely said a word when you got in the car?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded. “Figured it’d be easier than pretending I was fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sucked her teeth, trying to figure out what to say. She wasn’t great at this part—at fixing things with words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I know this sucks,” she said finally. “I know you want people to see you and not just some extension of me. And I wish I could change that for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia was quiet for a long moment. Then, finally—“You can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car fell into silence again, but this time, it wasn’t so heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what it’s worth,” Rio said, giving Mia a sideways glance, “Agatha seems to get you. Which is kinda impressive considering she’s only known you for two seconds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia made a small noise, like she wasn’t sure how to respond to that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “And hey, if all else fails, you can always start wearing a fake mustache to school. That way no one will know you’re my kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia let out a reluctant snort. “You’re ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, but I’m </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> ridiculous mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes, but Rio could see the tension in her shoulders loosening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the win as she pulled into their driveway. “C’mon. Let’s go inside before you decide to move out and start a new life in the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shut off the engine but didn’t move to get out. Instead, she turned to Mia, draping an arm over the steering wheel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, tell me something good—how was your lesson?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia had been halfway to unbuckling her seatbelt, but she froze for a second, like she hadn’t expected the question. Then—just like that—something in her shifted. The sulking, the frustration, the weight of the school day—it all faded into something lighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was… good,” she said, and for once, she didn’t sound like she was just saying it to appease Rio. She sounded genuine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow. “Just good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia bit her lip, and Rio swore she saw the start of a smile. “Fine. It was </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh. And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia huffed, but now she was definitely smiling. “And she’s really— I mean, she’s intense, but in a good way? Like, she actually listens. And she didn’t just throw a bunch of scales at me and call it a day. We talked about composers, and how music is supposed to say something, and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cut herself off, as if she realized she was getting too excited. But Rio wasn’t about to let her backtrack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, don’t stop now. I was enjoying that,” Rio teased, grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes, but the warmth in her face didn’t fade. “She said I have a good ear for phrasing. And that my technique is strong.” A pause. Then, softer, almost hesitant— “I think she actually respects me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in Rio’s chest twisted. She reached over, ruffling Mia’s hair just to see her swat her hand away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course she respects you. You’re amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shook her head, but she wasn’t arguing. Not really.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Careful, kid. If you start liking classical music too much, you might end up one of those super serious concert pianists. Imagine the horror.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shot her a look but still couldn’t hide the happiness on her face. “Let’s just go inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, stepping out of the car. As they headed for the door, she glanced at Mia again—shoulders relaxed, a spark of something real in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. That was way better.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>

<p>
<span>Agatha had seen many things in her life. The rise and fall of entire symphonies. The chaotic brilliance of a concert hall before the first note was struck. The way a student’s face lit up when they finally mastered a piece that had once seemed impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But nothing—nothing—could have prepared her for the sheer, unshakable admiration her son had developed for Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been four weeks since Amelia Vidal started as her student, and Agatha had to admit, the girl was exceptional. Focused. Disciplined. Talented in a way that went beyond natural skill—Amelia worked for it, studied each note with the kind of precision Agatha rarely saw in someone so young. But while Amelia’s progress at the piano had been impressive, it was nothing compared to the other thing that had completely spiraled out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s enthusiasm for Rio had started as a spark. A simple, casual admiration for a musician he already adored. But then Rio—legendary rockstar, famed guitarist, walking chaos incarnate—had made the mistake of jamming with him once. Just once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had happened in the small courtyard behind Sonata Grove, beneath the shade of a sprawling tree, where Rio had pulled out a guitar and played alongside him like it was the most natural thing in the world. That moment had changed everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, every Wednesday, Rio brought her own guitar, and Nicky all but counted down the hours until she showed up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So today, when Mia arrived alone, Agatha felt Nicky’s disappointment before he even spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Rio?” Nicky asked, adjusting his backpack strap, his voice carefully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sighed, shifting her bag higher on her shoulder. “She’s in the studio today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky didn’t groan or complain, but Agatha noticed the slight slump in his posture, the way his fingers twitched at his sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” he said, trying for casual and missing the mark entirely. “Cool. That’s—cool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot him a look, but he ignored it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She told me to tell you she’ll see you next week,” Mia added, clearly picking up on his disappointment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded, recovering quickly. “Yeah. Yeah, of course. It’s not like I was waiting or anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost rolled her eyes. If Rio Vidal had any idea how much power she held over her son’s emotions, she would never let him live it down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat at the piano bench, watching as Amelia settled beside her. The girl was quieter than usual, her fingers flexing like she was working out some unseen tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we begin?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded but didn’t immediately place her hands on the keys. Instead, she exhaled sharply. “Can I ask you something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated, then muttered, “Did you always want to be a musician?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That wasn’t what Agatha had expected, but she answered without missing a beat. “Yes. There was never a time I didn’t want this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, filing that away. Then, in a quieter voice, “Must be nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her, noting the slight bitterness in her tone. “You don’t want to be a musician?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia huffed. “I do. Just… not the way everyone assumes I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She flexed her fingers again, as if music might settle the restlessness inside her. “Everyone just expects me to pick up a guitar and start a band. Like I’m some kind of mini-Rio, just waiting to take the stage.” She let out a humorless laugh. “Doesn’t matter how many times I say I want to compose. That I want to play in an orchestra, maybe even conduct one someday. No one hears me. They just hear what they think I should want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And at school?” Agatha prompted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia scoffed. “They don’t even see me. They see Rio Vidal’s daughter. Like I’m a walking backstage pass.” She flexed her jaw. “Some of them act like I’m some kind of celebrity. Others think I must be full of myself because of who my mom is. Either way, they don’t care about me—just what my last name can do for them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was quiet for a moment. Then, “That sounds infuriating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia blinked at her, like she hadn’t expected such a simple acknowledgment. “It is,” she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does your mother know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia let out a breath. “She knows… some of it. She’s seen the way people treat me. She hates it.” A pause. “But she doesn’t know how to fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That, Agatha thought, made sense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia continued, “She always tells me to own it. To not let them get to me. But that’s easy for her. She’s—she’s Rio Vidal. No one’s ever ignored her in their life. No one ever would.” Her fingers tightened on her lap. “And when she does try to help, it just makes it worse. If she posts about me or shows up to something, suddenly everyone remembers I exist again—but not as me. Just as an extension of her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered that. Considered the way parents, even the most well-meaning ones, could fail to see the full picture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what it’s worth,” Agatha said eventually, “I see you, Mia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s breath hitched almost imperceptibly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she straightened her shoulders, placed her hands on the keys, and said, “Can we start now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha only nodded, her chest unexpectedly tight as she turned her attention back to the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Friday night dinners at Agatha’s house had been a tradition for years, an anchor in the chaos of life. No matter what was happening, Wanda, Viz, Lilia, and the kids always found their way to her dining table by the end of the week. It was loud, messy, and often involved at least one near food fight between the boys, but Agatha wouldn’t trade it for anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set down a dish of roasted vegetables in the center of the table just as Wanda poured them both a glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Wanda said, settling into her chair. “Weekly recap—who has grievances to air?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy immediately raised his hand. “Tommy stole my game controller and then lied about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t lie,” Tommy said. “I borrowed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Without asking!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s still borrowing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s stealing—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Viz cut in, rubbing his temples. “New rule: no litigating sibling disputes at the dinner table.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smirked. “Where’s the fun in that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fun for you because you get to watch the chaos,” Wanda said, nudging Agatha’s arm. “Speaking of chaos—how’s your celebrity student doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, already regretting telling Wanda anything. “Amelia is doing well. Very focused, very talented.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And her mother?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a look. “Not my student.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, but she is at your school constantly now, isn’t she?” Wanda teased, taking a sip of her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “She’s just there to bring Amelia. And to play guitar under a tree with my son, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, so she’s spending time with Nicky? You must love that,” Lilia said, smirking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “He already idolized her. Now it’s somehow gotten worse.” She glanced at Nicky, who was pushing food around his plate. “Especially since she didn’t show up this week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t?” Wanda raised a brow. “And that ruined his whole day, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Basically,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Wanda said, turning to Nicky. “I know it sucks, bud, but rockstars have unpredictable schedules. Maybe she had something come up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sighed. “I know, I just… I thought maybe she’d actually want to jam again. It’s been fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe she does want to,” Viz offered. “You never know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy, grinning, leaned in. “You do know you’re living every fan’s dream, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’d be my dream if she actually showed up,” Nicky muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Welcome to the world of musicians, kid. We’re an unreliable bunch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not,” Nicky pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, but I’m the exception to the rule,” Agatha said, sipping her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The following week, Rio showed up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew the moment she walked through the doors of Sonata Grove—not because she saw her first, but because of Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He had been sitting at the front desk, doodling absently in his notebook while Wanda balanced the books. The second the glass doors swung open, Nicky’s entire body went rigid, his pencil freezing mid-stroke. Then, as if propelled by some unseen force, he launched himself to his feet, nearly knocking his chair over in the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You came!” he practically shouted, eyes wide with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could remind him of the importance of personal space, he launched himself at Rio in a full-bodied hug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know who was more startled—her or Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a brief second, Rio tensed, clearly caught off guard. But then, something in her face softened. The smirk that usually curled at her lips faded into something more open, more unguarded. She let out a small breath and ruffled Nicky’s hair, her touch light, almost hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”‘Course I came,” she said, as if it were obvious. “I said I would, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed up at her, practically vibrating with excitement. “I saved our spot! C’mon, let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright, give me a second, kid,” Rio said with a small chuckle, gently prying him off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, arms crossed, watched the exchange with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. “If you corrupt my child any further, I’ll have to take legal action.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Define corrupt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Encouraging him to have a rockstar’s sense of responsibility, for starters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I showed up today, didn’t I?” Rio shot back, tipping an imaginary hat. “That’s gotta count for something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Barely,” Agatha deadpanned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you guys gonna argue, or can we go play?” Nicky interrupted impatiently, shifting from foot to foot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“By all means,” Agatha gestured toward the courtyard. “Take your bad influence outside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aye, aye, ma’am.” Rio threw her a lazy two-finger salute before following Nicky out the back doors, her guitar case slung over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. A bad influence indeed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze flicked toward Amelia, who had been standing quietly to the side, watching the exchange. Agatha caught the slight crease between her brows, the way her arms stayed crossed over her chest—not defensive, exactly, but… careful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Amelia,” Agatha said, shifting gears. “Let’s get started.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia’s lips pressed together briefly, but she followed without protest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lesson went well. Exceptionally well, in fact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia was progressing at an impressive rate, and Agatha made sure to tell her so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your technique is improving,” she noted as she watched Amelia’s fingers glide over the keys, coaxing out a melody with steady confidence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia, as always, just shrugged like it was no big deal. But Agatha caught the tiny flicker of satisfaction in her eyes, the way her shoulders straightened ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you been practicing extra?” Agatha asked, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated for a fraction of a second before shrugging again. “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was as close to an admission as Agatha was going to get, and she smiled to herself as she turned the page of the sheet music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the lesson, as they walked back to the reception area, Agatha spotted a teenage boy waiting by the front desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was tall and lanky, with dark hair that flopped over his forehead and a hoodie that looked two sizes too big for him. He was leaning against the counter, spinning a pen between his fingers, his expression a mix of boredom and barely contained energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Amelia walked in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” he said immediately, stuffing his hands into his hoodie pockets, his entire face brightening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amelia, who had spent the past hour schooling her expressions into their usual careful neutrality, cracked an actual smile. “Hey, Will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ah.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha recognized that look—the kind of easy familiarity that only came with time, the way Amelia’s  usually guarded posture eased just slightly. It was trust, comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“William Kaplan,” Wanda supplied helpfully from behind the desk, clearly picking up on Agatha’s curiosity. “Her best friend apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in understanding, watching as Amelia and William fell into an easy back-and-forth, their conversation already in full swing as if they hadn’t missed a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Deciding to give her space, Agatha turned on her heel and went in search of her own son—who, if she knew him at all, was still outside under that tree, completely enraptured by the woman ruining his good sense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped out into the courtyard, already knowing what she would find.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And sure enough, there they were—Rio sitting cross-legged on the ground, guitar in her lap, Nicky beside her, practically vibrating with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, little man,” Rio was saying, tuning one of the strings with a practiced flick of her fingers. “Let’s try that again. What’s the first chord?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“G major!” Nicky said immediately, sitting up straighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Look at you, already a rockstar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms, leaning against the doorframe as she watched the scene unfold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d spent the past few weeks watching Rio become something of a fixture in her son’s life, and as much as she wanted to pretend it didn’t bother her, it did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not because Rio was a bad influence—despite what Agatha might have joked about—but because of the way Nicky lit up around her. The way he looked at her like she hung the stars in the sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had spent the past decade being her son’s entire world, and now here was this woman—this loud, brilliant, reckless woman—who had waltzed into their lives with her damn guitar and stolen that place in a matter of weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was infuriating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see you’re still corrupting my child,” she said dryly, finally making her presence known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced up at her, looking entirely unrepentant. “And look at him, thriving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky turned to Agatha, eyes pleading. “Mom, can I show you what I learned?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, pushing off the doorframe. “Go ahead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He scrambled to his feet, snatching his own guitar from where it rested against the bench. Rio nodded at him encouragingly, giving him a four-count before they both started playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And to Agatha’s surprise—he had actually improved. A lot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was still a little clumsy, his fingers sometimes hesitating before shifting to the next chord, but the progression was there. The foundation. And more importantly, the joy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Nicky was beaming, practically glowing as he played alongside Rio, who was nodding in encouragement, playing along with him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Damn her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, running a hand down her face. “I suppose it is good practice,” she admitted begrudgingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Don’t worry, Harkness. I’ll have him headlining stadiums in no time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God help me,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clapped her hands together. “Alright, bud, time to wrap it up. Go get your things so we can head home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky let out a dramatic groan but didn’t argue, setting his guitar down carefully before running off inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which left Agatha alone with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence between them wasn’t exactly uncomfortable, but it wasn’t easy either. Agatha wasn’t sure if that was because of Rio’s general existence or because of how aware she’d become of her own reactions to her lately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way Rio carried herself—so at ease, so self-assured—was infuriating. And distracting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, deciding to focus on the only thing she could control. “I hope you realize you’ve created a monster,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, smirking. “Yeah? He’s got talent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now he won’t shut up about you,” Agatha muttered, crossing her arms. “Do you have any idea how exhausting it is to listen to a ten-year-old wax poetic about your guitar solos?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, leaning back on her hands. “You sound jealous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “I am not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, Harkness.” Rio grinned, looking infuriatingly pleased with herself. “I’m flattered. The kid’s cool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Yes, well, I would appreciate it if you didn’t fill his head with the idea that he’s going to be some rockstar prodigy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because he’s ten,” Agatha said. “Because he gets obsessed with things and then forgets about them in a month. Because I know how this industry works, and it’s brutal. He’s not ready for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was watching her now, the teasing glint in her eyes softening into something more thoughtful. “You don’t have to be so scared for him, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “I’m not scared—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you are,” Rio said simply, still watching her with that quiet, almost infuriating understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, but nothing came out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because, goddamn it, she </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>scared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had spent years making sure Nicky had stability, had safety. Had her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now here was this woman—this rockstar—walking into their lives, capturing Nicky’s attention, showing him a world Agatha had spent years trying to keep at bay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must have seen something shift in her face, because her voice softened. “I get it, you know. Wanting to protect them. Wanting to keep them from making mistakes, or getting their hopes up about something they might not even want in a year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, her gaze drifting toward the entrance of the school. “Mia’s a great musician. If she wanted, she could take over the world. But she doesn’t want what I want. She doesn’t want this life. And as much as I wish she did sometimes, that’s not my call to make.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t expected this. Hadn’t expected this Rio—the one who wasn’t just a freewheeling rockstar but a mother who understood exactly what Agatha was feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s lucky you get that,” Agatha found herself saying, quieter than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a dry laugh. “Maybe. Doesn’t make it easier, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That—that—Agatha understood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly, glancing toward the school. “Just… don’t make promises you can’t keep,” she muttered, before turning toward the building to find Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And behind her, Rio let out a quiet, knowing hum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Noted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the week passed in a blur, and before Agatha knew it, she was right back at Sonata Grove, watching Nicky vibrate with anticipation, waiting for Rio to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she’d admit it out loud, but Agatha had found herself thinking about their conversation more than she cared to. About the way Rio had spoken about Amelia, about the quiet resignation in her voice when she said it doesn’t make it easier, though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was one thing to acknowledge that she and Rio had some things in common—they were both musicians, both mothers, both deeply protective of their children. It was another thing entirely to admit that Rio Vidal, rockstar, actually understood her in ways not many people did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made her uneasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s here!” Nicky all but shouted, snapping her out of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temple as she watched Rio stroll through the entrance, guitar case slung over her shoulder, sunglasses perched on her head. “I don’t suppose I can convince you to keep your enthusiasm at a reasonable level?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, predictably, ignored her. “Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, greeting Nicky with a casual fist bump before glancing at Agatha. “Good afternoon, Harkness. Looking serious as ever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of us have responsibilities,” Agatha shot back, arching an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Right, and some of us just show up to corrupt children with music. Speaking of which—” She tapped her guitar case. “Ready, kid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky practically lit up, looking at Agatha like he was about to start begging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply. “Fine. Go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Nicky fist-pumped, already leading Rio toward their usual jam spot in the small courtyard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched them go, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re doomed,” a voice said beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to see Wanda leaning against the reception desk, watching the scene unfold with an amused expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not helping,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not trying to help,” Wanda said cheerfully. “I’m trying to enjoy this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look, but before she could retort, the door opened again and Amelia walked in, her bag slung over one shoulder, her usual quiet but purposeful demeanor in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon, Amelia,” Agatha said automatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated for a split second before sighing. “It’s Mia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shifted her weight. “I prefer Mia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say anything for a moment, then nodded once. “Alright, then. Mia. Shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, falling into step beside her as they walked toward the practice room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t miss the way Wanda was grinning at her from the reception desk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chose to ignore it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the drive home, the car was filled with the sound of Nicky tapping out a beat against his knees, humming an off-key version of whatever song Rio had taught him that afternoon. Agatha glanced at him from the corner of her eye, taking in the way he was practically glowing with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I take it your jam session was a success?” she asked dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, it was so cool,” Nicky gushed, turning to face her as if she wasn’t, in fact, trying to navigate Los Angeles traffic. “Rio taught me this really sick riff—like, I’m still kinda slow at it, but she said I’m picking it up fast. And then she let me try her guitar, and it was amazing. It felt so different from mine, and she said that’s because of the action and the strings, and she told me all about how she customizes hers to fit her playing style—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in response, letting him ramble as she focused on the road.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”—and then she told me about this time when her band played this tiny venue, and the power went out, but they kept going with just an acoustic set, and the crowd loved it. And then she said she might teach me one of The Coven’s songs—like, a real one, not just some random riff—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That got Agatha’s attention. “I see,” she said, voice carefully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky caught the shift in her tone and rolled his eyes. “Relax, Mom. It’s not like she’s trying to get me to drop out of school and go on tour with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Nicky groaned, slumping dramatically against his seat. “You’re so dramatic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Pot, meet kettle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky huffed but didn’t argue. He went back to tapping his fingers against his knees, a little more thoughtful this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” he said after a moment, “she’s actually a really good teacher. Like, I didn’t think she’d be, since she’s, y’know… </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. But she explains things in a way that just makes sense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tightened her grip on the wheel slightly. She hadn’t expected Rio to be bad with Nicky—heaven knew the woman had a natural ease with people—but hearing him actually praise her teaching skills was…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure how she felt about that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you’re learning something,” she said, keeping her voice even.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned. “I really am. She’s awesome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled slowly. This was getting out of hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>A week later, Agatha paused just outside the door to the courtyard, fingers tightening around her barely touched coffee. Through the cracked door, she caught the tail end of Nicky’s excited chatter, his voice practically buzzing with energy—the way it always did when he was talking to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And it’s gonna be so cool, Rio. We always do it at the school, and we decorate everything all spooky, and Aunt Wanda goes all out with the fog machine—it’s awesome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, hold on,” Rio interrupted, amusement laced in her voice. “You’re saying your mom’s birthday is actually on Halloween?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup!” Nicky chirped. “She hates when people make a big deal out of it, but, like… c’mon. It’s Halloween. That’s, like, the coolest birthday ever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I can see that,” Rio mused. “I mean, I don’t know her that well, but she does give off serious Halloween energy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swore she could hear the smirk in Rio’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right? That’s what I keep telling her!” Nicky said. “Anyway, it’s gonna be amazing. You should totally come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach did something strange and undignified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I dunno, kid,” Rio replied easily. “Sounds like a student thing. Your mom probably doesn’t want some random rock star crashing the party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not random,” Nicky said, as if the very idea offended him. “You’re, like, part of the school now. And besides, Billy and Tommy aren’t students, but they always come too. And Mia’s coming this year. So, like. You should come too. Obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shut her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia’s going?” Rio asked, her voice shifting just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky said. “She said she’d come to the school party. And she’s really good at piano too. Mom’s super impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low chuckle. “That so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup, I’ve heard talking about it with Aunt Wanda,” Nicky confirmed. “Anyway. You should totally come. Mom won’t say it, but I know she’d be happy if you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes snapped open.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That little traitor.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She was not happy about this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she needed to put an end to this conversation before Rio Vidal got any ideas.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a steadying breath, she schooled her face into careful neutrality and stepped into the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” she said, voice cool. “I wasn’t aware we were sending out additional invitations to my birthday party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky turned, entirely unbothered. “I mean. It’s just Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow, cutting a glance at Rio, who was lounging against the wall with her guitar, amusement flickering behind those dark sunglasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha said flatly. “Just Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Hey, don’t look at me. This is all your kid’s doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I can see that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky just grinned up at her. “You always say Halloween’s about surprises, Mom. This is a good one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leveled him with a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky just smiled wider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose it’s too late to take you back to the hospital and demand a refund?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Way too late, mom,” Nicky said cheerfully. “So Rio can come, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just sighed in resignation.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio hadn’t felt nervous about a party since she was a teenager sneaking into underground shows with a fake ID and too much eyeliner.</p><p>But as she adjusted the wide-brimmed hat atop her head, smoothing the fabric of the deep red coat she’d thrown over her matching corset, she had to admit—she felt the tiniest bit unsettled.</p><p>Which was absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>It was just a school party.</p><p>A school party full of children and teenagers and parents.</p><p>And <em> Agatha Harkness. </em></p><p>Yeah. That was probably the part that was throwing her off.</p><p>“Okay, you’re, like, <em> way </em> too committed to the part, Ms. V,” Will said from the backseat as they pulled into the parking lot of Sonata Grove. “Did you actually buy that, or did you just have a full-on sexy witch costume lying around?”</p><p>Mia groaned. “Will, <em> why </em> ? That’s my <em> mom</em>.”</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Will went on, undeterred. “That’s not a last-minute costume. That’s a <em> statement.</em>”</p><p>Rio smirked, adjusting her hat as she cut the engine. “Maybe I just like to make an entrance.”</p><p>“Oh my God,” Mia muttered, shoving open the passenger door before Will could add more fuel to the fire.</p><p>Rio chuckled, stepping out after them. Sonata Grove was already fully decked out for the occasion—cobwebs draped over the front entrance, jack-o’-lanterns lining the walkway, a flickering faux candle casting shadows from inside each one. From inside, music played, the muffled sound of laughter and conversation filtering through the walls.</p><p>For a moment, Rio hesitated.</p><p>It wasn’t like she wasn’t used to walking into a crowded room.</p><p>She’d just never done it while feeling quite so… out of her element.</p><p>But then Mia glanced back at her, brow raised in something like curiosity—like she could see the hesitation but wasn’t going to call attention to it—and Rio straightened.</p><p>This wasn’t about her.</p><p>Mia had actually wanted to come.</p><p>And she wasn’t about to let her kid see her falter.</p><p>So she squared her shoulders, grinned at Will and Mia, and said, “Alright, kids. Let’s go scare some music nerds.”</p><p>And with that, she pushed open the door.</p><p>The moment Rio stepped inside Sonata Grove, she was hit with the scent of cinnamon and warm cider, mingling with the faintest hint of something floral—probably from the dozens of fake cobwebs and plastic bats hanging from every corner of the room. The place was alive with music and laughter, kids and adults alike milling about in a sea of costumes.</p><p>She adjusted the strap of her bag, where she had tucked away Agatha’s birthday present—nothing too dramatic, just something she thought she might appreciate—and the small bag of Halloween candy and new guitar picks for Nicky.</p><p>Then her gaze landed on her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness stood across the room, deep in conversation with the redhead she’d seen around the school a few times, dressed in a flowing, elegant black-and-purple witch’s outfit, the long sleeves fitted perfectly to her slender arms, the corset-style bodice hugging her waist, and the skirt cascading in gentle waves to her ankles. A matching wide-brimmed hat sat atop her dark hair, and—<em> fuck </em>.</p><p>Rio swallowed, hard.</p><p>Because that was a problem.</p><p>A real problem.</p><p>It wasn’t like she didn’t already know Agatha was attractive—she had eyes, thank you very much. But seeing her like this, in something that looked like it had been designed specifically to make Rio’s brain short-circuit, was… interesting.</p><p>And it got even more interesting when Agatha turned, locking eyes with her.</p><p>Because for a split second—<em> just a second</em>—Rio saw something there. Something like… admiration. Maybe even desire.</p><p>It was gone in a blink, replaced by her usual cool composure, but Rio had seen it.</p><p>
<em> Well, well. </em>
</p><p>She smirked, making her way through the room, only vaguely aware of Mia and Will peeling off in search of whatever teenagers did at these things. She had more important things to deal with.</p><p>Like handing Nicky his gifts—because she was absolutely not above bribing her number-one fan—and, of course, Agatha.</p><p>Because now that she’d seen that look, she was suddenly very interested in pushing a little harder to see what else Agatha Harkness was trying to keep under wraps.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Rio found Nicky first, because of course she did. The kid had a way of making himself impossible to miss—bouncing on his feet near the snack table, wearing a pirate costume complete with a toy sword and an eyepatch he’d pushed up onto his forehead.</p><p>“Rio, hey!!” he greeted her with enough enthusiasm to power an entire concert hall. “You came!”</p><p>Rio grinned, pulling the bag off her shoulder. “Of course I did. You invited me, didn’t you? Wouldn’t miss it.” She handed him the small bag of Halloween candy and the new set of guitar picks—sleek, black with silver details, ones she’d had custom-made. “Figured you could use some fresh ones.”</p><p>Nicky gasped like she’d just handed him a bar of solid gold. “No way. These are so cool!” He flipped one between his fingers, testing the weight, and then gave her the most serious nod a ten-year-old could manage. “You get me.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p>Before Nicky could launch into another excited rant, she felt a presence behind her—strong, poised.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>She turned, already grinning, but whatever she was about to say completely vanished from her brain the second she got a proper look at Agatha up close.</p><p>
<em> Jesus fucking Christ. </em>
</p><p>Up close, the outfit was even more unfair. The dark velvet of her bodice hugged her frame like a second skin, the neckline just low enough to make Rio’s mouth go dry. The deep purple skirt swayed as she shifted, her dark hair spilling over one shoulder, lips painted a rich shade of red.</p><p>She looked… dangerous. The kind of woman who could ruin a person’s entire sense of balance with a single glance.</p><p>“Having fun?” Agatha asked, her voice perfectly measured, but Rio knew she’d caught her staring.</p><p>Yeah, you caught me, Harkness.</p><p>Rio grinned, lifting her bag off her shoulder. “Brought you something.” She pulled out a small, carefully wrapped gift. “Birthday and Halloween combo. Thought it’d be rude to show up empty-handed.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted slightly, eyes flicking down to the present before returning to Rio’s face, as if trying to gauge what the hell she was up to.</p><p>Agatha took the gift, her fingers grazing Rio’s in a way that felt almost deliberate. Or maybe Rio was just imagining things. <em> Yeah, let’s go with that before I do something stupid, </em>she thought to herself.</p><p>“You didn’t have to,” Agatha said, but she was already unwrapping it.</p><p>Rio shrugged, forcing herself to sound casual. “Didn’t seem right not to.”</p><p>The paper fell away, revealing a sleek, leather-bound notebook, the kind meant for composing music. Agatha’s fingers traced over the embossed initials on the cover—A.H.—and for the first time that night, she looked genuinely surprised.</p><p>Rio looked down at her hands, suddenly feeling like she’d said too much without saying anything at all. “Figured you might like a fresh place to put your genius.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, something shifting in her expression. For a second, Rio swore she saw a flicker of something dangerously close to warmth, maybe even gratitude. But just as quickly, it was gone, replaced by that signature smirk.</p><p>“Flattery will get you nowhere,” Agatha teased, but she held the notebook with an almost reverent grip, like she actually did appreciate it.</p><p>Rio smirked, tilting her head. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>As Agatha turned the notebook over in her hands, Rio leaned in just slightly, dropping her voice low enough that only Agatha could hear.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers paused on the cover. For a moment, Rio thought she wouldn’t respond, but then she looked up, her expression unreadable.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said, her voice softer than Rio had ever heard it.</p><p>And damn it, if that didn’t make something shift in Rio’s chest.</p><p>Then, before the moment could stretch into something too obvious, Nicky came barreling in, grabbing her wrist and yanking her toward the stage.</p><p>“You have to come watch me play!” he insisted, practically vibrating with excitement. “Please, please, please?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking off whatever weird thing had just happened between her and Agatha.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” she said, letting herself be dragged away. “I’ll watch you play.”</p><p>As she glanced back one last time, Agatha was still standing there, fingers lightly tracing the edges of the notebook. And this time, Rio didn’t imagine it—Agatha was smiling.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>The party was in full swing, and Rio had lost count of how many times someone had come up to her, phone in hand, asking for a selfie. She obliged each time, because it was part of the deal, but it wasn’t exactly fun to constantly be pulled out of a conversation or a moment just to pose for a camera.</p><p>She was just about to retreat to a quieter corner when a familiar voice cut through the noise.</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough of that,” Agatha said, stepping in between Rio and a particularly insistent guest. “She’s off duty. Go bother someone else.”</p><p>Rio blinked as Agatha’s firm tone sent the person scurrying away, and then—before Rio could even get a word out—Agatha’s hand wrapped around her wrist, tugging her away from the crowd.</p><p>“You looked like you needed rescuing,” Agatha murmured as she led her toward a quieter corner of the room where a small group was gathered.</p><p>“I was handling it just fine,” Rio replied, though she couldn’t help the smirk tugging at her lips. “But I guess I should say thanks.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look that was both exasperated and amused before stopping in front of her friends.</p><p>“Everyone, this is Rio Vidal,” she said, gesturing toward her. “Rio, this is Wanda, Lilia, and Viz.”</p><p>Wanda, a striking redhead in a vampire costume, gave her an easy grin. “Oh, we know who you are,” she said. “Nice to finally meet you officially.”</p><p>Lilia, a silver-haired woman dressed as some kind of dramatic sorceress, arched an eyebrow. “So you’re the one corrupting Agatha’s child,” she said dryly.</p><p>Rio let out a laugh, throwing her hands up. “Guilty as charged.”</p><p>Viz, dressed as—Rio squinted—some kind of futuristic knight, nodded politely. “Nice to meet you,” he said, before adjusting his glasses. “I do my best to keep these ones in line, but it’s a full-time job.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Excuse you, I am perfectly respectable.”</p><p>Wanda snorted. “Sure you are.”</p><p>Rio found herself grinning, enjoying the easy banter between them. But what caught her attention the most was Agatha herself. Though she was keeping up with the conversation, her fingers were still lightly touching the edge of the notebook Rio had given her, almost absently. She had put it in the pocket of her skirt, just the top of it popping out, but it was unmistakably her gift.</p><p>The sight made something warm curl in Rio’s chest. It wasn’t often that she gave someone a gift and saw them actually cherish it. But Agatha?</p><p>Yeah, Agatha liked it. A lot.</p><p>And for some reason, that pleased Rio more than it should have.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio leaned back against the table, arms crossed loosely over her chest, as she watched Agatha banter with her friends. It was… different.</p><p>The Agatha she was used to seeing—the one in the crisp button-downs at Sonata Grove, the one who carried herself with an air of quiet authority, the one who always seemed like she had a hundred things on her mind at any given moment—was still there. But here, at this party, in her witch costume, glass of wine in hand, with her friends teasing her and making her roll her eyes in fond exasperation, she seemed… lighter.</p><p>Rio found herself watching her more than she probably should.</p><p>“You know,” she said, smirking as Agatha turned to her, “I think this is the first time I’ve seen you actually enjoying yourself.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You heard me.” Rio took a sip of her drink, studying her over the rim of her cup. “I see you here at school, all serious and in charge, and I’ve seen you around Mia, making sure she’s learning the right techniques and all that. But this? You’re smiling.” She gestured vaguely at her. “You’re having fun. Who knew you were capable?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “I do have fun, I’ll have you know.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. When?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then hesitated.</p><p>Wanda, ever the troublemaker, grinned. “No, no, I want to hear this. When <em> do you </em> have fun, Aggie?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “I will kill you.”</p><p>Wanda just laughed, and Rio chuckled along with her.</p><p>Agatha huffed, taking a sip of her wine before muttering, “I have fun.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, smirking. “Sure you do.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her. “I do.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Rio drawled, taking another sip of her drink. “Give me one example.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated again, and Wanda outright cackled.</p><p>“You have no example, do you?” Rio teased, enjoying how Agatha’s glare sharpened.</p><p>“I run a music school,” Agatha defended, as if that proved anything. “That’s fun.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Rio said, grinning. “Super fun. Nothing screams ‘letting loose’ like organizing schedules and making sure kids don’t break expensive instruments.”</p><p>Agatha gave her an unimpressed look. “For your information, watching students improve, helping them discover their potential, and giving them the tools to succeed? That <em> is </em> fun.”</p><p>Lilia laughed, sipping her cocktail. “You sound like an inspirational poster, darling.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, holding back a laugh, and Agatha sighed, clearly regretting all of her life choices.</p><p>But Rio, now fully entertained, pressed on. “Okay, so the school is fun. What else?”</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the party, as if searching for an answer. “I enjoy playing music.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “That’s work.”</p><p>“It is not,” Agatha scoffed, looking personally offended.</p><p>Rio grinned. “It totally is.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, then said, “Fine. I enjoy spending time with Nicky and my friends. We do this every year.”</p><p>“So, what you’re telling me,” Rio said, looking delighted, “is that the one time a year you truly let loose is your own birthday party?”</p><p>Agatha looked like she was debating whether or not she should throw her drink at her.</p><p>Viz, chuckling, decided to step in. “To be fair, Agatha has never been the reckless type.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “That’s not entirely true.”</p><p>Agatha immediately turned to her with a warning look. “<em>Wanda </em>.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “<em>Oh </em>? Do tell.”</p><p>“<em>Wanda </em>,” Agatha said again, more forcefully.</p><p>Wanda, grinning wickedly, ignored her. “Let’s just say there was a time when someone wasn’t as uptight as she pretends to be.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I already regret introducing you to each other.”</p><p>Rio laughed, enjoying every second of this.</p><p>She looked at Agatha again, and for just a moment, something softened in her chest. She liked this version of her. The version that was flustered, exasperated, and—for once—not completely in control. It made her wonder what Agatha would be like if she ever really let go.</p><p>That was an interesting thought.</p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, eyes glinting with curiosity. “Okay, now I have to know. What’s the most reckless thing you’ve ever done, Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha took a measured sip of her wine, as if she could buy time with it. Then she gave Rio a perfectly cool look and said, “Letting you hang out with my son.”</p><p>Lilia let out a dramatic gasp. “Scandalous.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “Alright, I walked right into that one.”</p><p>“You did,” Agatha said, smug now.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t done with her. “Come on, really though. I refuse to believe you’ve never done anything impulsive in your life.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, considering her. “I make calculated decisions.”</p><p>“Oh my God,” Wanda muttered. “It’s exhausting being friends with you.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a withering look, and Rio grinned.</p><p>“You mean to tell me,” Rio pressed, voice full of mock disbelief, “that you’ve never gotten into trouble? Never had a reckless night? Never made out with someone just because you felt like it?”</p><p>There was something about the way Agatha’s lips parted, about the way her fingers tightened ever so slightly around her glass, that made Rio pause.</p><p>Wanda and Lilia exchanged glances, and Agatha, after a long moment, finally said, “Not since college.”</p><p>Rio’s curiosity sharpened. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look that said don’t push it, but Rio was already invested.</p><p>“College Agatha,” Rio mused, tapping a finger against her chin. “I bet she was something else.”</p><p>Agatha gave a slow, deceptively pleasant smile. “College Agatha,” she said smoothly, “would’ve eaten you alive.”</p><p>Viz choked on his drink. Lilia burst out laughing. Wanda looked like she was about to keel over.</p><p>Rio? She just stared at Agatha, feeling something unspool in her stomach.</p><p>And for once, she had absolutely no idea what to say.</p><p>The moment stretched between them, charged and humming, until Rio finally found her voice.</p><p>“Damn,” she murmured, still processing. “Now that’s an image.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, clearly pleased with herself. “I thought you’d like that.”</p><p>Before Rio could come up with an appropriately flirty response, a familiar voice cut through the air—one full of absolute delight.</p><p>“Mom! You have to come see this!”</p><p>Rio turned to find Mia approaching, Will at her side, both of them looking uncharacteristically excited.</p><p>“See what?” Rio asked, grateful for the reprieve (<em>because what the hell had just happened with Agatha Harkness? </em>).</p><p>Mia gestured toward the small stage that had been set up in the corner of the room, where a group of kids—including Nicky and the twins—were gathered around what looked like an impromptu jam session.</p><p>“It’s Nicky,” Mia said. “He’s really good.”</p><p>At that, Rio perked up. “Yeah?”</p><p>Mia nodded. “Come on.”</p><p>She and Will led the way, and Rio turned back to Agatha, who was watching Nicky with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“You coming?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then sighed. “I suppose I should see what kind of corruption you’ve inflicted on my child.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “That’s the spirit.”</p><p>They made their way through the crowd, and as they got closer, Rio could hear it—Nicky, guitar in hand, playing with an ease and confidence that was damn impressive for a ten-year-old.</p><p>He was playing a riff she recognized immediately—one of her songs.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio felt something tighten in her chest, something warm and almost painful. She glanced at Agatha, wondering how she was feeling about all this, but Agatha was watching Nicky with something close to awe.</p><p>Then, as if she felt Rio’s gaze, Agatha turned to her and said, very softly, “You’ve made him better.”</p><p>It wasn’t an accusation.</p><p>It wasn’t even grudging.</p><p>It was something else entirely.</p><p>Something that made Rio’s heart trip over itself as she looked at Agatha Harkness in the dim, golden light of Sonata Grove, listening to a boy who adored them both.</p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p>She was in trouble.</p><p>Before either of them could address the quiet thing that had passed between them, Nicky came bounding up, eyes wide with excitement.</p><p>“Rio, you have to play with me. Just one song. Please?” His hands were clasped together in dramatic pleading, and his cap had shifted slightly askew from all his excitement.</p><p>Rio blinked, still reeling from whatever that was with Agatha, before letting out a breathless chuckle. “You sure you can keep up with me, kid?”</p><p>Nicky puffed up his chest. “I’ve been practicing.”</p><p>Agatha groaned beside her, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I blame you entirely for this.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I take full credit.” Then, glancing back at Nicky, she jerked her head toward the little impromptu stage area. “Alright, kid. Let’s see what you’ve got.”</p><p>Nicky let out an actual whoop and bolted off to grab his guitar, leaving Rio standing there, feeling—unexpectedly—like she’d just agreed to something far more dangerous than a simple jam session.</p><p>When she glanced back at Agatha, she caught the way her lips had twitched, like she was trying not to smile. And Rio?</p><p>Rio was definitely in trouble.</p><p>Nicky was vibrating with excitement as he adjusted his guitar strap, fingers barely staying still over the strings. Rio crouched down slightly, giving him a conspiratorial grin. “Alright, what are we playing?”</p><p>Nicky’s entire face lit up. “Wicked Games.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, impressed. “Solid choice, kid. Let’s make it good.”</p><p>She strummed her guitar, testing the sound, and then—because she was incapable of half-assing anything when it came to music—she sank into the opening chords, letting the notes hum through the space. Nicky followed her lead, his playing a little hesitant at first, but he had good instincts. He listened, adjusted, and as the melody built, his confidence grew.</p><p>The crowd quieted as the familiar song filled the air, and Rio, caught in the moment, closed her eyes, letting herself feel the music.</p><p>When she glanced up again, her gaze immediately found Agatha.</p><p>And <em> oh</em>.</p><p>She was watching.</p><p>No—she was <em> staring</em>.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, the picture of composure, stood with her arms loosely crossed, her head tilted just slightly, and her eyes—dark, deep, entirely transfixed—were locked onto her.</p><p>Rio felt it like a strike of lightning, sharp and unexpected.</p><p>The rest of the song passed in a blur of sound and rhythm, and by the time they hit the last notes, Nicky was grinning so wide it was a miracle his face didn’t split in two. The moment the music stopped, the crowd clapped and cheered, and Nicky turned to Rio, breathless and starry-eyed.</p><p>“That was <em> so cool</em>.”</p><p>Rio smirked, ruffling his hair. “Not bad, rookie. We’ll make a rockstar out of you yet.”</p><p>Nicky beamed, but Rio’s focus drifted back to Agatha.</p><p>She was still watching her.</p><p>And for once, she didn’t look away.</p><p>The air between them felt different now—charged, something unspoken crackling in the space where Agatha’s sharp, discerning gaze met Rio’s. It wasn’t admiration, not quite. It wasn’t even simple appreciation.</p><p>It was something else.</p><p>Rio handed her guitar off to Nicky, ruffling his hair one more time as he ran off, chattering excitedly with the twins about his “epic” performance. But even as she joked with him, even as she smiled at his enthusiasm, she could feel Agatha’s attention lingering on her like a ghost touch.</p><p>And when she turned—when their eyes met again—Rio swore the breath stalled in her throat.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away.</p><p>Didn’t hide behind her usual perfectly curated distance.</p><p>Instead, she took a slow, measured step closer, just enough that Rio caught the faintest trace of her perfume—something warm and dark, like vanilla and spice.</p><p>“Not bad, Vidal,” Agatha murmured, voice smooth as a well-played piano chord. “I suppose all those years of performing have made you somewhat competent.”</p><p>Rio huffed a soft laugh. “Somewhat competent? Wow, that almost sounded like a compliment.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved just slightly, but there was something else in her expression now—something thoughtful. Almost hesitant. She shifted her weight, fingers drumming idly against her opposite arm.</p><p>And then, in a rare moment of something like sincerity, she said, “He adores you, you know.”</p><p>It took Rio a second to realize she meant Nicky.</p><p>Something in her chest tightened. She exhaled through her nose, rubbing the back of her neck. “Yeah. He’s a good kid.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, glancing briefly toward where Nicky was still basking in the afterglow of his impromptu performance. Then, softer, “He doesn’t… get attached to people like that often.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>And just like that, the moment shifted.</p><p>This wasn’t just a casual remark. This was something real. A peek behind the curtain of Agatha’s guarded world.</p><p>Rio swallowed, suddenly feeling like she was standing at the edge of something she didn’t quite understand yet.</p><p>Before she could think of what to say, someone called Agatha’s name from across the room. She exhaled through her nose, sending Rio one last glance—still unreadable, still layered with things Rio couldn’t quite name—before stepping away.</p><p>And Rio, for the first time in a long time, found herself wishing she hadn’t.</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha moved through the crowd on autopilot, offering polite smiles and murmured thanks to those who wished her a happy birthday. But her mind was elsewhere—back in that moment, standing too close to Rio Vidal, with the scent of her lingering in the air and the unmistakable pull of something unsettling coiling deep in Agatha’s belly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to name it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t want to acknowledge the way her skin still prickled where Rio’s gaze had lingered, the way her breath had caught at the sight of her playing—completely in her element, fingers dancing over the strings with an ease that made it look effortless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a long time since Agatha had felt anything like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the problem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a slow sip of the wine Wanda had handed her at some point, hoping it would steady her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she found herself scanning the room—looking for her, like some part of her had already given in to whatever this ridiculous pull was. And when she spotted Rio, laughing at something one of the kids had said, Agatha exhaled sharply, forcing herself to look away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was ridiculous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, spill,” Wanda’s voice cut through her spiraling thoughts, and Agatha barely had time to school her expression before her best friend appeared at her side, arms crossed, lips curled in the knowing smirk that meant trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Spill what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda arched an eyebrow. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe the fact that you’ve been eyeing a certain rockstar like she’s a particularly complicated piece of music you really want to figure out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, taking another sip of wine. “Don’t be ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just grinned wider. “I love when you get all flustered. It means I’m right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, but Wanda just looped an arm through hers, dragging her toward the dessert table. Except Agatha could feel Rio’s presence across the room, like a song she couldn’t quite tune out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if Wanda noticed the way her grip tightened around her glass, she was kind enough not to comment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let Wanda drag her toward the dessert table, focusing on the spread instead of the lingering sensation of Rio’s presence in the room. The party was well underway, a lively hum of conversation and music filling Sonata Grove’s main hall. Normally, she would enjoy this—the warmth of good company, the ease of familiarity—but she felt anything but at ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was still watching her, clearly waiting for her to crack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Wanda started casually, reaching for a mini pumpkin tart. “What did you think of her performance?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed noncommittally, pouring herself another glass of wine. “She’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda made a tsk sound. “She’s good? That’s all you’ve got?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a professional musician, Wanda,” Agatha replied dryly. “It would be concerning if she wasn’t good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda rolled her eyes. “Oh, come on. You were watching her like—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was watching Nicky,” Agatha corrected, too quickly, too sharply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda raised her eyebrow again, unimpressed. “Right. Sure. Watching your son. That’s why you looked like you were about to either pass out or drag Rio Vidal into a dark corner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha choked on her wine. “</span>
<em>
<span>Excuse me</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned, far too pleased with herself. “Oh, you heard me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leveled her with a glare. “I am not—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incredibly attracted to her?” Wanda cut in. “Because Ags—” she placed a hand on Agatha’s arm, her expression turning far too knowing for Agatha’s liking— “I saw your face. And I saw hers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened. “There was nothing on her face.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted. “That’s hilarious. Because I distinctly remember her looking at you like she wanted to—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Wanda</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her best friend smirked, then took a slow, deliberate bite of her tart. “I’m just saying,” she said around a mouthful. “You should—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should nothing,” Agatha interrupted, then exhaled sharply, lowering her voice. “This is ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “I barely know her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet you’re here all flustered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled, but Wanda simply grinned, enjoying this far too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could snap a response, she heard Nicky’s laughter across the room. He was still buzzing with excitement, chatting animatedly with Tommy and Billy. And next to him, Rio stood, hat now discarded, running a hand through her dark hair as she smiled at something Nicky said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt it again—the same unsettling sensation that had been chasing her all night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just attraction, though she couldn’t deny that was part of it. It was something deeper, something unfamiliar, something she didn’t want to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tore her eyes away. “I need more wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the party wound down, Agatha said goodbye to her students and their families, nodding along as many of them gushed about how incredible it had been to have </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Rio Vidal at Sonata Grove.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She supposed it was a big deal. A world-famous rockstar at their little school event? Of course, people were excited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little exasperated as she overheard someone whisper, </span>
<em>
<span>She’s even cooler in person.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes, yes. She’s magnificent. We should all bow before her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rolling her eyes at her own pettiness, Agatha turned her attention back to the room. That was when she spotted Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl stood near a corner, arms loosely crossed, watching as yet another person approached her mother with a hesitant smile and a phone in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha braced herself, expecting Mia’s usual flicker of irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But it never came.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia wasn’t tense or scowling. She wasn’t staring at the floor like she wanted to disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she just… watched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was new.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Curious, Agatha approached. “Not annoyed this time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia turned, offering her a small shrug. “Not really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sighed, shifting her weight. “I dunno. It’s different here. At school, at events, it’s like I don’t exist. I’m just Rio Vidal’s daughter, and everyone acts like I’m some accessory to her life.” She gestured around them. “But here? This place is </span>
<em>
<span>mine</span>
</em>
<span>. This is </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>spot. So I don’t really care if people freak out over her. It’s not like she’s taking anything away from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her, impressed by the self-awareness in those words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had seen it happening—Mia finding her place within these walls. The way she threw herself into her lessons, the way she focused, the way she came alive at the piano. It was the exact opposite of the reserved, uncomfortable girl she had first met weeks ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, Mia was finally acknowledging that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered her a small smile. “I’m glad you feel that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave another shrug, but there was an ease in it this time. “Yeah. Me too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced over at her mother again before straightening. “I should go look for Will, so we can go. Thanks for the party, Ms. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inclined her head. “See you next week, Mia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the last of the guests trickled out, Agatha found herself lingering near the piano, listening to the quiet hum of conversation still floating through the room. She had just finished saying goodbye to Wanda and Viz when she felt a presence at her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice was warm, familiar in a way that Agatha wasn’t sure she was ready to acknowledge. She turned her head and found Rio standing there, closer than expected, hands in the pockets of her red coat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leaving?” Agatha asked, her voice steady despite the odd twist low in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Mia already stepped out with Will.” She tilted her head. “Figured I’d say goodbye before I go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inclined her head. “That’s very polite of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “I can be polite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll believe it when I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, then let the sound settle between them. For a moment, neither of them spoke, the energy in the air shifting, crackling, as if something unsaid was hovering between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio exhaled, her voice quieter, more intentional. “Happy birthday, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth, a response already forming, but it vanished the moment Rio reached out and touched her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was barely a touch—just the light press of fingers against her forearm, a fleeting, grounding warmth—but Agatha felt it everywhere. Her breath hitched, but she didn’t pull away. Couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lingered, thumb brushing absentmindedly over the fabric of Agatha’s sleeve before she let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, realizing only then that she had been holding her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you next week?” Rio asked, as if nothing had happened. But the way her eyes flickered—like she knew something had—made Agatha’s pulse stutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She straightened, schooling her features into something composed. “See you next week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, that easy, knowing grin, and then she turned and walked away, leaving Agatha standing there, breath uneven, pulse thrumming, and deeply unsure of what the hell had just happened to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The restaurant was dimly lit, elegant without being pretentious, the kind of place Agatha had been meaning to try for months but never quite found the time for. Tonight, though, she wasn’t Professor Harkness, wasn’t Mom, wasn’t the carefully controlled head of Sonata Grove. She was just Agatha, out with her friends, drinking a very nice glass of red wine while Wanda and Lilia tried (and failed) to one-up each other with increasingly ridiculous stories about disastrous first dates from their youth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their server had just brought out the appetizers—a spread of artisan bread, roasted olives, and a delicate burrata drizzled with balsamic—when Lilia leaned back in her chair and sighed dramatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am so mad I had to leave early last night,” she lamented, shaking her head. “I told them I needed the night off, but no—every other actor in the cast suddenly had an emergency, and I had to go on for all of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry,” Wanda said, smirking as she cut into the burrata. “We only had a literal rockstar gracing our presence. She even performed. Nothing special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia groaned. “That’s exactly why I’m mad! I heard she even performed after I left—tell me everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a long sip of her wine. “It was a school party, Lilia. Not a concert.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia scoffed. “Yes, and I am the Queen of England.” She turned to Wanda. “Spill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She played a song with Nicky,” Wanda continued, undeterred. “You should’ve seen his face—kid was practically levitating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia grinned. “And what about you, Aggie? I heard she gave you a present.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set down her glass with an exasperated sigh. “I hate that Wanda has the biggest mouth on the planet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, darling,” Lilia purred. “You are so much fun when you’re flustered.” she leaned forward, eyes sparkling with mischief. “So? What did she get you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. She wasn’t sure why she suddenly felt so self-conscious about it. It was just a thoughtful gift. A strangely thoughtful gift, but still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A notebook,” she admitted, carefully keeping her voice neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia looked even more interested. Agatha wanted to die. “A notebook?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A personalized leather-bound notebook,” Wanda added knowingly. “With the most ridiculously high-quality staff paper I’ve ever seen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia nearly choked on her wine. “Hold on. She gave you—” She turned to Wanda. “That’s not just a notebook, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Wanda confirmed. “That’s a move.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “You’re both ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you are ridiculous if you think we’re going to let this go.” Lilia pointed a fork at her. “That woman gave you a composer’s notebook. Do you understand what that means?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That she knows I’m a classical music composer? That I’m a pianist?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda rolled her eyes. “That she wants you to write something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia snapped her fingers. “For her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “She never said that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t have to,” Lilia said smugly. “That’s what makes it brilliant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, reaching for her wine again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She also wrote in it,” Wanda added slyly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia gasped, looking delighted. “Did she really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was just one sentence,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned. “What was it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A little magic for your music.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t stopped thinking about it since she’d read it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But there was no way she was telling them that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not important,” she said instead, taking a deliberate sip of wine. “I don’t even know why you guys are being so obnoxious about this. I’m not even into women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia and Wanda exchanged a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Aggie,” Lilia said, shaking her head. “You are so screwed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was saved from answering by the sudden shift in the room’s energy. Conversations stuttered, heads turned, subtle murmurs spread like ripples in a pond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she saw her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal had just walked in, flanked by three other women who could only be her bandmates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire restaurant practically buzzed with recognition. A couple at the bar subtly took out their phones, and a waiter practically tripped over his own feet trying to keep his composure as he led them to a table near the back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Wanda said, a slow smirk pulling at her lips. “Well, well, well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened. “Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia arched a brow. “Interesting. You’re already defensive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am</span>
<em>
<span> not </span>
</em>
<span>defensive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re gripping your fork like a weapon,” Wanda pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled at her plate. “This was supposed to be a night off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“From what?” Lilia mused. “Your very normal and completely not tense interactions with your son’s favorite rockstar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hummed. “Right. Totally normal. Which is why you’ve been staring at her for a solid ten seconds now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced herself to look away, suddenly very interested in the appetizers in front of her. But it was too late—her mind had already cataloged everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t in a costume tonight, wasn’t playfully performing for an audience. She was just herself, all dark hair and easy confidence, dressed in ripped jeans and a fitted leather jacket that looked infuriatingly good on her. Her laugh—low and warm—cut through the restaurant as one of her bandmates said something, and Agatha hated that she recognized the sound immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This is fine</span>
</em>
<span>, she told herself. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s not even looking this way. We will finish this meal, and I will go home, and—</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her thought process abruptly derailed when Rio turned, scanning the restaurant, and her eyes landed directly on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, to Agatha’s absolute horror, Rio’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She saw you,” Wanda singsonged gleefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She knows you saw her,” Lilia added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a long-suffering sigh and picked up her wine glass. “I am going to need another drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a slow sip of her wine, schooling her expression into something neutral. Indifference. That was the key here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was an expert at that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just had to pretend that Rio Vidal’s smirk hadn’t sent a ripple of something entirely too dangerous through her bloodstream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Wanda drawled, utterly delighted. “That was intimate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia, as always, was quick to pile on. “Did you see the way she looked at you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deliberate bite of her artisan bread. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda huffed out a laugh. “Aggie. Sweetheart. Darling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowled. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s still looking at you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha absolutely was not going to fall for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stabbed at an olive. “Eat your food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia, unhelpful as ever, propped her chin on her hand, grinning. “Oh, she’s making you work for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what?” Agatha snapped, too fast, too sharp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda let out a scandalized gasp. “Oh my God. You </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> her to come over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes, you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re both insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia waved her off. “We’re observant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We just want you to be happy, Aggie,” Wanda said, placing a dramatic hand over her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leveled her with a glare. “I am very happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda snorted. “Yeah, sure. You’re glowing with joy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to fling a piece of bread at her. “I am having a lovely evening with my dear friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia grinned. “And Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her. “A lovely evening,” she repeated firmly. “And nothing—</span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span>—is going to disrupt that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia hummed. “You know, it’s funny—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doubtful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“—because it sort of looks like she’s about to get up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fork clattered against her plate. “She is not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not looking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Wanda said, far too smugly, “You’re going to cave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her chin. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, finally, finally—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She risked a glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And immediately regretted it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Rio was still looking at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But worse?</span>
</p><p>
<span>So much worse?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second their eyes met, Rio winked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply, hating the way her stomach clenched, the way a heat curled low in her belly, the way—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, my God,” Lilia gasped, delighted. “Look at you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nearly choked on her wine. “This is so much better than I expected.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slammed her glass onto the table, looking around wildly, desperate for an out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was when she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A waiter—bless him—was coming their way, bottle of wine in hand, clearly prepared to top off their glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Perfect. A distraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to him immediately. “You know what? Just leave the bottle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was perfectly fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was enjoying a wonderful dinner with her dear—if insufferable—friends, and nothing was going to shake her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not Rio Vidal’s smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not her stupid wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not the way her pulse had jumped in response to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a long sip of wine, listening very intently as Lilia launched into some dramatic retelling of a nightmare audition process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was working.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, she almost forgot—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Low, warm, familiar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand tightened around her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to look to know exactly where it was coming from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the other end of the restaurant, a waiter had just finished pouring a round of drinks for Rio and her bandmates.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio accepted her glass with a lazy sort of ease, a grateful smile, something amused flickering in her eyes as an Asian woman muttered something to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, as if she could feel Agatha’s gaze—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach dropped as Rio suddenly pushed her chair back and stood. And now Agatha noticed she had taken her leather jacket off, wearing only a silk halter neck black blouse. Her tattooed arms were on display and Agatha felt her breath hitch when her eyes swept over how toned they were.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Wanda whispered, as if witnessing a miracle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, wide-eyed, panicked. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Lilia beamed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s coming over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And sure enough—</span>
</p><p>
<span>With all the confidence of someone who had never once questioned herself a day in her life, Rio crossed the room, easy and unapologetic, her gaze locked onto Agatha like she already knew how this was going to go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it wasn’t just Agatha’s table that had noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio weaved through the restaurant, more than a few heads turned, murmurs bubbling up in her wake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely heard them over the blood rushing in her ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers clenched around her napkin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She willed herself to look bored. Indifferent. Unmoved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was remarkably difficult given the way Rio was looking at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped just short of their table, tipping her head in greeting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ladies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda and Lilia exchanged looks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swore she heard a silent squeal of excitement from Wanda, but she didn’t dare check.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced a polite smile. “Ms. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth tugged up at the corners, as if she found Agatha’s attempt at casual deeply amusing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happy birthday,” she said smoothly, gaze dipping to the wine glass in Agatha’s hand. “Still celebrating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her chin. “I like to be thorough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed out a quiet laugh, eyes twinkling with something dangerous. “Can’t fault you for that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia, who clearly had zero intention of behaving, leaned in, chin propped on her palm. “We were just talking about you, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a warning look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia, unfazed, beamed. “Your Halloween performance was the talk of the party, I hear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to Agatha, playful. “Oh? What’d you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set down her glass. “I think you’re quite accustomed to having an audience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “And you’re not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha refused to acknowledge the way her pulse skipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha only took a sip of her wine, Rio smirked, apparently infinitely amused at whatever she saw playing in Agatha’s expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway, I’ll let you get back to your dinner. Just wanted to say hi and wish you a happy birthday again, Harkness,” she turned to Wanda and Lilia and nodded. “Ladies, enjoy the rest of your evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night air was cool, but not cold—just enough of a crisp edge to remind Agatha that autumn had arrived, even in Los Angeles. She tugged her blazer a little tighter around herself as she and her friends stepped onto the sidewalk, the buzz of dinner still lingering between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I vote for drinks at that rooftop bar Wanda likes,” Lilia said, stretching her arms over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, now you want my opinion?” Wanda shot back. “I distinctly recall being ignored when I suggested the first restaurant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You suggested an Italian place.” Lilia rolled her eyes. “You always suggest Italian.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because Italian is good,” Wanda said, as if this was a universally agreed-upon fact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let their bickering wash over her as she exhaled, feeling…content. She wasn’t usually one for big birthday celebrations, but shaking things up this year had been the right call. A night out in the city, good food, good company—what more could she ask for?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely had time to process that thought before the restaurant doors swung open again, and a fresh wave of noise spilled onto the sidewalk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to turn around to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal had just stepped outside, the hum of her presence instantly shifting the energy on the street. Even without looking, Agatha could tell that a few people had noticed—whispers, stolen glances, someone subtly pulling out their phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she did glance over, she found Rio looking exactly as she always did—effortlessly magnetic, somehow both relaxed and impossible to ignore. The glow from the streetlights caught the silver rings on her fingers as she ran a hand through her dark hair, the leather jacket slung over her shoulders making her look every bit the rockstar she was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her gaze forward, resisting the urge to sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” came Rio’s voice, smooth and amused. “Fancy meeting you here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for half a second. Then, slowly, she turned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood a few feet away, hands in her pockets, that insufferable smirk tugging at her lips. Her bandmates lingered behind her, still caught up in their own conversation, but Rio’s focus was entirely on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t peg you for the ‘night out on the town’ type, Harkness,” Rio continued, head tilting slightly. “What’s next? Dancing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As a matter of fact,” Agatha said pointedly, “we were just discussing where to go next.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect,” Rio said, grinning now. “We were about to head to a club. Private spot. You should come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to refuse immediately, but—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, that actually sounds fun,” Lilia cut in before she could get a word out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agreed,” Wanda added, surprising Agatha even further. “We should do something different tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to glare at them. “Since when are we the ‘go to a club’ type?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since we got a VIP invite,” Lilia said. “Come on, Aggie. It’s your birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s right,” Rio said easily, stepping just a fraction closer. “It </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> your birthday, Harkness. Live a little.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something about the way she said it—low, almost coaxing—sent an unwelcome prickle down Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She crossed her arms. “I’m already out,” she countered. “This is me living.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, as if that answer delighted her. “Now you just have to take it a step further.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated that the challenge in Rio’s voice made something flicker in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could formulate a response, Lilia leaned in and stage-whispered, “If you say no, she’s going to think you’re boring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a withering look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, to her credit, didn’t look smug. She just looked…amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe a little curious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed again, long-suffering. “Fine,” she relented. “But one drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” Rio said, voice full of mock innocence. “Wouldn’t dream of corrupting you, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia cackled. Wanda pressed her lips together, clearly holding back laughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored all of them as she stepped forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fell into step beside her, eyes gleaming in the streetlights, looking far too pleased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha refused to acknowledge the small, sharp thrill in her own chest as they started walking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio led the way down the sidewalk, the city buzzing around them, her hands still stuffed in her pockets as if this was all perfectly casual. It wasn’t. Not for Agatha, at least.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure if it was the way the night air carried Rio’s scent—something warm and slightly smoky, like cedarwood and leather—or the fact that she could feel Rio’s presence beside her, even without looking. Either way, something about this whole situation felt… dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said, tilting her head slightly toward Agatha as they walked. “You’ve met me, but you haven’t met my band yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “And that’s a problem?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Only if you don’t want the full experience of knowing Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, God,” Agatha muttered, just as Rio turned toward her group.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, guys,” Rio called, making the other three musicians look up. “Come meet Agatha Harkness. </span>
<em>
<span>The</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first to step forward was a short woman with red streaks in her dark hair and an expression that screamed troublemaker. She was dressed in a worn leather jacket, combat boots, and ripped jeans, looking exactly like someone who lived and breathed rock and roll.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice Wu,” she said, voice low and confident, offering her hand. “Guitarist. It’s nice to finally meet you—Rio’s been talking about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows lifted at that, but she shook Alice’s hand briefly. “Has she now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah,” Alice smirked. “She’s got a lot of thoughts about classical music all of a sudden.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nudged Alice with her elbow, muttering something under her breath, but before Agatha could dig into that extremely interesting comment, another woman stepped forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was striking, with a shaved head and an easy, self-assured smile. There was something effortlessly cool about her, the kind of presence that drew people in without trying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jennifer Kale,” she introduced herself, shaking Agatha’s hand. “Keyboardist. And before you say anything, yes, I know I could probably learn a lot from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted at that, finding herself a little charmed. “That remains to be seen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer grinned, then glanced toward the last person in their group, who had been standing slightly apart, watching with sharp blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Nat,” Rio said, tilting her head. “Don’t be shy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Natasha Romanov,” she said as she stepped forward, extending a hand with an almost lazy elegance. “Drummer,” she added, voice smooth and cool. “And if you ever want to trade war stories about what it’s like being the serious one in a group of absolute maniacs, I’m available.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha liked her immediately. She shook her hand firmly, arching a brow. “I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio made a wounded sound. “Excuse you, I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a maniac.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you absolutely are,” Natasha said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer laughed. Alice smirked. Rio just sighed dramatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, against her better judgment, was amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Jennifer said, looking between them. “Are we all heading to the club, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot a glance at Wanda and Lilia, both of whom looked entirely too entertained by this entire exchange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose we are,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Then let’s go.”</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Rio had been to more clubs than she could count. She’d played them, partied in them, watched them rise and fall with the city’s ever-changing tides. There was a time when she thrived in them—when she fed off the high of neon lights, pounding bass, and the rush of people who wanted to be near her just because she was Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But tonight? Tonight felt different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was aware of the crowd, of course. The way people whispered when they recognized her, the occasional bold ones who tried to get close. But that wasn’t what held her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was reserved for the woman currently walking just a step ahead of her, the dim lights of the club casting a soft glow against the curve of her jawline.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still couldn’t get over the way Agatha had looked at her back at the restaurant—how her eyes had gone dark when Rio had gotten too close, the way her throat had moved when she swallowed, the tension that had crackled between them like the first warning signs of a brewing storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t imagining it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, watching Agatha navigate the club, stiff and poised like she wasn’t quite sure what to do with herself in this setting, Rio felt something almost like amusement curl low in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked seeing Agatha a little out of her element.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More than that—she liked unsettling her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, this place is packed,” Wanda shouted over the music as they weaved through the crowd toward the private section Rio’s manager had reserved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a Saturday night,” Lilia pointed out. “Where else would people be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Reading books,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a laugh. “Do you actually read on Saturday nights?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed together. Then, grudgingly, “Sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d love to know what Agatha Harkness’s guilty pleasure books are,” Alice teased, appearing at Rio’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have guilty pleasures,” Agatha replied primly. “I simply have good taste.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer snorted. “Jesus. You’re even worse than Nat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I resent that,” Natasha said mildly as they arrived at their section.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slid onto the couch, ignoring the open space across from her and instead settling into the spot right beside Agatha. She stretched an arm along the back of the couch, her fingers nearly brushing against the back of Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, for her part, stiffened slightly. Not so much that anyone else would notice, but Rio noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked and relaxed further into the seat, watching as Agatha picked up a menu from the table, pretending to study it like it was the most interesting thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let the others talk for a bit, content to sip her drink and just watch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take long for her to start noticing things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like how Agatha avoided looking directly at her for too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or how she seemed just a little too aware of where Rio was sitting, her posture stiff whenever their legs brushed under the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, of course, there was the moment Rio leaned over to pass her a fresh drink—fingers grazing against Agatha’s wrist in the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Goosebumps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw them rise on Agatha’s skin, saw the way her breath hitched ever so slightly before she covered it up with a scowl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Very, very interesting.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her hand back, clearing her throat as she took the drink. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, voice low and smooth. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something flickered in Agatha’s gaze before she looked away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh yeah. She was definitely affecting her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that knowledge settled into Rio like a slow, steady burn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The others didn’t last long at the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Between the music, the drinks, and the energy of the club, it was only a matter of time before someone—Alice—decided they all needed to be on the dance floor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Alice said, nudging Natasha and Jen. “We didn’t come here to sit around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen drained the rest of her cocktail, already sliding out of the booth. “She’s got a point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda and Lilia exchanged a glance before Wanda shrugged. “I’m not saying no to dancing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither am I,” Lilia agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, already reaching for her drink as she watched her friends and Rio’s bandmates disappear into the crowd. “Thank God.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “What? Not a fan of dancing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, turning her gaze back to Rio. “Not a fan of being pressed up against strangers in a room where the music is too loud, the air is too thick, and people have no concept of personal space.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched her arm out along the back of the couch, her fingertips brushing against the soft fabric just behind Agatha’s shoulder. “You mean to tell me you’ve never been out dancing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t say that,” Agatha cut her a look. “I said I don’t enjoy it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, tilting her head. “That’s a shame.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. I just feel like someone with your precision, your grace—” Rio gestured vaguely with her fingers, “—would have incredible rhythm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips quirked slightly, as if she wasn’t sure whether to be annoyed or amused. “You’re trying to flatter me into dancing with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it working?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled through her nose, shaking her head. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, studying her for a moment. The dim lighting of the club softened Agatha’s sharp edges, the neon glow from the dance floor casting deep purples and blues along her cheekbones.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God, she was beautiful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I still think you’d like it,” Rio said, tapping her fingers idly against her knee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted a brow. “And why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in just a little, her voice lower now. “Because it’s not that different from playing music.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, sitting back. “I highly doubt that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, really,” Rio insisted, shifting slightly so she was just a little closer, her knee almost brushing Agatha’s. “It’s rhythm. Movement. Letting the music take over.” She tilted her head, watching the way Agatha’s fingers curled slightly around her glass. “I bet if I put you in front of a piano right now, you wouldn’t even have to think about what your hands are doing. Your body would just know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s muscle memory,” Agatha countered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And dancing is instinct,” Rio shot back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, amused despite herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know…” Rio said, voice dropping just a little lower, “if you came out there with me, I might be able to give you something better to add to your list of wild experiences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled, barely perceptible, but Rio caught it. She caught the way Agatha’s fingers twitched around her drink, the way her throat moved as she swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then—of course—Agatha smoothed over whatever momentary reaction she had and scoffed. “You are relentless.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked. “And you love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth—probably to deny it, probably to say something sharp and cutting—but before she could, someone suddenly appeared at their table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely held in a groan before turning to see a woman standing there, phone already in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate to bother you,” the woman continued, eyes wide with excitement, “but I’m such a huge fan. Could I get a picture?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, already pasting on a polite smile. It wasn’t the first time this had happened tonight. Probably wouldn’t be the last.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could answer, Agatha was already moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll give you a minute,” she said smoothly, grabbing her drink as she stood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time that night, Rio wasn’t entirely sure if she was winning or losing this little game they were playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the bar, nursing what was left of her drink as she waited for the bartender’s attention. The momentary reprieve from the table should have felt like a relief, but she still felt unsettled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not just because Rio had been in her space, pushing, teasing—flirting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And not just because Agatha had liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music thumped through the speakers, the low hum of conversation buzzing around her, but her mind was still stuck on the way Rio had leaned in close, voice low and inviting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled, shaking it off as she caught the bartender’s eye and started to order—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, suddenly, a hand brushed lightly against her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened before she even had time to think, a wave of heat rolling through her as she turned to find Rio standing beside her, her touch already gone, but the impression of it lingering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio said, voice smooth and easy, as if she hadn’t just branded Agatha with that one, simple touch. “Didn’t mean to startle you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t,” Agatha lied, shifting slightly, irritated by how aware she was of Rio’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, clearly not believing a word of it. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes but said nothing, turning back to the bar as the bartender approached.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slid into the space next to her, signaling for her own drink before tilting her head in Agatha’s direction. “So? Having fun yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “You mean aside from the part where strangers keep interrupting to take a picture with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leaning her elbow on the bar. “That is part of the experience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How unfortunate for you,” Agatha said dryly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I could be worse. I could be dragging you to the dance floor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look. “You already tried that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“True.” Rio grinned. “But since that didn’t work…” She paused, then tipped her head toward the bartender. “Two shots of tequila.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to her with a mock-wounded look. “Come on, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just one shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s your birthday weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed sharply. “That is not a reason to subject myself to tequila.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, watching her. “I think you’re just scared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Of what, exactly?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That you won’t be able to handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp, humorless laugh. “</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>. I can handle my alcohol.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really?” Rio leaned in slightly, her voice lower now, knowing, teasing. “Then prove it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her gaze, her pride flaring just enough to make her teeth clench.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew exactly what Rio was doing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was working.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, then turned to the bartender. “Make it double.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows lifted in delighted surprise, her grin widening as the bartender set up their shots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” Rio mused, reaching for the salt. “Look at you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare as she grabbed a lime wedge. “Don’t patronize me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, grabbing a lime for herself before lifting her shot glass. “All right, then. Ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her shoulders, lifting her own shot. “More than you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Now that’s what I like to hear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, together, they knocked back the first shot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tequila burned on the way down, smooth but with just enough bite to make it interesting. Rio hummed in approval, licking the salt from her lips before reaching for the lime wedge. She popped it into her mouth, grinning as the tartness hit her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Across from her, Agatha placed her shot glass down with a decisive clink, every movement controlled, deliberate—like she was determined to prove that tequila had no effect on her whatsoever. But Rio had been around enough people to recognize the subtle signs. The way Agatha’s shoulders had loosened just a fraction. The faintest warmth in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, most telling of all, the fact that she hadn’t walked away yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, tapping her fingers against the bar. “Round two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a dry look. “You said one shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I?” Rio feigned innocence. “I don’t recall that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed but didn’t protest when the bartender poured again. Rio watched her as they took the second shot, noting the way Agatha exhaled slightly slower this time, the way her lips parted just a fraction as the warmth settled in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, this was fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really don’t do this often, huh?” Rio teased, propping her elbow on the bar as she turned to face Agatha fully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dabbed at the corner of her mouth with a napkin, giving her a look. “What gave it away?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “You’re tense. Even now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> tense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t argue. She just lifted a brow, then reached out and placed her hands on Agatha’s shoulders, giving a light, knowing squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back a laugh, but her smirk was impossible to hide. “Oh? What was that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha said quickly, straightening as if that would somehow erase what just happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, this was very interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her hands drift lower, smoothing over the line of Agatha’s shoulders, thumbs pressing just slightly into the fabric of her dress. She could feel the tension there—Agatha really didn’t know how to relax, did she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands drifted down Agatha’s arms, fingers barely ghosting over her forearms before skimming lower, teasing, testing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha let her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the kicker. Not just that she allowed it, but that Rio could see how it affected her. Could feel the shiver that ran through her, the way her breath caught just slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you like it,” Rio murmured, letting her fingertips brush the inside of Agatha’s wrist, slow and deliberate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head just enough to meet her gaze, her expression unreadable. “I think you think you’re a lot smoother than you actually are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, undeterred. “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb dragged lazily over Agatha’s pulse point, feeling the faint, quick beat beneath her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in slightly, just enough to make it feel like a challenge. “I knew you were trouble,” Agatha muttered, though her voice was lacking its usual sharpness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, definitely,” Rio murmured back. “But you love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t have to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way she stood still beneath Rio’s touch, the way she hadn’t pulled away yet—that was answer enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had never been the patient type.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She liked to move fast, feel things in real time, act on them before they slipped away. But with Agatha, she found herself savoring the moment—stretching it, pulling at the edges just to see how far she could go before Agatha pushed back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only… Agatha wasn’t pushing back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not really.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sure, she was trying to pretend like she wasn’t affected—like Rio’s touch, her teasing, the way she leaned in just enough wasn’t sending shivers down her spine—but Rio could see it. Could feel it in the way Agatha’s body kept betraying her, in the way her pulse fluttered under her fingertips, in the way her breath hitched whenever Rio got too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was why Rio decided to take it a step further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, tell me something,” she said, tilting her head, studying Agatha’s face as she sipped her drink. “When was the last time you went on a date?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A date,” Rio repeated, grinning. “Dinner, drinks, maybe a little music in the background. You do date, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Of course I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed. “So when was the last time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. Just for a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she recovered. “That’s none of your business.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, taking another sip of her drink. “That long, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare. “I’ve been busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio drawled, amused. “Teaching, composing, raising a kid. Very noble, Harkness. But, uh…” She leaned in, lowering her voice just a little. “That doesn’t really answer my question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, eyes flicking away for a moment before landing back on Rio, like she was trying to decide how much to give away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she said, “A couple of years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brows lifted in surprise. “Damn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Like I said, I’ve been busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied her for a moment, then asked, deliberately casual, “What about before that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned slightly. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Just curious. I mean, you seem pretty… controlled. Like you don’t let people get too close. So was that a pattern or…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, catching onto something in her tone. “What exactly are you trying to ask?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled innocently. “Nothing. Just wondering what kind of person catches Agatha Harkness’s eye.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, her breath a little unsteady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw it—the way she hesitated, like the question wasn’t just unexpected, but… complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha set her glass down on the bar with a deliberate motion and turned fully to face Rio. “What exactly are you asking, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, their faces close—so close—before grinning and pulling back just a little. “Relax, Harkness. I just like knowing what I’m up against.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, but there was a new tension in her posture now, something defensive, uncertain. “You’re not up against anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just smiled. “We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was rattled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could see it—the way she squared her shoulders, the way she suddenly seemed too aware of every inch of space between them. And then there was the way she reached for her drink a little too quickly, as if she needed something to do with her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was fascinating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Rio let her be. She didn’t push, didn’t crowd her. Not yet. Instead, she let the moment settle, taking a slow sip of her own drink as she let Agatha wrestle with whatever thoughts were swirling in that sharp mind of hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Agatha cleared her throat. “And what about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted an eyebrow. “What about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flickered to her, calculating. “What kind of person catches your eye?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That made Rio grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I have a type,” she said easily. “Women.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers stilled on her glass. Just for a second, but Rio caught it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow smirk tugged at Rio’s lips as she leaned in slightly, watching Agatha’s reaction. “I mean, I thought I was bi once. A long time ago. Turns out I just hadn’t figured myself out yet.” She shrugged, taking another sip of her drink. “I like women. Always have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a noise, something half scoff, half exhale, and Rio wasn’t sure if it was amusement or something else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio pressed just a little further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you?” she asked, tone deliberately casual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated—just long enough for Rio to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Agatha started, then stopped herself. She exhaled, shaking her head like she was annoyed with herself, before finally muttering, “It’s complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, slow and knowing. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around her glass. “I don’t—” She let out a breath, like she was debating whether to even entertain this conversation, before finally meeting Rio’s gaze again. “I kissed a woman once.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was said in such a carefully neutral way that Rio had to bite back a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just once?” Rio mused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “It was a long time ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, close enough that their knees brushed. “And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “And what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped lower. “Did you like it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them was thick now, charged with something neither of them had fully acknowledged before tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha parted her lips like she wanted to answer, but nothing came out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the way her throat bobbed, the way her fingers twitched slightly where they rested on the bar. And that—that tiny reaction—was what did it for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe more than she wanted to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the realization sent a thrill through Rio’s spine, something sharp and satisfying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tilted her head, studying Agatha for a long moment, then finally leaned back slightly, easing the pressure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know,” she murmured, before taking another sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply, like she’d just realized she’d been holding her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio just smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let the silence stretch between them, the weight of it pressing against the charged air. Agatha was looking at her with something unreadable in those sharp, stormy eyes—something caught between irritation and curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew that look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the look of someone who had spent years building walls, only to realize that someone else had slipped past them without permission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was more than happy to be that someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took another slow sip of her drink, watching as Agatha did the same, though there was an almost imperceptible shake in her fingers. Not nervousness, exactly. More like—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You ever wonder why it was just the once?” Rio asked casually, setting her glass down and shifting slightly closer, just enough that Agatha would feel the heat of her body next to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, tilting her head. “Not even a little?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, setting her own drink down with a little more force than necessary. “You ask a lot of questions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like to know things.” Rio let her fingers trail lightly against the bar between them, casual and slow. “Especially when I find something that interests me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, shaking her head like she was trying to dislodge the moment itself. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “I’ve been told.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her body slightly, as if she was about to put more distance between them—but then someone brushed past behind her, making her shift instinctively closer to Rio instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither did Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they just stayed like that, close enough that Rio could feel the warmth of Agatha’s skin through the thin material of her blouse. Close enough that she could see the rapid rise and fall of Agatha’s chest, the way her pulse jumped just slightly at the base of her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It would be so easy to reach out. To run her fingers down Agatha’s arm, just to see if she’d shiver. To tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear, just to watch her breath hitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she wanted to see if Agatha would let herself stay in this moment a little longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t make some sharp remark to cut through the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just stayed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that—</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the most thrilling thing of all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let the moment stretch a little longer, just to see if Agatha would bolt. But she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Agatha swallowed hard and reached for her drink again, like she needed something to anchor herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. Gotcha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned in slightly, dropping her voice just enough to make it impossible to ignore. “So… are you going to let me convince you to dance now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look, something caught between exasperation and—intrigue. “I already told you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, I know.” Rio waved a hand. “You don’t do crowds. You don’t like clubs. You don’t—” She made a vague gesture. “—dance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t confirm or deny, just exhaled sharply, looking toward the dance floor where their friends were lost in the shifting, writhing bodies. The music pulsed, steady and rhythmic, the bass thrumming through the walls and floor like a heartbeat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her watch for a moment before speaking again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t have to be in the middle of all that,” she said, voice softer now, coaxing. “We can stay on the edge. Just the two of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back to her, wary. “That’s still dancing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “It is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, fingers tapping lightly against the side of her glass. Her gaze flickered to the dance floor again, then back to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was thinking about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Considering it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took one more step, closing the last of the space between them. She lifted a hand, fingers barely skimming over the inside of Agatha’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just a brush. A whisper of contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked in a breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio felt it—the slight tremor in her pulse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up, catching Agatha’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Rio said, her voice low and warm, coaxing. “I’ll lead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just stared at Rio, her fingers tightening slightly around her glass as if she were considering all the possible ways this could go wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when Rio tilted her head toward the dance floor in silent invitation, Agatha exhaled, slow and measured, and set her drink down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a word. Just quiet surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curled into a satisfied smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached for Agatha’s hand, her fingers sliding over hers, warm and steady. Agatha stiffened at first—like even this small touch unsettled her—but she didn’t resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio led her, weaving them through the crowd until they reached a darkened corner of the dance floor, just out of the thickest part of the mass of moving bodies. The music pulsed around them, bass thrumming low and steady, the air thick with heat and motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Here, away from the flashing lights and prying eyes, they had a sliver of privacy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to face Agatha, still holding her hand, but she didn’t move just yet. She just watched her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked tense, unsure. Her eyes darted toward the crowd, then back to Rio, her chest rising and falling in slow, measured breaths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was fighting herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio made it easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slid one hand lightly to Agatha’s waist, just barely grazing the fabric of her blouse, and leaned in slightly, her voice a warm murmur in the space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just follow me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, something flickering behind her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed her hand once—just enough to anchor her—and then she moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slow at first, swaying to the rhythm, guiding Agatha into motion. Nothing dramatic, nothing overwhelming—just enough for her to feel the music. To feel her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was stiff at first, hesitant. But then Rio slid her hand from Agatha’s waist to her lower back, a slow, deliberate touch, and suddenly, Agatha inhaled sharply—like the heat between them had finally registered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There you go,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the precise moment Agatha gave in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t dramatic. There was no grand shift, no sudden boldness. Just the slow, almost reluctant way her body loosened under Rio’s hands. The way her breath hitched when Rio guided her just a little closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was subtle—but Rio noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha was aware of her now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her hands skim slightly, her touch never demanding, just there, a steady presence at Agatha’s waist. And Agatha, instead of pulling away, let it happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her movements were still hesitant, but she was swaying now, following Rio’s rhythm, letting herself feel the music instead of fighting it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp inhale. A ripple of tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Goosebumps, breaking out beneath Rio’s fingertips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, that was interesting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her lips curve, slow and knowing, as she dipped her head just slightly, lowering her voice enough that it was nearly lost in the pulse of the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See?” she said near Agatha’s ear. “Not so bad, is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shivered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not dramatically. Not in a way anyone else would have noticed. But Rio felt it, felt the way Agatha’s breath went just a little unsteady, the way her fingers curled faintly at her sides, like she was holding herself back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> holding herself back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio… liked that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liked the tension thrumming between them, the push and pull of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Liked the way Agatha—</span>
<em>
<span>controlled, composed Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>—was coming apart in the smallest, most delicious ways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely had time to process the shift before it happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not abruptly. Not in some bold, decisive move. But with a slowness that felt deliberate, almost experimental—like she was testing the feeling of it, seeing how it fit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she settled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back to Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught, fingers tightening just slightly where they rested at Agatha’s waist. She felt the steady rise and fall of Agatha’s breathing, the warmth of her against her front, the way she had—whether consciously or not—given in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio—God help her—wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanted to press closer. Wanted to dip her head, let her lips ghost along the elegant line of Agatha’s throat. Wanted to see just how far Agatha would let her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she exhaled slowly, steadying herself, fingers splaying wider against Agatha’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shift, a press, a gentle pull that had Agatha swaying just slightly deeper into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, that was good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The beat thrummed around them, loud and insistent, but all Rio could hear was the rush of blood in her ears, the unspoken tension between them stretching tight, tight, tighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was letting this happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t shying away, wasn’t stiff or uncertain. She was moving with Rio now, trusting her body to follow the music, trusting Rio’s hands at her waist, trusting—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely bit back a groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she didn’t want to stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, a slow, controlled breath, but Rio could feel the tension in it. Could feel the way her body responded, the subtle press of her spine against Rio’s front as she moved in perfect time with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was intoxicating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of her, the warmth of her, the way her fingers twitched slightly at her sides like she wasn’t quite sure what to do with them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted to fix that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let one hand slide just a little lower, settling at the curve of Agatha’s hip, fingertips pressing lightly—not demanding, just there. Just a suggestion, an invitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t tense, didn’t turn, didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If anything, she leaned in, just the barest amount. Enough that Rio felt it, enough that her breath hitched slightly against the back of Agatha’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had danced with people before. Had done this exact thing countless times in clubs, on tour, at parties.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was </span>
<em>
<span>different</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was Agatha Harkness—the woman who’d spent the last several weeks looking at her like she was a problem she didn’t want to solve, who seemed to thrive on keeping Rio at a distance, on maintaining control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And right now, she was letting go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it was the tequila, maybe it was the music, maybe it was something else entirely, but Rio wasn’t about to question it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she dipped her head slightly, lips just shy of Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re good at this,” she murmured, voice low, meant just for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a sound—something almost like a scoff, but it was breathless. “I can follow a rhythm, Vidal. That shouldn’t surprise you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Didn’t say I was surprised. Just impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, but Rio caught it—the tiny shiver that ran through her, the way the goosebumps rose on her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was affecting her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>, if that wasn’t a dangerous kind of thrill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was about to say something else, some teasing remark about how she hadn’t expected Agatha to be such a natural at this, but then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not to push it away. Not to break the contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No—Agatha’s fingers curled over Rio’s where they rested on her hip, keeping them there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a big movement. It wasn’t grand or dramatic. But it was deliberate. It was intentional.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it sent a bolt of heat through Rio’s spine, a slow, curling thing that settled low in her belly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept moving, still perfectly in time with the music, but Rio could feel it now—the way her breathing had changed, the way she had stopped overthinking every movement and had given in to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Given in to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers flexed slightly under Agatha’s, just a test, just to see if she’d pull away. But she didn’t. If anything, her grip tightened, like she wanted Rio to stay right there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Who was Rio to deny her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Emboldened, she let her other hand slide up just slightly, fingers tracing the curve of Agatha’s waist, feeling the heat of her through the fabric of her blouse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See?” Rio murmured, voice lower now, rougher. “Told you I’d make you loosen up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled a breath—sharp, quick, but not annoyed. Not reprimanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t even sure if she meant to do it, but she leaned back, just slightly, just enough that her shoulder blades pressed against Rio’s chest, her head tilting a fraction of an inch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Rio turned her head just a little, she could touch her lips to the sensitive spot just beneath Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought was dangerous. Tempting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers flexed against Agatha’s hip again, tighter this time, instinctive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And still—Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely let herself breathe as she shifted her hand, just enough to brush her fingers between Agatha’s. Just enough to—</span>
</p><p>
<span>There.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their fingers slotted together, slow and unhurried, and Agatha let her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t tense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If anything, she pressed back into her—not consciously, maybe, but Rio felt it. The way Agatha’s body molded against her, the way she let the weight of her settle into Rio’s front, moving in perfect time with her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus fucking Christ.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath, tightening her grip on Agatha’s hand, grounding herself before she lost every ounce of restraint she had left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel everything now—the heat of Agatha against her, the way their bodies moved as one, the way her jeans clung to the curves Rio wanted to touch—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she couldn’t push. Not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So instead, she let her other arm move, wrapping around Agatha’s waist in a slow, deliberate motion, pulling her as close as humanly possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around Rio’s instinctively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, she smelled good—some expensive perfume, subtle but heady, mixed with the faintest trace of the whiskey she’d been drinking earlier. Rio wanted to bury her face in the crook of her neck, wanted to press her lips to the spot just beneath her jaw and see if she’d shiver—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clenched her jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tread carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t think you’d let me get this close,” she said in her ear instead, her voice rougher than she meant it to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched. Just barely, but Rio caught it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Agatha started, then stopped. Swallowed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited. Let the silence stretch, let her make the next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t stiffen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just—kept moving with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio—Rio could work with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio was losing her fucking mind.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She’d lost all sense of time. Had no idea how long she’d had Agatha in her arms. All she knew was that Agatha was soft against her, warm and impossibly close, her body moving in a way that felt deliberate now—like she was no longer fighting it, no longer overthinking. Like she was just feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio was feeling too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She clenched her jaw, trying to keep her own reactions in check, but then—then Agatha shifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small thing. Barely even a movement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But </span>
<em>
<span>Jesus Christ.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her ass pressed right against Rio’s front, the slow grind of her hips sending a bolt of heat straight through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost groaned—almost—but she bit it back at the last second, letting out a sharp breath instead, gripping Agatha’s waist tighter because she had to. Because if she didn’t—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She let her palm slide, just a fraction of an inch, fingertips ghosting over the curve of Agatha’s hip, pressing just enough to feel her, just enough to test the waters—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t stiffen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If anything—if anything—she leaned into it, just slightly, just enough to make Rio’s pulse fucking skyrocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay. Okay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could work with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips parted, her breath warm against the side of Agatha’s neck as she let her hand drift lower, her thumb tracing the edge of fabric over her hip, dragging over the silk of her blouse like she was memorizing the feel of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, sharp and unsteady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I gotta say,” she murmured, voice thick with heat, “for someone who didn’t want to dance, you’re doing an amazing job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a noise—half breath, half scoff—and Rio felt it more than she heard it, the way her shoulders shifted, the way her body reacted—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Agatha did something unexpected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She squeezed Rio’s fingers. Deliberately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small permission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that—that nearly wrecked her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, her heart hammering in her chest, her entire body thrumming with the sheer effort it took to not push further, not just—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But more than that—more than anything—she wanted Agatha to want her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she loosened her grip—just slightly—giving her space, just in case, giving her a moment to step away, to change her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t think she’d ever wanted anything as badly as she wanted this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she wanted Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The music pulsed around them, the world beyond the dance floor a blur of flashing lights and bodies moving in time with the beat. But all of it—all of it—faded into nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because there was only this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only the slow, deliberate way she was letting Rio hold her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only the way her fingers stayed tangled with Rio’s, the way her breath hitched whenever Rio’s grip tightened, the way her body melted just so against her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s blood was on fire, her heart pounding against her ribs as she let herself sink further, let herself breathe Agatha in, let herself feel every damn thing she’d been trying to keep at bay all night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted again, her back pressing even closer to Rio’s front, her body aligning perfectly with hers, the heat of her, the scent of her, making Rio’s pulse skyrocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even think.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t hesitate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t care about anything beyond the sheer, overwhelming need clawing its way through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she leaned in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Deliberately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Letting her lips brush against the bare skin of Agatha’s neck, right over the spot where her pulse beat beneath her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And fuck, Agatha felt it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Felt her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because the second Rio’s lips met her skin, Agatha shuddered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A full-body reaction, sharp and unguarded, her breath catching in her throat—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—then she groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A low, quiet sound, barely audible over the music, but Rio heard it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Felt it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanted more of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip on Agatha’s waist tightened instinctively, her other hand squeezing Agatha’s fingers, grounding herself even as her lips brushed again, just slightly firmer this time, testing—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t tense.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If anything—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She relaxed into it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was done for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was losing her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right here, on this dance floor, in the middle of a crowded club, she was losing her fucking mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Agatha—</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha fucking Harkness</span>
</em>
<span>—was still here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still pressed against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still letting this happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Deliberately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Turned in Rio’s arms until they were face to face, their bodies still impossibly close, their breaths mingling in the charged space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she was beautiful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even in the dim, shifting lights of the club, Rio could see her—could see the way her lips parted slightly, the way her pupils were blown wide, the way a flush had crept up her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Could feel her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The warmth of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tension in her muscles, like she was fighting herself, like she wasn’t sure if she should stay or run.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t giving her the chance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands found Agatha’s waist again, pulling her in, until there was nothing left between them, until Agatha’s hips were flush against hers—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And fuck, Rio’s body reacted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Reacted to the press of her, to the heat of her, to the sheer, maddening fact that this was real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to squeeze her thighs together, had to grip Agatha’s hips tighter, had to press closer, just to keep herself from spontaneously combusting right then and there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt it against her lips, the faintest exhale, shaky and unsure—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she couldn’t help herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Couldn’t hold back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dipped her head just slightly, just enough to ghost her lips along the sharp line of Agatha’s jaw, lingering for a single, heart-stopping second—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before trailing lower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before pressing a kiss—a real one this time—against the elegant curve of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And fuck, fuck, fuck, Agatha let her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More than that—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reacted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A full-body shudder, a sharp inhale, her fingers twitching against Rio’s arms—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then her hand was in Rio’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Warm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tentative at first, but then firmer, bolder, threading through the strands, tugging just slightly—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio nearly moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nearly fucking lost it, right there in the middle of the club, because Agatha’s other arm was around her now, pulling her in, her grip tightening around her waist—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And their hips—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their hips aligned again, perfectly, maddeningly, and Rio—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was done for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to kiss her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Had to.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was beyond reason, beyond control—this was instinct, gravity, the kind of pull she had no hope of resisting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was in her arms, pressed against her, warm and solid and wanting, her breath ghosting over Rio’s lips, her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, her body flush against her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was going to </span>
<em>
<span>fucking combust.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>So she moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Closed the last inch of space between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pressed her lips to Agatha’s like it was the only thing keeping her alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And holy shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was—</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soft and heated, a quiet inhale from Agatha, like she hadn’t expected it, like she hadn’t realized how much she wanted it until it was happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed Rio back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If these were her last moments on this Earth, Rio would die a happy, happy woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because this kiss wasn’t tentative. It wasn’t uncertain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, it was slow and deep, like Agatha was letting herself fall into it, her body melting against Rio’s, her fingers curling tighter in Rio’s hair, her lips parting just enough—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft, breathy sound, barely there—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio felt it like a lightning strike, all the way down to her fucking bones.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned against Agatha’s mouth, her grip on her waist tightening, her fingers pressing into soft curves as she pulled her in deeper, needing, needing, needing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse was a goddamn drumline, her body burning, the heat between them unbearable, perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tasted like whiskey and warmth and something dangerous, something intoxicating, something Rio never wanted to stop drinking from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha wasn’t stopping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wasn’t pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was leaning into it, pressing closer, her body yielding, her hands gripping Rio’s back, her nails scraping against fabric, her tongue playing with hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was dizzy, undone, lost in the way their mouths moved together, in the quiet, breathy gasps between them, in the way Agatha’s hips shifted just so against her own—</span>
</p><p>
<span>And fuck, fuck, fuck—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was going to lose her goddamn mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Impact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone slammed into them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not just a casual brush, not just a drunken stumble—</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, this was a full-on, forceful collision, a sudden, jarring shove that sent them both reeling, Agatha gasping as she jerked away from Rio’s lips like she’d been burned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her entire body tensed instantly, like reality had just slammed back into her at full force.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely managed to catch her balance, one hand still on Agatha’s waist, the other reaching instinctively to steady her, but the moment—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Erased by the press of bodies, the pounding bass, the drunken apology muttered in their direction before the person disappeared back into the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath came fast, her chest rising and falling against Rio’s, her lips still parted—kiss-bruised, fuck, Rio wanted to kiss her again, wanted to pull her right back in and keep going, keep going—</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha took a step back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just a small one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A half-inch of space, but it felt enormous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes were wide, shocked, like she couldn’t quite process what had just happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she couldn’t believe she’d let it happen at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew that look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Knew the second the spell had broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Knew that Agatha was about to run.</span>
</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A sharp jolt of reality crashed over Agatha as someone bumped into them, breaking the spell. The press of Rio’s lips against hers, the intoxicating heat of her body—gone in an instant.</p><p>Agatha stumbled back, her breath ragged, her heart hammering violently against her ribs like it was trying to escape her chest. The world around them hadn’t changed—bodies still swayed to the music, the bass still thrummed beneath her feet, neon lights still cast shifting shadows across the club. And yet, everything felt different.</p><p>Because she had just kissed Rio Vidal.</p><p>No. She had let Rio kiss her.</p><p>And worse—she had kissed her back.</p><p>Not just kissed—she had melted into her. She had let Rio’s hands guide her, let her touch, pull, press until there had been nothing in the world but them and the pounding of the music. Until her control had been nothing but a distant memory.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, suddenly hyperaware of just where they were. This wasn’t some darkened corner where no one would notice. This was a club in the middle of Los Angeles, where Rio Vidal—world-famous rockstar, beloved public figure, scandal magnet—had just kissed her in plain sight.</p><p>What the hell had she done?</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up to Rio, who was watching her with a look Agatha didn’t dare name. She looked…wrecked. Her lips were parted, still kiss-bruised, her pupils blown wide in the dim light. The heat between them hadn’t dissipated. If anything, it thickened, pressing against Agatha like a second skin.</p><p>She had to put a stop to this.</p><p>“Do you think that’s wise, Vidal?” Her voice was low, clipped, but the warning was unmistakable.</p><p>Rio blinked, still dazed, then smirked—an automatic reaction, but the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes betrayed her. “I think it was inevitable.”</p><p>Inevitable.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse stuttered at the word. “We are in public.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk faltered just slightly, then she shrugged, shoving her hands into her pockets like she hadn’t just been holding Agatha against her like she never wanted to let go. “So?”</p><p>“So?” Agatha repeated, incredulous. “You are Rio Vidal. This is a club in the middle of Los Angeles, and I—” She exhaled sharply, raking a hand through her hair, trying to regain some semblance of control. “I am not someone who enjoys being in the spotlight.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment. “Agatha—”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shook her head, ignoring the way Rio saying her name made her stomach twist. “This can’t happen.”</p><p>Something flickered across Rio’s face—something careful, something guarded. “Because you don’t want it to?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then hesitated.</p><p>The truth was a complicated, tangled mess of want and fear, of what-ifs and impossibilities.</p><p>She wanted Rio. That much was undeniable. The ghost of her lips, the heat of her body still lingered, and Agatha knew—knew—if she gave in again, if she let Rio close just one more time, she wouldn’t stop.</p><p>But wanting wasn’t the same as being able to have.</p><p>And Rio—damn her—was entirely too perceptive.</p><p>None of that mattered. Not when she could still feel the weight of a hundred what-ifs pressing against her ribs, not when she was standing here unraveling in the middle of a club with no escape.</p><p>She straightened her spine, forcing her voice into something cool, detached. “Because it would be a mistake.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. “Right.”</p><p>The word was clipped, sharp in a way that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>For a split second, she wanted to take it back. She wanted to grab Rio by the collar and pull her in again, to feel the way she had made her feel just moments ago—reckless, breathless, alive.</p><p>But Agatha had spent a lifetime mastering control.</p><p>And she refused to let one impulsive moment unravel her.</p><p>So she turned, pushing past the crowd, ignoring the way her entire body protested the distance she was putting between them.</p><p>She needed air.</p><p>She needed control.</p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped onto the balcony, the cool night air hitting her like a slap to the face. It wasn’t enough to extinguish the fire beneath her skin, but it was something—a sharp contrast to the heat that still lingered from the dance floor, from Rio.</p><p>She exhaled hard, gripping the metal railing with both hands. Below her, the city stretched out in a shimmering sprawl, car headlights weaving through the streets like tiny currents of light. The club’s music thumped faintly through the walls behind her, but out here, it was quieter. Calmer.</p><p>A lie.</p><p>She was anything but calm.</p><p>Her pulse was still erratic, her lips still tingling from the way Rio had kissed her—hungry, consuming, like she’d been waiting for it just as much as Agatha had. And Agatha had wanted it. She had wanted it in a way that terrified her.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to breathe. She should’ve stopped it before it happened. She should’ve stepped away when their bodies got too close, when Rio’s hands started straying, when her own fingers tightened around Rio’s as if she never wanted to let go.</p><p>But she hadn’t.</p><p>And worse, she had liked it.</p><p>No—she had loved it.</p><p>The realization sent a shiver through her that had nothing to do with the night air.</p><p>This was dangerous.</p><p>Everything about tonight had been a reckless departure from the carefully constructed life she had built. She had rules, boundaries. And Rio Vidal didn’t just blur them—she shattered them entirely.</p><p>A musician. A public figure. A woman.</p><p>Agatha had spent a lifetime keeping herself in check, controlling her emotions, her desires. But Rio had a way of undoing her in mere seconds.</p><p>And it wasn’t just about Rio.</p><p>Mia was her student.</p><p>Nicky idolized her.</p><p>If this went too far—if she let herself fall—she wouldn’t be the only one who got caught in the mess.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, tilting her head back to stare at the inky sky. The stars were faint against the city’s glow, barely visible. Fitting, really.</p><p>She needed to end this before it started.</p><p>She needed to find her control again.</p><p>And yet, despite everything, her body still ached for Rio’s touch.</p><p>Agatha heard the door creak open behind her, followed by the quiet click of it shutting again. She didn’t turn. Didn’t need to.</p><p>She already knew who it was.</p><p>The air shifted as Rio stepped up beside her, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her body, even in the cool night breeze. But she didn’t touch her. Didn’t push. Not yet.</p><p>For a moment, the only sound was the distant bass thumping through the walls of the club, muffled laughter from inside. Out here, though, it was quieter. More dangerous.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“You always run when you don’t like the way something makes you feel?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly through her nose, keeping her gaze fixed on the city lights. “You always chase after things you shouldn’t have?”</p><p>A pause. Then a soft chuckle. “Maybe.”</p><p>Agatha tightened her fingers around the railing, grounding herself. “Then you should work on that.”</p><p>“Not really my style,” Rio said easily. She shifted, leaning against the rail with one hip, turning slightly so she could watch Agatha more closely. “You’re rattled.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“You’re lying.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled, slow and measured, before finally turning her head to meet Rio’s gaze. The way Rio was looking at her now—steady, searching, knowing—it made something coil tight in her chest. Like she was a lock Rio was already halfway to picking.</p><p>Agatha hated how much she wanted to be figured out.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have followed me out here,” she said, her voice quieter now, tinged with something she didn’t want to name.</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Why not?”</p><p>Agatha turned back toward the city, focusing on the skyline, on the distant lights blinking in the dark. Anything but the way Rio was watching her. “Because you’re reckless. Because you don’t think about the consequences of your actions. Because—”</p><p>“Because you liked it,” Rio cut in, voice low, certain. “Because it scared you.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, but the sharp breath she took in gave her away.</p><p>Rio noticed.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>“Do you think that’s wise, Vidal?” she asked again, her voice colder than she felt.</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered down to her lips for the briefest moment before she smirked. “Probably not.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to stay still as Rio shifted again, angling her body just enough that their arms nearly brushed. That same electricity from before crackled between them, an unbearable awareness, a pull Agatha didn’t know how to fight.</p><p>She needed to shut this down. Needed to make it clear that whatever had happened in there—whatever this was—it wasn’t happening again.</p><p>And yet, her body betrayed her.</p><p>Her breath came a little faster. Her fingers twitched against the railing.</p><p>Rio noticed that too.</p><p>And she was entirely too pleased about it.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was pounding so loud, she could hear it in her ears. She hadn’t been expecting this—any of this—but now that it was happening, she couldn’t bring herself to walk away.</p><p>She felt the subtle shift in the air before Rio even moved, the slight change in the energy between them. Rio had that way of drawing you in, like gravity itself couldn’t keep her away. When Rio touched her arm, Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. It was a small touch, a light graze of fingers against her skin, but it was enough to make her body shiver.</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away, though—couldn’t pull away. It was like she was locked in place, caught between two forces she couldn’t explain. She didn’t have to look at Rio’s face to know what was happening. She felt it in the way Rio’s fingers were delicate against her, but also assertive. The way she was speaking now—low and teasing, like they were the only two people in the world.</p><p>“You can fight it all you want, you know,” Rio whispered, her voice like a soft caress. “But eventually, it’s gonna catch up with you.”</p><p>Agatha knew that. She felt it. But still, she didn’t know what to do with the undeniable pull that was building between them. She’d never been one to give in to impulses. She was controlled. Measured.</p><p>And yet here she was, every fiber of her being screaming at her to walk away, to keep her distance, but she couldn’t. Rio was just too close. Her voice was just too tempting.</p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, feeling a rush of heat bloom on her cheeks. She was too aware of how much her body was reacting to Rio, to the way her touch felt like a spark that ignited something inside of her. But still, she fought to keep her focus.</p><p>Rio, however, wasn’t having any of it. Her fingers drifted down her arm, touching her with the lightest, almost absentminded grace. Agatha’s breath caught again, her pulse quickening as Rio moved even closer, until her hand reached up to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. The brush of Rio’s fingers against her neck felt like a jolt of electricity, and Agatha’s body instantly responded—tighter, warmer, every nerve alive and buzzing in a way she couldn’t control.</p><p>“Let go,” Rio murmured.</p><p>It was a command wrapped in a whisper, soft but clear, and Agatha was suddenly aware of how close they were. Rio was standing so close now that their bodies were almost touching. The air was heavy with the weight of their proximity, and for a split second, Agatha could’ve sworn Rio was leaning in.</p><p>And she did lean in.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s lips ghosted over the curve of her jaw. The lightest touch, barely there, but it set Agatha’s heart racing.</p><p>She froze, unsure what to do. The kiss wasn’t anything but a gentle trace of skin, but it was enough to make her stomach flip, to make her feel like she was in freefall. She wanted more.</p><p>Her mind screamed for control, for clarity, but her body wasn’t listening. Her hand moved on its own, reaching for Rio, just barely touching her shoulder, her fingers trembling against the soft fabric of Rio’s jacket. She couldn’t stop herself. There was something magnetic in the way Rio was pulling her in, and despite every instinct that told her to fight it, Agatha found herself leaning into the touch.</p><p>It was impossible to stop.</p><p>Rio’s lips moved, pressing against her skin once more, this time lingering on her pulse point. The sensation was enough to make Agatha’s breath catch in her throat, a soft groan slipping from her lips before she could stop it. It was involuntary, like a reflex, and the sound of it made her heart race even faster.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were shaking as she reached for Rio’s waist, her fingers brushing against the smoothness of her leather jacket. It was like every inch of her body was aware of the heat between them, of the growing pressure building with every passing second. But when Rio pulled her even closer, when their bodies pressed against each other, Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Rio’s hips shifted, pushing into hers with a quiet but unmistakable urgency. The instant their hips aligned, Agatha’s world tilted. The feeling was electric, primal. She felt her entire body respond, the sudden friction sending a pulse of heat straight to her core. And when Rio let out a low, throaty moan in her ear—God, the sound—Agatha’s breath hitched again, her body trembling at the feel of Rio’s heat pressing against her.</p><p>Her heart was in her throat now, her head spinning. It was like nothing else mattered. The moment was all-encompassing, pulling her deeper into Rio’s orbit with every brush of skin, every shared breath.</p><p>And then—Agatha gave in.</p><p>With a shaking hand, she grabbed Rio’s jacket, pulling her even closer, not caring that her heart was hammering, not caring that every instinct told her she was crossing a line. Rio was there, she was real, and Agatha was lost in the pull of her.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She moved in closer, capturing Agatha’s lips with hers in a kiss that was fierce, urgent, and desperate. Their mouths collided with a force that left Agatha breathless, her hands finding the soft curve of Rio’s waist and pulling her even closer. There was no space left between them now. The kiss deepened, Agatha responding with a hunger she didn’t know she had until that very moment.</p><p>Rio groaned against her lips, the sound of it sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>And it was like everything inside Agatha snapped. All of her carefully constructed walls, all of her doubts—they shattered under the intensity of the kiss, under the heat of Rio’s body against hers.</p><p>Rio’s hands roamed, one slipping to the back of Agatha’s neck, pulling her in even closer, while the other rested against her lower back, pressing her into the pulse of Rio’s body. Agatha couldn’t stop herself now—she was all in.</p><p>The kiss was everything—frantic, needy, a collision of desire and desperation. And when Rio’s body pressed even tighter against hers, Agatha nearly lost it. The sensation of Rio’s body aligned with hers, their hearts racing in unison, made Agatha feel like she was on fire.</p><p>Agatha was lost in the moment, her mind swimming in a fog of desire and heat. Every inch of her body was pressed up against Rio’s, the kiss deepening with each passing second, every part of her burning as Rio’s hands roamed and pulled her in closer. Agatha’s body responded without thought, moving with Rio’s in perfect harmony, as if their very souls had aligned in this moment of undeniable connection.</p><p>But then, just as Agatha felt herself about to lose herself completely, the sharp, sudden crack of a car backfiring broke through the silence. The noise was so unexpected, so jarring, that Agatha jumped in shock, pulling away from Rio instinctively.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest as the world around her snapped back into focus. The rush of adrenaline that had filled her moments ago was replaced with a sudden, suffocating clarity. She stared at Rio, both of them breathing heavily, their lips swollen, their eyes wide with shock.</p><p>Rio blinked, her breath unsteady, and for a moment, she didn’t say anything. The silence hung between them, heavy and thick, filled with everything unsaid. Rio’s fingers lingered on Agatha’s waist, the warmth of her touch still a burning reminder of what had just transpired, but it felt like something had shifted.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, pulling her arms back, feeling a chill creeping over her skin despite the warmth of the night. She stepped back a little, her heart still racing, her mind reeling.</p><p>She couldn’t do this. She couldn’t do this with Rio Vidal. Not here, not now. It was all too much, too fast, too dangerous.</p><p>“This… this was a mistake,” Agatha whispered, her voice almost hoarse with the weight of it. She didn’t meet Rio’s eyes right away, instead looking out at the city lights below them, trying to steady her breath.</p><p>She could feel the space between them growing as Rio processed her words. The silence that followed was thick with unspoken tension.</p><p>Rio’s voice finally broke the stillness, softer than before, but with an edge of determination. “It doesn’t have to be, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha turned her gaze to Rio, her chest tight. “You don’t understand.” Her hands were shaking as she tried to find her words, struggling to voice the conflict that raged inside her. “I—I can’t be with you. It’s not just about you and me. You’re… Rio Vidal. You’re famous. And I—” She stopped herself, taking a deep breath. She couldn’t keep doing this to herself. “I can’t be in the public eye. Not again. Not after… everything.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, and she took a step forward, her voice steady and low. “You don’t have to be in the public eye, Agatha. Not for me. I’m not asking you to be. I’m not asking you to throw everything away for me. But I won’t lie to you—I want this. I want you.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, her heart aching with the weight of the words, but her fear still held tight. “But I’m not ready. I’m not ready for this… for…”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, taking a deep breath, her expression patient but no less intense. “Then take your time, Agatha. I’m not going anywhere. I can be patient.”</p><p>The words hit her harder than she’d expected, her heart squeezing in her chest. Rio’s eyes were sincere, soft, and for a moment, it almost felt like Rio was offering her something safe. But Agatha couldn’t quite trust that part of herself yet. She couldn’t trust that she could let go without losing control.</p><p>“I’m not good at letting go,” Agatha whispered, her voice fragile, breaking under the weight of it. “I don’t know how to do this. I’ve never been good at letting someone else in. Not like this.”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand gently, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s with a tenderness that made Agatha’s chest ache. “I get that. You don’t have to rush.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched at the sincerity in Rio’s words. She didn’t know what to say, didn’t know how to respond to that level of patience, of understanding. It wasn’t like Rio to be this patient, this… steady. But there it was, in the way Rio held her gaze, in the way she didn’t rush Agatha, didn’t push her for answers.</p><p>She couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing for something she didn’t even know she needed. And for the first time, she didn’t feel like she was being pulled in too many directions. She just felt held.</p><p>But even so, she couldn’t shake the fear, the uncertainty.</p><p>“I need time,” Agatha said softly, more to herself than to Rio, as she pulled her hand away. “I can’t promise anything right now.”</p><p>Rio smiled, though it was tinged with sadness. “I don’t need promises, Agatha. I just need you to be honest with me. And if you want space, I’ll give you space.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling a weight lift from her chest, though the uncertainty was still there, lingering between them like a fine thread pulling them together and yet holding them apart.</p><p>They stood there for a few moments, neither of them speaking, just feeling the weight of the moment. Agatha knew she hadn’t given Rio everything—she couldn’t. But maybe, just maybe, she had given herself something she hadn’t even realized she needed.</p><p>Rio stepped back slowly, giving her the space Agatha had asked for, but her eyes never left hers.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio said again, softer now, almost a whisper.</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha believed the sincerity in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha nodded, letting out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. She closed her eyes for a moment, her chest tight with the weight of everything that had just happened. She had kissed Rio Vidal—that kiss—and yet, she still didn’t know how to untangle the mess of emotions swirling inside her. Could she really do this? Could she allow herself to feel something so intense for a woman, for Rio?</p><p>Before she could settle on an answer, she felt Rio’s touch again—soft, almost as if testing the waters. A strand of her hair, caught in the breeze, fell across her face, and she felt Rio’s fingers slide through it, tucking it gently behind her ear. The touch was tender, intimate even, as if Rio was grounding her in this moment.</p><p>She instinctively leaned into the touch, her breath catching in her throat. Her pulse quickened at the warmth of Rio’s hand, and for a moment, she forgot about everything—about her doubts, her fears, the complications that came with everything surrounding them.</p><p>“Again, no promises,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. She was so aware of how much she was giving, and yet, she couldn’t bring herself to walk away from it.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer with words. Instead, she nodded, her expression soft but resolute. She cupped Agatha’s cheek, her thumb brushing gently across her skin, sending a shiver through her body. The touch was grounding, calm, but it held a depth of understanding that made Agatha’s heart beat faster.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, her gaze searching Agatha’s face as if to ensure she truly believed it. “Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be here. No rush.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak at first. She just stood there, feeling Rio’s warmth, the softness of her words, the undeniable pull between them. The world around her seemed to fade. It was just the two of them, standing in the quiet of the night, with no barriers between them, no pressure.</p><p>But then, Rio leaned in again, her lips brushing softly against Agatha’s once more. This time, it was slower, more deliberate. The kiss lingered, a soft press that spoke volumes. The kind of kiss that said more than words could ever convey, that whispered promises and possibilities without needing to utter them aloud.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio pulled back just slightly, her forehead resting against Agatha’s, their breaths mingling.</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice low, yet full of warmth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything immediately. She just nodded, her hand finding Rio’s arm, her fingers brushing against the leather of her jacket. The simple touch felt like a promise of something more, even if she wasn’t ready to face it just yet.</p><p>When she finally met Rio’s eyes, there was something softer there now, something more vulnerable. Something that made Agatha believe, just for a moment, that maybe this wasn’t such a mistake after all.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha stood by the curb, her fingers tapping nervously on the fabric of her blazer as she waited for the Uber to arrive. The night air felt colder than it had when they first stepped outside, but it wasn’t just the temperature that made her shiver. It was everything—everything that had happened between her and Rio.</p><p>She glanced over at Rio, who was leaning casually against the brick wall of the club, arms folded across her chest, eyes watching Agatha with an intensity that sent a thrill racing down her spine. The way Rio looked at her now—after everything—had shifted. There was no rush, no pressure, just… an understanding. And the way Rio had kissed her, so deliberately, so passionately, made her insides coil tighter every time she thought about it.</p><p>“Do you need a ride?” Rio asked, breaking her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, the slight motion feeling too quick, too sharp. “I called an Uber,” she muttered, looking down the street. She could feel Rio’s gaze on her still, and her body responded instinctively, her pulse quickening.</p><p>The silence between them was charged, thick with everything unspoken.</p><p>Rio stood up straight, a slight grin tugging at the corner of her lips. She stepped toward Agatha, her presence overwhelming. “Before you go…” Rio said, voice soft but steady.</p><p>Agatha turned toward her, eyebrows furrowing slightly. “What?”</p><p>“Can I have your number?” Rio asked, the words casual, but the weight behind them was unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her mind racing. She hadn’t expected that. It felt like a big step, too big. She had just agreed to slow down, to figure things out. But Rio wasn’t asking for much—just her number. She opened her mouth, then closed it again. Her mind fought the instinct to shut this all down, to put up a wall. But in that moment, she realized she wanted this, too, more than she was willing to admit.</p><p>Reluctantly, she gave Rio her phone number, watching as Rio typed it in with a slight smile that made her heart flutter.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said softly, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped, and before she could say anything else, the Uber pulled up to the curb. She didn’t look at Rio as she climbed into the car, but the brief brush of their fingers as they said goodbye was enough to leave her breathless.</p><p>The entire ride to her house was a blur. Agatha couldn’t shake the images from her mind—the feel of Rio’s lips, the way her body had responded to each touch, the electric charge between them. Her mind replayed every kiss, every touch, every second of the night, and no matter how much she tried to calm herself, she couldn’t stop the heat that was building inside her.</p><p>The moment the Uber pulled into her driveway, she was already out of the car, her feet almost moving without her consent. She needed space, time to process—anything but the tight, throbbing feeling that wouldn’t leave her body.</p><p>She let herself into her house and immediately felt the emptiness of the space. Nicky wasn’t home—thank god. He was spending the night at Wanda’s with Billy and Tommy, leaving her alone with her thoughts. Alone to finally admit to herself what she had done.</p><p>After she locked the door, she went through her usual nighttime routine. She washed her face, brushed her teeth, made sure everything was in its place, but even as she went through the motions, her mind was consumed by the night. Every moment with Rio. Every kiss, every whisper.</p><p>When she finally climbed into bed, the cool sheets did little to soothe her. She pulled the duvet up to her chest, her breath coming in shallow, uneven waves. The tension in her body was unbearable, a coiled spring ready to snap. She closed her eyes, but it was no use. Rio’s face, her voice, her touch—they were all there, imprinted on her mind, demanding her attention.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched beneath the covers, restless. She bit her lip, trying to ignore the ache building low in her stomach. But the more she resisted, the more insistent it became. Her heart pounded in her chest, the sound loud in the quiet room.</p><p>With a shaky exhale, Agatha gave in. Her hand slid beneath the waistband of her pajama pants, fingers trembling as they brushed against the warmth of her skin. Her breath hitched at the contact, and she hesitates but the need to keep going was too strong.</p><p>Her fingers dipped lower, exploring the slick warmth between her thighs. She gasped softly, her back arching off the bed. She was so wet, her body already yielding to the lightest touch. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut as she traced slow, deliberate circles, her breath coming in short, uneven bursts.</p><p>The pressure built with every stroke, her hips rocking instinctively against her hand. Rio’s name spilled from her lips in a whisper, a plea, a prayer. Agatha’s mind filled with images of Rio—her dark eyes, her soft lips, the way her hands had felt on Agatha’s skin. It was all too much, and yet not enough.</p><p>She pressed harder, her moan muffled by the pillow she’d buried her face in. Her body was on fire, every nerve alight with sensation. Her fingers moved faster, her breathing ragged. She could feel the tension coiling tighter, her muscles tensing as she teetered on the edge.</p><p>“Rio,” she gasped, her voice barely audible. The sound of her own voice sent a shiver down her spine, her body arching off the bed as the wave of pleasure crashed over her. For a moment, the world fell away, leaving only the heat and the trembling aftershocks coursing through her.</p><p>When she finally came down, her body felt heavy, her limbs like lead. She lay there, her chest rising and falling as she tried to catch her breath. Her fingers were still between her thighs, slick and trembling. Slowly, she pulled her hand away, her heart still racing.</p><p>The tension in her body dissolved, but the longing remained. Even as she lay there, trying to catch her breath, all she could think about was the last time Rio’s lips had touched her skin—and the promise that, maybe, there would be more.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Agatha walked into Wanda’s house on Sunday morning, the sharp scent of pancakes and the sound of the twins arguing over something trivial greeting her as she stepped inside. Nicky had spent the night with the twins and Viz while Agatha and Wanda had gone out to grab dinner with Lilia. She had barely slept, her mind reeling from the events of the night before—the kiss with Rio, the pull of desire, the mix of excitement and fear that still throbbed in her chest.</p><p>Now, she was steeling herself for Wanda’s inevitable questions. Her best friend always knew when something was off, and Agatha couldn’t hide it forever. She took a deep breath and tried to calm the nerves gnawing at her.</p><p>Wanda was in the kitchen, as usual, flipping pancakes while the twins set the table. Agatha’s presence barely made a ripple in the chaos until Wanda looked up, her sharp eyes catching Agatha’s. There was no hiding it. Wanda would know immediately.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said, forcing a smile as she stepped further inside.</p><p>Wanda gave her a look that clearly said she wasn’t buying the act. “Morning. You feeling better?” she asked casually, but her eyes flicked to Agatha’s face, studying her closely.</p><p>Agatha froze, her stomach flipping. Of course Wanda would ask. She’d already tried to lie about her “headache” last night when Rio had been kind enough to cover for her. “Yeah,” Agatha answered, her voice tight. “Much better.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. “Uh-huh. If you say so.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind flashed back to the club—Rio’s touch, the heat of that kiss, the weight of everything that had been left unsaid. She didn’t know how to explain any of it, not without admitting things she wasn’t ready to admit. “It was nothing, really,” Agatha said quickly, turning her attention to Nicky, who had just appeared in the doorway with a big grin on his face.</p><p>“Mom! I’m ready to go!” he said, rushing over and giving her a tight hug around the waist.</p><p>Agatha smiled, letting herself relax a little at the sight of her son. “Let’s head out, kiddo,” she said, returning his hug and feeling some of the tension drain from her shoulders.</p><p>Wanda stepped in, giving Agatha a knowing look as she prepared a plate of pancakes for the twins. “You sure you’re okay, Agatha?” she asked, her voice softer now. “You’ve been acting a little… off.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temple. She couldn’t avoid this conversation forever, but at least Nicky was here, offering a buffer for the moment. “I’m fine. Just tired, that’s all.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t press further but watched Agatha carefully, her expression unreadable. Agatha had the sense that Wanda would circle back to this later when it was just the two of them. She didn’t know if she was ready for that, but it seemed inevitable.</p><p>Nicky grabbed his backpack and started pulling his shoes on, eager to head out the door. She had promised him they would do something fun today. As they walked toward the door, Wanda caught Agatha’s eye once more.</p><p>“You’ll talk to me when you’re ready, right?” Wanda asked quietly, her gaze warm but unwavering.</p><p>Agatha hesitated but finally nodded. “Yeah, I will.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a small smile, and Agatha managed to return it before she ushered Nicky out the door.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The next few days passed in a blur as Agatha threw herself into her work. Music lessons, meetings, compositions—anything to keep her mind from wandering to a certain rockstar who had completely unsettled her. But every time her mind drifted even slightly, it found its way back to Rio. It was maddening.</p><p>By Wednesday afternoon, Agatha was barely holding herself together. Her schedule was filled, but in the moments between, her mind would wander to that kiss, to the warmth of Rio’s body against hers, and the desire she was struggling to control. She tried to push it down, but the memories clung to her, louder and more persistent each time she tried to focus on something else.</p><p>Her 2:30pm student canceled, leaving her with unexpected free time. It was both a blessing and a curse. She needed a release, something to express everything that had been building inside her. She glanced at the piano in the main area of the school, its polished surface gleaming under the soft light.</p><p>That piano had always been a place of comfort, a space where she could translate her emotions into music. Today, she knew exactly what she needed to do.</p><p>She went to it, sitting down on the bench, adjusting her phone to start recording, just as she always did when she was composing. But this time, there was a difference. The notebook Rio had given her for her birthday—she opened it to the first blank page, the crisp white waiting for her to fill it with something new, something real.</p><p>Her fingers hovered over the keys for a moment, then she let them fall. The first note was sharp, filled with the unease that had been growing in her chest. And then another followed, each note a release of the tension that had built up from days of confusion and longing. Agatha didn’t plan out the music. It came to her in waves, just like her feelings for Rio—unpredictable, raw, and completely consuming. The music was her way of understanding herself, of processing what she couldn’t put into words.</p><p>She played as though the piano was the only place where she could truly let go. Every chord felt like a confession, every movement on the keys a way to capture the essence of what had happened between them, even if she couldn’t fully make sense of it herself.</p><p>As the final note faded into the room, she closed her eyes, breathing in deeply, her fingers still resting lightly on the keys. The music had left her, but it had left something else too—an ache that she wasn’t sure how to solve, but that she had to find a way to live with.</p><p>And then she felt it. That sensation of being watched.</p><p>Slowly, she turned around, her heart skipping a beat when she saw Rio standing in the doorway. Her expression was one of awe—eyes wide, lips parted slightly, as if she’d been spellbound by the music.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her pulse quickening, not entirely sure what to say or do.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Rio was standing in the doorway, eyes wide, taking in every inch of Agatha’s form—how her posture softened as the music swirled into the air, how her hands moved with such grace, how her expression reflected the intensity of every note. She looked breathtakingly beautiful, even in this quiet moment, her vulnerability on full display.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just the music that captivated Rio; it was the way Agatha had opened herself up to it, allowing her emotions to flow freely without holding anything back. It was raw and real. And for a moment, Rio felt as though she were witnessing something far more personal than just a performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure how long she had been standing there, but the urge to be closer to Agatha was undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you been standing there?” Agatha’s voice cut through the silence, a slight hesitation in her tone. She turned to face Rio, her eyes locking onto hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a few steps forward, unable to break the spell Agatha had cast over her. Her heart was pounding in her chest, the words slipping out before she could stop them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was… incredible,” she whispered, her voice reverent, full of admiration for Agatha’s talent, but even more so for the way she seemed to pour herself into every note, every chord.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly, but there was a guardedness to it. She ran a hand across the pages of her notebook, closing it gently as if to seal away whatever had just poured from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she said quietly, her voice just above a whisper, almost as if the compliment was something she wasn’t sure she deserved. “I just… needed to get something out. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, but Agatha didn’t move any closer to her. There was a tension in the air, something delicate, something that Agatha wasn’t quite ready to expose just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was it about?” Rio asked gently, her curiosity tugging at her. She could feel the weight of the music still hanging in the air between them, a question lingering unspoken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, her gaze flickering briefly before she met Rio’s eyes again, but there was no immediate answer. She shifted uncomfortably, crossing her arms over her chest in a way that made her seem more distant, more protected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” she said, the words coming out in a whisper. “Just… feelings, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t push, sensing the hesitation in Agatha’s voice, the walls she had instinctively built up around herself. She smiled softly, feeling a rush of tenderness for the woman who, despite the cool exterior, was so clearly carrying something heavy beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio murmured, her voice low. “I get that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The music seemed to settle between them like a bridge, and Rio could almost taste the unspoken words, the things Agatha wasn’t yet ready to say. She wanted to reach out, wanted to make Agatha see how much she wanted to be there for her, but she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Rio took a quiet step back, allowing Agatha space, but her eyes never left her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence between them held a promise. Neither of them spoke of it, but it was there—the knowledge that whatever was happening, whatever had already happened, wasn’t going to just fade away. Not so easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in that moment, Rio knew she had to be patient. If Agatha wasn’t ready to take the next step, Rio could wait. But she wouldn’t walk away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not now. Not after all of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood there for a long moment, her thoughts swirling. The past few days had been a blur of restlessness. She had been dying to text Agatha, to reach out after everything that had happened, but she had held herself back. She didn’t want to spook Agatha. The last thing she wanted was to push her further away. So, Rio had kept her distance, but every day, every moment, Agatha had been on her mind—more and more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just the kiss, though that had been something unforgettable. It wasn’t just the way Agatha had let herself go in that moment, or the softness of her lips against hers. No, it was everything. It was the way Agatha had opened up through her music. The way she spoke, so careful yet so deeply emotional. Rio could feel the pull, could feel it in every part of her body, but she wasn’t going to rush it. She had to let Agatha come to her, had to let her find her own way through the storm of emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But damn, it was hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had paced her house, texted and deleted, tried to focus on writing and band prep for their upcoming album, but Agatha was always there, in the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just that… she hadn’t expected this. She hadn’t expected someone like Agatha to bring out something so… tender in her. A desire to protect, to hold her close, but also to give her the space she clearly needed. Rio was used to the thrill of the chase, the quick spark of attraction, but Agatha wasn’t like that. She didn’t respond to those quick hits. No, Agatha was deeper. She needed time. She needed to be certain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was willing to wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts were interrupted when Agatha shifted, breaking their silence. Agatha glanced at her, her eyes scanning Rio for a second before she spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re early,” Agatha said, her voice soft, almost like she didn’t want to disrupt the moment they were sharing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, taking a step toward her. “Yeah, I… Mia had something to take care of at school,” she explained, not wanting to dive too deep into the details of her daughter’s plans for the day. “I told her I’d meet her here afterward, but I figured I’d come early. Thought maybe… maybe I could see you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curling up just slightly in a knowing smile. “You wanted to see me?” she repeated, a hint of amusement in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her gaze steady, though there was something vulnerable in the way she met Agatha’s eyes. “Yeah, I did. I thought about you… a lot,” she admitted, her words carrying more weight than she intended. “More than I probably should have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, feeling the pull of Agatha’s presence as she sat at the piano. She hesitated for a moment before settling onto the bench beside her, the space between them small but enough to carry a quiet weight. The soft hum of the school’s music-filled space provided a backdrop to their conversation, but Rio could feel the silence between them almost as heavy as the weight of everything left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio settled beside Agatha on the piano bench, the space between them just enough to make the air feel heavy, but not so much that it was uncomfortable. She hesitated for only a moment before running her fingers across the keys, the familiar smoothness of the ivory comforting in a way she hadn’t expected. She hadn’t played in a while—not seriously, at least—but it was something she’d done since she was a kid, so her hands moved without thinking, finding a simple melody that felt right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her for a few moments, clearly surprised. “You play?” she asked, her voice soft with curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, since I was little,” Rio replied, glancing over at Agatha with a small, easy smile. “It’s not my favorite, but I always found it kind of soothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head slightly, her gaze lingering on Rio’s hands as they moved with surprising fluidity over the keys. “You’re </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>,” she commented quietly, her tone genuine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled lightly, giving a slight shrug as she stopped playing and turned her body slightly to face Agatha. “I don’t play much anymore. But… I thought I’d give it a shot today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her for a second, a thoughtful expression crossing her face. She could feel the quiet pull between them again, and her heart quickened at the way Rio was looking at her—almost like she wanted to say something more. But when Rio just met her gaze, her eyes soft yet unreadable, Agatha found herself at a loss for words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stayed silent for a beat, but then she let out a small sigh, her fingers absently tracing the edges of the piano. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” she finally said, her voice low, just above a whisper. Her words hung in the air between them, a subtle but undeniable confession. “I’ve been trying to distract myself… but every time I close my eyes, I see you. That night… everything. I just couldn’t stop thinking about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched slightly, her heart stuttering at the rawness in Rio’s voice, but she didn’t say anything in return. She couldn’t bring herself to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t done, but she sensed the tension in the air, the way Agatha had stiffened ever so slightly, as though trying to process what she’d said. She bit her lip, her fingers lightly brushing against the piano keys again as she focused on them, giving Agatha the space she needed. “I’m not going to push you, Agatha,” Rio added, her tone quiet but firm. “I just… wanted you to know. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence between them stretched out, more comfortable than it should’ve been, but neither of them moved. Rio could tell that Agatha needed time, and she was willing to wait. She wasn’t going anywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, just as Agatha opened her mouth to respond, the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall. Rio quickly turned her head, and Agatha’s gaze followed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, guess what!” Nicky’s voice rang out, and before either of them could say anything else, he burst into the room, his face lighting up when he saw Rio sitting at the piano. “You’re already here! What are you doing?” he asked, firing off the question in his usual rapid-fire manner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a small laugh, grateful for the interruption. She quickly turned to face her son. “Just… hanging out,” she said, keeping her voice light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes darted from Rio’s fingers still resting on the piano keys to Agatha, then back again. “Do you play? Does she play well, mom? Is she, like, the next piano star?” he asked, his enthusiasm clearly uncontainable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, unable to resist the warmth Nicky radiated. “I wouldn’t go that far,” she replied, her grin wide. “But I can hold my own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky seemed satisfied with that, though his curiosity was still brimming. “What are you gonna play next? Can I try?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but chuckle, the moment finally feeling lighter, more like the usual routine of their days. She ruffled Nicky’s hair. “Not today, buddy. Rio’s just here for a bit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pouted but seemed to accept it. “Well, if you ever do a show, I wanna be front row!” he announced before turning back to Rio with wide eyes. “Do you play anything else? Like, bass? Drums?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, feeling the weight of the previous conversation ebbing away, replaced by the familiar warmth of Nicky’s unfiltered energy. “Guitar, drums, a little bass, a little keyboard… I dabble,” she said with a wink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes grew even wider, clearly starstruck. “Whoa! You’re like, a super cool rockstar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled warmly, her thoughts about Agatha momentarily pushed aside as Nicky bombarded her with more questions. Agatha, feeling the moment slip away, leaned back against the bench, watching Rio handle her son with an effortless charm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the moment stretched on, Rio’s earlier words about not pushing Agatha still hung in her mind, simmering beneath the surface. But she was content, for now, to let the pace be what it was. She wasn’t going anywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Nicky asked her if she would listen to the new song he’d been working on, Rio nodded happily. She was more than happy to indulge him, her admiration for the boy growing the more she was around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted in her seat and gave Rio’s shoulder a quick, gentle squeeze. “I’m going to get some work done in my office,” she said, her tone light but with a subtle edge Rio couldn’t quite place. Maybe it was the way Agatha avoided meeting her eyes for a second too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her leave, feeling a slight disappointment in her chest, though she tried to ignore it. The closeness they shared earlier was interrupted, but Rio was determined not to overthink it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, I can’t wait to show you!” Nicky said, bouncing on his heels, eager to share his latest creation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, letting herself get swept into his energy. They headed outside to the small courtyard, where Nicky took her to the spot he made his own. It was just a small corner with some benches, but it was clear it was special to him. He set up his guitar, his fingers already dancing over the strings, and started playing with a concentration that Rio couldn’t help but admire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The boy had talent. More than that, he had passion—a drive that reminded Rio of herself when she was his age. As she listened, she couldn’t help but smile at how effortlessly his music flowed. He was still a kid, but there was something mature about the way he expressed himself through his music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the next hour passed, Rio couldn’t ignore the tug in her chest. Even though she was engrossed in Nicky’s playing, part of her kept drifting back to the tension between her and Agatha. She couldn’t quite place it—maybe it was Agatha’s hesitation, maybe the way she was pulling away. Whatever it was, it lingered in the back of Rio’s mind as she continued to encourage Nicky, offering him advice and praise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio listened to Nicky excitedly play the riff he’d been practicing, her gaze shifted toward the entrance of the courtyard. Mia had just appeared, her posture slumped and her eyes avoiding contact. Rio could feel the shift in the air, a subtle tension she couldn’t quite place. Mia wasn’t her usual self.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kiddo,” Rio called, offering a soft smile. “You good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia glanced up, forcing a smile, but Rio could tell it didn’t reach her eyes. “Yeah, fine,” she muttered, though the words felt empty. She hesitated for a moment, then dropped her shoulders, her gaze drifting toward the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her for a beat, instinctively knowing something wasn’t right. But Mia wasn’t in the mood to talk—Rio could see that much. Still, the silence between them was thick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, on the other hand, was too caught up in his guitar to notice. “Rio, look! It’s that Coven song!” His enthusiasm pulled Rio back into the present. “I’ve been practicing! Watch!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a grin, Nicky strummed a few notes, his fingers moving quickly over the guitar strings. Rio smiled at his excitement, genuinely impressed by his progress. “You’re sounding great, buddy. That’s some real talent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed, clearly proud of himself. But as she glanced back at Mia, who still stood by the entrance, Rio felt the familiar pull of concern. “Alright, Nicky, you keep practicing,” she said, ruffling his hair affectionately. “But I need to go run some errands. I’ll be back soon to pick up Mia, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay!” Nicky said, grinning up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at him before turning her attention to Mia once more. “Mia,” she said gently, “I’m gonna go take care of a few things, but I’ll be back to pick you up soon. You good to wait for me here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t respond right away, but she gave a short nod, her expression unreadable. “Yeah, I’ll wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied her for a moment longer, but then decided not to press. She gave her a soft smile before heading toward the gate. As she walked away, Rio couldn’t help but feel the weight of the conversation that was still hanging in the air. Mia clearly had something on her mind, but she wasn’t ready to open up about it just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shaking off the thought, Rio headed out of the courtyard, telling herself she’d check in with Mia later. She had to get her errands done, and then she’d be back—ready to pick up her daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked away, she glanced back one last time, seeing Nicky still focused on his guitar, his enthusiasm still evident. Rio couldn’t help but smile, but the moment of peace was fleeting as she turned toward the errands awaiting her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio returned to pick up Mia, she carried a tray with two cups of coffee and two hot chocolates, the warm aroma cutting through the late afternoon air. Her eyes immediately found Agatha, who stood near the front desk, scanning something on her tablet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up as Rio approached, her gaze briefly flicking to the tray before settling on Rio’s face. “Mia’s in the bathroom,” she said, setting the tablet down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, then hesitated for a fraction of a second before holding out one of the coffees. “For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows lifted slightly, but then—there it was. That small, pleased smile, the kind Rio was quickly learning felt like a rare reward. She accepted the cup, fingers brushing against Rio’s for the briefest moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t sure what pleased her more: that she’d guessed right, or that Agatha was accepting it at all. “And this is for Nicky, if that’s okay. Thought he’d like a hot chocolate,” she added, nodding at one of the smaller cups.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, nodding as Rio placed the hot chocolate on the counter. Agatha took a careful sip of the coffee, humming in approval before cradling the cup between her hands. “Not bad,” she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, leaning against the desk. “Not bad? That sounds dangerously close to a compliment, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the corners of her mouth twitched in amusement. “Don’t let it go to your head, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, taking a sip of her own coffee. “Too late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, there was an ease between them, something warm and unspoken lingering in the air. Rio could feel it, could see it in the way Agatha’s shoulders had lost some of their tension. It made her want to push, just a little—to reach for that connection again, to remind Agatha that whatever had sparked between them that night hadn’t been a mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could say anything else, the sound of a door opening caught their attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia stepped out of the bathroom, her expression unreadable as she spotted Rio standing there with Agatha. Her gaze flickered to the tray in Rio’s hands, then to the way Agatha held her coffee, before settling on Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kid,” Rio greeted, forcing a casual smile. “Got you a hot chocolate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hesitated for a fraction of a second before stepping forward and taking the cup. “Thanks,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio studied her, noting the slight tension in her posture. Something was off. Something was way off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You all done with your lesson?” Rio asked, keeping her voice light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, taking a sip of her drink. “Yeah. Just finished.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced between them before speaking. “She did well today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shifted uncomfortably, as if unsure what to do with the praise. She nodded once, then turned back to Rio. “Can we go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow at the clipped tone but nodded. “Yeah, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia turned around and made her way to the door. “Bye, Agatha. See you next week,” she called over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to Agatha, lowering her voice slightly. “Is she okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled softly, her fingers tightening briefly around her coffee cup. She glanced at Mia, who was now focused on her drink, then back at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was a little distracted today,” Agatha admitted in a quiet voice, careful not to let Mia overhear. “Nothing too concerning, but…” She trailed off, giving Rio a knowing look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, rubbing the back of her neck. “Yeah. I noticed something was off earlier too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shifted beside them, clearly aware they were talking about her. She didn’t say anything, just kept sipping her hot chocolate, her expression carefully blank.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio decided not to push it—not now. Instead, she turned back to Agatha and gave her a small, appreciative smile. “Thanks for letting me know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. There was something about the way she was looking at Rio, something softer than before, and Rio found herself reluctant to leave just yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sighed, shifting her weight impatiently. “Are we going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a small laugh at her daughter’s tone, then turned back to Agatha. “I’ll see you soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for the briefest moment before nodding. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a promise. But it wasn’t a refusal either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was enough for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she turned to leave, Rio let her fingers brush against Agatha’s, then gave her hand a brief, warm squeeze. A quiet, unspoken acknowledgment—of what had happened, of what still lingered between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t pull away. Didn’t stiffen. Just looked at her, something unreadable flickering in those sharp blue eyes before she gave a nearly imperceptible nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back, offered a small smirk, and then finally stepped away. “Take care, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, she slung an arm around Mia’s shoulders and led her out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know what to do anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia had been in a mood all day, and no matter what Rio said or did, she barely got more than a one-word response from her. It wasn’t unusual for Mia to be quiet—she had always been more reserved than Rio—but this wasn’t just quiet. This was something else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was getting real tired of dancing around it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the plates down with a little more force than necessary, the sound of ceramic meeting wood breaking the heavy silence. “Mia, dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia barely glanced up from her phone. “I’ll eat later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath, gripping the edge of the counter. “You know the rule. When we’re both home, we eat together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know the rule,” Mia muttered. “I’m not hungry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not the point,” Rio said, exasperated now. “Come sit down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio folded her arms, her patience wearing thin. “Okay. What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s fingers stilled over her phone, her jaw tightening. She sighed, tossing it onto the couch beside her, then finally looked at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They found pictures of you at school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pictures. Of you. Online.” Mia’s voice was sharp, her fingers drumming restlessly against her thigh. “Some asshole found them and thought it would be funny to show everyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach sank. She didn’t need to ask what pictures Mia meant. She had been in a club, she had been drinking, and she had been… well, close to someone. But nothing had happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Except, apparently, someone had caught it on camera.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus,” Rio muttered, dragging a hand down her face. “Mia, I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They said you were making out with some woman,” Mia interrupted. “That you were probably taking her home that night. They were laughing, calling you a—” She cut herself off, pressing her lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw clenched. “Calling me a what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shook her head. “Doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It does,” Rio said, stepping closer. “What did they say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia exhaled harshly. “That you’re just slut who got famous. That you sleep around. That you—” She stopped, looking away. “That it’s no wonder I don’t know who my dad is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took everything in her not to punch a hole in the wall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a slow breath, then another. “Mia, you know that’s bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Mia muttered. “But it doesn’t mean it’s fun to hear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then moved closer, hesitating only for a second before pulling Mia into a tight hug. “I’m sorry,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t hug her back at first, but eventually, she let out a breath and leaned into her mother’s embrace. “I just hate it,” she admitted, voice small now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “And I’ll fix it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia pulled back, giving her a skeptical look. “How?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “I don’t know yet. But I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia held her gaze for a long moment before sighing and finally sitting at the table. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t much, but Rio would take it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, long after Mia had gone to her room, Rio sat on the couch with her phone in hand, scrolling through search results with a clenched jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to see them for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take long to find them. The photos were grainy, taken from a distance, but they were clear enough. There she was, pressed close to someone on the dance floor, her hands on the woman’s waist, their bodies aligned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded as she swiped to the next one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just as Mia had said—there were shots of her looking like she was about to kiss someone, their faces inches apart. But it was dark and grainy and there wasn’t much to see there. Another one caught her in the middle of a laugh, the club lights painting her skin in neon hues.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But none of them showed Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Relief crashed over her so suddenly she almost sagged against the cushions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the clearest shot, the only thing visible of Agatha were her hands—one on Rio’s hip, the other tangled in her hair. The angle worked in their favor; Rio’s body mostly blocked Agatha from view. Anyone who didn’t already know who it was wouldn’t be able to tell.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But the headlines were still brutal.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rockstar Rio Vidal Caught in Late-Night Club Romp—Who’s the Mystery Woman?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>

</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal: Music’s Favorite Bad Girl at It Again?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply and tossed her phone onto the coffee table, raking a hand through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So this was what Mia had been dealing with all day. No wonder she was pissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes and leaned back against the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had no idea how to fix this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she had to try.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat on the edge of her bed, her fingers absently scrolling through her phone, her mind racing. She hadn’t realized that the photos even existed until Mia had told her about them, and now the tension in the house felt unbearable. Mia was withdrawn, angry, and Rio couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that everything was spiraling out of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What hurt the most was that Mia had found the photos. The photos that could, in the worst case, get out of hand and cause even more trouble. Mia had always been sensitive about the attention her mom’s career brought, and Rio understood that. But what she was even more pissed was that she should’ve seen this coming. She knew how those vultures worked.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I should’ve known better. I should have been more careful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The guilt gnawed at her, but what stung more was the idea that Agatha might find out through someone else. Agatha had been nothing but supportive, and Rio knew that her world was different from this. The last thing Agatha needed was for all of this to get tangled into her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at her phone, at the images Mia had shown her. There were a couple of blurry shots of her dancing at the club with Agatha. And while the pictures weren’t clear enough to make out her face, Rio couldn’t help but feel a knot tighten in her chest. She had never wanted this kind of attention, and certainly not for Agatha to be dragged into it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a deep breath, Rio stood up, pacing the room. It wasn’t just about the photos—it was about making sure Agatha knew the truth, straight from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed her phone again, finding Agatha’s contact and hesitating for a moment before hitting the call button. She needed to do this. She needed to apologize, even if it wasn’t her fault.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone rang once, twice, and then Agatha answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard, trying to steady her voice. “Hey, it’s Rio. We need to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong?” Agatha’s voice was soft but alert, and Rio felt a wave of guilt wash over her. She hadn’t even told Agatha about the photos yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… I need to tell you something,” Rio started slowly, struggling to find the words. “Mia showed me some photos today. They’re of me in a club… with someone. And they got out, somehow.” She paused, trying to collect her thoughts. “I didn’t know about them until Mia told me. I just—I don’t want you to hear about it from anyone else. You can’t really tell it’s you. They’re blurry, and you can’t see much. They can just see your hands around me, like when we were dancing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long silence on the other end. Rio’s heart pounded as she waited for Agatha to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha’s voice broke through the quiet. “I wish you had told me earlier. I… I would have wanted to know about this sooner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Rio said quietly, the words heavy on her tongue. “I didn’t mean for you to be dragged into this. I didn’t want to upset you or make things harder for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed softly. “It’s not your fault, Rio. I know that. But it’s just… complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. I just—I didn’t want it to be something you had to deal with,” Rio replied. “I didn’t want you to find out from anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you told me. I really am,” Agatha said after a moment. “But this isn’t just about us. It’s about Mia, and what this might mean for her. I don’t want her to see us getting caught up in all this noise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want that either,” Rio murmured. “I just wanted to make sure you knew. I should have been more open with you. I should have told you sooner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s tone softened. “Hey, again, it’s not your fault. It’s a lot to handle. But we’ll figure this out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breath she didn’t realize she had been holding. “I appreciate that. Really. And I’m really sorry you got dragged into this mess. I hate it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t need to apologize,” Agatha said gently. “We’ll handle it. But thank you for telling me. We’ll talk more later, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha said goodbye and the line went quiet again, and Rio let out a deep breath, feeling a bit lighter, but the weight of everything still lingered. At least Agatha knew now. She had been open, and that felt like a small relief, even if the road ahead was uncertain.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha lay in bed, staring at the ceiling in the dark, her mind racing. The weight of the conversation with Rio still hung heavy, the knowledge of those photos swirling in her thoughts. She hadn’t been able to shake the uneasy feeling ever since Rio had told her. A part of her felt that old familiar pang, that dread, like the echoes of something she’d tried to bury long ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled onto her side, pulling the covers tighter around her, but the chill had little to do with the temperature of the room. It was a memory, one that felt just as fresh now as it had all those years ago. The images of her ex—James Wilcox—flooded her mind. The world of fame she had been unwillingly dragged into. The cameras. The flashing lights. The whispers. The constant need to be perfect in a world that didn’t care about who you were beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought about the way he had looked at her when she’d told him she was pregnant. How his face had hardened, his shoulders tensing as if the weight of her announcement was a burden he couldn’t bear. It was supposed to be a moment of joy, but it hadn’t been. For him, it had been an inconvenience, something that threatened to shatter the illusion of his carefully curated life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, she’d tried to tell herself it was just the pressure of his career that made him react the way he did. He was a famous musician, after all—at the height of his fame, surrounded by people who worshipped him. The idea of settling down, of raising a family, had seemed impossible in his world. But she had hoped that with time, things would change. She was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts drifted back to that day, the day he had packed his things and left. The moment when she realized that her world would never be the same again. He’d walked out the door, not even a glance back, as though the life they had shared had never mattered to him. And just like that, he had replaced her with someone younger. Someone who didn’t come with the baggage of responsibility, who didn’t ask for things he couldn’t give.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she, alone and pregnant, had been left behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had taken years for her to rebuild, to regain her sense of self. The memory of his indifference had fueled her drive to create Sonata Grove, to make something of herself that had nothing to do with his world. It had been a sanctuary, a way to reclaim control over her life. But the fear had never truly gone away. The fear that history would repeat itself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now, with Rio, it felt like the past was threatening to resurface. The way Rio’s life in the spotlight seemed so familiar, so dangerous. The photos, the attention—they reminded her too much of what had happened before. She was terrified. Terrified of getting caught up in something she couldn’t control. Terrified of allowing herself to trust again, only for it to crumble in the face of the same pressures she had experienced with her ex.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, willing the thoughts to fade, but they refused to. They were relentless, like ghosts that refused to leave her side. And in the quiet of her bedroom, her heartbeat seemed too loud, a constant reminder that she was alone with her fears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the clock on her nightstand, noting that it was already past 3 a.m. The time seemed irrelevant, but the hours lost to worrying only made the fear grow stronger. She had always believed that she could keep her life separate from the chaos of fame, that she could protect herself and Nicky from the unpredictability of that world. But with Rio, things felt different. Too different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had promised herself that she would never allow anyone to treat her like her ex had. She wouldn’t allow herself to be dragged into the whirlwind of another world that didn’t care about her. But Rio… Rio was different. Agatha could feel it in the way she looked at her, in the way she listened. Rio made her feel things she hadn’t felt in years, and that scared her more than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up in bed, running a hand through her hair, trying to collect herself. The room felt suffocating, and she needed to clear her mind. She knew she couldn’t stay in this state forever. She couldn’t keep running from what was happening between her and Rio. But she wasn’t ready yet. She needed time. Time to sort through the emotions swirling inside her, to decide if she could let herself take a step forward, or if she would shut herself off and risk losing something that felt too much like a dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced toward the window, where the first light of dawn began to creep through the blinds. In the stillness of the early morning, Agatha wondered if she had the strength to face what was ahead, or if she would pull back, afraid of the very thing that might heal her wounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, though, all she could do was wait. Wait for the storm of memories and fear to settle, and hope that she wouldn’t let herself get swept away in it again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked into Sonata Grove, the familiar scent of wood, paper, and the faint sound of distant piano keys immediately calming her frayed nerves, but not enough to ease the exhaustion that clung to her like a heavy weight. Her body felt like it hadn’t been given a proper rest in days, and her mind… her mind was a jumbled mess of memories, worries, and things left unsaid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she made her way through the main area, Wanda spotted her almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like you haven’t slept in days,” Wanda said, her sharp eyes studying Agatha with concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, offering her a small smile as she tried to brush it off. “I just couldn’t sleep, Wanda. It’s nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, however, wasn’t buying it. She followed Agatha closely, not allowing her to escape her gaze as she moved toward her office. “You’re lying,” she said, her voice gentle but insistent. “Come on, something’s going on. I know you too well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, the weight of the conversation with Rio still lingering at the back of her mind. She sat down at her desk and began sorting through papers aimlessly, trying to regain some sense of control. “Really, Wanda, it’s nothing. Just… too much on my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda wasn’t having any of it. She pulled up a chair and sat down across from Agatha, crossing her arms. “Nope. Not buying it. What happened? Tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could respond, her phone buzzed on the desk, a text notification lighting up the screen. She hesitated, her fingers itching to look but not knowing if she was ready. She snatched it up, her eyes immediately landing on the message from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good morning. Just wanted to check in after our talk last night. Hope you’re doing okay.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Accompanying the text was a picture of a sunrise, the early light casting soft, warm colors over a cityscape, but it was Rio’s tired face that caught Agatha’s attention. The half-smile, the exhaustion behind her eyes… it was clear that Rio, too, hadn’t slept well. Her own struggles, her own worries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart gave a painful lurch. She wasn’t the only one who couldn’t seem to shake off the tension, the questions that lingered in the air between them. And yet, here was Rio, reaching out in her own quiet way, trying to check in, to offer comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her smile was instant, but short-lived. Agatha stared at the photo for a moment, the warmth of it settling in her chest. But then reality hit, like a punch to the gut. She could feel the complications, the fear, the unspoken things weighing down on her, and the reminder of Rio’s vulnerability only added to the confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the phone in her hand for a moment longer, her thumb lingering over the screen, but before she could respond to Rio’s message, Wanda’s voice broke through the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been off ever since our night out with Rio and her band,” Wanda said, leaning forward in her chair. “You didn’t just toss and turn because of some restless night’s sleep. There’s something else going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart sank at Wanda’s perceptiveness. She had been trying so hard to keep everything at bay, to convince herself that she was in control. But Wanda could see right through her, as she always had. Agatha didn’t know how to explain, not yet, so she deflected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just… a lot on my plate, that’s all,” Agatha murmured, turning her attention back to the papers on her desk, though she didn’t really see them. “The usual. Running the school, keeping everything together… And Nicky’s been on edge lately. You know how it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda wasn’t fooled. She stood up and walked closer, crossing her arms as she leaned against the edge of Agatha’s desk. “You’re a terrible liar, Agatha,” she said softly, but there was a tenderness in her voice. “You’re not fine. And don’t try to tell me you are when you’ve been so quiet since that night. It’s not just Nicky you’re worrying about, is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, her gaze dropping to her hands. She couldn’t tell Wanda everything, not yet. It was too soon, too raw. But the words were so close to spilling out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you mean,” Agatha said, her voice barely above a whisper, though she knew it was no use.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes softened, but she wasn’t letting her off the hook. “I know you. You’re shutting yourself off, and I don’t think it’s just because of the usual stress. There’s something else eating at you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, looking up at Wanda, her eyes brimming with a mixture of frustration and vulnerability. She could feel her resolve crumbling. It wasn’t like she could keep pretending forever. She was trying so hard to hold everything together, but it was starting to feel impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone buzzed again, breaking the moment, and Agatha picked it up, letting the distraction pull her away from Wanda’s relentless gaze. It was Rio again. Agatha didn’t even bother to hide her smile this time, but it quickly faded as the reality of what she had to face sank in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the message from Rio:</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I know we left things in a weird place last night. Just wanted to make sure you’re doing alright.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back in her chair, a mixture of warmth and guilt blooming in her chest. She hadn’t realized just how much Rio had been thinking about her. The words hit a little too close to home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda noticed the change in Agatha’s face immediately, her gaze catching Rio’s name on her phone. “It’s her, isn’t it?” she asked, her voice soft. “It’s Rio. That’s what’s been on your mind, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She stared at the message on her phone, her finger hovering over the screen, unsure of what to say or how to respond. She had no idea how to process it all. Rio was reaching out, and part of Agatha wanted to reach back, but there were so many things left unsaid, so many unanswered questions. She had been so traumatized after James left her; she didn’t know if she was ready to dive into a relationship, especially not with someone who came with her own set of baggage that seemed to be so similar to her ex’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, sensing her hesitation, softened. “I don’t need all the details right now. But you’ve got to stop shutting people out, Agatha. Especially if you care about them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened at Wanda’s words, and she felt an overwhelming urge to confess everything that had been plaguing her. But instead, she only nodded slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what to do,” Agatha admitted, her voice tight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda studied her for a moment, then sighed and shook her head, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “Well, you can always try talking to her, maybe let your guard down just a little bit, Aggie. It won’t get any easier if you keep burying it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a shaky breath and finally hit reply to Rio’s text. She didn’t know what she was going to say yet, but it felt like the first step toward something. Maybe that was enough for now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she typed, Wanda turned to leave, pausing in the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll give you some space,” she said, her tone light. “But just know that I’m here when you need to talk. About anything. And you might want to take a breath before you hit send on that message.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled tiredly, looking up as Wanda left the office. She glanced back at the phone, rereading Rio’s message. Then, with a deep breath, Agatha finally started typing her response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her phone screen, the sunrise image bright and warm, an unexpected comfort. She hadn’t realized how much she needed it until now. Rio’s tired face peeking out from the edges of the frame made her heart ache in a way she wasn’t quite ready to acknowledge. It was a gentle reminder that Rio, too, wasn’t immune to the sleepless nights, that they both carried a weight on their shoulders—one that Agatha had been too busy with her own thoughts to consider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She typed a reply, fingers hesitant but needing to connect.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Thank you for the sunrise photo. I didn’t sleep much last night. My mind kept me up, but this was a nice distraction. I hope your morning’s going better than mine.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send, looking at the message for a moment, feeling vulnerable but also relieved. Rio’s simple gesture had broken through the barrier of exhaustion Agatha had put up around herself. She didn’t know what this connection was—didn’t even know what to call it—but the quiet understanding Rio’s photo brought her was something Agatha couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone buzzed moments later, and Agatha’s heart skipped when she saw it was Rio replying.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I didn’t sleep much either, if it helps. You know how it goes… sometimes your mind doesn’t want to shut off. But I’m pushing through today. I’ll bring you coffee next Wednesday. Looking forward to it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, picturing Rio’s easy smile. Despite the exhaustion that lingered in her words, Rio still had the ability to make Agatha smile.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Btw, I’ll be in the studio for the next few days working on the album. But I’ll check in on you now and then, if that’s okay. I’ll make sure to come back to you with better news next time.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart softened as she read the last line. Rio, despite everything, still made time for her, even if it was just in short text exchanges. It felt like more than she deserved, more than she’d ever anticipated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, thinking about the best way to respond. She settled on something simple, yet truthful.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’m glad you’re pushing through. I’ve been keeping myself busy with composing, though it hasn’t been easy. And Mia… Was that why she seemed upset yesterday? Because of the photos?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the message, wondering if she should say more, but finally pressed send, hoping Rio would understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t long before Rio’s reply came.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yeah. Some kids at her school were talking shit about it. About me. Apparently, they got spread around, and she’s been having a hard time with it. I didn’t know until she mentioned it last night. It’s one thing when it’s just me, but Mia… she doesn’t deserve that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart tightened as she read those words. She thought about Mia—the girl who had always seemed so strong, so composed—and realized just how fragile she was beneath the surface. The weight of Rio’s words hit her harder than she expected. She could feel the frustration and helplessness in Rio’s tone. It was a harsh reminder of the world Mia had to navigate, and how much of it Rio couldn’t protect her from.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’m sorry to hear that. She’s been such a strong presence during her lessons, I didn’t know it was affecting her so much. You’re right, though. She doesn’t deserve that. Kids can be ruthless sometimes.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause before Rio’s next text came through.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yeah, it’s not easy. You think you can protect them, but sometimes the world finds a way to break through. It sucks, and it’s a part of being in the public eye that no one warns you about. But I’m trying. I’m doing the best I can for Mia, even when it feels like I’m failing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted as she read Rio’s message. She hadn’t really understood before—hadn’t grasped the full weight of what it meant for Rio to be a famous mother, trying to protect her daughter from the prying eyes of the world. It wasn’t just the fame that made things difficult; it was the scrutiny, the way people always had an opinion about everything, including their families. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back, feeling a sense of empathy she hadn’t expected. She wasn’t sure if Rio would want to hear it, but she had to say something.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I can’t even imagine how hard it must be to have your personal life laid bare like that. You’re doing the best you can, Rio. I can see that. It’s not easy, but you’re not alone in this. If there’s anything I can do… I’m here.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send and sat back, unsure of what would come next. She hadn’t intended to say so much, but the words felt right. She hoped Rio would hear the sincerity in them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause, but then Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank you, Agatha. That means a lot more than I can say. I’ll keep you posted on Mia. I just want to make sure she knows I’ve got her back, even when it feels like the world’s against us.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled as she read Rio’s message. There was something in those words—something real, something raw—that connected them in a way Agatha hadn’t expected. She thought about how difficult it must be for Rio to constantly fight for her daughter’s peace of mind while also carrying the burden of her own public persona. It made Agatha respect her in a way she hadn’t before.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I know you do. And I know Mia knows it too. You’re stronger than you think, Rio</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, when Agatha hit send, she didn’t hesitate. It felt like the right thing to say. A reminder that, despite everything, they were all trying their best—both in their personal lives and in the world they lived in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she set the phone down, she couldn’t help but smile. There was something about Rio’s openness, her honesty, that made Agatha feel a little less alone in her own struggle. It wasn’t just a text—it was a moment of connection, one that made the weight of the day feel a little more manageable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Over the next few days, their texts became a regular, comforting rhythm. Agatha found herself checking her phone more often than usual, her heart skipping a beat whenever a message from Rio popped up. Rio’s messages were simple, but they had a way of making Agatha feel connected, especially on the days when she was buried in her work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, being the free-spirited soul she was, didn’t just text. She sent photos of everything she was doing: her bandmates huddled in the studio, guitar in hand, laughing between takes; the dimly lit recording booth with her mic set up; and even candid moments where she looked a little tired but undeniably happy, lost in the process of creating. The photos were snapshots of her world—unfiltered, raw, and filled with an energy Agatha couldn’t help but admire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One morning, Rio sent a photo of herself mid-jam session with her bandmates. She was hunched over her guitar, the intensity in her eyes palpable even in the blurry shot.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Here’s a sneak peek of our next album in the making! It’s chaos, but it’s the good kind. Hope your scales are going smoothly</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at the photo, glad to see Rio so engaged with her work, but a little part of her also felt a pang of envy. Rio’s world was vibrant, unpredictable, and full of noise. Agatha’s world, in comparison, was quieter—structured, precise. She replied, trying to match Rio’s energy.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’m getting there. I’ve been working on a performance for December—getting the right pieces together. It’s a bit slower than I’d like, but I’m getting there.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t send a photo right away, but then decided to share one of Nicky. He was in the living room, guitar in hand, fingers strumming through one of The Coven’s songs. His concentration was intense, his small hands making the chords with surprising ease. Agatha snapped the photo, sending it with a quick message:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Nicky’s taking after you. He’s been practicing one of your songs on his electric guitar. He’s obsessed with you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help the fond smile that stretched across her face as she watched her son play. His passion for Rio’s music was so pure, so innocent. He had no idea what it meant for Rio to be in the spotlight, but he loved her music for what it was. Agatha sent the photo, feeling a little vulnerable, wondering how Rio would react.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A minute later, Rio’s reply came through, this time with a photo attached. Rio was standing in front of a large speaker, headphones around her neck, the band huddled behind her. She looked exhausted, but there was a glint in her eye that made Agatha’s heart flutter.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s amazing! Tell Nicky he’s got a real talent for this. Maybe we’ll get him up on stage one day.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The thought of Nicky performing with Rio made Agatha’s heart race, but she pushed it away, focusing instead on how much Rio seemed to appreciate the gesture. The next message from Rio caught Agatha off guard.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>By the way, do you ever get the feeling like you’re just playing the same scale over and over? Sometimes I feel like we’re chasing the same sound, even when we think we’ve found something new. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was a simple question, but it made Agatha pause. The way Rio phrased it reminded her of the kind of deep thinking she had during her quieter, more introspective moments. She didn’t hesitate in responding.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>All the time. It’s like the sound is just out of reach, and no matter how much you try to get closer, it’s always just slightly beyond your fingertips. But when it clicks… it clicks. And that makes all the frustration worth it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She felt oddly connected to Rio in that moment. They were both chasing something—whether it was perfection in music or finding their own rhythm in life—but they were trying to find it in their own ways.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next few days, their messages continued to flow easily. Rio would share little behind-the-scenes photos of the studio, the band’s progress, and her sporadic moments of downtime. Agatha, in turn, would send pictures of her piano and the progress she was making on the December performance. She sent one particularly close-up shot of her hands on the keys, her fingers poised over the ivories, a reflection of her intense focus.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Here’s a bit of what I’m working on. It’s coming together, slowly but surely.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>This time she sent a video of her fingers working on the piano keys, and it seemed to prompt Rio’s response, which was both playful and sincere.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I love seeing these! You make it look so easy, but I know it’s anything but. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at that. The playfulness in Rio’s words felt like a bridge between their two worlds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout the week, the photos and texts became more than just exchanges—they were moments of connection. Agatha found herself looking forward to them, especially when Nicky would join her, eagerly showing her his progress with The Coven’s songs. One evening, after a particularly long day of practice, Agatha sent Rio a picture of Nicky mid-shred on his guitar.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Nicky’s getting better at this. I think he might be more of a rockstar than I realized.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s response came quickly, a photo of herself in the studio, a guitar slung over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Tell Nicky I’m coming for him. He’ll make one hell of a guitarist.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled at Rio’s words, and she realized that, despite the distance between them, Rio was making her feel like a part of something larger. It wasn’t just the music that connected them—it was their willingness to share these pieces of themselves, these little fragments of their worlds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Wednesday rolled around, Agatha was already looking forward to seeing Rio in person. The texts and photos had been enough to keep her heart light, but the anticipation of actually seeing Rio’s face again made her stomach flutter with nerves. She’d gotten used to their text exchanges, but she knew it would be different once they were face to face. Would Rio feel the same?</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in a while, Agatha allowed herself to imagine what might happen when they saw each other. There was something about this connection—something both exciting and terrifying—that made her feel like she was on the brink of something she hadn’t expected. She wasn’t sure where it would lead, but she was beginning to believe that, maybe, it was worth exploring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning passed in a blur for Agatha, as she tried to focus on her work. But with each passing hour, a feeling she hadn’t experienced in far too long fluttered inside her—anticipation. She caught herself glancing at the clock, counting the minutes, wondering if Rio would show up early again. It was a silly thing, really—just an exchange of coffee and pleasantries—but for some reason, she couldn’t help but feel the flutter of butterflies every time her phone buzzed, each time imagining Rio’s smile and that easy way she had of making everything feel just a little lighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a week since their last meeting, and even though Agatha had been cautious with her feelings—still unsure, still hesitant—she couldn’t deny how much she was looking forward to seeing Rio in person again. The past few days had felt like an odd dance between texts, brief moments of connection, and then pulling back. But today, with the promise of their actual interaction looming, Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the thought of finally getting to talk to Rio face to face again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the clock neared the hour, Agatha felt her excitement building. There was something about Rio’s energy that had a way of drawing her in, of making her forget the weight of her own careful self-protection. But Agatha wasn’t quite ready to throw caution to the wind. She couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like if she let herself fall into this…whatever this was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at the door, wishing for a moment that Rio would walk in a bit earlier, just so they could chat, just so she could see her again without the formalities of picking up Mia, without the tension of needing to keep things in check.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was something about Rio’s presence, something warm and confident, that had a way of making Agatha forget herself for a moment. But the next step—what came after this, what the two of them might even be heading toward—was a mystery.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, for now, she settled back in her seat, checking her watch again and allowing herself to smile, just a little, at the thought of Rio’s inevitable arrival.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped when she saw Rio step through the door a little earlier than expected, holding a tray with two cups of coffee and a box of pastries. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted into the room, mingling with the delicate sweetness of the pastries. Rio’s smile was as bright as ever, and there was something about her casual demeanor that made Agatha feel a little more at ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got you some coffee,” Rio said with a wink, setting the tray down on the small table in the center of Agatha’s office. “And something sweet, too. Thought you might need it after a long day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach gave an involuntary flutter at the sight of Rio’s thoughtful gesture, and she couldn’t help but smile. It was a simple thing, yet it spoke volumes. Rio had clearly put some thought into this, and the ease with which she navigated their dynamic made Agatha’s chest tighten in an unfamiliar way. She wasn’t sure what to make of it, but she couldn’t deny that she was happy Rio had arrived early.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in the direction of her office, and led them there quietly. The door clicked shut behind them, leaving just the two of them in Agatha’s office. The silence was comfortable, an unspoken understanding between them, as Rio set the tray with the coffee and pastries between them on the table. She sat down with an easy stretch, her posture relaxed but her gaze warm, like she was more than happy to share this quiet moment with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for letting me sneak in early,” Rio said, flashing a grin. “I figured we’d have a little time before Mia comes rushing in.” Her voice was easy, but there was a certain softness to it now—one that made Agatha’s chest tighten in a way she wasn’t prepared for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, still trying to shake off the weight of everything that had been on her mind. She took a sip of her coffee, the warmth settling in her hands, and then looked over at Rio. There was a part of her that had wanted to feel uncomfortable with Rio’s proximity, but somehow, it was different with Rio. She wasn’t sure why, but she found herself enjoying it, even in the midst of her own hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you came early,” Agatha admitted, her voice quieter than usual. “I’ve had a lot on my mind recently, and… well, it’s nice to have a bit of peace before the storm of kids arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back in her chair, her eyes catching Agatha’s with an openness that made something flutter in her stomach. “I get that,” she said, her voice warm. “I’m not exactly thrilled with what’s been going on either, but I’m glad we’re getting this time together. You’re easy to talk to, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught at the way Rio said her name—like it was something she’d been meaning to say for a while. Her heart skipped a beat. But instead of overthinking it, she focused on the moment, on the gentle ease between them, and how, for the first time in a long time, she didn’t feel like she had to keep her walls up so high.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Same here,” Agatha replied, setting her coffee down and glancing toward the pastries. She took a pastry from the box and broke off a small piece, offering it to Rio with a small, amused smile. “I’d like to think I’m more than just a piano teacher, you know. I can also appreciate a good pastry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, leaning in slightly as she accepted the piece from Agatha’s hand. “I can definitely appreciate that,” she said, her voice low as she took the bite. Her eyes lingered on Agatha for a moment longer than necessary before she casually reached for her own coffee. “So, how’s the performance prep going? Anything exciting coming up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, feeling the tension in her shoulders begin to melt as they fell into their conversation. “It’s actually been a lot of work,” she admitted. “I was invited to do this solo concert in December, and it’s got me busier than I expected. But it’s exciting too. It’s been a while since I’ve done something like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds amazing,” Rio said, her eyes brightening as she leaned forward just a little bit, a subtle shift that made Agatha notice how close Rio had become. “I wish I could come see it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach did another little flip at the idea. She hadn’t even considered Rio wanting to attend one of her performances, but the thought made something warm spread through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you’ll be welcome if you want to come,” Agatha replied, her tone a bit more open than she meant. “It’s a special one, for me, anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened as she looked at Agatha, her expression sincere. “I’d love that,” she said quietly, her voice almost hushed. “I really would.” She reached forward, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s hand in a casual but deliberate touch, and Agatha’s breath hitched at the unexpected connection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a dramatic gesture, just a simple touch. But the way Rio did it, with the lightest pressure on Agatha’s hand, made Agatha feel the warmth of it all the way down to her toes. Rio was still looking at her, and there was something in her eyes that made Agatha’s heart race a little faster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about you?” Agatha asked, trying to regain her composure as she met Rio’s gaze. “What’s been keeping you busy besides trying to be an angel in the studio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, the sound genuine and rich, and she leaned back in her chair, looking thoughtful for a moment. “Well, besides the band, there’s Mia,” she said, her voice softening a bit. “And… I’m always trying to figure out what’s next for us. It’s been a bit of a balancing act lately, trying to juggle everything without losing my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart tightened a little, and she leaned forward slightly. “I think you’re doing a great job, Rio,” she said, her voice quiet but sincere. “It’s not easy, having a teenager and all the pressure from being in the spotlight. It’s… it’s a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile softened, and she reached out again, her fingers gently brushing against Agatha’s hand once more. “Thanks,” she said, her voice full of gratitude. “It means a lot, hearing that from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped another beat at the contact, and for a moment, she forgot everything else—the doubts, the hesitations. All she could focus on was Rio’s hand against hers, the warmth of her touch, and the way Rio was looking at her like she had all the time in the world to just… be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only when a noise from the hallway startled them both that Agatha realized they had been caught in a quiet moment of connection, a moment that she wasn’t sure what to do with. But for now, she didn’t care. It was nice, feeling this way. And for the first time in a long while, Agatha let herself enjoy it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia would be here soon. Nicky would be following her shortly. But for now, it was just the two of them. And it felt like enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio sat in comfortable silence, each savoring their coffee, the moment between them stretching longer than either of them had expected. There was something about the quiet that was soothing, and Agatha found herself enjoying the way Rio seemed so at ease in her office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t expected Rio to feel so… familiar. But the way Rio leaned casually on the desk, the way she touched Agatha’s arm in passing when she made a joke about the pastries, was disarming in the best way. The lingering brush of Rio’s fingers against her skin made Agatha’s pulse quicken in a way she couldn’t entirely explain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what can I expect from your performance? I've never been to a concert like that.” Rio asked after a moment, her eyes soft but focused, taking in every detail of Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, setting her coffee cup down. “It’s a work in progress. I’m doing a few classical numbers, but I’m also including some of my own stuff. I’m still tweaking a few things, but it should be ready for December. I’ve got to get the students in shape for the recital too, which is a bit of a challenge. That’s coming up very soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her fingers brushing lightly over the edge of Agatha’s sleeve. It was a simple gesture, but it made Agatha’s breath catch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds like a lot,” Rio murmured. Her gaze flickered to Agatha’s hands, and before Agatha could pull back, Rio’s fingers traced the back of her hand, sending a little spark of warmth through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, her thoughts momentarily thrown off balance. “It is,” she said quietly, her voice almost betraying how her heart had started to race. But she wasn’t about to let herself get caught up in the heat of the moment—not yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to remind herself that they were just two people sitting and chatting, sharing coffee and pastries, with no real agenda. Except for maybe… her hand brushing against Rio’s wrist as she reached for her own coffee again. Just a moment of connection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to keep your hands to yourself, you know,” Rio said lightly, a playful glint in her eye, though there was something unspoken in her tone—something that made Agatha’s stomach twist in a way she didn’t want to examine too closely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a split second, the words hanging between them. Was that boldness something Agatha could handle? Could she risk letting herself get closer to Rio like that? She could feel her resolve crumbling bit by bit, and yet, she wasn’t sure if she was ready to surrender to it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the weight of Rio’s words linger in the air, and for a moment, she wasn’t sure if she’d misheard. But when Rio’s playful glint didn’t fade, when her fingers remained just a little too close, Agatha knew she had to decide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could keep herself in check, maintain that familiar distance—or she could take the risk, just a tiny one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a soft exhale, Agatha reached across the desk, her fingers brushing against Rio’s wrist in a gentle, almost tentative touch. It was just a fleeting contact, but it sent a ripple of warmth through her, her pulse quickening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t flinch, instead letting her gaze soften, her lips curving into a subtle smile. “Well, well,” she said, her voice still light but carrying an edge of something more. “I didn’t think you actually had it in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart raced at the feel of Rio’s touch lingering even after her fingers pulled away. She wasn’t used to this—this was new, this… connection that tugged at her in ways she couldn’t explain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers moved toward her hand again, this time brushing more deliberately across Agatha’s palm. The touch was soft but firm, as though Rio was silently inviting her to keep going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught, and for a split second, she considered pulling away, playing it safe, but the pull of curiosity won out. She hesitated, then leaned in slightly, her fingers resting lightly against the back of Rio’s hand. She could feel the warmth of her skin, the slight tremor in her own fingertips as they made contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a quiet laugh, a sound that made Agatha’s chest tighten in a way she didn’t want to acknowledge. “I’m starting to think you like it when I touch you,” Rio teased, her voice low, a little daring, as she flipped her hand up so their palms could meet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words made Agatha’s heart skip a beat. She wasn’t sure if she should pull back or lean into it. The moment felt too intimate, too real, but there was something irresistible about the way Rio’s hand lingered on hers, the way her body seemed to speak louder than the casual jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips parted, but before she could say anything, Rio’s thumb caressed her skin, sending a jolt through her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t keep your hands to yourself, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice nearly a whisper. The words made Agatha’s stomach flutter, a warmth spreading through her that had nothing to do with the coffee or the pastries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her resolve break just a little. She let out a soft sigh, her hand lifting, not out of hesitation but out of sheer curiosity. She placed her fingers on Rio’s wrist, feeling the pulse there, steady and calm. And for just a moment, she let herself linger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her eyes bright with something playful, something far more intimate than anything Agatha had expected to feel in that moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But just as quickly as the mood shifted, Nicky’s voice broke the spell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, guess what I learned today?” Nicky’s voice echoed through the door, and Agatha’s heart jumped at the sound, the reality of their situation sinking back in. She quickly pulled her hand away from Rio’s wrist, the warmth of the touch lingering on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky stepped into the office, his wide eyes scanning the room as he froze in his tracks. His gaze shot from Rio to Agatha, clearly confused by the scene unfolding before him. “Wait, Rio? What are you doing in here?” he asked, his voice higher than usual, surprised to see her there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was the first to recover, her grin slipping back into place as she leaned back against the chair, her posture casual and relaxed. “I was just hanging out with your mom. We’re having coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky blinked again, his eyes bouncing between Agatha and Rio, still processing the unexpected sight. “Uh, okay… I didn’t know you guys were hanging out like this.” He glanced back at Agatha, then back to Rio, still unsure of the situation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, still flustered but trying to regain her composure, smiled at Nicky. “Well, you know, Rio’s always popping by to check on you and your guitar playing. We were just having some coffee before you got back from school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked between the two of them, his expression shifting from surprise to curiosity. “Cool,” he said slowly, the moment of awkwardness quickly dissolving as his attention turned back to Rio. “So, what’s up with the band? You guys been working on new music? Mom mentioned the other day that you’ve been in the studio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as Rio and Nicky fell into an easy conversation, the tension from their brief moment of connection ebbing away. But inside, Agatha couldn’t shake the warmth that still lingered from their touches. She wasn’t sure what it meant or where it was going, but for now, she just let it sit, feeling both the pull and the uncertainty of it all.</span>

<p>
<span>The drive back from Sonata Grove felt longer than it should have, even with the LA traffic crawling by. Rio couldn’t shake the memory of the last hour spent with Agatha—how close they’d gotten in that moment, how easy it had felt to touch her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been an unexpected rush, like something she hadn’t even realized she was craving. She hadn’t planned on any of it—especially not letting her fingers brush against Agatha’s wrist or feeling that undeniable connection spark when Agatha had hesitated but then responded to her touch. That smile Agatha had given her when she finally let herself touch her back? It was like everything else had faded away, leaving just the two of them in that small, quiet room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha pulled away. She always did. Rio had noticed it the moment they’d first met: that guarded part of Agatha, that hesitation that ran deeper than Rio’s usual flirty encounters. Agatha wasn’t like other people. She wasn’t going to fall for charm or a pretty smile. She wasn’t even looking for anything—at least, Rio didn’t think so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But there was something there, something beyond the politeness and the professionalism. And Rio couldn’t ignore it. Not when it felt so right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gripped the steering wheel tighter as the thought flashed through her mind: What if I’m pushing too hard?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But at the same time, Agatha had been slowly but surely letting her in. She couldn’t stop thinking about the way they’d connected over something as simple as coffee and casual conversation. And about that split-second hesitation, when Agatha’s fingers had brushed against her wrist, when she’d allowed herself to soften just enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted more of that. Wanted to see if Agatha could let go of her walls, even just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that meant figuring out what Agatha wanted. And Rio wasn’t sure how to navigate this. She had always been confident in everything she did—her music, her band, even her relationship with Mia. But Agatha was different. Agatha had walls so high, so carefully constructed, Rio felt like she’d need a ladder just to peek over the top.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed bitterly to herself. Maybe she should start by being patient. The thought of waiting wasn’t something she liked—it never had been. But this… whatever this was with Agatha, it wasn’t something to rush. She didn’t want to push too hard, scare Agatha away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But what was the next step? She couldn’t just keep showing up with coffee and pastries. It had to mean something. There had to be a way to show Agatha she was serious without overwhelming her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t just let Agatha think that she wasn’t interested. She wanted Agatha to feel seen—to feel the way she made Rio feel when she’d responded to that first touch, that first little spark. There was a tenderness there that Rio didn’t usually have with anyone, and it both scared and excited her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed a plan. A way to get closer without forcing Agatha into something she wasn’t ready for. A way to show her, slowly, that there was more to this than just a passing attraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe next week, when she came back with coffee again, she could make it more personal. Maybe she could open up a little more about her own fears—the things she’d never talked about with anyone. About being a mother, about the loneliness of fame, about being a woman in the public eye who had to fight to be taken seriously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know yet, but she was going to figure it out. She just hoped that when the moment came, Agatha would be ready to take that next step with her, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That Friday night, Rio barely had time to breathe between the flashing cameras and the endless small talk. The premiere was massive—red carpets, high-profile celebrities, reporters crowding every inch of the space. It wasn’t her first time at an event like this, but it always felt surreal to be here, all because The Coven had a song on the movie’s soundtrack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had to admit, though—she looked good. Her stylists had outdone themselves. Her hair was swept back in loose, effortless waves, her makeup sultry but still fresh. She wore a perfectly tailored deep red suit, unbuttoned just enough to be suggestive, and beneath it, a black silk top that clung in all the right ways. When she caught her reflection in the windows of the theater, she had to smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah. She looked hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she wasn’t the only one who thought so. She’d lost count of how many people—some she knew, some she didn’t—had complimented her that night. It was part of the job, part of the whole rockstar package that she’d learned to embrace over the years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the only opinion that really mattered wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, in a moment of mischief (and maybe just a little bit of nerves), she snapped a selfie in the limo on the way to the afterparty. The lighting was moody, casting soft shadows over her jawline. She tilted her head slightly, lips just barely parted, and smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she sent it to Agatha.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Guess who got all dressed up tonight?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated only a second before adding another text.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Wish you were here to see it in person</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put her phone down, not expecting an immediate reply. Agatha wasn’t exactly the type to text back right away—especially not when Rio was being like this. Still, she couldn’t help but glance down every now and then as the limo crawled through LA traffic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You clean up nicely, Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. But then—another message.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A single emoji.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heart eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up straighter, staring at the screen like she’d imagined it. Agatha Harkness, queen of restraint, sent her a heart eyes emoji?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow, satisfied grin spread across Rio’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed to push her luck.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You just made my whole night, Harkness</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three dots appeared, then disappeared. Then reappeared again.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t let it go to your head.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, shaking her head. Too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The afterparty was in full swing by the time Rio arrived, but for the first time in a long time, she wasn’t all that interested. She made her obligatory rounds, chatting with some industry folks, accepting compliments about The Coven’s track on the soundtrack, even taking a few photos with fans who were lurking near the VIP section. It was all routine, all second nature by now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her mind wasn’t on the party. It was on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That damn heart eyes emoji had ruined her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept checking her phone like an idiot, hoping for another message, another tiny crack in Agatha’s careful restraint. But nothing else came.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, that didn’t mean she couldn’t do something about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slipping away from the crowd, she found a quieter corner near the balcony and snapped another photo—this time, in front of a full-body mirror. She angled it just right to capture the city lights behind her, the rich red of her suit standing out against the moody backdrop of the party.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Alright, but just to be clear—how nicely do I clean up, exactly?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send before she could second-guess herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seconds passed. A full minute. Two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wouldn’t you like to know?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she was in so much trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even hesitate before replying.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Yes. Yes, I would very much like to know.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply right away. It was a full thirty minutes later that her phone finally buzzed again. The venue was packed, music thrummed in her chest, and people kept pulling her into conversations, offering drinks, leaning in too close. But Rio had her phone in her hand—because of course she did. She’d been waiting.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Then I suppose you’ll just have to live with the mystery.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost choked on her champagne. Unbelievable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow grin spread across her face as she read it again. Agatha Harkness was teasing her. Actually teasing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she was so in trouble.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>That’s just cruel, Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned against the bar, absently swirling the last of her drink, her mind no longer in the room at all. Someone said her name, but she barely heard them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed again.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is it?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sharp laugh, shaking her head. She typed back quickly.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Oh, absolutely. You can’t just say something like that and then leave me hanging. That’s a crime.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The DJ switched tracks. A new wave of people moved toward the dance floor. Someone from the film crew clapped her on the shoulder, saying something about how amazing the band’s music sounded in the movie. Rio smiled, nodded—she thought she even managed a thanks—but her attention was entirely elsewhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m sure you’ll survive</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tapped her fingers against her thigh, her smile growing.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Barely</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause. A longer one this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone slid onto the stool beside her. A woman, gorgeous, red lips curving into something suggestive. “You look like you could use another drink.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at her, smiled politely, and turned back to her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re more dramatic than I expected.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, considering her response.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I contain multitudes, Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She finished off her champagne, set the glass down, and scanned the crowd absently. Somewhere, Alice was deep in conversation with a director. Natasha was charming her way through another industry connection. Jen had probably already snuck out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed again.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m starting to see that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a second, she forgot where she was. Forgot about the noise, the crowd, the weight of all these expectant eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was flirting with her. Subtly, yes—but she was engaging. She was giving Rio something to work with, something to hold onto.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wet her lips, tapping out her next message.</span>
</p><p align="right">

<span>You really know how to keep a girl on her toes.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the screen, willing another reply to come through. A full minute passed. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good night, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the words, an odd mix of frustration and delight pooling in her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was it? She was going to play coy and leave her like that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, that was hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Grinning to herself, Rio typed back one last message.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Good night, Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Then, before she could overthink it, she slid her phone into her pocket and turned back toward the party.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s house was alive with noise when she woke up. The smell of coffee and something frying drifted through the air, mingling with laughter and the low hum of conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned, shoving a hand through her already-messy hair as she rolled out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her band was still here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that she was surprised. They had a tendency to crash at her place after big nights out—especially Alice, who always claimed Rio’s couch was the best in L.A. And honestly? Rio didn’t mind. It was nice, in a way, to have people around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dragging her feet toward the kitchen, she spotted Mia already up, standing by the stove in deep conversation with Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, rubbing her eyes as she took in the scene. Mia looked…comfortable. Focused. Natasha, despite her usual </span>
<em>
<span>I do not do mornings</span>
</em>
<span> demeanor, was listening intently, nodding along as Mia spoke. It didn’t surprise her. Nat had always been Mia’s favorite Aunt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever they were talking about, it clearly mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled to herself. Then, without thinking twice, she walked up behind Mia and pressed a quick kiss to the top of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, mi amor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia made a face, half-heartedly swatting her away. “</span>
<em>
<span>Moooom,</span>
</em>
<span>” she whined teasingly, but that only made Rio hold onto her even tighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha snorted. “That’s the most affection I’ve ever seen you tolerate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes but didn’t move away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, grabbed a mug, and poured herself some coffee before sinking onto a stool at the kitchen island. The coffee was hot—too hot—but she didn’t care. She took a sip anyway, letting the warmth jolt her fully awake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, as naturally as breathing, she pulled out her phone and sent a text.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Good morning, Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send, barely hesitating, and exhaled as she set her phone down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was becoming a habit, this—reaching for Agatha first thing in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that? That was dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took another sip of her coffee, watching Mia and Natasha with mild curiosity. They were still deep in conversation—something about music theory, she realized. Mia was animated, explaining something with her hands, and Natasha was nodding along like it was the most interesting thing she’d ever heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a good look on Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could dwell on that thought too long, her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good morning, Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She huffed out a laugh. Of course Agatha would match her energy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Did you even sleep?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, about to type a response when a loud groan came from the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shuffled in first, looking half-dead, her red streaks sticking up in every direction. “Coffee,” she croaked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer followed, looking a little more put together but still moving slowly. “How the hell do you look functional already?” she grumbled at Rio, grabbing a mug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thrive on chaos,” Rio said, grinning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha raised a brow at her. “And yet, you were the first to crash last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not the first,” Rio corrected, glancing at Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia looked unimpressed. “You passed out on the couch like an old lady.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rude,” Rio muttered, though she wasn’t entirely offended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed again.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Or are you still running on whatever kept you awake last night?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hid a grin behind her mug.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Are you asking if you kept me up, Harkness?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply immediately, which made Rio bite her lip. She imagined her frowning at the screen, debating whether or not to dignify that with an answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice slumped onto a stool, eyeing the eggs Natasha was scrambling. “Are we just now starting breakfast?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s more like brunch at this point,” Jennifer muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shrugged. “I wasn't hungry earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice made grabby hands toward the pan. “Love that for you, but I am starving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let the noise wash over her as she checked her phone again. Still no reply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took another sip of coffee, drumming her fingers on the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Come on, Harkness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio’s phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m not dignifying that with a response.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, imagining Agatha’s exasperated look.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So that’s a yes?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Drink your coffee, Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, setting her phone down just as Alice dropped onto a seat next to her, rubbing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, sunshine,” Rio said with a grin, knowing full well Alice was always the last one to rise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Alice mumbled, stealing a piece of toast off Mia’s plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia immediately swatted her hand away. “I was going to eat that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, come on, Mia. Share the wealth,” Alice said, her voice a little too cheerful for the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes but didn’t respond, just grabbed another piece of toast for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer sat across from Rio, looking at her thoughtfully. “You’re up early today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coffee’s good,” Rio said, taking another sip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice raised an eyebrow. “What’s with the smile?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “Nothing,” she shrugged, but couldn’t help but look down at her phone again, her fingers itching to text Agatha back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure?” Jennifer asked with a teasing grin, “You’ve got that look like you’re texting someone special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just shrugged, hiding the smile that was creeping up on her face again. “I’m just texting. Nothing special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Sure</span>
</em>
<span>.” Alice looked at Jennifer and smirked. “We’ll just keep our eyes open.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia snorted. “You’re both ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” Alice muttered. “Just tell us if anything happens. No one has the patience for your mystery, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha wandered in, clearly having heard some of the chatter. “Let’s all just enjoy our breakfast and stop trying to dissect Rio’s love life for the tenth time year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer rolled her eyes. “You’re no fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia, who had been pretending to ignore them, finally spoke up. “Can we please just eat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was about to respond, but Rio quickly shot her a look. “Later,” she muttered, trying to deflect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, they all settled into a comfortable quiet as Mia went back to her toast, and the others started talking about their plans for the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s phone buzzed again, and she glanced at it quickly, smiling as she saw Agatha’s text.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So how was your big night out last night?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Oh, I thought you were already done with me. And the premiere was wonderful, thanks for asking. Wish you were there with me, though. Also, does this mean I get to keep texting you, or have I exhausted my Harkness quota for the week? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The reply came almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’d never stop even if I told you to.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled at Agatha ignoring half her message, but let it slide for now.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Damn right. You know me so well already.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She felt a sense of satisfaction at the easy banter, despite the chaos of the morning around her. It was something she hadn’t expected to find, but she was happy to enjoy it, especially as she finished her coffee in the calm before the rest of the band became a bit more vocal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sprawled out on the couch, lazily scrolling through her phone while sipping at her now lukewarm coffee. The house was still shaking off the last bits of sleep—Natasha and Mia were still in the kitchen, deep in conversation, while Jennifer nursed her coffee and Alice lay half-conscious on the armchair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t much of a morning person, but today, she was feeling good. She had that easy kind of contentment humming under her skin—the kind that came from a night of good music, good friends, and, most importantly, good flirting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled as she tapped out a message.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>What’s on the agenda for today?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha answered quicker than expected.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I was thinking about taking Nicky out for a bit. Maybe to the park. Get some fresh air.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. Yeah, that sounded about right. Agatha would take him, watch him run around, pretend to be completely engrossed in a book or her phone, but she’d really be watching him the whole time, soft in a way she probably didn’t even realize.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, okay, maybe Rio wanted to see that for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, elbows on her knees.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Or…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She let the message sit there, dramatic pause and all.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You could come over instead</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few seconds passed. Then the typing bubble appeared. Then it disappeared. Then it came back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could practically see Agatha’s frown.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>To your place?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>That is what “come over” usually means, yes.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Long pause.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and let her head fall back against the couch. This woman.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Because I’m grilling today. And you like food. And I like your company. And Nicky seems like the type of kid who could demolish an entire rack of ribs.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Still nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tapped her fingers against her thigh, thinking. Then she went for it.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Or is it that you’re scared of seeing me again?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>That got a response fast.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m not scared of you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, triumphant.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So you do want to see me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That is not what I said.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she was enjoying this way too much.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You didn’t deny it, either.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tapped her fingers again, then went for the killing blow.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Besides, if you say no, I’ll be forced to text you every thirty minutes with updates about my day. And you don’t want that, do you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>That got her another quick response.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>My God, you’re exhausting.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>And yet, you’re still talking to me. Fascinating.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, waiting. She knew Agatha. Knew she was probably pinching the bridge of her nose, sighing dramatically, coming up with a million reasons to say no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked at her phone, stretching her legs out on the couch as she read Agatha’s latest reply.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s not appropriate.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, now they were getting somewhere.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Define “appropriate.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm Mia's teacher. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. Of course Agatha was worried about that. It was such an Agatha thing to say—always thinking about structure and boundaries and professionalism. Meanwhile, Rio was over here just thinking about how good she’d looked the last time they were together and how much she wanted to see that tiny, reluctant smile again.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Mia likes you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s beside the point.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>No, it’s exactly the point. If she had a problem with you coming over, I wouldn’t invite you. But Mia is fine. She’s always fine when you’re around. Probably because she knows you’re not secretly plotting to corrupt her with rock and roll.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a slow sip of coffee, feeling the victory before it even happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s still not appropriate.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her head fall back against the couch, groaning dramatically. She sat up again, rolling her shoulders before typing out her next attack.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Okay, let’s pretend you’re right. Let’s say it’s wildly inappropriate for you to eat food with me in a setting where other people will be present. That doesn’t explain why you haven’t just said no and ended this conversation.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grinned. Got her.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>It’s because you want to come over. You just need to find an excuse good enough to let yourself do it.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<span>Still nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time to push a little harder.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Come onnnn, Agatha. I’m literally giving you the perfect excuse. Nicky. You’re not coming for me. You’re coming because I invited your son. You’re being a good mother, bringing him to a fun day with music and food and his favorite rock band. What’s inappropriate about that?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another long pause. Then, finally—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You are insufferable.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Yes, but I’m also right.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a minute of nothing. Then two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started to wonder if she’d gone too far—if she’d pushed too hard, made Agatha retreat back into that shell of hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What time?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Let's say 1:30-ish? Bring your appetite. And your kid. And that pretty little face of yours.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely held back a victorious grin as she stared at Agatha’s last message.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh, she was so pleased with herself right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced herself to take a slow sip of coffee like she wasn’t vibrating with satisfaction. Across the room, Alice, Natasha, and Jennifer were talking about their plans for the day, completely oblivious to the miracle that had just occurred in Rio’s text messages.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should play it cool. Not react. Just quietly celebrate this win in her own head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she saw the three dots appear again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another message.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t push your luck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And that? That made Rio’s grin slip free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer glanced at her. “What are you grinning at?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers curled tighter around her phone as she stretched her legs out, trying to feign nonchalance. “Nothing,” she said easily. “Just winning a battle of wills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice snorted. “So you’re annoying someone into submission. Got it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha hummed. “Hope it’s not our manager. You already drive her up the wall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please.” Rio rolled her eyes. “If it was Michelle, I’d be getting a million passive-aggressive emails right now. Not texts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all seemed to accept that answer, Natasha returning to her coffee, Alice flipping through her phone, Jennifer leaning into the counter to steal a piece of toast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And meanwhile, Rio just sat there, pretending to be completely normal while staring at Agatha’s last text like a lovesick fool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>1:30pm. She was coming over at 1:30pm.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set her coffee down and turned to Mia, who was scrolling through her phone at the kitchen counter. With the band chatting amongst themselves in the background, Rio seized the moment to speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So… Agatha and Nicky are coming over in a bit for a barbecue,” Rio said, her voice casual. “I figured it’d be nice to hang out, get to know each other outside of all the lessons and stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia glanced up, her eyebrow raised. “Agatha? As in Agatha Harkness, my piano teacher?” she asked, as if she was trying to understand if Rio was joking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that Agatha,” Rio confirmed, giving her a small smile. “She and Nicky are coming over. It’ll be fun. Just a chill afternoon, some food, music—nothing big.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s expression turned more skeptical, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the need to tread carefully. She wasn’t sure how Mia would react to the situation. “No reason, sweetheart. Just to hang out. You’re fine with that, right? It’ll just be a relaxed hangout. Agatha is great… so is Nicky. So I invited them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia paused for a moment, her gaze lingering on Rio as if she was piecing things together. “And this is just a barbecue? Nothing else? No… other plans?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, trying to diffuse the tension. “Yes, just a barbecue. I promise, Mia, it’s nothing complicated. I just thought it’d be nice to have Agatha and Nicky over—get to know them a bit more. You don’t have to worry about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t seem entirely convinced, her lips pressing into a thin line. “I don’t know, Mom… it just feels weird, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, offering a reassuring smile. “It’s just a casual hangout, sweetheart. You don’t have to feel awkward. I wouldn’t invite them over if I thought it would make you uncomfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave her a doubtful look, still hesitant. “Well, as long as it’s just the barbecue. I don’t want to deal with anything weird, Mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, understanding her daughter’s need for reassurance. “Of course. Just a laid-back afternoon. Nothing weird, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia seemed to relax a little, but she wasn’t entirely sold yet. She let out a sigh, clearly still mulling it over. “Alright, fine. But if it gets weird, you’re dealing with it, not me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, grateful for Mia’s understanding. “Deal. Thanks, kiddo.” She patted Mia on the head, her hand lingering for a second longer than usual. “It’s going to be fun, you’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia rolled her eyes playfully but didn’t argue further, which Rio took as a win.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio heard the familiar hum of activity from the other room—her bandmates bickering over something trivial, as always—she knew it was time. It was almost time for Agatha and Nicky to arrive, and Rio was simultaneously excited and a little bit nervous. She quickly texted Agatha her address, making sure to send a quick </span>
<em>
<span>See you soon </span>
</em>
<span>before she started getting ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to overthink it, but at the same time, she wanted to look good. Something casual, but still… well, sexy. It was a fine balance, but Rio knew she had it in her. She slipped into a loose-fitting blouse that had a deep V-neck—just enough to show off a little skin without being too revealing—and paired it with a pair of dark jeans that hugged her hips in all the right ways. Simple, but flattering. Comfortable, but still sexy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she caught her reflection in the mirror, she made a quick adjustment to her hair, running her fingers through it to give it that effortless, just-woke-up-but-still-gorgeous look. After a quick glance at her phone, she saw Agatha’s message. She’d gotten the address. That made Rio smile, a thrill running through her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Time to face the music, she thought, walking toward the kitchen, where the rest of her bandmates were still hanging around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She approached them, trying to act casual as she slipped her phone into her pocket. “So, I may have invited Agatha and Nicky over,” Rio said, her voice nonchalant, though she could feel a hint of nervous energy bubbling beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha, who was leaning against the counter sipping coffee, looked up with a raised eyebrow. “Agatha? Your daughter’s piano teacher, right? The one we met a couple of weeks ago?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep,” Rio said, nodding. She glanced over to where Alice and Jennifer were laughing at something on their phones. “I thought it would be nice for us all to hang out. You know, get to know each other outside of the whole teacher-student thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice chuckled. “You, getting all domestic with a piano teacher. I did not see that coming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I didn’t say it’s anything serious. Just a barbecue. But I figured it’s about time we all spend some time together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer raised an eyebrow. “She’s the one you’ve been texting a lot lately, isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a second, her heart skipping a beat. Was she being too obvious? She gave a quick, nonchalant shrug. “Maybe. She’s just been nice to talk to. But it’s not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, sure, if you say so,” Natasha teased with a wink. “Good luck with that, though. Looks like it could get… interesting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a grin. “If you guys want to stick around and make things more interesting, feel free. But just, you know…behave. Don’t make it weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she finished getting ready, Rio texted Agatha again, just to make sure everything was still on track. </span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’m all set. Come on over whenever you’re ready. See you soon.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>When she received the reply, she couldn’t help but smile. Agatha was on her way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could hardly contain her smile as she opened the door, seeing Agatha and Nicky standing there, looking almost…normal. Well, as normal as one could look when walking into the world of a rock band and a famous musician’s home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Rio greeted, her voice a little too bright, but she didn’t care. The excitement was bubbling up inside her, and she was eager to have them over. “Nicky, Agatha—come on in!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face lit up the second he stepped inside. He took in the space like it was some kind of sacred ground. Rio couldn’t help but laugh softly, realizing just how much of an effect her life—her band, her music—had on him. It was endearing. It made her want to be the best version of herself, for him, for Agatha, for everyone in her life who cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio stepped aside to let Agatha and Nicky into the house, her heart picked up a little. There was something about Agatha’s presence, something that made the air feel a little heavier in the best way possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for coming, Agatha,” Rio said, her voice softer as she turned to face her. “I’m really glad you guys could make it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her eyes warm as she looked at Rio. “Of course. Nicky’s been so excited about meeting everyone,” she said, her voice calm, but there was a slight nervousness in her gaze. Rio noticed it—Agatha was still holding herself back a little. But then again, that was Agatha: always measured, always controlled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped a little closer, then, without overthinking it, leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek. The brief contact sent a wave of warmth through her, and she was surprised at how natural it felt. She lingered there for a second, her lips barely brushing the soft curve of Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a moment, her eyes flickering up to meet Rio’s. For just a beat, Rio thought maybe she’d gone too far, but then Agatha smiled, her cheeks flushing just a little. Rio could feel her heart rate pick up as she pulled back slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio said with a grin, her voice a little breathless, though she didn’t know why. “I’ve been wanting to do that all week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile was gentle but real, a little shy but no less genuine. “Hi,” she echoed, her tone soft but full of meaning. Rio swore she saw something behind Agatha’s eyes, something that mirrored the way her own heart had been racing this entire time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Rio said, clearing her throat and quickly changing the subject to cover up her slight fluster. “Come on. Let’s go outside before Nicky explodes with excitement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Rio motioned for them to head toward the back door. Nicky had already dashed ahead, his excitement impossible to contain, and as Agatha followed Rio outside, she could feel the casual energy of the backyard’s atmosphere setting in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped into the backyard, Nicky was already surrounded by Rio’s bandmates. He was practically vibrating with excitement, nervously fidgeting with the sleeve of his shirt. Natasha was the first to spot him, smiling warmly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey there, Nicky!” she greeted, walking over and giving him a friendly handshake. “We’ve been hearing a lot about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes grew wide, clearly a little starstruck. “Really?” He grinned, his face lighting up. “I’ve been hearing a lot about you guys too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer smiled at him and ruffled his hair. “It’s awesome to finally meet you in person. Rio is always talking about how great you’re doing with the guitar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Rio’s been teaching me some of your songs,” Nicky said, beaming. “I hope I don’t embarrass her when I play them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her smile proud. “Don’t worry, kiddo. You’re doing great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice, who had been leaning casually against the grill, straightened up when she saw Nicky’s excitement. “I’ve been looking forward to meeting you too,” she said, walking over to shake his hand. “Anytime Rio’s excited about someone, you know it’s a big deal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned even wider. “Well, I’m a huge fan, so this is definitely a big deal for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come hang out with us,” Jennifer said, motioning to the rest of the band. “We’re just getting the grill fired up. I’m sure we could talk music for hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded enthusiastically, eagerly following Jennifer over to the grill while Agatha and Rio walked together to one of the seating areas in the backyard. Rio couldn’t help but notice how Agatha’s smile had softened watching Nicky interact with the band. It was easy to see how proud she was of her son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they settled down on the comfy chairs, Rio couldn’t resist looking at Agatha again, taking in the way she seemed to be relaxing into the moment. There was something about Agatha’s calm presence that made Rio feel like everything was falling into place, even though neither of them were saying much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the conversation around the grill continued with Nicky happily chatting away, the back door opened, and Mia stepped outside, a little hesitant at first. Her eyes scanned the backyard, and when they landed on her mom and Agatha, her pace faltered. Her gaze lingered on Agatha, and it was clear she was a little uncomfortable seeing her teacher here in this setting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio noticed Mia’s hesitation immediately. She gave her daughter a soft smile and a small wave. “Hey, sweetheart. You already know Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded slowly, her cheeks flushing ever so slightly. “Of course, Mom,” she said, her voice a little quieter than usual. She shifted awkwardly, her fingers playing with the hem of her shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha noticed the discomfort in Mia’s posture and offered a warm smile, trying to ease the tension. “Hi, Mia. It’s good to see you outside of class,” she said, her tone friendly and approachable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia smiled back, but it was more of a polite gesture than the usual easy grin Agatha had seen from her. “Hi, Ms. Harkness,” she replied, looking down for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered a smile, shaking her head. “Just Agatha is fine, Mia. We’re not in class.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, sensing the awkwardness, gently nudged her daughter’s shoulder. “Come on, don’t be shy. I’m sure Agatha’s been telling Nicky all sorts of things about you,” she teased lightly, hoping to break the ice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s eyes flicked to Nicky, who was still animatedly discussing one of The Coven’s songs with the band. She seemed to relax a little, her shoulders dropping slightly. “I guess so,” she said, but there was a faint hint of uncertainty in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, noticing Mia’s unease, decided to steer the conversation toward safer ground—something they both could connect on. “Actually,” she said with a soft smile, “I’ve been meaning to ask you, Mia—how’s that new piece we’ve been working on? The one you were mastering last week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s face lit up a little at the mention of her music. She looked up, eyes shining with a small sense of pride, though she still seemed to hold herself back slightly. “Oh! It’s going really well. I finally got through the tricky part at the end—where it jumps into the higher octave, that I kept messing up, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s fantastic!” Agatha said with genuine enthusiasm. “You’ve been making such great progress. It’s really impressive to see how you’re growing with your music.” She paused and gave Mia a moment to settle before adding, “Maybe when you’re ready, we can play it together? You could show me what you’ve learned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s posture softened, and she gave Agatha a small but grateful smile. “Yeah, I’d like that,” she said, her voice a little more confident now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the exchange with a mix of relief and admiration. She knew how much Mia struggled with being in the spotlight, especially when it came to the expectations placed on her because of her connection to Rio. Seeing Agatha’s warm and patient approach made her feel grateful that her daughter had such a supportive teacher.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, still talking with the band, didn’t notice the shift in conversation. But Agatha’s easygoing nature and her genuine interest in Mia’s music were helping to ease the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia, now feeling a little more at ease, took a step forward. “So, um, what’s your favorite piece to play, Agatha?” she asked, her curiosity peeking through the previous awkwardness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly. “That’s a tough question. But if I had to choose, I’d say I’ve always loved playing Chopin’s Nocturnes. There’s something so beautiful and delicate about them. Do you like his music?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, seeming genuinely interested now. “I think I’d like to learn some of his stuff, actually. Maybe after I finish the piece I’m working on,” she added, glancing down at her feet for a moment, still a little shy but more relaxed. “Would that be okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds like a great plan,” Agatha encouraged, her tone kind and patient. “We can take it slow—one note at a time. You’ve got the skill to master anything you set your mind to, Mia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave a more confident smile this time, her shoulders fully relaxing. “Thanks, Agatha. I think I’ll try that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, watching the interaction, couldn’t help but feel a swell of pride for both her daughter and Agatha. The two of them had a way of connecting that made her heart feel a little lighter. Mia was getting more comfortable, and Agatha was making it happen in the quietest, most natural way possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Rio said, stepping forward with a grin. “I think it’s time for some food. Nicky’s definitely going to eat us out of house and home if we don’t serve him soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia chuckled at that. “I’m pretty sure he’s already eaten half of the chips,” she said with a raised eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds about right,” Rio said with a laugh. “Come on, let’s eat before he decides to start on the barbecue sauce.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia and Agatha both chuckled, and the group moved toward the grill, the atmosphere lightening further as they sat down to enjoy the afternoon. Agatha, once again, had proven to be a calming presence for Mia, easing the tension that had been there since she first arrived.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours later, the beer had flowed freely, the air full of chatter and laughter. The band had already started setting up outside for an impromptu jam session, much to Nicky’s excitement. Rio couldn’t help but smile at how delighted he looked. It was one of those moments where everything felt easy, and the day seemed to stretch on with no end in sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had slipped away from the group when Agatha excused herself to go to the bathroom. Rio had been content to watch her leave, a gentle smile tugging at her lips. She loved seeing Agatha in her element with Nicky, being so… unguarded. Rio admired her, more than she had expected. There was something about Agatha that made her feel like she could breathe a little easier, and after the tension of the past few weeks, that felt like a gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Standing in the hallway, Rio found herself staring at the spot where Agatha had gone, absently running a hand through her hair. She didn’t know what she expected when she invited Agatha here today. She just knew she wanted to spend time with her, and now that she had, she realized just how badly she craved her presence. It had been too easy to fall into the comfortable rhythm between them, their playful banter punctuated by moments of surprising sincerity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, the door opened, and Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, looking as effortlessly graceful as always. Rio took a step toward her before she even realized she was moving, her heart skipping a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’re you holding up?” Rio asked, leaning casually against the wall. She let her eyes roam over Agatha’s form as she approached, not bothering to hide the playful glint in her gaze. “Has my delightful band of misfits made you want to run screaming for the hills yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laughter was like music to Rio’s ears, and Rio could feel her shoulders relax. There was something about the way Agatha smiled that made Rio’s chest tighten, an unfamiliar but welcome sensation. It made her wonder what it would be like to see that smile more often.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha replied with a soft laugh, shaking her head. “Though I’m starting to think Nicky might end up coming home with more stories about The Coven than he’ll know what to do with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, the thought of Nicky spending time with her bandmates making her heart flutter. “They do have that effect on people,” Rio replied with a chuckle, stepping closer to Agatha. “But they mean well. I’m really glad you’re here though,” she added, her tone softening. “It’s nice, you know? Hanging out without all the… noise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a brief silence between them, and Rio felt herself drawn in by Agatha’s presence. Agatha had this way of making Rio feel both completely seen and, somehow, invisible. It wasn’t in an uncomfortable way—it was like she was quietly giving Rio permission to just… be. Rio didn’t have to be “the rockstar” or anything else, just Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you invited us,” Agatha said, her voice low, sincere, and Rio could feel her pulse quicken. The smile Agatha gave her then sent a wave of warmth through Rio’s chest. She had no idea how she managed to stumble into a moment like this, but she didn’t want it to end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you came,” Rio replied simply, her gaze softening. She took a small step toward Agatha, and their proximity made the air between them hum with an electric energy that Rio had never felt before. It was unsettling, thrilling, and a little bit terrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was strange, Rio realized, how easily the space between them had closed. She hadn’t planned for any of this—didn’t even know it would feel like this. She was used to playing it cool, used to being the one in control of situations like this, but with Agatha, everything was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it’s safe to say you’re stuck with me for a while,” Rio said, her voice playful again, but her eyes were soft as she met Agatha’s gaze. She meant it, even though she wasn’t sure what exactly “stuck with me” meant. She just wanted this moment to last longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze flickered to the instruments being passed around outside, and for a brief second, Rio swore she saw a hint of nervousness there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s see how Nicky handles the band’s performance first,” Agatha teased, nudging Rio gently before walking past her toward the back door. “But, yeah. I think I can handle it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her go, her chest tightening at the words. “Good,” she murmured under her breath, a smile tugging at her lips as Agatha turned her back. “I’m looking forward to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the wall for a moment longer, her heart still pounding in her chest. She had no idea what exactly was happening between her and Agatha—maybe it was just the connection they shared, the way they were able to talk so freely without any pretense. Whatever it was, Rio wanted more of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was certain about one thing: she didn’t want to let Agatha slip away.</span>
</p><p>

<p>As Agatha stepped out of the house and back into the bright afternoon sun, she found the scene outside bustling with energy. The band had already started setting up their instruments, their laughter floating through the air like the familiar hum of a well-loved song. Nicky was standing in the middle of it all, his small hands wrapped reverently around one of the guitars. His eyes were wide with awe, his excitement palpable, and it was hard not to smile at how much he looked like he was living a dream.</p><p>But even as she felt that warmth in her chest, a flutter of nerves stirred beneath it. The day had already been such a whirlwind—spending time with Rio, getting to know her bandmates better, and now, as she watched Nicky hold the guitar with such care, a new wave of uncertainty washed over her. She’d known Rio’s friends from that night at the club, and while they had all been kind, it felt different now. Now, it wasn’t just some happenstance casual gathering—it was real. And Agatha wasn’t entirely sure how to handle it.</p><p>Her eyes automatically searched for Rio, who was now helping to get a few more instruments outside. The sight of her made Agatha’s pulse quicken—her natural charisma, the way she effortlessly commanded the space around her. She had no idea what was happening between them—what any of it meant—but she couldn’t deny that the connection between them felt… undeniable. </p><p>She couldn’t remember the last time she felt this drawn to someone, this compelled to be near them. She couldn’t quite pinpoint it, but Rio had a way of making everything else fade into the background when they were together.</p><p>Agatha smiled softly as she watched Nicky strum the guitar gently, his eyes still wide, his hands tentative but growing more confident by the second. It was clear he was in awe of being this close to the band, let alone holding one of their prized instruments.</p><p>“You like it, buddy?” Agatha asked as she approached, her voice soft, careful not to startle him.</p><p>Nicky’s head shot up, and his face lit up with a grin so wide it nearly reached his ears. “It’s their guitar,” he said in a hushed voice, like he was afraid he might be dreaming. “The one they play in all their songs.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart softened as she watched him gently pluck a string, his fingers unsure but determined. “Yeah, it is,” she said, her voice thick with affection for how much this meant to him. “Don’t go breaking it now, alright?”</p><p>He laughed, but there was an edge of reverence in it. “I won’t,” he promised, before going back to playing the guitar with a little more confidence.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha just stood there, her arms folded across her chest, watching Nicky lose himself in the music, absorbed in the magic of being so close to something he had admired for so long. It was one of those quiet moments she knew would stay with him for the rest of his life, and in some way, it felt like she was holding her breath—like the world was holding its breath with her—waiting to see where this would all lead.</p><p>She could feel a tug on her heart, a mixture of pride and something else she couldn’t quite identify. She was more than happy that Nicky was here, happy that he was surrounded by people who genuinely seemed to care about him. But she also couldn’t ignore the small voice in the back of her head, the one that had been questioning her decision to come here in the first place. Could she really do this? Could she really just let herself get swept up in all of this—the laughter, the music, the easy way Rio made her feel?</p><p>Agatha knew she wasn’t one for spontaneous decisions, and everything about today had felt like an unpredictable, uncertain choice. But at the same time, a part of her had welcomed it—welcomed the idea of getting lost in the moment. For once, she didn’t have to think about the next step, the next responsibility. It felt… freeing.</p><p>But just as quickly as that feeling came, it was replaced with a new kind of uncertainty.</p><p>What exactly was this between me and Rio?</p><p>She shook her head softly, her thoughts threatening to spiral before she could catch them. She hadn’t even realized that Rio had stepped up beside her until the sound of her voice cut through the moment, low and soothing.</p><p>“Does he look like he’s in heaven or what?” Rio asked with a grin, leaning a little closer to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha glanced over at Rio, her breath catching slightly as their eyes met. Rio’s casual confidence, her openness, all of it seemed to wash over Agatha in waves, making her heart race in a way she hadn’t expected.</p><p>“He’s definitely in heaven,” Agatha replied, managing a soft smile. Her gaze lingered on Rio for a moment longer than she intended. “I think he’ll be telling this story for years.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, her voice dropping an octave, playful yet teasing. “Well, you can tell him you were the one who made it all possible.” She nudged Agatha’s arm with her elbow. “You’re a hero in his eyes.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help but smile. “That’s a bit much, don’t you think?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her grin growing wider. “Not at all. I mean, come on. He gets to hang out with The Coven and you brought him here. What’s not to love?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Nicky’s voice cut through their banter.</p><p>“Can I keep it?” he asked, holding the guitar a little more carefully now, his eyes hopeful.</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, the playful glint never leaving her eyes. “What do you think? Should we let him keep the guitar?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched in her throat, and for a moment, all she could do was smile at Nicky’s excited face. She could already imagine how much he would treasure this moment, the memory of it locked away for years to come.</p><p>“Maybe for today,” Agatha said, her voice filled with warmth. “But only if you promise not to drop it.”</p><p>Nicky’s grin widened, and Rio gave Agatha a playful nudge, as if to say, See? You’re a hero in his eyes.</p><p>And Agatha? She just laughed. Because maybe—just maybe—Rio was right.</p><p>As Nicky clutched the guitar with a mix of awe and excitement, Agatha felt a warmth spread through her chest. Watching her son, so engrossed in this rare moment, made everything worth it. </p><p>It also reminded her how important it was to let him experience life outside of his usual routine, to let him chase after these fleeting, magical moments. A part of her had always been so cautious about protecting him from the unknown, from the chaos of a world filled with unexpected twists. But today, seeing the joy on his face, she realized maybe she had been too protective. Sometimes, letting go was just as important as holding on.</p><p>Rio’s teasing nudge brought Agatha back to the present. She shot Rio a look, one of half-mock annoyance, half-amusement, but there was something in Rio’s gaze—a lightness, an invitation to not take everything so seriously—that made Agatha feel like she was breathing a little easier than she had been all day.</p><p>“So, are we ready to do this?” Rio asked, her voice dropping low again, her eyes scanning the group starting to gather. The bandmates were chatting and adjusting their instruments, and even Nicky seemed to be getting ready to strum a few more chords, his fingers growing more confident with each passing second.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a moment before nodding, the warm feeling in her chest creeping into her throat. She wasn’t used to being part of something this spontaneous, this… carefree. But Rio had a way of making it feel natural, like the music and laughter were a language they all spoke fluently.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said softly, her eyes lingering on Nicky as he tentatively strummed a few more notes. “I think we’re ready.”</p><p>Rio flashed her a grin. “Good. I’ve got a feeling this is going to be fun.”</p><p>The band had finished getting everything ready, and before Agatha knew it, they were all taking their places around the makeshift stage outside. Nicky was practically bouncing on his feet, clearly itching to jump in and join the jam session. His excitement was contagious, and even Agatha, usually so composed and reserved, found herself caught up in the energy of the moment.</p><p>As the first few chords rang out, Agatha took a step back and leaned against the porch railing, her arms crossed as she watched Rio, her bandmates, and Nicky slip into the rhythm. The music flowed through the air, a familiar, comforting thing—one Agatha had always known but never in a setting quite like this. She glanced over at Rio, who was already lost in the moment, her fingers dancing effortlessly over her guitar, her eyes closed in concentration.</p><p>It was like watching someone completely in tune with the world around them, every note, every beat a reflection of who Rio was. Agatha felt herself leaning in a little, her attention riveted by the fluidity of Rio’s playing, the way she seemed to own every movement. It was a side of Rio that Agatha hadn’t fully seen before—not just the confident, daring rockstar, but the artist, the person who lived and breathed music.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze shifted back to Nicky, who was now playing alongside Alice, his smile wide as he tried to keep up with the rest of the band. It was hard not to feel a swell of pride. Her son had always loved music, but watching him in this setting, surrounded by real musicians, it was like he had found his place. He had been nervous at first, but now, there was a sense of belonging in his movements, the way he played with confidence, as if he’d always been meant to be part of something this special.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile to herself, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. This moment, this connection between her son and Rio’s band, felt significant. It wasn’t just a casual afternoon; it was the kind of memory that would stay with Nicky, that would shape his love for music in ways Agatha couldn’t yet understand.</p><p>Rio’s voice broke through her thoughts. “You sure you don’t want to join in?” she teased, her eyes sparkling as she leaned over, strumming a few playful chords on her guitar.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the instrument Rio had handed her earlier, a hesitant smile tugging at her lips. She wasn’t exactly known for being spontaneous, and certainly not when it came to picking up an instrument on the fly. But there was something in Rio’s smile—something that urged her to let go of her hesitation, even if just for a moment.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m ready for that,” Agatha replied with a laugh, though her voice was light, playful.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, a teasing grin spreading across her face. “You never know until you try,” she said, leaning a little closer.</p><p>For a second, Agatha considered it. The thought of jumping in, even for a little while, sounded… freeing. But as she watched Nicky play with such ease, she realized maybe her role today wasn’t to play, but to watch. To enjoy. To let herself soak in the moments, the laughter, the music. That, for now, was enough.</p><p>“Maybe next time,” Agatha said softly, her gaze locking with Rio’s, the smile on her lips growing a little more genuine. “I’m happy just watching for now.”</p><p>Rio’s grin softened. “I’ll hold you to that,” she said with a wink.</p><p>The music continued to swirl around them, the sun starting to dip lower in the sky, casting a golden glow over the backyard. It was one of those moments where everything felt just… right. Not perfect, not without complications, but exactly what it needed to be.</p><p>And for the first time in a long while, Agatha let herself believe that maybe—just maybe—this could be the beginning of something beautiful. Something real.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the evening stretched on, the mood in the backyard became more relaxed. The beer kept flowing, and the jam session had turned into a comfortable, impromptu gathering of friends and family. The sun had dipped lower in the sky, casting a warm orange glow across the backyard, and with Mia gone to hang out with her friend Will, and Nicky fully immersed in conversation with Natasha, Agatha allowed herself to unwind a little more.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s presence beside her, subtle but constant. Rio had a way of making everything seem effortless, from the way she leaned into Agatha as they talked to the occasional brush of her fingers against Agatha’s arm. At first, Agatha had been hyper-aware of every touch, every glance, unsure of how much was too much. But as the evening wore on, she felt her defenses soften, her breath coming a little easier. She let herself relax into the moment, her body gravitating toward Rio’s as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio sat down beside Agatha on one of the patio chairs, their knees brushing as she kicked her feet up onto the nearby ottoman. Her arm rested casually on the back of the chair, just inches from Agatha, and as if on instinct, Agatha leaned into her side a little more, her hand brushing against Rio’s.</p><p>“So, how’s everything going?” Rio asked, her voice smooth, almost purring as she looked over at Agatha with that playful, mischievous glint in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, her heart skipping a beat. “Everything’s fine. Just… a lot to take in,” she replied, her words soft but confident. She couldn’t deny the warmth that radiated from Rio’s presence, the way Rio’s touch seemed to spark something inside her.</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the music still playing lightly in the background, the murmur of voices drifting past them. Agatha noticed that Rio’s fingers were resting a little closer to hers now, just barely touching, like an invitation. It was tempting—too tempting—but Agatha didn’t pull away. Instead, she allowed her fingers to brush lightly against Rio’s, the touch sending a thrill through her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered to Agatha’s hand for just a moment, her lips curling into that same confident smile. “You know, it’s nice to see you like this… relaxed,” she murmured, her voice barely audible over the hum of conversation around them.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, the sound low and almost nervous. “I don’t think you’ve ever seen me relaxed.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, her tone playful, “but I’m starting to think I might like this side of you.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Alice and Jen, who had been laughing over a joke in the corner of the yard, exchanged a quick look before casually strolling over toward them. It was only when Alice sat down beside them that Agatha realized just how close Rio and she had gotten in that quiet moment.</p><p>Alice leaned in slightly, her gaze flicking between Agatha and Rio with a grin. “You two look cozy,” she remarked with an eyebrow raised, making it clear that she’d noticed the subtle closeness between them.</p><p>Jen, slightly tipsy, chimed in with a playful smirk. “Yeah, I’ve been watching you two for a while. You’re definitely not as stiff as when we first met.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, smirking at Agatha as she stretched out her legs in front of her. “Oh, we’re just getting started,” she said, a mischievous glint in her eye as she bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s. Agatha chuckled, unable to suppress a smile at the teasing tone in Rio’s voice.</p><p>Alice tilted her head, her gaze lingering a little longer than necessary. “So, what’s going on here, exactly?” she asked, crossing her arms in a way that was both casual and a little too knowing. “You two getting to know each other better?”</p><p>Agatha tried to play it off, but there was a heat rising in her cheeks. “We’re just… talking,” she replied, a little too quickly, but Rio’s hand brushed gently against her back as if to reassure her, and the touch made Agatha feel a little more grounded.</p><p>Jen, ever the observer, gave them both a knowing look. “Uh-huh. Just talking, sure. But we’ll let you get back to that.” She nudged Alice, both of them getting up and heading off to join the others, leaving Agatha and Rio alone again.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding, her heart still racing from the playful but loaded exchange. She glanced at Rio, who was watching her with an amused look on her face.</p><p>“Well,” Rio said with a laugh, her voice low and teasing, “at least they’re not wrong. I think we’re definitely getting to know each other better.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Despite the teasing, despite the growing tension between them, she felt strangely at ease with Rio. Maybe it was the alcohol, or maybe it was just the moment—quiet and unspoken—but for the first time all evening, she allowed herself to breathe.</p><p>“They’re… perceptive,” Agatha said softly, glancing over at Rio, her fingers brushing against Rio’s once again.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio agreed, her voice low and smooth. “But I think we’re doing okay.”</p><p>And with that, Agatha let herself relax into the moment once more, the casual touches and shared smiles turning into something a little deeper, a little more unspoken. For the first time in a long while, she didn’t feel the need to control everything—just let things happen.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension, the kind that had been building steadily throughout the afternoon. Agatha couldn’t help but notice the way Rio’s gaze lingered on her, or the way their hands would brush every time they moved just a little closer. It felt like the space between them was shrinking, the magnetic pull undeniable. She had been on edge, uncertain at first, but now it was different. Every touch felt charged with promise, a small spark that could ignite if she let it.</p><p>And then, without warning, Rio’s thumb gently brushed against the back of her hand, sending a small jolt through Agatha’s chest. The touch lingered just a second longer than necessary, a silent invitation. Agatha’s pulse quickened, her breath catching, but before she could say anything—or do anything—Alice’s voice cut through the moment, pulling them back to reality.</p><p>“Hey, are you guys coming inside?” Alice’s voice called from across the yard, breaking the spell. “We’re going to get a few more drinks, and it’s getting kind of chilly out here.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, shaking herself out of the daze that Rio’s touch had put her in. She turned toward Alice, feeling her face flush. “Uh, yeah, I think that sounds good,” she replied, offering a quick smile as she pushed herself up from the chair. Rio followed her lead, standing just a little too close as they moved toward the door.</p><p>Agatha felt her breath hitch again when Rio’s fingers brushed lightly against her arm as they walked. The simple contact sent another spark through her. It was as if they were moving closer to something, and Agatha wasn’t sure whether she was ready—or whether she could stop it now.</p><p>They entered the house together, the door creaking shut behind them, and for a moment, the noise from the backyard seemed to fade into the background. The kitchen was dimly lit, the scent of barbecue still lingering in the air. Agatha could hear the faint sound of music coming from the living room, but her mind was focused entirely on Rio.</p><p>“Nice place,” Agatha said, her voice a little breathless as she glanced around, trying to steady herself. She had to admit—Rio’s house was warm, lived-in, cozy. It didn’t feel like the glamorous world of the rockstar at all, and somehow, that made it more real.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio replied, her voice low and soft. “I like it here. Makes it easier to escape from everything, you know?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze falling on Rio for just a beat too long. She didn’t know how much more of this she could take—the teasing touches, the lingering gazes. It was becoming harder to ignore the undeniable pull between them, the growing desire that she could no longer hide.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her presence almost overwhelming as she moved in front of Agatha, close enough that their breath mingled in the space between them. “I’ve got a feeling we could use some alone time,” she said quietly, her tone smooth, seductive even, as her hand brushed lightly over Agatha’s arm again.</p><p>The touch was enough to send a shiver down Agatha’s spine, and for a moment, she almost forgot how to breathe. Her heart was racing in her chest, her mind whirling with everything that had happened, everything that could happen if she allowed herself to give in.</p><p>“I don’t think I should—” Agatha began, her voice shaky, but Rio’s fingers gently touched her chin, lifting her gaze so that their eyes met.</p><p>“You don’t have to say anything,” Rio murmured, her lips just a breath away from Agatha’s ear. “You don’t have to make any decisions right now. It doesn’t have to mean anything if you don’t want to. I just want to be with you. Here. Now. Can I?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She wanted this. She wanted her. But her mind, always so structured, kept throwing up walls, reminding her of everything that could go wrong. She couldn’t—she shouldn’t—but the attraction was too strong to ignore. Rio was standing so close now, so impossibly close, and Agatha could feel the heat radiating off her, pulling her in.</p><p>Without thinking, Agatha’s hand reached out, resting gently against Rio’s arm. It was a small gesture, but it felt like a surrender. Rio’s eyes softened, and in that moment, Agatha saw nothing but the depth of Rio’s desire. She wasn’t sure who leaned in first—whether it was Rio or herself—but suddenly, their lips met in a kiss that was everything and nothing at once.</p><p>It was gentle at first, as if neither of them wanted to rush it. Rio’s lips were soft, warm, tasting faintly of the beer they’d been drinking earlier. Agatha let herself get lost in it, the kiss slow, languid, the kind that made her forget everything except the feeling of Rio’s mouth on hers.</p><p>But it didn’t stay slow for long. Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer, deepening the kiss. Agatha’s pulse was thundering in her ears, her body leaning into Rio’s as if it had been waiting for this moment, for this release. She couldn’t help but respond in kind, her hands moving up to Rio’s shoulders, the touch desperate but tender all at once.</p><p>They pulled away just enough to catch their breath, their foreheads resting together. Agatha’s heart was still racing, her thoughts jumbled, but there was no denying what had just happened. What was happening.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio whispered, her voice low, the words nearly lost in the quiet, intimate space between them.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her fingers brushing against Rio’s cheek as she met her gaze. “Yeah. I think I am.”</p><p>Rio smiled, that same playful glint in her eyes, but there was something deeper there now. Something more. And Agatha wasn’t sure where this would lead, but for the first time in a long time, she felt like it was okay to let it happen.</p><p>The kiss had left Agatha’s mind a little scrambled, but in the best way. Her heart was still pounding in her chest, her thoughts rushing and colliding as she tried to steady herself. Rio was still standing close, just a breath away, her presence overwhelming and comforting all at once. Agatha could feel the heat of Rio’s body against hers, the proximity almost too much to bear. She wasn’t used to this—this raw attraction, this desire that felt so out of her control. But as she met Rio’s gaze, the uncertainty started to fade.</p><p>Rio was still smiling, that teasing smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “I think you’re still in shock,” she teased softly, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s lip as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “But I’m glad we did that.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh, albeit a little breathlessly. “I didn’t expect it to happen like that,” she admitted, her voice still shaky from the kiss. Her hand instinctively moved to her chest, as if to steady her racing heart. “I—I wasn’t sure I was ready for… any of this.”</p><p>Rio took a step back, but only a small one, enough to give Agatha a bit of space but not so far that the distance between them felt too much. Her gaze softened, and Agatha could see the understanding there. Rio wasn’t pushing, wasn’t rushing. She was letting Agatha breathe, letting her process.</p><p>“You don’t have to be ready,” Rio said gently. “You just have to let things happen. No pressure, Agatha. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>The words hung in the air between them, comforting and reassuring, and Agatha could feel the tension in her shoulders ease just a little. Rio was offering something—something more than a kiss, more than just a fleeting moment. She was offering patience, respect. She was offering herself, and somehow, Agatha felt like she could trust her with that. The last few years had been about building walls and keeping people at arm’s length, but with Rio… it felt like those walls might finally be coming down.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, letting the moment stretch out. “You’re… different than I thought,” she said softly, almost more to herself than to Rio. “I thought… I thought this would be a mess. That we’d be too different.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, a playful glint in her eyes. “And are we, though?” she asked, her voice light and teasing, but Agatha could see the earnestness in her expression.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her lips curving into a small, hesitant smile. “No,” she admitted, “we’re really not.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened again, her hand gently cupping Agatha’s cheek. “Then maybe it’s time we stop thinking so much about what could go wrong, and just see where this goes.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself relax into the touch, something in her chest loosening, like a weight had been lifted. Maybe she hadn’t been ready before, but in this moment, with Rio looking at her like she was the only person in the room, Agatha felt like maybe—just maybe—this could be something real.</p><p>Before she could respond, the sound of footsteps echoed from the living room, and the moment was broken as Alice’s voice called out, “Hey! Are you two coming back here, or what?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, breaking the connection for a moment. “We should probably get back to the others,” she said, but her voice held a different tone now—lighter, more certain. She met Rio’s gaze once more, a silent understanding passing between them.</p><p>Rio nodded, smiling warmly as she leaned in, brushing her lips lightly against Agatha’s forehead before stepping back. “We have time,” she said, her voice quiet but full of promise.</p><p>And with that, they made their way to the living room, but the unspoken bond between them was clearer than ever. Agatha wasn’t sure what would come next, but for the first time in a long time, she was ready to find out.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the party slowly shifted from the backyard to the living room. Agatha watched the way Rio moved effortlessly among her bandmates, always the center of attention, but it was the sight of Nicky that truly made her heart warm.</p><p>He was completely engrossed in a video game with Natasha, his face lighting up with a grin every time he scored a point. Natasha—normally so serious and intense behind the drums—had a gentle side to her when it came to Nicky. She was patient with him, explaining game mechanics in a way that Agatha had never expected from her. It was a side of Natasha Agatha never predicted, but she was glad for it. Nicky looked so at ease, his usual exuberance making him seem like a natural fit with the band.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the doorframe, watching them with a soft smile. She had been nervous about bringing Nicky into this environment, worried that he would feel out of place, but now, seeing him so happy, so absorbed in the game, all her concerns melted away. Natasha’s easygoing attitude and willingness to bond with him made everything seem less daunting.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Nicky was getting along with the band, though—this was the kind of family dynamic Agatha had always hoped for him. She could see it now, in the way he laughed at Natasha’s playful banter, in the way her tough exterior cracked just a little for him.</p><p>It was a relief, honestly. As much as Agatha cherished her structure and control, sometimes, seeing her son have fun in the way he was now was a reminder that the world didn’t always need to be orderly. Sometimes, it could be messy, chaotic—and that was okay.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the living room, not wanting to intrude on their moment, but also feeling the urge to check in on Nicky. When he saw her, he looked up, excitement clear in his eyes.</p><p>“Mom! Did you see this?” Nicky pointed to the screen, his voice high with energy. “Natasha’s showing me how to play this one, and I think I’m getting good at it!”</p><p>Agatha smiled warmly, walking over and leaning in to see the screen. “I see that, sweetheart. You’re doing great.” She ruffled his hair affectionately, and he grinned back at her. It felt nice, seeing him so at ease.</p><p>Natasha gave her a quick smile, her voice teasing but kind. “He’s got good reflexes. You might have a gamer in the making here.”</p><p>The easy banter continued for a while, with Nicky eagerly explaining all the different aspects of the game to Agatha. She could tell he was enjoying himself, and that made her feel lighter, as if the weight of the evening had shifted. The band had welcomed him, and she didn’t feel so out of place anymore.</p><p>Eventually, though, the game wound down, and Nicky stretched, a dramatic groan escaping his lips. “I’m gonna need a snack after all that.” He stood up, running over to where Rio was sitting.</p><p>Rio looked up from her phone with a grin. “You want some chips, kiddo?”</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky’s excitement was palpable, and Rio handed him a bowl with a knowing smirk.</p><p>Agatha took a step back and let her son go, still keeping an eye on him. But her gaze soon drifted back to Rio, who was watching them with a quiet smile. That simple, relaxed smile that never failed to settle something inside of Agatha. It was as though the moment she started seeing Rio in a new light, everything else began to follow suit.</p><p>Agatha didn’t quite know what she was doing, but she knew that being here, in this space—surrounded by Rio’s friends, by Nicky’s laughter—it felt right. It felt like she could take a deep breath and just… be.</p><p>“You’re good with him,” Agatha said softly, stepping up to Rio, her words a little more vulnerable than she intended. “It’s nice to see him so happy.”</p><p>Rio looked up, her smile softening, and she gave a small shrug. “He’s a good kid. He’s easy to get along with.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave a little flutter, something she didn’t know how to label. Was it admiration? Attraction? She wasn’t sure, but she liked how easily the connection with Rio was forming. She liked the way Rio made her feel safe, like she didn’t have to carry the weight of the world all on her own.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha murmured, her voice quiet but full of meaning.</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, and she leaned in close, just enough to brush her shoulder against Agatha’s in a familiar, comforting touch. “Anytime,” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even have to look at Nicky to know that he was perfectly happy—her son had found a place among these people. Among Rio’s people.</p><p>And now, as she stood there with Rio, she realized that, maybe, she was starting to find a place for herself too.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the night stretched on, the party slowly started to dwindle. Alice and Jen, a little tipsy but still in high spirits, excused themselves first, offering warm goodbyes and promises to meet again soon. Their departure left a noticeable shift in the energy of the room—less raucous laughter and more relaxed, quieter conversations. Natasha eventually gave a lazy stretch, her eyes flicking toward the clock on the wall.</p><p>“I’m gonna head out too,” Natasha said, giving Nicky a playful salute as she passed him. He barely noticed, still focused on the game he and Rio had started playing together earlier. Natasha winked at Agatha. “Take care of these two,” she said with a smile before walking out the door.</p><p>The space felt emptier now. There were just three of them left—Agatha, Rio, and Nicky—enveloped in the quiet hum of the night. Agatha felt a sense of comfort settle over her as she sank into one of the armchairs, watching Nicky still immersed in his video game, completely at ease in this new environment.</p><p>Rio stayed standing for a moment, eyeing Agatha with a mischievous glint in her eyes. She walked over to where Agatha was sitting and, with a playful smile, leaned against the back of her chair, close enough to feel her warmth. Agatha’s pulse quickened, but she tried to remain composed, especially with Nicky in the room. Rio bent slightly to her ear, whispering, “You know, they think I don’t know, but I’ve been aware for months now.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. She glanced at Rio, unsure where this was going.</p><p>Rio grinned, her voice low and teasing. “Alice and Jen—they think we don’t know they’ve been sneaking around behind the scenes… but trust me, I know. They’ve been banging for months. </p><p>Agatha blinked, shocked but somehow amused. It wasn’t the revelation itself that was surprising, but the way Rio delivered it with such casual confidence, as if it was the least interesting thing in the world.</p><p>“You’re… you’re really something, aren’t you?” Agatha muttered with a half-laugh, shaking her head.</p><p>“I know,” Rio replied with a soft chuckle, clearly enjoying Agatha’s reaction. She slid into the seat next to her, leaning back and watching Nicky with a fond smile. “But don’t worry, it’s not like I’m telling the whole world. Just you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how to respond to that, so she just smiled and shook her head again, focusing her attention back on Nicky. Her mind was still processing Rio’s words, and she realized how much she was enjoying this playful, easy banter between them. It wasn’t complicated, it wasn’t heavy—it was just… comfortable.</p><p>“So,” Rio said after a pause, her voice softer now, more thoughtful, “you ready to head out in a bit? It’s getting late, and Nicky’s clearly winding down.” She glanced at Agatha, eyes glimmering with a mixture of curiosity and something else—something more intense. “We can call it a night if you want. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to spend a little more time with you.”</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth spread through her chest at the words. She didn’t respond immediately, just sat there for a moment, weighing the offer. She was surprised by how much she wanted to stay—how much she wanted to keep feeling this connection with Rio, no matter how hesitant she had been earlier.</p><p>Nicky looked up then, his game paused on the screen. He flashed a big, tired smile. “Mom! We’re not leaving already, are we?”</p><p>Agatha met his gaze, a soft smile on her face. “No, Nicky. We’re not going anywhere just yet.”</p><p>Rio leaned closer, her voice a bit more playful now, but still warm. “Looks like you’re stuck with me for a little longer, kid.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a glance, the look in her eyes a mixture of affection and something deeper, more uncertain. It had been a long night, and she wasn’t ready to leave just yet either.</p><p>Nicky nodded with a satisfied grin, completely unaware of the undercurrent of tension between the adults. He quickly went back to his game, and Rio settled in beside Agatha, close enough for their shoulders to touch again.</p><p>The evening wasn’t over yet—not by a long shot.</p><p>And Agatha found herself feeling more comfortable with each passing moment, the world outside fading away as she allowed herself to enjoy the simplicity of this night with Rio and Nicky. Just the three of them. No expectations, no worries. Just being.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“You know, Nicky can crash in Mia’s room for now. She’s staying at Will’s tonight, so there’s no reason he can’t make himself comfortable there for the night.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, surprised at the offer but not completely opposed. The idea of letting Nicky settle into a space that was a bit quieter gave her more freedom to stay for a while longer, especially when the air between her and Rio felt so charged, so full of unspoken possibilities.</p><p>“Are you sure? Mia’s room?” Agatha asked, her voice light but teasing. She wasn’t sure if Rio was joking, but the offer was tempting.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied with a wink, her tone playful. “I’m sure Mia won’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment, her gaze flicking over to Nicky, who was now lounging on the couch with a book, his yawning getting more and more frequent. “Alright, I’ll let him know. Thank you,” she said, a soft smile curling at her lips.</p><p>Nicky heard his name and looked up. “What’s up?”</p><p>“Rio says you can settle in Mia’s room for now,” Agatha said, half amused and half relieved. “Since she’s at Will’s, you’ve got the place to yourself.”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up with excitement. “Seriously? Sweet! Thanks, Mom!” He jumped up from the couch, practically bounding toward the stairs to claim his new territory for the night.</p><p>As he disappeared down the hall, Agatha took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the evening settle over her. She turned back to Rio, who was watching her with a knowing look, her smile teasing but genuine.</p><p>“Well, looks like we’re alone,” Agatha murmured, her voice softening, though her heart was racing.</p><p>Rio leaned in just a little closer, her breath warm against Agatha’s ear. “So, now that we’re free to hang out…” She trailed off, eyes glinting with the same magnetic pull that had drawn Agatha to her from the start.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened as the space between them closed. She could feel the tension in the air, the weight of everything unsaid, everything yet to happen. The night stretched out before them like an open invitation.</p><p>“Well then, let’s see where the night goes,” Agatha said, a smile tugging at her lips as she looked up into Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“Now that’s the spirit,” Rio replied, her voice low, almost a whisper. </p><p>And with that, Agatha knew the night was far from over.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p>They stood there in the kitchen, the air between them electric, charged with the quiet intensity of the night. Agatha poured herself a glass of wine, her hand slightly trembling as the events of the evening ran through her mind. She didn’t want to overthink it—tonight was supposed to be simple, a night without complications. But Rio had a way of making everything feel effortless, and yet, all-consuming.</p><p>As Agatha straightened up, Rio was right behind her. Her presence was impossible to ignore—close, steady, and as magnetic as ever. Their fingers brushed once more as Rio reached to pour herself some wine, and Agatha felt the heat of her touch like a spark racing up her arm.</p><p>“You know,” Rio’s voice was soft, almost playful, “I’ve been wondering about something for a while now.”</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s breath against her skin, the soft weight of her presence settling over her like a comforting blanket. It should have been too much—too fast, too intense—but there was something about Rio that made it all feel so natural, like she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p>“What’s that?” Agatha’s voice came out quieter than she intended, her heart thudding in her chest. She didn’t know if it was the wine or Rio’s nearness, but she was suddenly painfully aware of how close they were, how their bodies almost seemed to be magnetized together.</p><p>Rio’s lips were so close to her ear now, their proximity undeniable. “If I kissed you again, would you let me?”</p><p>The question hung between them, lighter than air, but it felt like everything was riding on it. Agatha could feel her pulse quicken, her breath hitching in her throat as her mind raced. She had already kissed Rio tonight, but this…this felt different. This felt like Rio wasn’t just asking for a kiss. She was asking for more. And Agatha had been fighting it, holding back every step of the way.</p><p>But now, standing in the kitchen with Rio so close, with the weight of the night hanging on them, Agatha found herself unable to resist.</p><p>She set her glass down slowly, her fingers brushing against Rio’s as she did. Without a word, Agatha turned to face Rio fully, her eyes locking with hers. There was no hesitation now—no walls, no fear of what it might mean, just the undeniable pull between them.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha breathed out, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p>Rio’s lips crashed against hers without another thought, urgent and eager, as though they both knew this was the moment they’d been waiting for. Agatha leaned into it, pulling Rio closer, feeling the heat of their bodies pressed together, their breath mingling in the small space between them.</p><p>It was everything Agatha had been trying to deny: the way Rio tasted, the way her touch made her skin tingle, the way her heartbeat seemed to match Rio’s. For the first time tonight, Agatha let herself feel it fully, without holding back. Every kiss, every caress, was like a wave crashing over her, pulling her deeper into Rio’s orbit.</p><p>Agatha’s hands found their way to Rio’s shoulders, then her back, feeling the solidness of her, the warmth of her skin under her clothes. She didn’t care about anything else—about the consequences, about the messiness of it all. All that mattered was the way Rio made her feel, the way their lips moved together in perfect sync, like they were made to be this close.</p><p>And when Rio pulled back just a fraction, her breath hot against Agatha’s lips, Agatha didn’t move away. Instead, she leaned forward, capturing Rio’s lips again in a slow, lingering kiss, one that spoke volumes without a single word.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, both of them were breathless, caught in the haze of everything unsaid, everything that had built up between them over the past few weeks. Agatha looked into Rio’s eyes, her own heart still racing.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a soft chuckle, “I think I’ve made my point.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, her chest tight with both relief and desire. “I think so,” she murmured.</p><p>They stood there in the kitchen, the world outside fading away, as they let themselves enjoy the simple intimacy of the moment. For once, Agatha didn’t want to think about anything else. Just this—just Rio, and the way everything felt right in her arms.</p><p>Just as the kiss deepened, the faint sound of footsteps echoed from the hallway. Agatha’s heart lurched in her chest, and she quickly pulled back, breaking the kiss with a sharp breath, her pulse racing. She heard the door to the living room creak open, followed by a soft voice.</p><p>“Uh… mom? Rio?”</p><p>Both women froze, their eyes snapping toward the doorway. Agatha felt a rush of heat in her cheeks as she quickly tried to regain her composure. Rio, ever the cool one, shot Agatha a knowing grin, though she, too, paused, her lips curling into a playful smirk.</p><p>“Looks like we’ve got company,” Rio murmured, just low enough for Agatha to hear.</p><p>Nicky, still rubbing his eyes sleepily, peered around the corner, his face half-lit by the soft glow of the hallway light. He squinted for a moment before his gaze shifted between the two women, utterly unaware of what he had walked in on. With a yawn, he mumbled, “Mom?”</p><p>Agatha straightened up, her heart still racing, and put on her best calm face. “Nicky, sweetie,” she said softly. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>Nicky blinked a couple of times, still half-asleep, before his gaze slowly focused. He glanced between Agatha and Rio, both of them standing much too close to each other for his sleepy mind to process. But after a beat, he let out a small sigh and rubbed his eyes again. “I just want a glass of water,” he muttered, yawning. “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but stifle a relieved laugh before Rio said, “Yeah, of course, bud. Go ahead.”</p><p>Nicky, looking a bit out of it, shuffled toward the kitchen, dragging his feet. He paused for a moment at the doorframe, glancing back with a small frown. “You guys okay?” he asked, sounding genuinely curious but too tired to think much of it.</p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, smiling playfully. “Yeah, we’re fine, Nicky. Just chatting.”</p><p>Nicky gave a lazy shrug and turned away, heading toward the fridge in search of his water. “Alright. Cool. Just making sure.”</p><p>As the sound of Nicky’s footsteps faded, Agatha exhaled a long, slow breath and looked at Rio, her face flushed but with an amused smile. “Well, that was… unexpected.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “Yeah, I’m pretty sure he has no idea what he just walked in on.”</p><p>“I think we’re safe,” Agatha said, still a little breathless from the sudden tension, but her nerves slowly starting to settle. “Though, I’m not sure how much longer I can keep pretending none of this is happening.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry,” Rio said with a wink, stepping a little closer. “He’s not going to remember this in the morning.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, the tension easing between them. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. He’s so out of it, he won’t even notice if we’re still standing here in five minutes.”</p><p>Rio leaned in a little closer, her eyes mischievous. “Well, I’m in no rush,” she murmured, her breath warm against Agatha’s cheek. “We’ve got all the time we need.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped, but she managed to hold Rio’s gaze, a faint blush still coloring her cheeks. “I’m not sure I’m ready for Nicky to catch us really in the act just yet,” she teased, her voice a little breathier now.</p><p>Rio laughed softly, her hand brushing lightly against Agatha’s. “Don’t worry,” she said, her voice low and sultry. “I’m not going anywhere… unless you want me to.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse quickened at the heat in Rio’s words, but before she could respond, they both heard the faint sound of Nicky’s voice calling from the other room.</p><p>“I’m gonna go back to Mia’s room now, okay?” he shouted, his tone casual and oblivious.</p><p>“Yeah, okay!” Agatha called back, shaking her head in disbelief.</p><p>Rio grinned, clearly enjoying the awkwardness. “Well, guess that’s our cue to stop being so obvious.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, her heart still racing from the closeness. She felt her heart still pounding in her chest, but the tension had lifted, replaced by something warmer and more inviting. She stepped toward Rio again, a little more confident now that Nicky had gone to bed.</p><p>“Now,” Agatha said, her voice soft and inviting. “Where were we?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, a slow smile spreading across her face. “I think you know exactly where we were,” she teased, her hands reaching out to gently tug Agatha closer.</p><p>And this time, neither of them hesitated.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio pulled her closer, the heat between them igniting once more. She could feel the electric charge of their touch, the way Rio’s fingers trailed along her waist, sending shivers of desire down her spine. The proximity made Agatha’s head spin, but she couldn’t pull away. She didn’t want to.</p><p>They both seemed to be moving in slow motion, the anticipation building with each passing second. Rio’s lips brushed against Agatha’s ear as she whispered, her voice low and intoxicating, “I don’t want to wait anymore, Agatha. You’re driving me crazy.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment, her pulse quickening. She wanted this. She wanted Rio. She wanted to let go, just for tonight. But the thought of Nicky suddenly appearing again sent a flash of anxiety through her, a reminder of how thin the line was between this beautiful moment and the reality of their situation.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she met Rio’s gaze, her voice barely a whisper. “But Nicky—”</p><p>“He’s fine,” Rio cut her off with a grin, her thumb grazing Agatha’s jaw. “He’s asleep. And honestly, if he weren’t, he’d probably just think we were talking. He has no idea what’s really going on.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, trying to steady herself. “But what if—”</p><p>“What if he walks in again?” Rio finished for her, her lips curling into a smirk. Rio took a slow step back, her eyes dark and filled with heat. “You look like you need a break from being so cautious. Let’s go somewhere we can have some privacy. I think we’ve had enough of the kitchen for tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind raced, her chest tightening with a mix of desire and nerves. She hesitated, but only for a moment. Rio was right. She had been so cautious, so worried about appearances. But the pull between them was undeniable.</p><p>“You want me to come with you?” Agatha asked, voice thick with longing.</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, and she leaned in, her lips brushing against Agatha’s briefly before pulling back, a teasing smile playing at the corner of her mouth. “I don’t want to risk Nicky walking in again… so yeah, I think we should move this to my room. We deserve that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her heart racing, as she followed Rio toward the hallway. The heat between them was still there, intensifying with each step. When they reached the door to Rio’s bedroom, Rio hesitated, looking over her shoulder at Agatha with a slow, seductive grin.</p><p>“You sure you’re ready for this?” Rio asked, her voice low and inviting.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her hands trembling slightly as she reached for the door handle. “I’m not going anywhere,” she replied, her voice a whisper of her own desire.</p><p>Rio opened the door and let Agatha step inside first, the quiet hum of the house in stark contrast to the chaotic intensity of their emotions. </p><p>The door clicked shut behind them, and the sound seemed to echo in the quiet of the room, amplifying the tension that had been building between them for days. The air was thick, charged with anticipation, and as Rio took a step closer, Agatha could feel her heart pounding in her chest, each beat reverberating through her entire body. Their chests brushed, and a wave of heat surged between them, making Agatha’s breath hitch. She didn’t pull away. She couldn’t.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved up to cup Agatha’s cheek, her touch so gentle it made Agatha’s knees weak. Rio tilted her head, her lips capturing Agatha’s in a slow, deep kiss that sent a shiver down her spine. Agatha moaned softly into it, her hands instinctively reaching for Rio’s shirt, pulling her closer, as if she couldn’t get enough of her. The urgency that had been simmering between them finally boiled over, and Agatha wanted to drown in it.</p><p>Rio’s lips left hers, trailing down her neck, and Agatha’s head tilted back, a soft gasp escaping her. Her mouth was everywhere. Rio’s fingers slid under Agatha’s shirt, grazing the soft skin of her back, sending sparks racing up her spine. Agatha’s hands roamed lower, finding the curve of Rio’s hips, her grip tightening as if to steady herself. She couldn’t believe this was happening. Every touch was electric, igniting something deeper inside her, something she hadn’t realized had been buried for so long.</p><p>When Rio broke the kiss to look at her, both of them panting heavily, Agatha saw the hunger in her eyes, and it made her stomach twist with need.</p><p>“I want you, Agatha. All of you,” Rio murmured, her voice trembling with desire. “But only if you’re sure.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to think twice. Her body was already answering for her, pulling Rio closer as if it was second nature. “I’m sure,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I’ve never been more sure.”</p><p>Rio smiled, and it was a look that melted Agatha completely. With a quiet chuckle, Rio kissed her again, more urgently this time, their hands fumbling to shed their clothes. The urgency was palpable, their movements eager and desperate. In the heat of the moment, there was no space for doubt, only the pull of desire, the craving to be as close as humanly possible.</p><p>As the last of their clothes hit the floor, they both stopped for a moment, looking at each other. Agatha felt exposed, vulnerable in a way she wasn’t used to, but Rio’s gaze was soft, almost reverent, as she reached out to touch Agatha’s face, her thumb brushing gently over her lips.</p><p>“You’re beautiful,” Rio whispered, her voice so tender it made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes at the compliment, feeling a wave of warmth wash over her. It had been so long since anyone had said anything like that to her, and hearing it from Rio felt like the final confirmation that this was real, that they were here together, no barriers.</p><p>“I’m not sure about that…” Agatha replied with a small smile, her eyes still closed, but Rio’s touch was so gentle it made her feel like she was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>“You don’t have to be sure. You are,” Rio said, her voice a comforting promise as she leaned in to kiss Agatha again. It was soft, full of affection, before it deepened once more, and Agatha lost herself in Rio, in the heat of the moment, in the connection that felt more real than anything she’d experienced in a long time.</p><p>Their bodies came together, and Agatha gasped at the feeling, her hands gripping Rio’s shoulders for support. This was really happening. Rio’s hands explored her body, tracing every curve, every dip, as if she wanted to memorize every inch of her. Agatha’s breath came in short, uneven gasps as Rio’s lips found her neck, her collarbone, her chest. The sensations were overwhelming, and Agatha’s mind was a blur of heat and need.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved lower, and Agatha tensed for a moment, her breath catching in her throat. It’s too much. It’s not enough. Rio’s touch was gentle but insistent, and Agatha felt herself giving in, her body arching towards her. “Rio…” she whispered, her voice trembling.</p><p>Rio’s eyes met hers, and there was something unspoken in that gaze, something that made Agatha feel safe, cherished. “Tell me what you need,” Rio murmured, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a moment, her heart pounding. She’d never been this vulnerable with anyone before, but with Rio, it felt natural. “I… I need you,” she said, her voice barely audible.</p><p>Rio smiled, her hand stilling for a moment. “You have me. Always.” Her lips found Agatha’s again, and the kiss was slow, deep, filled with promise.</p><p>Agatha’s hands moved to Rio’s hips, pulling her closer, and she felt a surge of boldness she hadn’t known she possessed. “That night… at the club…” she began, her voice shaky. “After we kissed… I went home and… I thought about you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly, and then a slow, wicked smile spread across her face. “Is that so?” she murmured, her voice low and teasing. “Tell me more.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks flush, but she didn’t look away. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you. About how you kissed me, how you made me feel. I’ve never… I’ve never wanted anyone like that before.”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid up Agatha’s thigh, her touch sending a jolt of electricity through her. “And now?” Rio asked, her voice husky. “What do you want now?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her hips instinctively arching towards Rio’s touch. “I want you,” she whispered, her voice trembling with need. “I want you to make me forget everything but you.”</p><p>Rio’s smile turned into a smirk as her fingers moved higher, tracing tantalizing circles against Agatha’s skin. “Well then… you’re in luck,” she murmured, her voice dripping with promise. “Because I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as Rio’s fingers finally found their mark, and she let out a soft moan, her hands gripping the sheets beneath her. This is it. She’d never felt anything like this before, and as Rio’s lips found hers again, she knew she’d never be the same again.</p><p>Rio’s fingers lingered at the edge of Agatha’s wetness, teasing, drawing circles that made her hips buck in silent plea. Her lips brushed against Agatha’s ear, her breath warm and heavy as she whispered, “I want to taste you, Agatha. Every inch. Will you let me?”</p><p>Agatha’s body shivered, a wave of anticipation crashing through her. Her hands clenched the sheets tighter, her breath coming in shallow gasps. Every inch. The words echoed in her mind, sending a thrill down her spine. She’d never been asked like this before, never been touched like this, never felt so exposed yet so desired. She nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “Yes… please.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a smirk, her eyes darkening with intent. She pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s neck, her fingers retreating just enough to make Agatha whimper. “Good,” Rio murmured, her voice low and honeyed. “Because you taste like heaven already, and I haven’t even started.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, her heart pounding in her chest as Rio shifted lower. The anticipation was maddening, every second stretching into an eternity as Rio’s hands slid down her thighs, parting her legs wider. Her body trembled, her breath hitching as Rio’s gaze locked onto hers, filled with a hunger that made Agatha’s stomach tighten.</p><p>“Relax,” Rio whispered, her voice soothing. “Just feel me.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio’s lips pressed against the inside of her thigh, soft and warm, sending a jolt of electricity through her. Her hands balled into fists, her eyes fluttering shut as Rio’s kisses trailed higher, closer to where she needed her most. Oh god. Her body arched instinctively, her breath coming in short, uneven gasps as Rio’s tongue flicked against her, light and tantalizing.</p><p>Rio hummed against her, the vibration sending a ripple of pleasure through Agatha’s core. “So sweet,” Rio murmured, her voice muffled against her skin. “I could get addicted to this.”</p><p>Agatha moaned, her hips lifting off the bed, seeking more contact. Rio’s hands gripped her thighs, holding her steady as her tongue dipped lower, exploring her with a slow, deliberate precision. Every flick, every swirl, every press of Rio’s lips sent waves of pleasure crashing through Agatha, building a fire that threatened to consume her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped, her voice trembling. “I—I can’t—”</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to meet her gaze, her lips glistening. “You can,” she said firmly, her voice laced with a quiet confidence. “Let go, Agatha. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, her body trembling as Rio’s tongue found her again, this time with a firmer pressure. Her back arched, a strangled moan escaping her lips as Rio’s hands moved to her hips, anchoring her as she worked her with an intensity that left Agatha breathless. The room faded away, the only thing that mattered was the heat of Rio’s mouth, the way her tongue moved against her, curling and pressing in just the right way to make her toes curl.</p><p>“You’re so beautiful like this,” Rio murmured against her, her voice husky. “So responsive. So perfect.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her hands tangling in the sheets as Rio’s tongue circled her clit, sending a sharp spike of pleasure through her. Her muscles tightened, her body coiling like a spring as Rio’s fingers joined her mouth, sliding inside her with a slick ease that made Agatha cry out.</p><p>“That’s it,” Rio encouraged, her voice a low purr. “Let me feel you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips rocked against Rio’s mouth, her body moving on instinct as the pleasure built, cresting higher and higher with every stroke of Rio’s tongue, every curl of her fingers. She was close, so close, her breath coming in ragged gasps as Rio’s pace quickened, her fingers thrusting deeper, her tongue pressing harder.</p><p>“Rio, I—” Agatha’s voice broke, her body trembling as the first wave of pleasure hit her, washing over her in a blinding rush. Her back arched, her hands clutching at the sheets as the orgasm tore through her, leaving her gasping and shaking. Rio didn’t stop, her mouth and fingers working her through it, drawing out every last shuddering wave until Agatha collapsed back onto the bed, her body spent.</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to her inner thigh before crawling up her body, her lips brushing against Agatha’s as she whispered, “How was that?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, her chest still heaving as she tried to catch her breath. “I—I’ve never…” she stammered, her voice barely audible. “That was… incredible.”</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes soft as she brushed a strand of hair from Agatha’s face. “Good,” she murmured, her voice filled with a quiet satisfaction. “Because I’m not done with you yet.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her body still tingling from the aftermath of her orgasm. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid down Agatha’s side, her fingers grazing her hip as she leaned in, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear. “I mean,” she whispered, her voice low and sultry, “I want to hear you. I want to know what you’ve been thinking about. Tell me, Agatha… did you touch yourself after that night in the club?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed crimson, her heart racing at the question. She hesitated, her gaze dropping to Rio’s lips as she tried to find the words. “I… yes,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you. About… this.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, her hand moving lower, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s sensitive skin. “Tell me,” she urged, her voice a low, commanding purr. “What did you imagine?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, her body trembling as Rio’s fingers teased her, already reigniting the fire inside her. “I… I imagined your hands,” she stammered, her voice trembling. “Your mouth. I imagined you… touching me. Just like this.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, her lips curling into a smirk as she pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s neck. “Good girl,” she murmured, her voice dripping with approval. “Now… let’s make it even better than you imagined.”</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Rio lay beside Agatha, her body pressed gently against hers as they both caught their breath, the room still warm from their intimacy. Her fingers traced slow patterns over Agatha’s skin, wandering across her shoulder, down her arm, savoring the feel of her—the softness of her skin, the way her body still hummed with the electricity they’d shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt a sense of contentment settle over her, like a weight being lifted. For once, there were no walls, no barriers. Just the quiet between them, the rhythm of their breaths, the warmth of their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers trailed lazily down Agatha’s side, pausing for a moment as she thought about how much she’d wanted this, how much she’d wanted her. She had never expected things to unfold this way—so fast, yet somehow perfectly natural, inevitable even. But here they were, and Rio couldn’t help but smile at the thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Rio’s voice was low, still carrying a hint of breathlessness as she turned her head to look at Agatha, her eyes filled with warmth and curiosity. She had to ask—she had to make sure Agatha was really okay with this, with them. The last thing Rio wanted was to make Agatha feel uncomfortable or rushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, a soft smile tugging at her lips as she looked at Rio. She didn’t answer immediately, letting the moment stretch between them for a heartbeat longer before she nodded, her expression soft and almost shy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m okay,” she murmured, her voice thick with the intimacy they’d just shared. “More than okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her heart swelling a little at the words, at the way Agatha looked at her like she wasn’t sure what to do with the feelings either, but didn’t mind letting them sit there for a while. It was a good feeling. A comforting feeling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted slightly, turning her head to face Rio, her hand reaching up to brush a few stray strands of hair from Rio’s forehead. The gesture was tender, almost shy, but Rio could see the little spark in her eyes that told her this wasn’t just a passing thing for Agatha. She wasn’t the type to get swept up in something just for the thrill. No, this was real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happens now?” Agatha asked softly, almost hesitantly, her gaze flickering away for a moment before coming back to Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her fingers still tracing over Agatha’s skin as she gave her an almost playful look. “Well, I’d say we take this one step at a time,” she said, her voice warm but with a hint of teasing. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips quirked in a small smile, and Rio could see that familiar spark of strength, that cautious vulnerability in her eyes. “Good,” Agatha said, her voice soft but steady. “Because I’m not either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in then, her lips brushing against Agatha’s in a gentle kiss, a reminder of how easy it was, how right it felt. The kiss was slow and soft, nothing rushed, just the promise of more—more time together, more of this, more of them. It was everything Rio had wanted and yet hadn’t even known she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled away, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, her fingers still tracing circles on her skin. “I meant what I said, Agatha,” she whispered. “I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened, and she nodded, her fingers finding Rio’s hand, entwining their fingers together with a quiet reassurance. It was enough to silence the lingering doubts that Rio hadn’t even realized were there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha replied softly. “And I think I’m starting to believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help the grin that spread across her face at the words, at the way Agatha’s walls had begun to fall, piece by piece. This was just the beginning, but Rio was ready for it. Ready for all of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed Agatha’s forehead gently, letting herself linger there for a moment, savoring the softness of the moment, before she pulled back enough to look at her again, her thumb still stroking Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to stay here tonight?” Rio asked, her voice low, hesitant. She didn’t want to push, didn’t want to rush anything, but the idea of Agatha being there, beside her, felt so right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, but Rio could see the flicker of hesitation in her eyes. It wasn’t the same hesitation from earlier—this one was different, more familiar, more tied to the reality of their lives.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted slightly, her fingers tracing the edge of Rio’s collarbone as she let out a quiet breath. “I would, Rio,” she murmured. “But… I can’t stay the night. Not with Nicky in Mia’s room, and Mia—” Her voice faltered, but only for a moment. “I don’t want to make her uncomfortable, having me here when she comes back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart ached just a little, understanding the weight of Agatha’s responsibility, the way she always put others first. She leaned in to press a kiss to Agatha’s forehead, her lips soft against her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” Rio whispered, her voice gentle, but there was an undercurrent of something deeper, something that said she would wait, she would be patient. “I don’t want to make you feel like you have to choose, Agatha. We’ll take it one step at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly, a mixture of gratitude and longing in her eyes. “I want to be here,” she said quietly, her hand resting on Rio’s chest. “But right now, we have to think about Nicky, about Mia. This is… new for all of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, pulling her closer for another soft kiss, this time more lingering. “I know. I just—” She hesitated, her voice dropping to a whisper. “I wish you didn’t have to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, the tension between them easing, but her smile was bittersweet. “I know. I wish that too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed like that for a moment longer, tangled in the softness of their shared understanding, before Agatha gently pulled away, her fingers trailing down Rio’s arm. “But, for now, this is enough,” Agatha said, her voice a little firmer, as if she were convincing herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at that, letting out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “That’s enough for me,” she said, her hand sliding into Agatha’s. “I’m glad you’re here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her eyes softening as she met Rio’s gaze, and for a moment, the world outside felt like it didn’t matter. All that mattered was this—this moment, the quiet connection they shared, and the promise of more to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched Agatha pull on her clothes, the fabric shifting as she moved. She couldn’t help but admire the way Agatha held herself, even in such a simple, everyday moment. Agatha had a grace about her, something that made Rio’s heart beat just a little bit faster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha walked toward the bathroom, Rio lingered for a moment, still feeling the heat of their shared moment in the air. Her body was humming with satisfaction, but there was something more she needed—something she didn’t quite want to let go of yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking twice, she stood and followed Agatha into the bathroom, her steps quiet as she moved up behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stood in front of the bathroom mirror, fixing her blouse and smoothing down her hair, Rio followed after her, still gloriously naked and completely unbothered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could protest, Rio wrapped her arms around her from behind, pulling her close and resting her chin on her shoulder. Their reflections met in the mirror—Agatha, looking put-together but still slightly disheveled, and Rio, utterly unrepentant, her lips quirking up in a lazy, satisfied smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re beautiful,” Rio murmured against her skin, pressing a slow, lingering kiss just beneath her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head. “I look like I’ve just had wild sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, sliding her hands down Agatha’s waist, enjoying the way she tensed for just a moment before relaxing into her touch. “Well, you did.” Her voice was low and teasing, full of something warm and satisfied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze in the mirror, arching a brow. “You, on the other hand, </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> look like you just had wild sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, unabashed. “Good. I want you to remember exactly how amazing this felt.” She punctuated her words by kissing the side of Agatha’s neck, her hands squeezing lightly at her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, closing her eyes for a second before shaking her head. “You’re impossible,” she muttered, though there was no real bite to it. If anything, there was something almost… fond in her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned against her skin. “And yet, you’re still here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Throughout the day, Rio found herself checking her phone more than usual, smiling whenever Agatha’s name popped up on her screen. Their texts weren’t overly sentimental—Agatha still kept things somewhat measured—but there was an ease between them now, a playfulness that hadn’t been there before. It was a relief, really, that Agatha hadn’t shut her out, hadn’t let the weight of what happened between them push her back behind those walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, Rio knew better than to let herself get too comfortable. She wanted to believe this was something real, something that wouldn’t disappear the moment Agatha started overthinking. But she also knew Agatha was careful, hesitant. It wouldn’t take much for her to retreat again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was halfway through typing a teasing response to Agatha’s latest message when Mia walked in, setting her bag down by the door with a quiet sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re in a good mood,” Mia observed, her voice casual but her eyes sharp as she grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, locking her phone. “Can’t I just be happy to see my kid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave her a look. “Sure.” She took a sip of water, watching her like she was trying to figure something out. “Did something happen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia leaned against the counter, studying her. “You’re just… different today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, keeping her voice light. “Maybe I just had a good night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hummed, skeptical. She didn’t push, but Rio could feel her thinking, feel her debating whether or not to pry. But in the end, she just nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said simply, taking another sip of water before walking toward the stairs. “I’m gonna shower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a quiet breath as Mia disappeared down the hall. That had been too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew she’d have to tell her eventually—Mia wasn’t stupid, and she’d figure it out sooner or later. But for now, Rio kept her mouth shut, even as guilt lingered in the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Wednesday rolled around, Rio was already frustrated. She’d been looking forward to swinging by Sonata Grove, seeing Agatha, maybe stealing a few moments alone with her before their schedules pulled them in opposite directions again. But instead, she was stuck in the studio, staring down the endless hours it would take to get this damn album finished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were on a tight schedule—everything needed to be wrapped up by early December if they wanted time to prep for the tour in January. That meant long days, late nights, and very little time for anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Earth to Vidal,” Alice called, snapping her fingers in front of Rio’s face. “You planning on actually playing something, or are you just gonna keep sighing at your phone?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scowled, flipping her off before adjusting her guitar. “I’m here, aren’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked, clearly amused. “Physically, yeah. Mentally? You’re at that music school, making heart eyes at your pianist ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen, who was sitting at the keyboard, snorted. “Oh, definitely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “You’re both insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You like that we’re insufferable,” Alice shot back, adjusting her amp. “And we like that you’re finally acting like a lovesick idiot over someone. It’s cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored them, focusing on tuning her guitar. This was the problem with spending all day in the studio—too much time for her bandmates to notice things. Too much time for them to give her shit for it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled out her phone when the others got distracted with setting up the next track. She hadn’t texted Agatha yet, hadn’t wanted to tell her she wouldn’t be able to make it after they’d already made plans.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Stuck in the studio. Don’t think I’m gonna be able to make it today.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the screen, waiting for a response. When her phone buzzed a moment later, she wasn’t sure what she’d been expecting—maybe a teasing complaint, something about how Rio owed her for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, the reply was painfully neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Understood</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, her stomach twisting. That… wasn’t great.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shouldn’t overthink it. Agatha was busy, too. It wasn’t like she was sitting around waiting for Rio to show up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But they hadn’t seen each other since Saturday night—since Agatha had come undone beneath her, since she’d snuck out in the middle of the night. Not because she’d wanted to leave, but because she had to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now Rio couldn’t help but wonder—was Agatha overthinking it? Letting that big, brilliant, overly structured brain of hers spin itself in circles until it convinced her that this, whatever it was between them, was a mistake?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought made Rio’s stomach sink.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Not happy with me, are you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes passed before Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You have obligations, Rio. I can hardly be upset about that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Which, of course, meant that she was upset but was too polite to say so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scrubbed a hand over her face. She hated this—hated the idea of disappointing Agatha, even though she knew she didn’t technically owe her anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But damn if it didn’t feel like she did.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’ll make it up to you. Promise.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t reply right away. Just as Rio was about to tuck her phone away, another message popped up.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll hold you to that</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, relief washing over her. Maybe she wasn’t completely in the doghouse after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time Rio finally left the studio on Friday night, it was pushing 9 p.m. She was exhausted, starving, and a little cranky—not exactly the most charming combination. But more than anything, she wanted to see Agatha. She’d promised to make it up to her, and she wasn’t about to let another day slip by without doing just that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaning against her car, she pulled out her phone and snapped a quick selfie—her dark red beanie covering her ears, exhaustion clear in her eyes, but with a small, tired smile playing at her lips.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Finally done for the week.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated for half a second before adding:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Any chance I can see you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send and exhaled, stretching out her sore muscles. She had no idea if Agatha was even still awake, much less if she’d be willing to see her at this hour. The woman valued her routine like it was a sacred text, and an unplanned late-night visit probably wasn’t part of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed a minute later.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You must be exhausted. Shouldn’t you be going home?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. Deflecting. Classic Agatha.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Probably. But I’d rather see you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A longer pause this time. Rio tossed her guitar case into the back seat, already bracing for a polite but firm </span>
<em>
<span>not tonight, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, another message popped up.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I just made tea. If you don’t mind a quiet night, you’re welcome to stop by.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>On my way. Send me your address?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Agatha texted it over, Rio was already typing back.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Be there soon. Bringing food. You like pizza?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Who doesn’t like pizza?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Fair point. Any toppings you hate?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Olives. Anchovies. Anything that doesn’t belong on a pizza.</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So, no pineapple?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause before the three dots reappeared.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Just get the pizza, Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Laughing under her breath, Rio turned onto a familiar street, heading for her favorite late-night pizza place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she stepped inside, she pulled her beanie lower over her ears and kept her head down, praying no one would recognize her. It had been a long week, she was starving, and all she wanted was to get in and out without being stopped for pictures or a conversation she wasn’t in the mood for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was out of luck. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The guy behind the counter did a double take, eyes widening in recognition. “Oh shit. You’re Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced a smile, shoving her hands into her pockets. “Just here for a pizza, man.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, right.” The guy grinned, already punching in the order. “You need me to, like, sneak you out the back?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No one is following me,” Rio assured him with a chuckle, though she glanced over her shoulder anyway. So far, no cameras in her face, no one rushing over—but that didn’t mean it would stay that way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, can I just say, your last album changed my life—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, pulling out her credit card. “Appreciate it, man.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Twenty agonizing minutes and three more fan encounters later, she was walking out with two pizzas in hand, breathing a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The liquor store was worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two different people stopped her before she could even reach the wine aisle—one asking for a picture, the other just gushing about how they’d been to every one of The Coven’s LA shows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she finally got to her car, she was so completely over it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the kind of thing she was used to, but tonight, it made her chest feel tight. Maybe because she was already on edge about seeing Agatha again. Maybe because she was hyper-aware of how normal Agatha’s life was compared to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she pulled up to Agatha’s house, she was more than ready to let all that stress go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The house was…unexpected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A perfect lawn, a cute little porch, and the surest sign of a kid living there—Nicky’s bike tossed haphazardly on the side of the house, like he’d abandoned it mid-adventure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in Rio’s chest ached.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She climbed out of the car, balancing the pizzas in one hand and the wine in the other, but before she could knock, the door opened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Barefoot, in a deep purple sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, her hair loose and falling in soft waves down her back. No perfectly curated outfit, no polished presentation—just Agatha, warm and soft in the glow of her porch light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she was so damn beautiful it nearly knocked the breath out of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a second, she just stood there, taking it all in, before managing a hoarse, “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curled in a faint smile, eyes flicking to the food in Rio’s hands. “You didn’t have to do all that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Yeah, but I wanted to. Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back, opening the door wider. “You’re already here, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio stepped inside, the warmth of Agatha’s home wrapped around her. It smelled like something faintly sweet—vanilla, maybe?—with a hint of something floral beneath it. The lights were dim, casting a soft glow over the living room, and in the far corner, a bookshelf stood tall, filled to the brim.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was cozy. Lived-in. The kind of place that made her stomach twist with something Rio wasn’t ready to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the pizzas and the wine down on the kitchen counter, turning just as Agatha closed the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look good,” Rio said before she could stop herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I look like I’ve been lounging around all evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio murmured, gaze trailing over her again. “You look good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft breath, shaking her head like she wasn’t sure what to do with Rio. “Hungry?” she asked instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Starving,” Rio admitted, though food was rapidly slipping down her list of priorities.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed two plates from the cabinet while Rio uncorked the wine, pouring them each a glass. They moved around the kitchen easily, in sync despite how new this still was, and somehow that felt just as intimate as everything else they’d done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky was nowhere to be seen, and Rio figured he was already in bed. That was probably for the best.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled on the couch with their food, the coffee table housing their wine glasses as they ate in easy silence. After a long week, it was exactly what Rio needed—something simple, something quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha finally said, watching Rio over the rim of her wine glass. “Rough day?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. “Rough week. Got stuck in the studio longer than I planned. And apparently, I can’t just go buy a pizza without it turning into a whole thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a knowing look. “Fame is so hard, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, tipping her head back against the couch. “I’m so tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Poor thing,” Agatha murmured, patting Rio’s knee in mock sympathy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head, smirking. “Careful, Harkness. You keep touching me like that, I’m gonna start thinking you like me or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, but she didn’t pull her hand away immediately. “Eat your pizza, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did—but the entire time, her focus stayed locked on Agatha. The way she tucked her feet under her on the couch. The way she kept fidgeting with the hem of her sweatshirt. The way she was still here, sitting close, talking like this was normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe, Rio thought, it could be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finished eating, Rio leaned back, stretching her arm over the back of the couch. Agatha glanced at her wine glass, then back at Rio, something flickering in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should probably head to bed soon,” she murmured, though she didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, letting her fingers trail lightly along the back of Agatha’s shoulder. “You kicking me out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, but there was no real exasperation behind it. “Nicky’s here, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said, voice softer now. “I wasn’t suggesting anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her for a long moment before finally, slowly, relaxing back against the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t push it. Instead, she just let her fingers keep tracing absentminded patterns on Agatha’s back, feeling every slow, steady breath she took.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, they just sat there, the weight of the past week settling between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Agatha leaned into Rio’s side, just enough that Rio could press a kiss to the top of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then her hand gently cupped Agatha’s face, tilting her head ever so slightly to bring their lips together. It was soft at first, a slow press of warmth and the faintest taste of wine. She pulled back just a fraction, eyes searching Agatha’s as she asked, her voice a whisper, “Is this okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond with words. Instead, she closed the space between them again, her lips finding Rio’s, this time with more urgency. It was like they couldn’t get enough, as if the distance of the past week had been too much, too heavy, and now, with just this kiss, they could finally breathe again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned softly as Agatha kissed her deeper, pulling her closer, hands roaming over the curves of her back, pressing her against her own body. Every touch felt electric, like a puzzle piece finally snapping into place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, Agatha’s breath was shallow, her chest rising and falling beneath Rio’s palm. Rio’s thumb traced the line of her jaw before she whispered, “I’ve missed you. So much.” She kissed her again, soft at first, but her body was already begging for more. When she finally pulled away, she rested her forehead against Agatha’s, eyes closed, and whispered in a breathless tone, “I’ve been dying to kiss you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips were swollen, her eyes heavy with desire, but there was something else there too—something tender. She didn’t say anything at first, just nodded, pressing a kiss to Rio’s chin. “Me too,” she murmured. “I missed this. Us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, but it was a smile laced with hunger. She leaned in again, wanting more, but just as their lips were about to meet again, a voice rang out from the top of the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom?” Nicky’s voice was sleepy but loud enough to make them freeze. “Can I get some water?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women paused, eyes wide for a moment, the tension between them suddenly cracking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a quiet sigh, pulling back reluctantly. “Nicky…” She turned her head to the stairs, her voice soft but apologetic. “He's supposed to be asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, trying to mask the grin pulling at her lips, leaned back against the couch, her hand still holding Agatha’s, not letting go. “Go get the kid his water,” she teased, voice low and playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot Rio a look but couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped her lips. “Right. I guess privacy’s overrated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave Rio a quick, affectionate kiss before heading toward the kitchen. Rio stayed where she was, watching Agatha, the taste of the kiss still lingering, her heart racing from the intensity of it. She knew there was more to come between them, more to explore. But for now, the moment was interrupted, and as much as she hated to let it go, she knew that there would be more chances—more moments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, though, she could just smile, content in the quiet promise of what was still to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha headed into the kitchen, Rio relaxed back onto the couch, her fingers still tingling from the warmth of Agatha’s touch. She exhaled slowly, her heart still racing, but the peaceful calm of being with Agatha settled over her. She allowed herself to relax for a moment, watching the soft glow of the lamps in the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, from the stairs, she heard the familiar sound of footsteps padding down. Nicky. Rio straightened up, instinctively glancing toward the stairs. She hadn’t expected him to come down, but there he was, standing at the foot of the stairs, blinking groggily in the dim light of the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes immediately locked on Rio, and though he still looked sleepy, his face broke into a big grin. “Rio?” he mumbled, rubbing his eyes. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her heart warming at the sight of his excitement. “Hey, Nicky,” she greeted him, holding up a hand in a casual wave. “I was just hanging out with your mom. We were talking and, well… I thought I’d stop by and say hi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s sleepy frown turned into a more awake smile as he shuffled over to her, his bare feet making soft padding sounds on the hardwood floor. “I missed you this week,” he admitted, his voice still thick with sleep. “You didn’t make it to our jam session at school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, touched by his words. “I know, buddy. I’m sorry. We’ve been in the studio working on stuff. But I’m glad to see you,” she said, giving him an affectionate smile. “How’ve you been? Still rocking out with your guitar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Nicky said, his excitement evident as he glanced over at the kitchen, then back to Rio. “Mom didn’t say you were coming over tonight or I would’ve waited! I didn’t expect to see you until next week.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, touched by how much Nicky clearly liked her company. “Well, here I am,” she said. “I’ve been busy, but I couldn’t miss the chance to hang out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could say more, Agatha returned from the kitchen, catching the end of their conversation. Nicky turned toward her with a happy grin. “Mom, Rio’s here! I didn’t know she was coming over tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at the exchange, her voice warm but cautious, as she handed him a glass of water. “Yes, she was in the neighborhood so she stopped by.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a rush of affection for both of them, and as Nicky turned back to her, she playfully ruffled his hair. “You know, I wouldn’t miss seeing you,” she said softly. “How about another jam session soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face lit up, as he drank his water. “Yes! That’d be awesome!” he said enthusiastically, bouncing on his feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, taking the glass back from him. “Okay, buddy, it’s late. Let’s not get too crazy. It’s way past your bedtime, mister.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah, I’m going back to bed,” Nicky grumbled good-naturedly, but he gave Rio a final smile before heading toward the stairs. “Goodnight, Rio. It was great seeing you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, Nicky,” Rio called after him, her heart full as she watched him disappear upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Nicky disappeared upstairs, Agatha returned to the living room, her expression soft but thoughtful. She glanced at Rio, her eyes full of tenderness, before sitting down next to her on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That went well,” Agatha said quietly, her voice warm. “He really loves playing with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, nodding. “Yeah, he’s a natural. I love how excited he gets about the jam sessions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled but then let out a soft sigh, her shoulders relaxing. She shifted a little, her gaze turning more serious. “About earlier… I think we need to talk about privacy. I don’t want Nicky walking in on us like that again.” She met Rio’s eyes, her voice quieter now. “We need to be careful. Especially in moments like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a sudden flush creep up her neck, but she nodded, her lips curving into a sheepish smile. “I get it. I don’t want to make things awkward for Nicky. Or you. I just… I don’t know, I didn’t think we’d be interrupted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her eyes still warm but cautious. “It’s just… Nicky’s already so attached to you, and I’m not sure how Mia will react to all of this.” She hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I’m not ready to talk about the future yet, but I do need to be mindful of how we go about this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, understanding Agatha’s hesitation. She wasn’t ready for any heavy talks about what this was, and Rio respected that. “I’m cool with that. I don’t want to rush anything either. Just… wanted to make sure you knew how I feel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened as she gave a small nod. “I know you do. And I care about you too. But let’s just… take it slow, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, giving a slow nod in return. “Slow sounds perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back against the couch, reaching for the remote control with a small sigh. “We’ll figure it out. Just, for now, maybe we keep things a little less… spontaneous,” she said with a teasing smirk, referring to their earlier moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and nodded again. “Yeah, no more impromptu make-out sessions on your couch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and clicked on the TV, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s as she did. “How about a movie? Something to just… relax.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, her body still close to Agatha’s, feeling a sense of comfort in the quiet after everything that had happened. “Sounds perfect. Nothing too serious, though. Just something to unwind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked a movie, and as the opening credits rolled, Rio found herself settling in beside Agatha, the tension from the moment earlier melting away. They didn’t need to rush forward, not just yet. Right now, the quiet companionship was enough, and that was something she was willing to hold onto.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes fluttered open in the dark, her body still warm from the closeness of Agatha’s. The TV was still on, the faint glow of the screen casting long shadows across the room. She blinked, the soft hum of the movie credits still playing in the background. Everything felt so peaceful, so right, and for a moment, she considered just staying there forever, with Agatha’s body just stretched out pretty much on top of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then reality hit her. She fished her phone out of her back pocket, careful not to disturb Agatha as she unlocked it and checked the time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>4:15am.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft sigh escaped Rio’s lips as she leaned her head back into the couch cushions, the weight of exhaustion pressing down on her. She couldn’t believe how much time had passed. She’d wanted to stay, wanted to savor the moment longer, but she knew it was time to go. Agatha needed rest, and so did she. Plus, Nicky was asleep upstairs, and as much as Rio adored being here, she didn’t want to overstay her welcome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gently shifted, brushing her fingers over Agatha’s hair, tucking a few strands behind her ear as she whispered softly, “Agatha… it’s late. You should get to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stirred in her sleep, her body shifting slightly, but she didn’t fully wake. Rio’s heart fluttered as she realized how comfortable they had both gotten with each other. It felt like something more, even though they hadn’t officially defined what it was yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a hand over Agatha’s shoulder and leaned in to kiss her softly on the cheek. “Hey, babe, it’s really late. I need to head out soon, and you should go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha mumbled something incoherent, clearly not fully awake, but Rio smiled at the sound of her voice—so warm and familiar. She gently nudged her again, a little more insistently. “Agatha,” she said softly, “you need to sleep. It’s really late, and I can’t stay much longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked awake, her eyelids heavy as she tried to focus on Rio’s face in the dim light. It took a few moments for her to process what Rio was saying, her gaze clearing as she realized what time it was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Agatha mumbled groggily, her voice thick with sleep. She gave Rio a sleepy smile, rubbing her eyes. “I guess we lost track of time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her fingers brushing over Agatha’s cheek as she smiled back. “We really did,” she said, before leaning in to kiss her once more, tender and slow. “But it’s really late, and I think it’s time I go home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her expression soft but a little reluctant as she slowly pushed herself up from Rio’s chest. “I understand,” she said quietly, looking up at Rio with those quiet, unreadable eyes. “Let me walk you to the door,” she offered as she pushed herself up from the couch, stretching a bit. Her movements were still slow, her body still adjusting to waking up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled warmly, watching Agatha move around in her sleepy haze. “I’ll be okay, but thanks,” she said, standing up as well. “You go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just… text me when you get home?” Agatha said, her voice soft but genuine, her tired eyes locking onto Rio’s as she tried to convey more than just the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart skipped a beat, her smile widening. “Of course. I will.” She leaned in, giving Agatha one last kiss, lingering just a little longer than she intended. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight, Rio,” Agatha whispered, watching her with a gaze that lingered a moment longer, filled with that unspoken warmth. “Drive safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her smile still in place as she slipped out the door. She stood on the porch for a moment, looking at the house—at Agatha, at everything that had happened, and feeling that familiar tug of something more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she headed down the path toward her car, she couldn’t help but think that maybe this was the start of something more than she had expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, she couldn’t quite figure out where she was. The late-night haze still hung around her, but the soft morning light streaming through the curtains was enough to wake her fully. She groaned and stretched, feeling the exhaustion of the week hitting her all at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone was next to her, and she grabbed it lazily, her fingers still half asleep. She smiled when she saw the text from Agatha, a simple “Good morning” with a teasing emoji. Rio chuckled and typed back: </span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Morning, beautiful.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She sent it off with a grin, feeling the warmth of the moment from the night before still lingering inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few more moments of stretching and blinking sleep from her eyes, Rio finally dragged herself out of bed. She was running late for her usual routine but didn’t care too much—she deserved a slow Saturday morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she made it downstairs, she found Mia sprawled out on the couch, her eyes glued to the TV. It was one of those lazy Saturday mornings where Mia wasn’t rushing off to anything, and Rio couldn’t help but smile at how much Mia had grown.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, kiddo,” Rio said, crossing the living room with a yawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia glanced up, raising an eyebrow at Rio. “Look who’s finally decided to join the land of the living,” she teased. “I was starting to get worried about you. You were sleeping in so late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, brushing her hair out of her face as she poured herself some coffee. “Yeah, well… long week. And I had a bit of a late night last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sat up a little, giving her a curious look. “What time did you get in?” she asked, sounding just a bit too casual, though Rio could detect the subtle note of concern in her voice. “I went to bed around midnight, and you still weren’t home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused for a second, her fingers tightening around her coffee mug. She didn’t want to over explain, but she didn’t exactly want to hide anything either. “I got home a little after midnight. Just needed to get some rest,” Rio said, keeping her voice light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t seem entirely convinced, her eyes narrowing for just a moment before she shrugged and picked up her phone again, as though she had already decided not to press further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, just making sure,” Mia said, but there was something in the way she said it, a little quieter than usual, that made Rio think Mia might have picked up on something more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway,” Rio continued, trying to shake the feeling off, “I was busy working all week. Needed some downtime, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded but didn’t say anything else. For a moment, the air felt heavier than usual, but then Mia leaned back against the couch, her attention back on the TV. Rio let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding, feeling a bit more relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned toward the kitchen, sipping her coffee, and after a moment of quiet, texted Agatha again.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Mia had questions this morning. I don’t think she’s buying the whole ‘late night at the studio’ thing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As she sent the message, Rio leaned against the counter, wondering how to navigate this situation with Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s phone buzzed as she stood by the counter, taking another sip of her coffee. It was Agatha’s reply:</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh no, what did she say? Is everything okay?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but smile softly at Agatha’s concern. The warmth of the message made her feel more at ease. She typed back quickly:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Mia’s good, she’s just… perceptive. She picked up on some things, you know? She was asking about the late night, but I think she’s okay for now. I think she knows something’s different, but I haven’t had the chance to have the conversation yet</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few moments later, Agatha replied:</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’ll come around. Kids are surprisingly resilient. You just need to be honest with her, when you’re ready. Don’t rush it</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. She could feel the weight of the situation, the building pressure of Mia’s questions that she knew she couldn’t avoid for much longer. It wasn’t just Mia who had to adjust; Rio had to come to terms with how much of her life she was willing to share, especially when it came to Agatha.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’ll talk to her. Just… I want to make sure we’re in a good place first. You know?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s reply came almost instantly:</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course. Just take your time, Rio. This isn’t something to rush. I’m definitely not ready to tell Nicky either. We’re good keeping this to ourselves for now 💜</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled as she read Agatha’s message. Her heart warmed at the reassurance, but the concern for Mia still lingered in the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The following Monday, Mia came home from school with a look on her face that Rio instantly recognized: a mix of frustration and discomfort. As Rio poured herself a cup of coffee, Mia dropped her bag on the chair and sat down across from her at the kitchen table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia, what’s going on?” Rio asked gently, sensing something was off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia looked up at her, her brow furrowed. “People were teasing me at school today,” she said, her voice laced with annoyance. “I don’t know if you noticed, but there were some pictures of you from the other day… leaving this liquor store with two boxes of pizza and a bottle of whatever, I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach tightened, and she set her mug down carefully. “Great. The stupid paparazzi again…” she muttered, rubbing a hand over her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia continued, voice shaky, “Yeah, well. People were saying that you were finding me a new daddy, or… well, one kid said it was probably a new mommy, and then someone else called you a ‘fucking dyke,” she said, making air quotation marks and rolling her eyes. “Which is ridiculous because apparently people judge you for buying pizza now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hit Rio harder than she expected. Mia, at 15, was still so fragile in some ways, despite the tough exterior she often put up. Rio was suddenly acutely aware of just how much weight she carried on her shoulders, not only for herself but for Mia as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Mia added, “And then someone else said, ‘No wonder Mia doesn’t have a father; her mom goes through so many people, she probably doesn’t even know who Mia’s daddy is.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s chest tightened at the cruelty of the comment, and her hand gripped the edge of the table. Her instinct was to protect Mia, to shield her from this kind of pain, but she knew the teasing wasn’t going to stop. She could only try her best to be there for her daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s gaze was sharp as she met Rio’s eyes. “I told them they were full of shit and to leave me the hell alone. But it’s… embarrassing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, trying to keep her voice calm, even though she was furious at whoever had dared to say that to Mia. “Mia, I’m really sorry you had to deal with that. I should’ve been more careful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Mia started, crossing her arms, “I’m not a little kid anymore. I don’t need you to protect me. But… I wish you would’ve told me before it all started. I mean, you know… if you’re seeing someone. I could’ve at least been ready for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a knot in her stomach. She had been trying to protect Mia from this, trying to figure out how to handle things without making it worse. But she hadn’t prepared her daughter for what was coming. The realization made her feel guilty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia, it’s just… complicated,” Rio said softly. “I didn’t want to make it harder for you, especially with everything else you’re dealing with. But I promise, I’ll talk to you more about it soon. Just… not yet, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia raised an eyebrow, but she didn’t argue. Rio continued, “Just don’t let people keep saying shit like that about you,” she muttered. “It’s one thing to have people talk about me. It comes with the territory, but I don’t want anyone talking about you like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded and Rio smiled softly, relieved that her daughter didn’t seem too upset with her. “I won’t let them. I promise.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for having my back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia just shrugged, looking away. “Yeah, well, it’s not like I have much choice.” Then she got up and grabbed her bag. “I’ll be upstairs. Got loads of homework”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’ll be here,” Rio said, watching her leave. She wasn’t sure if Mia fully understood the complexity of the situation, but at least she hadn’t completely shut her out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Mia was gone, Rio sat there in the quiet of the kitchen, thinking about everything that had happened in the past week. She knew this was just the beginning of a bigger conversation, one that she wasn’t quite ready for yet. But she’d figure it out. She always did.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha had woken early, as usual, her mind already moving through the rhythm of the day ahead. Wednesdays meant the usual hum of Sonata Grove, followed by Mia’s piano lesson—something that usually brought a quiet sense of purpose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But today she felt a bit worried that Mia had been asking questions about what Rio’s been doing. She felt a bit guilty, but at this point, she didn’t feel like she could walk away unscathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky had already rushed out the door, full of chatter and barely zipped up, as he climbed into Wanda’s car, and now the house was quiet. Agatha was halfway through her coffee and had just pulled out her notes for the morning when her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey, Agatha. Just wanted to give you a heads-up about Mia. She’s been upset. Some photos of me leaving a liquor store with pizza and wine last Friday got out, and now kids at school are saying stuff. The pics are harmless, and they’re talking mostly shit about me, but you know how kids are. She’s been really down.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the message for a second, her brows drawing together. She could already feel it—that tight little knot in her chest. Poor Mia. And Rio… God, she must’ve felt helpless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She typed back.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’m sorry, Rio. That’s awful. I’ll keep a close eye on her today.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, then added:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>And I’ll be gentle with her. Promise.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The words felt right—quiet, but steady. Mia didn’t need a lecture or forced smiles. She just needed space to be herself, to know she wasn’t being judged. Agatha knew what it was like to be young and guarded, to carry more than you knew how to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A new buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Thanks. I’m going to try talking to her when she gets home. I don’t know if I’ll say the right thing. I feel like I keep getting it all wrong lately. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back against the counter, her phone resting in her hand. She could hear Rio’s voice in her head—low, frustrated, maybe a little tired. The kind of tired that didn’t come from lack of sleep, but from caring too much and not being able to fix things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled, just a little. That was something they had in common.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You’re doing better than you think, you know. Mia’s lucky to have you. And I’ll take care of her today. You don’t have to worry.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hovered for a second before hitting send. It felt… strange, letting something soft slip through like that. But it was the truth. And Rio should hear it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set her phone down and looked at the time. The hours would fly. Mia would be here soon enough, and Agatha wanted her to feel, if nothing else, that this space—this small corner of the world—was still safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went to the piano, fingers brushing over the keys, but her thoughts lingered on the girl who was hurting—and on the woman trying so hard to protect her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The day had been a whirlwind already. Agatha had just finished a few lessons at Sonata Grove and was heading back to her office when she received a call from the school nurse. Nicky wasn’t feeling well—she needed to come pick him up. Agatha’s heart sank, and she hurried to grab her things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she arrived, Nicky was sitting in the nurse’s office, his cheeks flushed with color, and his eyes heavy. He was trying to be brave, but Agatha could see the telltale signs of a fever. She knelt down beside him, brushing a hand through his messy hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay, kiddo?” she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just tired, Mom,” he mumbled, his voice weak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and helped him gather his things before taking him to Sonata Grove. She wasn’t sure what had caused the fever, but she knew he’d need rest. Since her schedule was light, she decided to take him to her office so he could sleep while she finished up the last class of the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get you settled, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured, leading him to her office. She set him up on the small couch with a blanket and tucked him in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Mom,” he whispered, already drifting off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a small smile, Agatha kissed his forehead and tiptoed out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her. The last thing she wanted was for him to be disturbed while he rested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was returning to the reception, she saw Rio and Mia walk in together. Mia looked tired, but she didn’t seem to be in any kind of distress. Agatha smiled at them both, though she could feel the tension between herself and Rio, and it had only been a few days since they’d shared that passionate moment on her couch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Mia,” Agatha greeted her student, giving her a quick but warm smile. “Go ahead and head to the classroom. I’ll be right there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, her eyes flickering between Agatha and Rio. As Mia walked away, Agatha gestured for Rio to follow her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They slipped into the office quickly, Agatha closing the door behind them. She hadn’t expected to have this much time alone with Rio, especially with Nicky sleeping in the room, but the urge to be close to Rio hit her like a tidal wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything okay with Mia?” Agatha asked, though her voice sounded more distracted than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft sigh, her brow furrowing as she looked at Agatha. “She’s had a tough day,” Rio said quietly, leaning against the desk. “She’s worried about the teasing at school. I just want her to feel safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart clenched for both of them. “She will,” she said softly, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “Mia’s strong. She’s got you, and she’s got her safe space here. We’ll help her through this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause. Rio was looking at her with those dark eyes, and Agatha could feel the intensity of the moment building. She wanted nothing more than to step closer, to kiss her again, to feel that warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then, Rio’s eyes flickered to the couch, and she tensed slightly. “Is Nicky okay?” she asked softly, her concern evident as she saw the small figure curled up on the couch, fast asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair. “He’s got a fever,” she explained quietly, her gaze lingering on Nicky. “It's probably just the flu. He should be okay. He just needs some sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened with sympathy, and then she stepped toward Agatha, her presence calming. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she felt the pull between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With Nicky still asleep, Agatha found herself unable to resist. She stepped into Rio’s space, their gazes locking, and Rio leaned in slowly, brushing her lips against Agatha’s. It was soft, gentle, but it carried the weight of everything Agatha had been holding back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breathless sigh as Rio deepened the kiss, her hand coming up to cup Agatha’s cheek. The kiss was everything she had been craving, everything she hadn’t allowed herself to feel in the rush of the past few days. Rio’s lips were warm, her touch tender, and Agatha melted into it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they broke apart, Agatha’s heart raced, and she looked up at Rio, her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Rio…” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “I… I don’t want to be reckless with him in the room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s thumb brushed over Agatha’s cheek, her smile soft but knowing. “It’s okay,” she whispered back, her voice low and steady. “You’re not being reckless. I’ve just missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, trying to steady herself. This was more than she had expected today, more than she was prepared to handle—but Rio was here, and it felt so right. And she couldn’t help herself when she leaned in again, capturing Rio’s lips in a quick but powerful kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment, Agatha pulled away slowly, her heart racing. Rio’s warmth still lingered on her lips, and it was hard to shake the feeling of her closeness, of how easily they had fallen back into each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate to leave him like this,” Agatha said quietly, glancing back at Nicky on the couch. She felt a pang of guilt at the thought of leaving him while he was sick, even though he was resting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, sensing her hesitation, gave her a reassuring smile. “I can stay with Nicky while you go to class with Mia,” she offered, her voice soft but certain. “He’s already asleep, and I can keep an eye on him. I don’t mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for a moment, surprised by Rio’s offer. She had been so preoccupied with the tension of the situation that she hadn’t even thought about it. But Rio was right—Nicky was sleeping, and Agatha’s class with Mia was about to start.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d be okay with that?” Agatha asked, her brow furrowed slightly. “I don’t want to put you out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled again, her eyes soft with affection. “Of course, Agatha,” she said gently. “I’m happy to help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened at the thought of Rio staying, even if just for a little while. “Okay,” she finally said, her voice quiet, “thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a warm, knowing smile and reached out, brushing a hand over Agatha’s arm. “It’s nothing,” she replied, her thumb gently caressing the soft skin of Agatha’s forearm. “Go ahead. I’ll be right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Agatha took a deep breath and walked toward the door. She glanced back over her shoulder to find Rio already settling into the chair by Nicky’s side, looking at him with a watchful, protective gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart softened as she opened the door to head to Mia’s class. The connection between them was undeniable, and seeing Rio so easily take on a role that felt so natural for her—caring for Nicky, making sure everything was okay—was a reminder of just how much Rio had already become a part of their lives. It wasn’t just about the chemistry between them anymore. It was about the way Rio fit so effortlessly into the rhythm of Agatha’s world, like she’d belonged there all along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat at the piano, her fingers gently pressing the keys, guiding Mia through the familiar song that the young girl was struggling with. The notes, though challenging, should have come more naturally by now. But as Mia played, her timing was off, and her fingers stuttered over the keys as if she was in a different world entirely. It was becoming more and more evident that Mia was somewhere else, lost in her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia,” Agatha said, her voice warm but firm. “Slow down. Focus on the melody. Don’t rush it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t respond immediately. She stared at the keys in front of her, eyes unfocused. Agatha’s concern deepened. Mia had been distracted through the entire lesson, her usual energy replaced by a quiet tension that Agatha couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia,” Agatha repeated, her tone softer now. “What’s on your mind? You’ve been off today. Talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia looked up at Agatha then, her expression guarded, as though she was weighing how much to say. Agatha waited patiently, giving her the space to open up. It took a while, but Mia finally sighed and let out a quiet, almost imperceptible groan of frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s… school,” Mia muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know. People have been saying stuff about my mom.” She paused, biting her lip. “They said she’s seeing someone now. Like, a new person. And I’m getting teased, like… they’re saying the worst things about her, you know? Which is so stupid. It’s like my mom can’t do anything without people talking about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a pang in her chest. She knew how much Mia cared about her mother and how much pressure she already carried as the daughter of a public figure. The idea of people making cruel comments about Rio didn’t sit well with Agatha, especially when Mia was already vulnerable from all the chaos of her teenage years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Mia,” Agatha said, her voice low and understanding. “What exactly are they saying?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shifted uncomfortably in her seat, clearly reluctant to delve too deep into the details. “Some kids are making jokes,” she said with a touch of bitterness. “Saying stuff like… no wonder I don’t  have a father, like she’s gone through so many people. They even said she probably doesn’t even know who my father is. It’s just… ugh, it feels like everyone’s talking about her. It’s embarrassing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly, understanding the weight of Mia’s words. She could hear the hurt in Mia’s voice, the way she had to swallow back her emotions as she tried to brush it off. Agatha leaned forward, her eyes meeting Mia’s with a quiet, reassuring intensity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia,” Agatha said softly, her voice gentle but filled with certainty. “You know none of that is true, right? None of it matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s eyes flickered with a mix of confusion and frustration. “It doesn’t matter? Everyone’s talking about it, and—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“People will always talk,” Agatha interrupted, her tone calm but firm. “But it doesn’t change anything. What matters is that your mom loves you. And you know that. Whatever people are saying, it doesn’t define you or your mom. Your mom isn’t some public spectacle; she’s a person. And she’s not defined by anyone’s assumptions or cruel comments.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s shoulders drooped a little, and for the first time that afternoon, she seemed to relax, just slightly. Agatha reached out, placing a hand gently on her shoulder in a gesture of reassurance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mom’s a strong woman. And if she’s seeing someone, she trusts them, Mia. And she deserves to be happy.” Agatha gave her a small smile. “You deserve to see her happy, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia stayed quiet for a moment, then nodded, though she still seemed troubled. “I know. It just… feels weird. I don’t know. I don’t want to be that kid at school, you know? The one whose mom is some sort of joke. The one whose mom is so… open about everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart softened for her. She could see that Mia was struggling with the balance between protecting her mom and also finding her own space to be a teenager, something that had to be incredibly complicated with the added pressure of being in Rio’s world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand,” Agatha said quietly, her voice full of empathy. “But you’re not alone in this, Mia. Your mom’s been through a lot, and she’s still standing strong. And you’re the same way. You’re strong too. Just know that you have people around you who care. Including me.” She smiled a little more widely. “And if you ever need to talk, you know I’m always here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia looked up at her, her eyes softening as she seemed to take in Agatha’s words. “Thanks, Agatha,” she said, her voice barely a whisper, but sincere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a small nod and gestured back to the piano. “Let’s get back to the song, okay? One note at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gave a small nod in return, and this time, when she placed her hands on the keys, there was less tension in her fingers. She played with a little more focus, though Agatha could tell there was still a lot on her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they continued the lesson, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that there was so much more Mia was carrying beneath the surface. But for now, all Agatha could do was be there, offer a little comfort, and make sure she knew that she was not alone in facing whatever came next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the lesson wrapped up, Agatha looked up from the piano and noticed Mia’s shoulders had relaxed slightly, though the weight of her earlier thoughts still seemed to linger in her eyes. Agatha decided to bring up Nicky’s condition, hoping to shift the focus a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia,” Agatha said softly as she gathered her music sheets, “Your mom stayed with Nicky while I was with you. He has a fever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s brow furrowed with concern, her earlier tension softening. “Nicky’s sick? Is he okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled gently. “He’s fine. Just a fever. He’s been resting in my office, and Rio’s been keeping him company while we had our lesson.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded and, without further hesitation, the two of them made their way out of the music room and down the hall to Agatha’s office. The closer they got, the more Mia’s pace slowed, her thoughts clearly still caught up in the earlier conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached the doorway, Agatha could hear Nicky’s voice, soft and comforting, his words a gentle murmur in the otherwise quiet room. When they walked in, the sight before them was unexpected but somehow soothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, propped up against the side of the couch, was leaning against Rio, his head resting on her shoulder. Rio was bent slightly toward him, her voice quiet but kind, asking him about his day at school as she ran her fingers through his hair in a comforting, almost maternal gesture. They were both so absorbed in their conversation that they didn’t notice Agatha and Mia standing in the doorway for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s eyes flicked up, finally noticing the two of them. A soft smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Hey, Mia!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia returned his smile, though her expression was still somewhat distant. “How’s the fever?” she asked, her voice still holding a bit of concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s better,” Nicky said, giving a small shrug. He shifted so that he wasn’t leaning on Rio as much but stayed close to her. “Rio’s been keeping me company. Told me about the band and everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a soft chuckle, her arm still wrapped loosely around Nicky’s shoulders. “Yeah, we were just talking about how loud our band can get sometimes. It’s kind of a miracle we ever practice at all with all the noise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia nodded, though there was still a glint of something unspoken in her eyes as she glanced at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped in to break the small tension, a gentle smile curving her lips as she looked between Rio and Nicky. “I’ll take over now. Thanks for staying with him, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a knowing look and nodded, standing up slowly from the couch. “Of course. Yeah, I think it’s time we get going. I have a few things I need to take care of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave Nicky a quick ruffle of his hair before looking over at Agatha, the two of them sharing a brief, silent exchange. Agatha’s heart skipped a beat, the pull between them still undeniable, though she kept her composure as they spoke in front of Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for letting me hang out with him,” Rio said to Agatha with a smile, “I’ll check in on you later?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her tone light yet sincere. “Of course. And if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio stood to leave, she gave Nicky a soft ruffle of his hair. “Rest up, okay? I’ll see you soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed up at her, giving her a thumbs up. “See you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart tightened as she watched Rio, a mix of longing and uncertainty in her chest. It hadn’t been long since their last conversation, but something about seeing her with Nicky made it all feel more real—more significant. She tried to push the feelings down, reminding herself to stay focused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia followed her mother to the door, but called out over her shoulder, “Feel better, Nicky!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled down at her daughter, though there was a flicker of something else in her eyes—concern, maybe, or relief. Whatever it was, it didn’t quite reach her voice when she turned to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you guys soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Rio and Mia left together, the door clicking softly behind them. Agatha stood in the quiet of her office for a moment, staring at the now-empty space where they’d just been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a breath, her thoughts swirling as she returned to the desk to organize a few papers. There was something about the way Rio and Mia had left together—something solid, even if she couldn’t quite name it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew the dynamics between them were complex, but for now, she had to focus on the here and now. Mia’s lesson had gone well, and Nicky was recovering. There was enough to be grateful for, even if there were still questions she wasn’t ready to answer yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had spent the next few days tending to a feverish, miserable Nicky. His flu had hit him hard, keeping him glued to the couch with tissues scattered around him, his usually boundless energy replaced with exhaustion. She hated seeing him like this, but at least his fever had started to break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d just finished making him a bowl of soup when her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey, how’s the patient?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, leaning against the kitchen counter.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Still a little feverish, but better than yesterday. He’s mostly sleeping now.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Poor kid. You holding up?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the question for a moment. She was exhausted, to be honest. She hadn’t left the house in days, barely sleeping as she checked on Nicky every few hours. But something about Rio checking in made warmth bloom in her chest.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I’ve been better. But I’ll survive.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She expected that to be the end of it, but Rio’s next text made her blink.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I miss you</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers hesitated over the keyboard. It wasn’t unexpected, not after the night they’d spent together and the texts they’d exchanged since. But reading it still made her pulse quicken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could overthink it, another message popped up.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Let me bring you something. Both of you. A little care package. Maybe some soup, tea, some cookies?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled despite herself, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You don’t have to do that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I know. But I want to.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, hesitating. She should probably say no. But the idea of seeing Rio, even just for a few minutes, was too tempting to resist.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Okay. Just nothing too much. It’s been a battle to get him to eat, and I don’t want you going overboard.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No promises ;)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she felt lighter than she had in days.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A little over an hour later, Agatha heard the sound of a car pulling into her driveway. She quickly checked on Nicky—still fast asleep on the couch, his little body curled under a blanket—before heading to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she opened it, Rio stood there, balancing two large paper bags in her arms, a lopsided grin on her face. She was bundled up in a hoodie and leather jacket, her hair tucked under a beanie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before you say anything,” Rio said, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation, “I did go overboard, but in my defense, I don’t know how to do things halfway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, arching an eyebrow as she closed the door behind her. “I said nothing too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a pointed look. “And I ignored you. You’ll live.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the bags on the kitchen counter and started unpacking: homemade soup from a little place she swore had the best broth in the city, a variety of teas, a jar of honey, fresh bread, lemon cookies, and—Agatha huffed a laugh—a small plush guitar with oversized eyes and a cute smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For Nicky,” Rio said, holding up the toy. “Thought he could use a little buddy while he’s sick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart twisted unexpectedly at the thoughtfulness of it all. “You’re ridiculous,” she murmured, but there was no bite to her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, stepping a little closer. “You love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her body betrayed her, leaning into Rio’s warmth. “I tolerate it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed. “Uh-huh.” Her hand brushed Agatha’s waist, subtle but deliberate, and Agatha exhaled slowly, letting her eyes flutter shut for just a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, she’d missed this. Missed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before either of them could lean in any further, a small groggy voice interrupted them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back quickly, turning to see Nicky standing in the hallway, blanket draped over his shoulders. His hair was a mess, and his face was still flushed with fever, but his eyes lit up at the sight of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kiddo,” Rio said, her voice warm. “You’re supposed to be resting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard your voice,” he mumbled, rubbing at his eyes. “And I missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt something crack wide open in her chest at the way Rio’s face softened completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, lucky for you, I brought you some good stuff.” Rio crouched down to his level, pulling the plush guitar from the counter and handing it to him. “And I figured you might need a little sick-day companion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky took the plush with a small smile, pressing his face into it. “I love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Good. Now come on, let’s get you back on the couch before your mom yells at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “I don’t yell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her an amused look as she helped Nicky shuffle back toward the living room. “You give looks, though. Very sharp, very scary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky giggled, his voice still a little hoarse, and Agatha sighed but didn’t argue. It was hardly worth it when Rio had already won Nicky over completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they got him settled with a cup of tea and a small bowl of soup, he was looking more awake. He clutched the plush guitar to his chest, occasionally sneaking small smiles at Rio between spoonfuls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stayed for a while, keeping both Agatha and Nicky company as they lounged in the living room. She didn’t push for anything, didn’t steal any more touches or kisses, but she was there, warm and steady, filling the space with quiet ease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, Nicky started nodding off again, and Agatha stood to adjust his blanket. She glanced over at Rio, hesitating for only a moment before jerking her head toward the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed without a word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment they were out of sight, Agatha turned to her, keeping her voice low. “Thank you. For all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, leaning casually against the counter. “You don’t have to thank me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do.” Agatha took a breath, glancing toward the living room before meeting Rio’s gaze again. “I don’t—this isn’t… easy for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression softened. “I know.” She reached out, brushing her fingers lightly against Agatha’s wrist. “I’m not in a rush. You know that, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, nodding. She did know. It was probably the only reason she hadn’t run yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed her hand once before pulling away. “Alright. I should get out of your hair. Let you rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to tell her she didn’t have to go, but the words caught in her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she walked her to the door, lingering as Rio slipped her jacket back on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Text me later?” Rio asked, voice quieter now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled softly. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Good.” She reached for the doorknob, then hesitated. “Oh, and, uh—make sure Nicky drinks plenty of fluids.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled. “I know how to take care of my son, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just checking.” Rio grinned, and then, with a final lingering glance, she stepped outside into the cool evening air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Rio turned to leave, Agatha reached out without thinking, fingers curling around the sleeve of her jacket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely had time to react before Agatha tugged her back, closing the space between them. Their bodies brushed, and Agatha hesitated for only a second before tilting her chin up and pressing her lips to Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t hurried, wasn’t desperate—just something inevitable, something Agatha had no desire to resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio made a soft sound against her mouth, surprised but pleased, her hands settling instinctively at Agatha’s waist. The kiss lingered, slow and deep, leaving them both a little breathless when they finally pulled apart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s forehead rested against hers, her voice hushed. “Not that I’m complaining, but what was that for?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, her fingers still gripping the fabric of Rio’s jacket. “I don’t know,” she admitted, but that wasn’t entirely true. She just wanted—wanted this, wanted her, wanted to stop pretending like she didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, her thumb grazing Agatha’s hip. “Well, I liked it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, stepping back before she did something reckless like pull her inside. “Go home, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, backing down the steps. “Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was still grinning when she climbed into her car, and Agatha watched her drive away, lips tingling, stomach tight with something she refused to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This thing with Rio—whatever it was—was already slipping past the point of control. And for once, she wasn’t sure she minded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weekend passed in a blur of tending to Nicky—monitoring his fever, coaxing him to drink fluids, and watching more episodes of his favorite cartoon than Agatha cared to count. It wasn’t until Monday morning, when he finally woke up without glassy eyes and congestion thick in his voice, that she allowed herself to breathe a little easier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time she arrived at Sonata Grove, she was exhausted but relieved to be back in her routine. She was sorting through lesson plans in her office when her phone buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How’s our little dude today?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, already biting back a smile as she typed a response.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Feeling much better, thankfully. I’ll still keep him home from school one more day just to be safe, but I think the worst is over.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s reply came almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s good. I missed you this weekend.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers hovered over her keyboard. It was one thing to kiss Rio on her doorstep in the quiet of the night, caught up in something she couldn’t name. It was another thing entirely to acknowledge it in the stark light of day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>I missed you too</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach flipped as soon as she sent it. Ridiculous. She was a grown woman, not some love-struck teenager.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could dwell on it, another text popped up.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Any chance I can see you soon?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky would be home from school tomorrow, but Wednesday… Wednesday was Mia’s lesson.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio always came with her.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You’ll see me Wednesday</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could practically feel Rio’s smirk through the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, you’re making me wait? That’s cold, Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was no real bite behind it.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Patience is a virtue, Vidal.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A pause, then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Never been one of mine.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, shaking her head. She was in trouble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because Wednesday suddenly felt much too far away.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Wednesday arrived too slowly for Rio’s liking. She wasn’t sure if it was the exhaustion of back-to-back studio sessions or the way Agatha’s text had stuck with her, but by the time she parked outside Sonata Grove, she was buzzing with restless energy.</p><p>Mia, sitting in the passenger seat, gave her a suspicious look. “You’re weirdly chipper for someone who’s been complaining about how busy work is.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, keeping her face neutral. “Maybe I just like watching you suffer through scales.”</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes but let it go, grabbing her bag and hopping out of the car.</p><p>Inside, Sonata Grove was its usual hum of quiet activity—students moving between rooms, soft melodies drifting from behind closed doors. Agatha was at the main area talking to a student, dressed in her usual professional attire, her hair neatly pinned back.</p><p>“Mia,” Agatha greeted, giving Mia a small nod before flicking her gaze toward Rio. “Vidal.”</p><p>It was subtle, but Rio caught the way Agatha’s expression softened for just a second, the ghost of something private passing between them before she turned her attention back to Mia.</p><p>Patience is a virtue, patience is a virtue, Rio reminded herself.</p><p>Mia gave a half-hearted wave. “Hey.”</p><p>“Let’s get started,” Agatha said, already leading Mia toward her classroom. But as she passed Rio, her fingers barely, barely brushed against Rio’s wrist.</p><p>It was nothing. Barely contact at all.</p><p>And yet, Rio swore she felt it everywhere.</p><p>She exhaled sharply and made her way to Agatha’s office, where she’d planned to wait. She wasn’t inside for more than a minute before the door opened again, and there Agatha stood, looking at her like she was debating something.</p><p>Then, without a word, she stepped inside, shut the door, and crossed the room in three strides.</p><p>Rio barely had a second to react before Agatha’s lips were on hers—firm, insistent, like she’d been holding back just as much as Rio had.</p><p>Rio groaned, immediately pulling her close, her hands finding the curve of Agatha’s waist. “You could’ve at least pretended to make me wait,” she murmured against her lips.</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, brushing her nose against Rio’s. “I changed my mind.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Good.”</p><p>She kissed her again, slower this time, savoring the way Agatha melted just a little bit more against her. But the moment was fleeting, and soon Agatha was reluctantly pulling back.</p><p>“I have a lesson to teach,” she murmured, smoothing a hand over her shirt as if that would erase the flush in her cheeks.</p><p>Rio leaned against the desk, arms crossed, watching her with an amused smirk. “Sure. And I’m supposed to just sit here and behave?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a pointed look as she opened the door. “I trust you’ll manage.”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically. “Fine.”</p><p>But as Agatha left, Rio caught the way her fingers lingered on the doorknob just a little too long, like she wasn’t quite ready to walk away either.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It was getting harder and harder to ignore just how deep she was falling.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio sighed, running a hand through her hair as the office door clicked shut behind Agatha.</p><p>She was supposed to just sit here after that? Like nothing had happened? Like Agatha Harkness hadn’t just walked in, kissed her like she’d been starving for it, and then walked right back out like it was nothing?</p><p>Rio groaned, dropping onto the couch and throwing her head back.</p><p>She’s killing me.</p><p>There was a restless energy buzzing under her skin, a low hum of frustration mixed with satisfaction. Agatha was driving her crazy—this push and pull, this maddening restraint followed by these fleeting moments of indulgence. It was intoxicating, and Rio wasn’t sure how much longer she could handle it.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>She wanted to kiss Agatha in broad daylight, where anyone could see. She wanted to pull her into her arms whenever she felt like it. She wanted to be with her in a way that wasn’t hidden behind closed doors and stolen moments.</p><p>But she also wanted Agatha comfortable. She wanted her to want this just as much as she did, without hesitation or fear.</p><p>So she’d wait.</p><p>Even if it killed her.</p><p>Still, she wasn’t about to sit there and sulk like a lovesick teenager. She pushed herself up, rolling her shoulders, and decided to take a walk around Sonata Grove. She passed a few students on the way, nodding at them as she moved through the halls. Most of them were too young to care about who she was, which was honestly a relief.</p><p>She found herself lingering near the classroom where Agatha and Mia were, the faint sound of a piano drifting through the slightly open door.</p><p>Mia was playing something slow and intricate, but Rio could hear the tension in it—the way her daughter’s usual confidence was absent. It wasn’t like her to second-guess herself when she played, but she had been off the past few days.</p><p>Rio leaned against the wall just outside the room, listening.</p><p>“That was better,” Agatha’s voice filtered through, calm and steady. “But you’re hesitating. What’s distracting you?”</p><p>Mia was quiet for a moment before muttering, “Nothing.”</p><p>“Mia.”</p><p>A sigh. “It’s stupid.”</p><p>“I highly doubt that.”</p><p>There was a pause, and then Mia spoke again, her voice quieter now. “People at school have been talking about my mom again.”</p><p>Rio tensed.</p><p>She hadn’t told Agatha the specifics of what Mia had gone through earlier in the week—how cruel kids could be, how vicious they had been with their words. It wasn’t just about Rio dating again. It was about her, about the way she lived her life, the way people had always judged her for being unconventional, for being different.</p><p>She could hear Agatha shifting in her seat. “What did they say?”</p><p>Mia let out a humorless laugh. “Oh, more of the same, you know? That she goes through people. That I’ll end up the same way, stuff like that. It’s stupid. And I shouldn’t let it get to me. But it does.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw, her hands curling into fists at her sides.</p><p>“I see.” Agatha’s voice was even, but there was a sharpness to it now, a quiet anger simmering beneath the surface.</p><p>Mia let out a breath. “It’s not like it’s the first time people have talked shit. But I guess it got to me more this time. I just… I don’t care if my mom’s seeing someone. I just wish people would stop acting like it’s a bad thing.”</p><p>Rio felt her throat tighten.</p><p>For so long, she had worried about what Mia thought, about how her daughter might react to her dating again. But here she was, more upset about the way people talked about Rio than the fact that Rio might have someone in her life.</p><p>God, she loved this kid.</p><p>There was a brief silence before Agatha spoke again, her voice softer now. “I’m sorry they said those things to you.”</p><p>Mia shrugged. “Not your fault.”</p><p>“No. But I wish you didn’t have to deal with it.” A pause. “For what it’s worth, your mother is one of the best people I know.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Mia was quiet for a long moment. And then, in a much smaller voice, “You really think that?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said without hesitation. “I do.”</p><p>Something in Rio’s chest ached.</p><p>She didn’t move from her spot outside the door, barely even breathed, just listening.</p><p>Mia sniffed. “She’s kind of a disaster.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet chuckle. “Maybe. But she’s also brilliant. And kind. And she loves you more than anything.”</p><p>Mia didn’t say anything right away, but when she spoke again, her voice was steadier. “Yeah. I know.”</p><p>Rio swallowed against the lump in her throat.</p><p>Agatha clapped her hands together once. “Alright. Enough heavy conversation. Again, from the top. And this time, trust yourself.”</p><p>Mia sighed, but when she started playing again, there was more confidence in the notes.</p><p>Rio exhaled, finally stepping away from the door.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she could fall for Agatha any more than she already had.</p><p>But somehow, she just kept proving her wrong.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio stayed outside the classroom a little longer, listening to the way Mia’s playing shifted. It wasn’t perfect—Mia was still holding onto some tension—but there was a newfound steadiness to it. A quiet resilience. It made Rio’s chest tighten, a strange mix of pride and heartbreak settling in her ribs.</p><p>She hated that Mia had to deal with this kind of shit. Hated that people saw Rio’s love life as some sort of spectacle, something to mock or dissect. It wasn’t fair. She had spent her entire life fighting for people to take her seriously—first as a musician, then as a mother, then as a lesbian in the public eye. And no matter what she did, no matter how much she tried to just live her fucking life, people always had something to say.</p><p>And now they were turning their cruelty on Mia.</p><p>Rio ran a hand down her face, exhaling sharply.</p><p>Later. She’d deal with this later. </p><p>She made her way back to Agatha’s office, heart still aching from what she’d overheard. She needed a distraction. Something to ground her. Something to—</p><p>The moment she stepped inside, Nicky lifted his head from where he was curled up on the couch, reading a book. His hair was a mess, and he looked downright adorable.</p><p>“Rio.” His voice was rough with the remnants of the flu, but there was no mistaking the little spark of excitement in it.</p><p>Some of the weight in her chest lifted.</p><p>“Hey, buddy,” she said, shutting the door behind her. “You feeling any better?”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “Ugh, kinda. I just wish this stupid flu would go away already.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, coming to sit beside him. “That bad, huh?”</p><p>He nodded dramatically. “I think I’m dying.”</p><p>“Wow. And yet, somehow, you still have the energy to be dramatic.”</p><p>That got a giggle out of him. “Did you bring me anything?” he asked, all hopeful innocence, but she could see the sparkle in his eyes.</p><p>Rio smirked. “I am the thing, kid. You got me.”</p><p>He huffed. “I meant food.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “No food, but I can get you a juice box from the vending machine in a bit.”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>Rio settled back into the couch, letting out a slow breath as Nicky relaxed against her side. He was still warm, his little body radiating heat, but he seemed content for now.</p><p>“Where’s my mom?” he asked after a moment.</p><p>“She’s finishing up a lesson with Mia,” Rio told him. “Shouldn’t be too long.”</p><p>At the mention of Mia, Nicky made a little face. “Mia’s cool. But she’s so serious.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Yeah, she can be. But she’s got a good heart.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, yawning. “I know.”</p><p>She stayed where she was, letting him lean against her, his hand curling into the fabric of her hoodie like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Something warm settled in Rio’s chest.</p><p>This thing with Agatha was still new. It was still uncertain. But this—Nicky trusting her enough to fall asleep against her, Agatha trusting her enough to leave her with him—this was something real. Something steady.</p><p>And for someone like Rio, who had spent her whole life chasing the next thing, the next thrill, the next stage—this kind of steadiness was something she had never even realized she wanted.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment, letting herself just be in it.</p><p>Letting herself have this.</p><p>And for once, she wasn’t afraid of it.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Nicky was still a little sniffly, but he was in much better spirits than the last time she’d seen him. Which, in Rio’s book, meant he was officially cleared for some musical distraction.</p><p>After going after Wanda, she managed to get her hands on a guitar, settling onto the couch next to Nicky. He was curled up with a blanket, looking much less miserable than he had a few days ago, but still bored out of his mind.</p><p>“I’m fine now,” he insisted, but Rio arched an eyebrow.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” she said, strumming a few chords. “You say that, but I think you still need a little cheering up. Lucky for you, I happen to be really good at that.”</p><p>Nicky eyed her suspiciously but didn’t protest when she started playing. The melody was light and familiar, and as soon as recognition flickered across his face, Rio grinned.</p><p>“You know this one, don’t you?” she asked.</p><p>Nicky nodded. “Mom plays it sometimes.”</p><p>“Then you gotta help me out.”</p><p>He hesitated for only a second before he started singing along, voice a little hesitant at first, but quickly growing stronger.</p><p>
<em> And damn, the kid could sing. </em>
</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows, impressed, but didn’t say anything yet—she just let him enjoy it, keeping the melody steady and letting him take the lead.</p><p>Before long, he was fully into it, sitting up straighter, his little fingers tapping along to the beat. His voice was clearer now, no more fever-induced rasp, and he actually sounded really good.</p><p>Which was exactly when Agatha walked in.</p><p>She stopped short in the doorway, looking almost startled as she took in the sight of them.</p><p>Nicky didn’t even notice her at first—he was too focused, too happy, too into it.</p><p>Rio, however, met Agatha’s gaze over the top of the guitar, giving her a slow, knowing smile as she kept playing.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, watching them, something soft and warm in her expression.</p><p>And then, finally, the song came to an end, Nicky grinning as he flopped back against the couch.</p><p>Rio let the last chord ring out before setting the guitar down, tilting her head at Agatha.</p><p>“Did you know your kid could sing like that?”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, walking further into the room. “He’s always loved music.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, love is one thing. Talent is another,” Rio said, nudging Nicky playfully. “And this kid’s got both.”</p><p>Nicky beamed, clearly pleased with the compliment.</p><p>Agatha just shook her head, amused. “You’re supposed to be resting,” she reminded him.</p><p>“I was resting,” Nicky said, unrepentant. “Until Rio made me sing.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “Oh, so now it’s my fault?”</p><p>Nicky just grinned, and Agatha sighed, exasperated but clearly charmed.</p><p>Rio stretched out on the couch, casually draping an arm over the backrest, looking up at Agatha. “So. What do you think? Future rockstar in the making?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Not if I can help it.”</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically, clutching her chest. “How dare you?”</p><p>Nicky giggled, and Agatha just rolled her eyes, shaking her head.</p><p>But Rio caught the way her gaze lingered—on Nicky, on her, on the easy, comfortable way they were sitting together.</p><p>And she saw the way Agatha’s lips curled just slightly, like she couldn’t quite stop herself from smiling.</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a knowing look before she crouched down next to Nicky, feeling his forehead out of habit. Satisfied that his fever was well and truly gone, she brushed his hair back and sighed.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be overexerting yourself,” she murmured, but there was no real heat to it.</p><p>“I wasn’t,” Nicky insisted, snuggling deeper into his blanket. “Rio did all the work.”</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning back against the couch. “Damn right, I did.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a flat look but didn’t argue, instead reaching over and lightly squeezing Rio’s knee. A small, subtle touch—so quick that Nicky didn’t even notice.</p><p>But Rio felt it.</p><p>And she couldn’t help the way her whole body warmed at the contact.</p><p>Agatha straightened, standing beside her now, close enough that Rio could smell her perfume, a soft, delicate scent that made her want to bury her face against her neck.</p><p>Instead, she tilted her head up, letting her fingers brush against Agatha’s wrist—just a whisper of a touch, hidden by the way her arm rested along the back of the couch.</p><p>“Where’s Mia?” she asked, keeping her voice low.</p><p>Agatha hummed, glancing toward the door. “Last I saw, she was talking to a girl in the reception area.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a wry smile. “I believe her name is Sophia. Small, dark hair, looked a bit nervous?”</p><p>Rio let out a thoughtful noise, running the name through her head. She didn’t recognize it, but that didn’t mean much.</p><p>“She nervous because she likes Mia?” Rio asked, intrigued.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “If I had to guess, I’d say it’s a strong possibility.”</p><p>Rio smirked, resisting the urge to tease. Mia would kill her if she said anything.</p><p>Agatha shifted, leaning ever so slightly against the couch, against Rio. It wasn’t much—barely even contact—but Rio felt the warmth of her body, the way her presence settled beside her like it belonged there.</p><p>She wanted to reach for her, wanted to tangle their fingers together and tug Agatha down onto the couch with her, just hold her for a little while.</p><p>But Nicky was still here.</p><p>So instead, she just let their arms brush, let the warmth sit between them like a secret, let herself want without pushing.</p><p>She caught Agatha’s gaze, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then Rio grinned. “So, what do you think? Should I tease Mia and ask her about her new crush?”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “I think you value your life too much to do that.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, stretching her arms above her head before letting them drop back down, brushing against Agatha’s side.</p><p>“Fair point,” she admitted. “Still, interesting development.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, glancing toward the door again. “Very.”</p><p>Rio watched her for a beat, then smirked. “Bet she won’t tell me, though.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I know she won’t tell you.”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically. “My own daughter. Keeping secrets from me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the smile on her lips was unmistakable.</p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, they both heard the unmistakable sound of Billy and Tommy’s excited chatter echoing down the hall. Nicky perked up immediately, throwing off his blanket.</p><p>“The twins!” he exclaimed, already scrambling off the couch. His energy levels had clearly bounced back completely. “Can I go, Mom?”</p><p>Agatha barely had time to nod before Nicky was rushing out the door, calling out to his best friends. His voice mixed with the twins’ laughter as they disappeared down the hall, leaving Rio and Agatha alone in the office.</p><p>Rio smirked and stood up. “Guess he’s feeling better.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head. “That child bounces back faster than anyone I’ve ever met.”</p><p>Rio turned toward her, lifting a hand like she might tuck a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. She hesitated for half a second—just long enough for Agatha to lean in slightly, to silently invite the touch—before she let her fingers graze the edge of her jaw, then her chin, tilting her face up just enough for a kiss.</p><p>It was soft, lingering.</p><p>Agatha sighed against her mouth, her own fingers brushing lightly against the edge of Rio’s jacket.</p><p>For a moment, it was easy to forget where they were, to just be.</p><p>But then, Agatha exhaled and pulled back just slightly. “I wish I could see you this weekend,” she murmured, almost apologetically.</p><p>Rio frowned. “You can’t?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “My students start rehearsals for our annual performance this weekend. It’ll be non-stop from here until the recital on the 15th.”</p><p>Rio groaned dramatically, dropping her forehead against Agatha’s. “Great. You’re gonna be swamped.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I am.”</p><p>Rio pulled back, hands finding Agatha’s hips, thumbs pressing against the fabric of her sweater. “Alright, but I’m stealing you away at some point. Just warning you now.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, shaking her head in amusement. “I’d expect nothing less.”</p><p>Rio leaned in for one last kiss, pressing their lips together for just a moment longer before finally stepping back.</p><p>“Text me later?” Rio asked as she took a step toward the door.</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha’s eyes softened. “Take care, Rio.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You too, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was smiling as Rio disappeared down the hall.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Sonata Grove was buzzing with energy that Saturday afternoon. Students hurried around the rehearsal space, tuning instruments, checking sheet music, chatting excitedly. Parents lingered by the entrance, some taking quick peeks into the auditorium before heading off. The annual performance was a big deal, and it showed.</p><p>Rio walked in beside Mia, hands stuffed in the pockets of her leather jacket as she surveyed the organized chaos.</p><p>“Are you sure you need me here?” she asked, arching an eyebrow at her daughter.</p><p>Mia sighed, clearly exasperated. “I told you, I <em> don’t </em> need you here. I just said you could come, if you wanted.”</p><p>That was teenager code for I don’t mind you being here but I’ll die before I actually say that out loud.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Right. So basically, I’m your emotional support rockstar.”</p><p>Mia shot her a flat look but didn’t argue.</p><p>Rio grinned, satisfied, and turned toward the stage, where Agatha stood at the piano, speaking to a group of students. She was all business—hair pinned up in a neat bun, dark rimmed glasses perched on her nose, dressed in black slacks and a fitted blouse that made Rio want to drag her into the nearest empty room and undo every button.</p><p>As if sensing the thought, Agatha’s gaze flickered toward Rio across the room. It lasted only a second—just long enough for a small, knowing smile to tug at the corners of her mouth before she turned her attention back to the students.</p><p>That was all Rio needed.</p><p>She waited until Mia was distracted—some girl from the orchestra had come up to talk to her—before she slipped away, moving through the hallways until she found an empty dressing room near the back of the building.</p><p>A few minutes later, the door creaked open, and Agatha stepped inside, closing it behind her.</p><p>“You’re terrible,” she said in a hushed voice, but there was amusement in her eyes as she crossed the room.</p><p>Rio leaned against the vanity table, arms crossed. “Am I?”</p><p>“Yes. You lured me away from my students.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I didn’t even say anything. And yet… here you are.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, exasperated, but she didn’t step away when Rio reached for her waist, fingers slipping under the hem of her blouse to press against warm skin.</p><p>“It’s been days,” Rio murmured, leaning in. “I missed you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She closed her eyes for a second, as if trying to summon some restraint, but when Rio brushed a kiss against her jaw, she exhaled and tilted her head just enough to meet her lips.</p><p>The kiss was slow, deliberate, lingering.</p><p>Agatha’s hands found their way into Rio’s jacket, resting against her ribs.</p><p>Rio hummed against her mouth, nipping at her bottom lip before kissing her again, deeper this time.</p><p>But just as she started to press Agatha against the vanity, there was a loud bang outside, followed by the unmistakable chatter of students passing by.</p><p>Agatha pulled away with a sharp inhale, eyes flickering toward the door.</p><p>Rio groaned, dropping her forehead against Agatha’s shoulder. “I hate this.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, her fingers brushing against Rio’s sides. “You hate not getting your way.”</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically. “Same thing.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, then pressed a quick, final kiss to Rio’s lips. “I do need to get back.”</p><p>Rio stepped back with an exaggerated pout. “Fine. Go be a responsible teacher.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “What are you going to do?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’ll behave.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Somehow, I doubt that.”</p><p>Rio grinned, watching as Agatha straightened her blouse and smoothed her hair before slipping out of the room.</p><p>She had no idea how she was supposed to just sit through rehearsal now.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio lingered near the back of the auditorium, leaning against the cool stone wall as the rehearsal continued. Mia was on stage, her posture stiff but determined, her fingers expertly dancing over the piano keys. Rio watched her daughter play, a quiet sense of pride swelling in her chest. Mia’s form was perfect—like a statue, rigid and focused, even if her face didn’t quite show it. Every note she played was careful, precise, but there was something in the way her brow furrowed slightly, as if she was pushing herself to be perfect that made Rio’s heart ache a little.</p><p>Rio’s gaze shifted from Mia to Agatha, who stood off to the side of the stage, a quiet observer but very much a part of the scene. Agatha’s attention was entirely on Mia, her eyes gleaming with pride. Rio noticed how she leaned forward slightly, her posture poised as she subtly corrected Mia’s technique when she stumbled, offering a word of encouragement after each note that didn’t quite land.</p><p>It was in that moment that Rio realized just how much Agatha had invested in Mia’s progress. Agatha’s love for teaching, for helping Mia and all of her students, was palpable.</p><p>When Mia finished her piece, she hesitated for a second before looking over at Agatha, clearly waiting for feedback. Agatha smiled softly and gave a subtle nod, her praise quiet but genuine.</p><p>“Mia, that was beautiful. Just remember to breathe—let the music flow through you, don’t force it.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile at the tenderness in Agatha’s voice. She’d heard Agatha give critiques before, but there was always this sense of care in the way she spoke to Mia. Rio found herself mesmerized, her heart swelling with an unexpected rush of affection.</p><p>And then, just as if she could read Rio’s thoughts, Agatha caught her eye from across the room. For a fleeting moment, their gazes locked, and everything else seemed to fade away. Agatha’s lips parted slightly in a soft smile, and Rio felt her pulse quicken. Agatha’s presence had this effect on her—calming yet electrifying.</p><p>The room was still buzzing with students as they began packing up, but Rio found herself rooted in place, watching Agatha’s every move. As Agatha moved to help Mia with her sheet music, Rio’s admiration for her grew. She could see the pride Agatha had in her students, especially Mia, and it made Rio’s chest tighten with something that could only be described as longing.</p><p>For a moment, everything else melted away, and Rio knew that this—this—was the kind of woman she wanted in her life.</p><p>When Agatha glanced back, meeting her eyes again, Rio couldn’t help but feel the pull. And as the rehearsal ended, she found herself walking toward Agatha without thinking, eager for that quiet, private connection.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the lights dimmed in the auditorium and the rehearsal came to an end, Agatha stepped onto the stage, ready for the final performance of the night. Rio, who had been quietly watching from the side, was taken aback when she saw Agatha take her seat at the piano.</p><p>She had heard Agatha play before, of course—she was a world-renowned pianist, after all—but there was something about the way she commanded the space now that made Rio’s heart skip a beat. Agatha’s fingers hovered over the keys, her posture graceful and confident. She exuded an elegance that was so effortless, it was like she was one with the instrument.</p><p>The room fell silent as Agatha began to play.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught in her throat as the first few notes flowed from Agatha’s hands, smooth and rich, filling the room with a deep, resonant sound. It wasn’t just the technical skill that had Rio in awe—it was the emotion that Agatha poured into every note, every chord. She could feel the depth of the music, the subtle rise and fall, as if Agatha was telling a story with her fingertips.</p><p>The beauty of it was overwhelming. Rio could see the passion, the love for music that radiated from Agatha as she played, and it stirred something deep within her. It was as though Agatha was exposing a part of herself that she rarely allowed the world to see.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were closed, completely immersed in the performance, but Rio was completely captivated. She couldn’t look away. Every movement of Agatha’s hands, every shift in her posture, every tiny nuance of her expression was mesmerizing. The piano seemed to become an extension of Agatha herself, and the music—that music—was a reflection of her soul.</p><p>By the time the final note resonated through the hall, Rio was left breathless, her heart hammering in her chest. She wasn’t sure when she’d started holding her breath, but she let it out now, her exhale shaky. She had always known Agatha was a brilliant pianist, but seeing her perform live—feeling the music like this—had taken it to an entirely new level.</p><p>When Agatha finished, the room erupted in applause. Rio was still standing in stunned silence, her heart full. Agatha opened her eyes slowly, a small, quiet smile tugging at her lips as she took a moment to gather herself. Rio didn’t even realize she had been staring at her, utterly captivated, until Agatha met her eyes.</p><p>And in that moment, Rio knew without a doubt that there was no one else quite like her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was everything.</p><p>~*~</p><p>As the crowd of students and parents slowly began to disperse, Agatha let out a quiet breath, smoothing a hand down her blouse as she gathered the last of her sheet music. The adrenaline of the performance still hummed in her veins, but she had to admit—she was exhausted.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, looked like she was still buzzing.</p><p>“That was unreal,” Rio said, voice full of awe as she leaned against the piano, watching Agatha. “I mean, I already knew you were talented, but that was something else entirely. I think I forgot to breathe at one point.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head as she stacked her sheet music into a neat pile. “Well, I’m glad I didn’t cause any medical emergencies.”</p><p>“No promises,” Rio shot back with a grin. “But really, that was… incredible. Watching you play like that, it’s like the world kind of fades away.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, caught in the sincerity of the compliment. Her hands stilled over the music, her fingers lightly grazing the pages. It wasn’t often that someone spoke about her playing like that. With such reverence. With such admiration.</p><p>When she finally glanced up, Rio was still watching her, eyes warm, smile easy.</p><p>“I—” Agatha started, but before she could form a proper response, a small voice interrupted.</p><p>“That was so cool.”</p><p>They both turned to find Nicky trudging toward them, rubbing at his sleepy eyes. “I think that was even better than the last time you played for me, Mom.”</p><p>A fond smile softened Agatha’s face. “Thank you, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio looked between them, and a spark of an idea lit in her expression. “You know what?” she said suddenly. “I think we should celebrate. How about dinner?”</p><p>Nicky perked up immediately. “Dinner?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, slipping her hands into her jacket pockets. “You, me, Mia, and your mom.” She turned to Agatha with a teasing grin. “Unless, of course, Agatha is too famous to be seen with us common folk now.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though amusement flickered across her features. “Oh, please.”</p><p>“So that’s a yes?” Rio pressed.</p><p>Nicky was already bouncing on his heels, looking up at Agatha with wide, pleading eyes. “Can we? Please?”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet sigh, knowing full well that she was outnumbered. “Fine,” she relented, shaking her head.</p><p>“Yes!” Nicky pumped his fist in the air, suddenly full of energy.</p><p>Rio shot Agatha a triumphant grin. “Great. I know just the place.”</p><p>Agatha only sighed again, though the small smile tugging at her lips betrayed her.</p><p>“Go find Mia, sweetheart,” she told Nicky. “Tell her we’re heading out soon.”</p><p>“Okay!” Nicky turned and darted off without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha watched him go before exhaling, rolling her shoulders back as if finally allowing herself to come down from the night’s high. “I need to grab my things from the dressing room,” she murmured.</p><p>“I’ll walk with you,” Rio said immediately.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Are you planning to carry my bag for me?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Of course, I’m a courteous lady.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small laugh, shaking her head as she led the way to the dressing room.</p><p>Once inside, she moved toward her chair, gathering the bag she had stashed in the corner earlier. Rio lingered by the doorway, watching her, hands still casually tucked into her pockets.</p><p>“You really were incredible tonight,” Rio said, softer this time. “I mean it.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, pausing for a moment before offering the barest hint of a smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio took a small step closer, just enough for her voice to lower. “I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of watching you play.”</p><p>Something fluttered in Agatha’s chest, unfamiliar and warm. It was one thing to be admired for her skill, her precision—but this? This was something else.</p><p>She shouldered her bag, glancing toward the door. “We should get going,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio nodded, but before Agatha could move past her, she reached out, fingers brushing lightly against Agatha’s wrist. “Wait.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio leaned in just slightly, her voice dropping to something softer. “Admit it,” she murmured. “You wanted to have dinner with me anyway.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a small chuckle, shaking her head. “Let’s just say you’re very persistent.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened. “That’s a yes.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, but the way her lips twitched upward was all the confirmation Rio needed.</p><p>Rio let her fingers trail lightly over Agatha’s wrist, up the inside of her forearm, watching the way Agatha shivered under her touch. The dressing room door was shut, the distant hum of voices beyond it reminding her that their time alone was limited.</p><p>Agatha was still looking at her, a mixture of exasperation and something softer, something that made Rio feel like she was the only person in the world for just a moment.</p><p>“Come here,” Rio murmured, stepping closer.</p><p>Agatha exhaled but didn’t step back. Instead, she tilted her chin up just slightly, her mouth parting in anticipation. It was all Rio needed. She cupped Agatha’s cheek, her thumb grazing just under her ear, and kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed, wasn’t frantic—it was slow and deep, a lingering press of lips that had Rio sighing against her mouth. Agatha’s hands found her waist, fingers curling into the fabric of her shirt, holding her close like she didn’t want to let go.</p><p>Rio groaned softly, tilting her head to kiss her deeper, her other hand sliding up into Agatha’s hair. God, she loved the way she kissed, like she was giving Rio a piece of herself with every brush of their lips.</p><p>A sharp knock on the door had them breaking apart just enough to breathe. Rio could still taste her, could still feel the warmth of her body against hers.</p><p>“Mom?” Nicky’s voice came from the other side of the door. “Mia says we should go before the pizza place gets too busy.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh, still close enough that Rio could feel it against her lips. “Your kid has a point.”</p><p>Rio grinned, pressing one last kiss to the corner of her mouth before stepping back. “Guess we’d better not keep them waiting.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, amusement flickering in her expression as she grabbed her bag. Rio took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus on anything other than the fact that she was about to sit through dinner with their kids, pretending she hadn’t just kissed Agatha like she was starving for it.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Rio pulled into the parking lot of Eclipse Pizza, one of her favorite spots in the city. It wasn’t some fancy, overpriced LA joint trying too hard to be trendy—it was cozy, family-owned, and made the best damn brick-oven pizza in town. More importantly, Rio knew the owner, Dom, well enough that she could count on a little privacy.</p><p>She glanced in the rearview mirror at the kids. Mia had her usual unreadable expression, scrolling through her phone, while Nicky sat forward in his seat, eyes flicking between the restaurant entrance and Agatha, like he wasn’t sure if they were actually allowed to be here. Agatha, next to Rio, looked composed as ever, but Rio could feel the tension in her posture.</p><p>“Relax,” Rio murmured, nudging her knee against Agatha’s under the console. “Dom’s got us covered.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look but didn’t pull away. “Covered how?”</p><p>“Covered as in, we’re not gonna be out in the middle of everything. Just trust me.”</p><p>She got out before Agatha could argue and led them inside, where the warm scent of tomato sauce, melting cheese, and fresh basil filled the air. The place was packed—families, groups of friends, a couple of teenagers on what was clearly a first date—but, as promised, Dom was already waiting for them near the entrance, a knowing grin on his face.</p><p>“Rio!” He clapped a big hand on her shoulder, then tipped his chin at the others. “Got you set up in the back, like we talked about.”</p><p>“Thanks, man.”</p><p>Dom led them through the main dining area and into a smaller, more secluded section with just a few tables. It wasn’t totally private—there were other diners, but the noise was lower, the lighting softer. It was the kind of place where no one would be looking too closely at them.</p><p>“This good?” Rio asked, looking at Agatha.</p><p>She exhaled, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. “Yes. Thank you.”</p><p>Mia slid into one side of the booth without a word, and Nicky, with all the enthusiasm of a ten-year-old who had been stuck inside for days, scrambled in next to her. Agatha took the seat next to Nicky, leaving Rio to sit across from her and next to Mia.</p><p>“Alright,” Rio said, rubbing her hands together. “Let’s get some food.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>Eclipse Pizza was perfect.</p><p>The food was incredible—the kind of pizza that made you close your eyes for a second because the combination of flavors was just that good. The crust had the perfect crisp on the outside but was still soft inside, the sauce was tangy and rich, and the cheese stretched just right with every bite. Even Agatha, who carried herself with a perpetual air of restraint, made a quiet, pleased sound when she bit into a slice of margherita.</p><p>But the best part? They were actually enjoying themselves.</p><p>Mia and Nicky had somehow fallen into an easy rhythm, bantering back and forth about music. It had started with Nicky declaring that rock music was “cooler” than classical music, which had made Mia scoff and declare, “That’s because you don’t get it.”</p><p>“Get what?” Nicky asked, mouth half-full of pizza.</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. “Dynamics. Structure. The way composers build tension and resolve it. Rock is great, but classical music is like—” She hesitated, as if struggling to put her thoughts into words. “It’s everything. It’s storytelling without words.”</p><p>“That’s what rock is too,” Nicky shot back. “Just with words.”</p><p>Rio, watching the exchange with amusement, leaned back in her seat. “Look at that,” she mused. “A ten-year-old holding his own against my music-snob kid.”</p><p>Mia groaned. “Mom.”</p><p>Agatha, however, looked amused. “They’re both right,” she said, tilting her head. “Music is storytelling. The tools are just different.”</p><p>Nicky looked delighted that Agatha had sided with him, and even Mia didn’t seem entirely displeased.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, was watching her daughter closely. It wasn’t just that Mia was talking—though that alone was nice, considering how often she kept to herself—but that she seemed relaxed. Comfortable. She wasn’t rolling her eyes at everything. She wasn’t checking out of the conversation. And even when she did glance down at her phone, it wasn’t in a dismissive, ignoring-everyone way.</p><p>That caught Rio’s attention.</p><p>Mia’s phone was on the table, her fingers tapping out a reply to someone named Sofia.</p><p>Sofia.</p><p>Rio filed the name away. She had a pretty strong feeling she knew what that meant, but she wasn’t about to pry. Not right now, anyway. Mia would tell her when she was ready.</p><p>Instead, she let her attention drift to Agatha, who was in the middle of answering a question Nicky had asked about how she’d gotten into classical music.</p><p>Mia was hanging onto every word.</p><p>Rio had seen her kid admire musicians before—she’d grown up surrounded by them, after all—but this was different. The way she watched Agatha was almost reverent, like she was seeing something she’d never known she needed. Like Agatha had hung the moon and the stars just by existing.</p><p>“When I was a kid,” Agatha was saying, “I wanted to play piano before I even knew what it really was. My parents didn’t have much, but we had an old upright in the house. It was out of tune, some of the keys stuck, and I didn’t even know how to read music yet, but I’d sit there for hours, trying to make something beautiful.”</p><p>Rio could see Mia absorbing every word, her hands curled around her water glass.</p><p>“What happened?” Mia asked.</p><p>Agatha smiled, just a little. “My mother found a teacher who was willing to take me on for free. She said she’d never seen someone so determined.”</p><p>Mia’s voice was quieter when she asked, “How old were you?”</p><p>“Six.”</p><p>Mia nodded like she’d expected that.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, just watched as the pieces clicked into place.</p><p>Her daughter adored Agatha. She’d seen it before, in the way Mia spoke about her, in the way she always took her lessons seriously—but this was something else. Mia didn’t just like Agatha as a teacher. She admired her. Respected her.</p><p>And Rio? </p><p>Rio admired her too. Maybe more than she should.</p><p>~*~</p><p>The night was going so perfectly. The restaurant had been cozy, the atmosphere light, and for the first time in what felt like ages, Rio felt like she could breathe without being on high alert. Nicky and Mia were laughing over something, their banter so easy and natural that it made Rio’s heart swell. Agatha was quietly listening, her eyes soft with affection as she watched the kids interact. They all fit together in this little bubble of comfort, and Rio wanted to hold on to this moment forever.</p><p>But as they made their way to the exit, something shifted. A quiet click sounded just behind them, and Rio’s heart dropped.</p><p>She didn’t have to look. She knew what it was.</p><p>The unmistakable sound of a camera’s shutter. A flash followed, and Rio could feel the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh, looking at Agatha with an apologetic glance. “Sorry, I should’ve known,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with frustration. “This is why I don’t take Mia out in public much. People are always watching, waiting for a picture.”</p><p>Agatha, who had been talking to Nicky, turned to face Rio. There was a flicker of sympathy in her eyes, but Rio could see that she wasn’t angry—just resigned, like she knew what this was. Agatha nodded, stepping a little closer to Rio, as if trying to shield her from the inevitable spotlight that always followed Rio around.</p><p>“It's okay,” Agatha said quietly, reaching out to rest a hand on Rio’s arm, her fingers warm against her skin. “I’m just glad you brought me along tonight.”</p><p>They made their way to the car, the buzzing of cameras still in the background, but Rio had to admit, it wasn’t as bad as she’d feared. The press was always going to be there. It was just part of the price of being Rio Vidal, rockstar.</p><p>As they got into the car, Rio glanced over at Agatha, who was leaning back in her seat, looking out the window, a content smile on her lips. For a moment, Rio allowed herself to feel the warmth of the evening, the closeness, the laughter, and the intimacy of being surrounded by the people she cared about most.</p><p>“Thanks for tonight,” Rio said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha looked over, her smile brightening. “Thank <em> you </em>. I needed this.”</p><p>Rio nodded, silently agreeing. They all needed this. And maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t so bad to be seen every once in a while—especially when you had someone like Agatha by your side.</p><p>~*~</p><p>Once they were all safely in Rio’s car, the tension of the evening began to fade. The soft hum of the engine, the low rumble of the tires on the asphalt, and the flickering street lights outside helped ease the nerves that had built up during the paparazzi moment. Nicky, still a bit nervous and excited, sat in the backseat directly behind Rio. Mia, however, seemed much more relaxed now, scrolling through her phone behind Agatha.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, Mia finally looked up from her phone, a hint of excitement in her voice. “Hey, Mom… can I go hang out with Will and some of our friends?”</p><p>Rio glanced at her through the rearview mirror, her eyebrows furrowing. “Where?” she asked, her tone cautious as she assessed how late it already was.</p><p>Mia didn’t miss a beat, her voice light and casual. “It’s just at Will’s place. I’ll probably stay the night, so you don’t have to worry about picking me up or anything.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, trying to gauge whether she was okay with this. She met Agatha’s eyes briefly, and Agatha offered a soft, encouraging smile. It was a smile that helped Rio make up her mind. After a long pause, she nodded. “Alright, as long as I know where you are and you’re safe.”</p><p>Mia’s face lit up with a smile, and she quickly nodded. “Thanks, Mom!” She immediately went back to her phone, but Rio could hear the excitement in her voice.</p><p>Rio turned the car toward Will’s place, the quiet hum of the engine filling the space between them. As they drove, Rio took a moment to glance at Agatha, who was looking at her with a gentle, understanding expression. Rio sighed softly, trying to shake off the feeling of worry that always came with letting Mia out of her sight for a while. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust her daughter; it was just hard to let go sometimes, especially with everything that had been happening lately.</p><p>After a few quiet moments, the car pulled up to Will’s house. Mia was already gathering her things in the back seat, eager to get out and join her friends. “Thanks for the ride, Mom,” Mia said, giving Rio a quick hug before getting out of the car. “I’ll see you tomorrow!”</p><p>Rio waved her off, watching Mia walk toward the door before turning to Agatha. “She’s growing up too fast,” Rio muttered, her heart a little heavier than it should have been. “But I’m glad she has Will. At least I know she’s not completely alone.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand brushed gently against hers, offering her a quiet sense of reassurance. “She’ll be fine, Rio. You’ve raised a good kid.”</p><p>Rio smiled at Agatha, feeling a little lighter at the simple reassurance. “Thanks,” she murmured. “Now, let’s get you guys home.”</p><p>~*~</p><p>As Rio pulled into Agatha’s driveway, she exhaled slowly, letting the quiet of the night settle around them. It had been a good evening—better than good. It had been easy. Laughing over pizza, watching Mia open up to Nicky, seeing the way Agatha softened in her element, talking about music with the same quiet reverence she brought to everything she loved.</p><p>For once, Rio had let herself just exist in the moment, not thinking about the cameras or the headlines or the way people whispered behind her back. It had just been dinner. Music. Good company.</p><p>And now, sitting in the stillness of Agatha’s car, she didn’t want it to be over just yet.</p><p>She turned to find Agatha watching her, something unreadable in her expression. There was a pause, then—</p><p>“Would you like to come in for a bit?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p>Rio blinked. It wasn’t the first time she had been invited in, but something about it felt different tonight. Maybe it was the way Agatha was looking at her—reserved, but hopeful. Maybe it was just the lingering warmth of the evening making her reckless.</p><p>Either way, there was only one answer.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice low, warm. “I’d love to.”</p><p>From the backseat, Nicky stirred. “Do we have snacks?”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “You just ate an entire pizza.”</p><p>“That was hours ago,” Nicky argued, rubbing his eyes as he sat up slightly. His curls were a mess, his voice thick with sleep, and Rio couldn’t help but smirk.</p><p>“He’s got a point,” she teased.</p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head fondly. “Fine. But if you’re not in bed soon, you’re going to regret it in the morning.”</p><p>Nicky made a noncommittal noise, already half-asleep again as Agatha unlocked the door.</p><p>Inside, the house was warm and still. There was something about it that Rio loved—the way it felt lived-in, safe. Her own place was bigger, louder in ways that didn’t always make sense, but Agatha’s home was different. The air carried hints of tea and books, of polished wood and something floral that might have been Agatha’s perfume. It was cozy without trying to be.</p><p>Nicky trudged in behind them, yawning as he toed off his shoes. The kid was clearly running on empty, even if he wouldn’t admit it. Without a word, he beelined for the couch, grabbing a throw blanket and curling up with the ease of someone who’d done this a thousand times before.</p><p>“I’m just gonna rest my eyes,” he mumbled, already burrowing into the cushions.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was nothing but fondness in her expression as she tugged the blanket up over him. “Sure, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio watched, something warm settling in her chest. She knew that kind of quiet, easy love—it was the same way she was with Mia.</p><p>She followed Agatha into the kitchen, leaning against the counter as Agatha reached for the cabinet above her head. “Wine?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Is that code for ‘you’re staying for a while’?”</p><p>Agatha cast her a wry look.</p><p>Rio grinned when she didn’t deny it. Instead, she watched Agatha move—the way she was always so precise, so deliberate. Even uncorking a bottle of wine was something graceful in her hands.</p><p>“So,” Rio murmured, lowering her voice as she stepped closer, keeping her tone light, playful. “I know I already told you earlier, but I need to say it again. You were incredible tonight.”</p><p>Agatha paused for just a beat, her fingers tightening slightly on the handle of the bottle. It was subtle, but Rio caught it—the way the compliment landed somewhere deep.</p><p>“You tell every pianist that?” Agatha quipped, but there was a softness there, a vulnerability peeking through the cracks.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No,” she said simply. “Just you.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, her lips twitching like she was trying not to smile, and Rio felt the pull between them like a current—something quiet but undeniable.</p><p>She wanted to kiss her.</p><p>It would have been so easy—just to reach out, to close the distance. But then, from the living room, Nicky shifted on the couch, and the moment flickered, reality slipping back in.</p><p>Rio stepped back, shoving her hands into her pockets. “So, about that wine?”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath that might have been a laugh. “Right. Wine.”</p><p>And just like that, the night stretched on, a quiet hum of something unfinished lingering between them.</p><p>

<p>
<span>Agatha watched as Rio leaned against the counter, effortlessly at home in her kitchen. It made her chest feel tight with affection, with so many feelings that she didn’t quite know what to do with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned back to the task at hand, willing her thoughts into order. She had spent a lifetime perfecting control—of her emotions, of her career, of the way she was perceived. And yet, tonight, the weight of a single camera shutter had unraveled it all in an instant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been foolish to let her guard down, to agree to dinner in a public place. She had known better. Had spent years ensuring that her private life remained just that—private. But Rio had smiled at her in the dressing room, and she had forgotten herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The worst part was that Rio had tried. She had gone out of her way to secure a private table, to make sure they could enjoy their night in peace. And for a while, Agatha had let herself believe they were safe. Until they weren’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she knew that it apparently has only been the one stupid paparazzi, and she really tried to play it cool so Rio wouldn’t feel even more guilty than she already did, but it still rattled her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw as she uncorked the wine bottle with a pop. She had no idea if the photos would actually make the rounds—if some tabloid would pick them up, spinning a story about who Rio Vidal had been seen with this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had tried so hard to stay away from all of this. Just thinking about it nearly gave her hives as she remembered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness, the untouchable, reclusive pianist. Agatha Harkness, whose last public romance had ended in humiliation. Agatha Harkness, who had spent years carefully rebuilding a life where she couldn’t be hurt like that again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t even been able to enjoy the drive home, too on edge, hyperaware of every set of headlights behind them. And now, even here, standing in her own kitchen with Rio just a few feet away, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the walls were closing in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned, finding Rio watching her. Not with amusement, not with pity, but with quiet understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re thinking too much,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, pressing her fingers against her temple. “You think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, but there was warmth in her expression, something easy and open. She stepped closer, hands tucked into the pockets of her leather jacket. “Talk to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. She wanted to. She wanted to let Rio in, to tell her how much she hated being caught off guard, how much she feared what might come next. But Nicky was still in the living room, and the last thing she needed was for him to overhear something he wasn’t ready to understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So instead, she said, “This is complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the thing was—she did. That was the difference. Rio hadn’t pushed her, hadn’t tried to dismiss her worries. She had simply been there, waiting for Agatha to let her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her for a long moment, then sighed and turned back to her glass of wine. “I just… I don’t like being caught off guard.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, her presence a quiet reassurance. “I know,” she murmured. “And I’m sorry. I should’ve been paying more attention when we left the restaurant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, stirring her tea with a slow, methodical motion. “It’s not your fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe not,” Rio admitted, “but I know you. You’re going to drive yourself crazy over this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a quiet, humorless laugh. “And what do you suggest I do instead?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached out, her fingers just barely brushing Agatha’s wrist—light enough that Agatha could pull away if she wanted to. She didn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me take your mind off it,” Rio murmured, a teasing edge to her voice, though there was something softer underneath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, though the warmth spreading through her chest betrayed her. “Oh? And how exactly do you plan to do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in just slightly, tilting her head like she might kiss her but stopping just short. “I can think of a few ways.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A rush of heat curled through Agatha’s spine, the pull of Rio’s nearness intoxicating. It would be so easy to close the distance, to let herself forget about the outside world and all its complications. But—</span>
</p><p>
<span>A quiet rustle from the living room made them both freeze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head just enough to see Nicky, curled up on the couch, shifting in his sleep. His breathing was steady, but he stirred slightly, mumbling something incoherent before settling again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a slow breath, stepping back. “Not here,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a quiet laugh, rubbing the back of her neck. “Right. Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, rolling her shoulders as she turned back toward the living room. Nicky was still curled up on the couch, shifting slightly but not quite awake. She knew she should nudge him toward bed, but she also knew how stubborn he could be about insisting he wasn’t tired—especially if he thought there was still something going on that he might miss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she settled on the arm of the couch, running a gentle hand over his back. “You should go to bed, sweetheart,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky made a sleepy, disgruntled noise. “’M not tired,” he mumbled into the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Of course not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, who had settled into the armchair across from them, grinned. “Kid, you’re five minutes from drooling on your mom’s couch. Just admit defeat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky cracked one eye open, squinting at Rio with something that might have been offense if he wasn’t so clearly exhausted. “I don’t drool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh,” Rio said, clearly unconvinced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly. “Come on, love. Bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sighed dramatically but didn’t argue further, slowly pushing himself up and rubbing at his eyes. Agatha stood with him, pressing a kiss to the top of his head before gently steering him toward the stairs. “Go brush your teeth,” she instructed. “I’ll be there in a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He mumbled something vaguely in agreement and shuffled off, leaving Agatha and Rio alone in the dimly lit living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath, rubbing the bridge of her nose before looking at Rio. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, leaning back in the chair. “A little. He’s a tough one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in agreement, then hesitated. “Stay?” she asked, the word slipping out before she could overthink it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk softened into something quieter, something warmer. “Yeah,” she murmured. “I’ll stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, satisfied, before heading down the hall to check on Nicky. It didn’t take long—he was already half-asleep by the time she tucked him in, murmuring a barely coherent goodnight before turning over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she returned to the living room, Rio had made herself comfortable on the couch, arms stretched along the backrest like she’d always belonged there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “You do realize I didn’t mean stay the night, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Didn’t say you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head as she settled next to her, the space between them narrowing with an ease that was becoming alarmingly natural.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel Rio’s steady warmth beside her, the weight of her arm around her shoulders a welcome comfort. As the tv flickered on, she found her mind drifting to places she hadn’t visited in a long time—places she didn’t want to visit. Rio’s proximity was soft and easy, but it also made something inside Agatha stir that she’d spent years locking away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of Rio’s breath, steady and even, suddenly broke the silence. “You alright?” she asked, her voice low, laced with concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, the words ready to tumble out before she could stop them. “I… I wasn’t always so private.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted slightly, clearly sensing that Agatha was about to share something more than she’d intended. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, staring at the screen without really seeing it. She’d never told anyone but Wanda and Lilia about James—not like this. But with Rio, she felt like she had to. She needed to explain, needed to let Rio understand her past before it became a wall between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to be,” Agatha started, her voice tentative, “with someone… someone who was a lot more public than me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, turning slightly toward her. “A musician?” she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, taking a deep breath. “His name was James. He was… well, he was huge. A classical composer, too, but more well-known for his performance career. People loved him. And they loved us, too, for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hung in the air, fragile and painful, and Agatha felt her heart begin to race, the old ache of betrayal creeping up her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was the one who pushed me into the public eye at first,” she continued, her eyes focused on the wall across from them, not quite able to meet Rio’s gaze. “We were together for years. I was his muse, his partner. I thought we were happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t speak, but Agatha could feel her attention, the way Rio’s hand was resting gently on her shoulder, a quiet but steady presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But then…” Agatha paused, swallowing hard. “He got tired of it. Tired of me.” Her voice cracked, but she kept going. “He left me when I told him I was pregnant with Nicky. Left me for some supermodel nearly half his age. And he never even bothered to ask about Nicky. Never even called. Just moved on like we never existed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened as she said the words aloud for the first time in years, the hurt still fresh despite the time that had passed. She could still remember the scandal—the front-page pictures of him and his new girlfriend, the whispers behind her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was gentle but filled with understanding when she finally spoke. “That’s… that’s awful, Agatha. I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small, bitter laugh. “It was. But it also gave me Nicky, so… I don’t regret it. Not him. But it was a rough time. The stupid tabloids, all the speculation about what had happened. I hated it. I hated every second of it. For a while I didn’t even want to leave the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was quiet for a long moment, but Agatha could feel her presence, the weight of her sympathy, her care. When Rio spoke again, her voice was soft but firm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry you went through that, Agatha. No one deserves to be treated like that, especially not by someone they trusted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat tightened again, but this time, she didn’t hold back the tears. She hadn’t expected to cry. She hadn’t expected to feel this much, but hearing Rio’s kind words, the softness in her tone—it was like something inside Agatha that had been locked away for so long had been cracked open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, pulling her just a little closer, but not too much. She seemed to sense Agatha’s need for space, even in the comfort of being close. “I know it’s not the same, but… I get why you’re cautious now. Why you’re so careful about everything. I don’t blame you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffled quietly, nodding. “I know I can’t change the past, but it’s still hard to trust sometimes. Especially when people’s opinions and the public eye are involved. I’ve spent so much of my life guarding myself from that pain. And I guess, I’ve been doing the same thing with you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything at first, just letting the words settle between them. Then, very softly, she spoke. “You don’t have to guard yourself with me. I would never, ever push you to do anything you’re not comfortable doing, Agatha. I can promise you that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught, her heart skipping a beat at the sincerity in Rio’s voice. It was the kind of statement that felt real, grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha murmured, her voice thick. She was starting to believe it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gently tilted her chin, catching her eyes with a softness Agatha hadn’t expected. “I’m not him. And I never will be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened again, but this time it wasn’t with sadness. It was something warmer, something more vulnerable. The truth in Rio’s words settled into her, filling the space between them. For the first time in a long time, she allowed herself to trust, just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha whispered back, the weight of the words settling in her heart. “I’m just… I’m not used to feeling this way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand brushed against her arm gently, a quiet promise. “Take your time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, for the first time in years, Agatha felt like she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>They settled back on the couch with their glasses of wine in hand, the low hum of the movie playing in the background. It was a familiar scene, almost like a loop of the last time Rio had been there with her, the soft light from the lamp casting shadows across the room, and the quiet closeness of just being together. Agatha could feel the weight of Rio’s presence next to her, comfortable and easy, like they’d picked up where they left off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a slow sip from her glass, watching the screen, but her mind wasn’t on the plot. Instead, it was racing, full of the moments they’d shared so far, the vulnerability Rio had shown, and the way Agatha felt her heart tug every time Rio smiled or spoke softly to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a while, neither of them said much. They were content to let the movie play on, the silence between them no longer feeling uncomfortable, but rather, peaceful. Agatha’s hand rested on the couch, just within reach of Rio’s, and she felt the warmth from Rio’s skin radiating, urging her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, as if on some unspoken cue, brushed her fingers lightly over Agatha’s, a casual touch that lingered a little longer than expected. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, the simple gesture sending a spark of warmth through her. She turned her head to look at Rio, and the moment their eyes met, there was a shift. Something subtle but undeniable—an intensity that hadn’t been there before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, but there was an underlying heat in her gaze, one that made Agatha’s chest tighten in a way she couldn’t ignore. Rio’s hand moved again, this time gently touching Agatha’s wrist, the soft pressure of her fingers sending an electric current through Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart was pounding now, and as much as she tried to concentrate on the movie, her mind was lost in the way Rio was looking at her. Her eyes darkened slightly, the playful affection giving way to something deeper, more palpable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking, Agatha leaned just a little closer, her breath mingling with Rio’s as she exhaled, her pulse quickening. Rio’s hand moved from her wrist to her cheek, the warmth of her palm sending another wave of heat through Agatha’s body. And in that moment, Agatha couldn’t help herself. Her lips parted, and before she could second-guess it, she closed the gap between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What started as a gentle kiss, hesitant and careful, quickly deepened. Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s arm, her fingers curling around the fabric of her sleeve as she pulled her in closer. Rio responded with equal intensity, her lips moving against Agatha’s, urgent now, as if they’d both been holding back for far too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a rush of heat spread through her, her entire body humming with the need to be closer, to feel more of Rio. She didn’t want to stop—she couldn’t stop. The tension that had been building between them seemed to vanish, and in its place was a quiet desperation, a need to bridge the gap between who they were and what they could become.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand slid from Agatha’s cheek down to her neck, her fingers tracing the delicate line of her jaw before she pulled Agatha in even closer. Agatha’s fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her down so their kisses could deepen even further, both of them melting into the moment. Every second felt like an eternity, a rush of emotions and desires that Agatha had kept locked away for so long, and now, all of it was pouring out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They kissed like it was the only thing that mattered, the world outside fading into nothing as they lost themselves in each other. Time seemed to stretch and bend, the movie forgotten, the wine untouched, until it was just the two of them—lost in the heat of their desire, in the urgency of finally being together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, it was with a deep, unsteady breath, both of them slightly dazed, their lips still tingling from the intensity of it. Agatha’s chest was heaving, and Rio’s eyes were wide, but there was something different now—a new understanding between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was low and husky, her words carrying a weight that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t trust herself to speak. Instead, she leaned in once more, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to Rio’s lips, a silent promise between them. She didn’t know what would happen next, but for the first time in a long time, she felt like she could finally stop holding back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the air between them thickened with a shared urgency, Agatha’s breath hitched. Her hands, still tangled in Rio’s hair, guided her closer, almost instinctively. The heat radiating from Rio’s body felt like it was drawing her in deeper, a magnetic pull she couldn’t resist. Agatha could feel her pulse pounding in her ears, her heartbeat erratic, as everything she’d been holding back for so long seemed to flood to the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking, she shifted, her knees coming up to settle on either side of Rio’s lap, straddling her as she leaned in for another kiss. Rio’s hands immediately found her hips, guiding her down gently, and the contact sent a jolt of electricity through Agatha’s entire body. The softness of Rio’s lips against hers was intoxicating, the intensity of their kiss growing with every passing second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers slid up the sides of Agatha’s shirt, skimming the skin there, the touch sending shivers across Agatha’s body. Agatha couldn’t help but move against her, pressing closer, the friction between them growing more intense. She gasped into the kiss as she felt Rio’s hands slide to the small of her back, pulling her in even tighter, the two of them so close that it was almost impossible to tell where one ended and the other began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything felt heightened—more real, more intense. Rio’s lips moved with a desperation that mirrored her own, as if they both knew they were at the edge of something neither could walk away from. Agatha’s hands explored Rio’s chest, her fingers grazing over the buttons of her shirt before she quickly discarded the fabric, eager to feel more of Rio’s skin beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The space between them had already been closed, but Agatha wanted more—she wanted everything, wanted to feel every inch of Rio’s body against hers. She pushed herself up slightly, looking down at Rio, her hands trembling slightly as she brushed Rio’s hair out of her face. The sight of Rio’s flushed cheeks, her eyes dark with desire, was enough to drive Agatha wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached up, her hands finding Agatha’s waist, pulling her back down so their lips met again, deeper this time. The kiss was filled with the hunger they had both been denying for far too long. Agatha felt herself completely surrender to it, her body moving on its own as she settled fully into Rio’s lap, the heat between them becoming unbearable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no hesitation now, no second-guessing. Their bodies were synchronized in a way that felt so natural, as if they had always known this moment would come. Agatha’s fingers traced the muscles of Rio’s arms, feeling the strength beneath her fingertips, and she couldn’t help but smile against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha whispered, breaking the kiss, her voice low and filled with something raw. She needed to say it, needed to say her name as a reminder that they were both here, fully present.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands slid up Agatha’s back, pulling her close again, her voice just as breathless. “Agatha…” she whispered back, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear, sending a shiver down her spine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was as if the whole world had narrowed down to this single moment. Nothing else mattered—nothing except the way their bodies were pressed together, the way their lips moved in sync, the way the air between them had turned electric. There was no turning back now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind, clouded with desire, suddenly snapped back to reality. She pulled away from Rio just enough to catch her breath, her chest heaving as she blinked in surprise. A realization hit her like a cold splash of water. They were still in the living room, in the middle of the night, and Nicky could wake up at any second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze flickered toward the stairs, imagining Nicky stumbling out of his room, his innocent eyes blinking as he saw exactly what was happening between her and Rio. A surge of embarrassment swept through her, a sharp reminder that she wasn’t used to this kind of spontaneity—especially not with her son just a few rooms away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha murmured breathlessly, pulling back just a fraction, enough to meet her eyes. “We should… we should move this upstairs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, still leaning in, her lips slightly parted, looked at Agatha, her eyes hazy with want but also glimmering with understanding. Her gaze followed Agatha’s, noting the subtle tension in her shoulders, the slight hesitation in her movements. She let out a soft chuckle, one that was warm, knowing, and tinged with a touch of mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right,” Rio said, her voice low, a trace of humor in it as she pulled back just enough to rest her forehead against Agatha’s. “Wouldn’t want Nicky to walk in and witness his mom and his idol in a compromising position”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a laugh that was part relief and part nervousness. Rio’s teasing tone made her feel both more at ease and more turned on, as if the whole situation was a bit of a delicious game they were playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not sure how I’d explain this one,” Agatha muttered, her breath still uneven. “Or if I even want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a sly smile, a glimmer of heat in her eyes that only made Agatha’s heart beat faster. She tilted her head, pressing a soft, teasing kiss to Agatha’s lips before slowly starting to stand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well then,” Rio said, her voice still laced with that same intoxicating energy. “Let’s go upstairs already cause you’re driving me crazy here, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood up, a little unsteady on her feet, but Rio was there to steady her, taking her hand and guiding her toward the stairs. The tension between them was palpable, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a mix of nerves and anticipation coursing through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They made their way upstairs, each step feeling heavier with desire, but also with a sense of excitement about what was about to unfold. Agatha didn’t want to overthink it—didn’t want to let the weight of her past fears or her responsibilities cloud this moment. For the first time in what felt like forever, she let herself be swept away, focusing only on Rio, on the intoxicating pull between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached the top of the stairs, Agatha couldn’t help but look over at Rio, her eyes searching for some confirmation that they were both still in this together. Rio caught her gaze, her lips curling into a confident, almost daring smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Rio asked, her voice thick with anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, nodding as she stepped closer to Rio, her body pressing into hers. This was happening, and for once, she wasn’t going to question it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely,” Agatha whispered, her lips barely brushing Rio’s in a soft kiss before she led them to her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hugged her from behind, her lips doing sinful things to her neck as they stumbled into the room. Agatha nearly tripped in her haste to turn around to kiss her, and Rio chuckled at her enthusiasm as she closed the door with her foot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” Agatha whispered, her breath hot against Rio’s ear. Her fingers trembled as they traced the curve of Rio’s hip, her skin warm beneath her touch. Rio bit her lip to stifle the moan that threatened to escape, her own hands gripping Agatha’s waist tightly, pulling her closer until their bodies pressed together in the dim glow of the bedside lamp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, you’re killing me,” Rio breathed, her voice barely audible, her dark eyes locked on Agatha’s. “You’re so fucking beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, her heart pounding in her chest. This was only their second time together, and the nerves were still there, creeping in at the edges of her mind. But so was something else—something hotter, more insistent. A desire to touch, to explore, to make Rio feel the way she’d made her feel the first time. She wanted to give as much as she’d received.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me what you want,” Agatha murmured, her lips brushing against Rio’s jawline, her voice low and husky. “I want to make you feel good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, her fingers tangling in Agatha’s dark curls. “You already are,” she whispered back, her hips shifting restlessly. “But—God, Agatha, your hands, your mouth. I want you everywhere</span>
<b>.</b>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse quickened, her confidence swelling at Rio’s words. She shifted slightly, her hand trailing down Rio’s thigh, the heat of her skin burning through the jeans. She wanted to be the one to unravel Rio, to make her lose control in the quiet, secretive way they had to tonight. With Nicky asleep just down the hall, every sound, every touch, had to be deliberate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand slid higher as she unbuttoned her jeans and pushed them down eagerly. Rio helped, kicking her jeans off, leaving her only in her underwear and bra as she laid down on her bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her for a moment, taking in just how absolutely gorgeous she was. When she couldn’t take the tension anymore, she climbed over Rio, her fingers brushing against the damp fabric between Rio’s thighs. Rio trembled, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice strained. “You’re going to make me—shhh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled for a moment, her own heart racing as she listened for any sound from the hallway. But the house was quiet, save for the soft rustle of sheets and the sound of their breathing. She looked down at Rio, her dark eyes clouded with desire, and felt a surge of something powerful, something possessive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me,” she whispered, her fingers slipping beneath the silk, finding the heat that was waiting for her. “I want to hear you. Just—quietly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips parted in a silent moan, her hips arching into Agatha’s touch. “God, yes,” she breathed, her hands gripping the sheets. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers moved slowly at first, exploring, learning what made Rio’s breath hitch and what made her hips jerk. She could feel the tension building in Rio’s body, the way her muscles clenched and her back arched. It was intoxicating, watching her come undone, knowing that </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> was doing this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so beautiful like this,” Agatha murmured, her lips brushing against Rio’s neck. “So perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s response was a choked whimper, her hand flying to her mouth to stifle the sound as Agatha’s fingers moved faster, pressing harder. Her hips bucked, her legs trembling as she teetered on the edge, her whole body taut with anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she gasped, her voice breaking. “I’m going to—oh God</span>
<b>.</b>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt it the moment Rio fell, the way her body convulsed, the way her breath came in ragged gasps. She held her close, her fingers slowing but not stopping, drawing out every last shudder until Rio collapsed against her, boneless and spent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they just lay there, their breathing slowly evening out, the silence of the house wrapping around them like a blanket. Then Rio lifted her head, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s, and smiled—a slow, tired smile that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re incredible,” Rio whispered, her voice hoarse. “No one’s ever made me come this hard and this fast. God, Agatha. That was unreal</span>
<b>.</b>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a warmth spread through her chest, a sense of pride and satisfaction she hadn’t felt in years. “I’m glad,” she said softly, brushing a strand of hair out of Rio’s face. “I wanted—I wanted to make you feel as good as you make me feel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile softened, her hand reaching up to cup Agatha’s cheek. “You did,” she said, her thumb brushing across Agatha’s lips. “But now it’s your turn.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand was still on Agatha’s cheek, her thumb brushing over her lips in a way that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. Before Agatha could respond, Rio leaned in, capturing her lips in a kiss that was softer, slower than before. It was as if Rio was savoring her, taking her time to explore every corner of Agatha’s mouth. Agatha’s hands found their way to Rio’s waist, her fingers digging gently into the soft skin there, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally pulled away, her breath was warm against Agatha’s face. “Your turn,” she whispered again, her voice low and teasing. Agatha’s heart raced, a mix of anticipation and nervousness bubbling up inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a soft exhale, Agatha nodded, her hands sliding down to Rio’s hips. “Okay,” she murmured, her voice barely audible. “But we have to be quiet. Nicky—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” Rio interrupted, pressing a finger to Agatha’s lips. “Don’t worry. We’ll be quiet, baby.” Her eyes were alight with mischief, and Agatha felt a flicker of warmth in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting up for a moment, Agatha pulled her shirt up and threw it over her head without a care in the world. Rio looked at her hungrily, already reaching around her to unclasp her bra. When her breasts we’re free, Rio nodded for her to lie down so she could pull her skirt off in one swift motion, taking her soaked underwear with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, climbing over her like a feline. The movement was fluid, confident, and it left Agatha breathless. Rio’s hands were already moving, trailing down Agatha’s body with a deliberate slowness that made her skin tingle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s fingers brushed over her collarbone, then lower, skimming the curve of her breast. “Rio,” she whispered, her voice trembling. Rio’s lips followed the same path, her mouth hot against Agatha’s skin. She paused at Agatha’s nipple, her tongue flicking over the sensitive peak in a way that made Agatha bite down on her lip to stifle a moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You taste so good,” Rio murmured against her skin, her voice a low hum that sent vibrations through Agatha’s body. Her hands continued their slow exploration, moving down Agatha’s sides, over her hips, and finally settling on her thighs. Agatha’s breath came in shallow gasps, her fingers tangling in the sheets as Rio’s touch grew bolder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips were on her stomach now, kissing a trail down to where she needed her the most. Agatha’s hips lifted instinctively, a silent plea for more. Rio chuckled softly, her breath warm against Agatha’s skin. “Impatient,” she teased, her fingers hooking under the fabric and sliding it down Agatha’s legs. Agatha felt exposed, vulnerable—but also incredibly alive. Rio’s eyes met hers for a moment, dark and intense, before she lowered her head again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first touch of Rio’s tongue was electric, sending a jolt of pleasure through Agatha’s entire body. Her back arched, her hands flying to Rio’s hair, fingers threading through the dark strands. Rio’s tongue moved slowly at first, exploring every inch of her, teasing her with a gentleness that was almost maddening. Agatha’s breaths came in ragged gasps, her body trembling with the effort of staying quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Please…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio responded immediately, her tongue pressing harder, faster, her movements becoming more urgent. Agatha’s hips lifted off the bed, her body instinctively seeking more. Rio’s hands gripped her thighs, holding her in place as she continued her assault. The pleasure was overwhelming, a tidal wave crashing over Agatha again and again. She could feel the tension building inside her, coiling tighter and tighter until she thought she might shatter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just when she thought she couldn’t take anymore, Rio’s fingers joined her tongue, sliding inside her with a fluid ease that made Agatha’s entire body convulse. The sensation was too much, too intense, and Agatha’s hand flew to her mouth to stifle the cry that threatened to escape. Her body arched, her muscles tightening as the pleasure consumed her. She was lost in it, her world reduced to nothing but Rio’s touch, Rio’s mouth, Rio’s fingers moving inside her with a rhythm that was driving her insane.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the climax hit, it was like a lightning strike, shattering her into a thousand pieces. Agatha’s body trembled, her breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps as the waves of pleasure washed over her. Rio didn’t stop, her relentless pace prolonging the ecstasy until Agatha was certain she couldn’t take anymore. Finally, with a shuddering sob, her body went limp, spent and utterly spent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back, her lips glistening, her cheeks flushed. She met Agatha’s gaze, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. “You okay?” she asked, her voice soft, almost tender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her chest still rising and falling rapidly. “Yeah,” she managed to whisper, her voice hoarse. “That was… incredible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, a slow, satisfied smile that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat. “Good,” she said, leaning down to press a gentle kiss to Agatha’s lips. “But I’m not done with you yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room was quiet, the only sound was the soft hum of the house around them and their steady breathing. Agatha’s fingers ran up and down Rio’s back absentmindedly, the gentle caresses soothing, as Rio rested her head against Agatha’s chest. Her body was warm and relaxed against her, a welcome contrast to the whirlwind of thoughts racing through Agatha’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t remember the last time she had felt this at ease with someone, certainly not like this. Everything about this moment—the quiet, the closeness—felt fragile but perfect. It was a sensation that Agatha wasn’t entirely used to, yet she didn’t want to let go of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she ran her hand up and down Rio’s back, Agatha considered the situation, still trying to reconcile the intensity of what had just happened with the ever-present fear of being too exposed. Rio’s presence, though, felt like a quiet promise that perhaps this time, it could be different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice low and tentative.  “Do you want to stay the night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers stilled on the other woman’s back as she let the question linger. She wasn’t entirely sure why she asked, but the warmth of the moment seemed to lead her toward it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted slightly, looking up at her. Agatha met her gaze, still not sure if she was rushing into something, still unsure of how Rio would react. But she couldn’t hide the slight hopeful quiver in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer right away. Instead, her fingers traced over Agatha’s arm, a slow and deliberate touch that seemed to answer her question in a way that made her heart skip. “What about Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart gave a quiet flutter, her gaze softening. “I can just say it got way too late for you to leave,” she said, a playful hint in her tone. “He won’t mind. Not really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move right away, her expression unreadable for a moment. The silence between them stretched, but it didn’t feel uncomfortable, just… uncertain. Then Rio let out a quiet breath and nodded, the smallest smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled too, feeling a warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. She tightened her hold on Rio just slightly, as if to remind herself that this—they—were real, and for now, she wasn’t ready to let go of the peace they had found together.</span>

<p>
<span>The sunlight filtered through the curtains, soft and golden, casting a gentle glow over the room. Rio slowly blinked her eyes open, adjusting to the light. For a moment, she was disoriented, her mind a little foggy from sleep, but then reality settled in around her like a warm embrace. She was here. In Agatha’s bed. Her breath caught slightly at the thought, and she glanced down to find Agatha still curled up beside her, asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was something undeniably peaceful about the way Agatha looked while she slept. Her features, usually so sharp and deliberate, were softened in the quiet of the morning. Her hair fanned out across the pillow, dark and wild, a stark contrast to the smoothness of her skin. It was a sight Rio couldn’t quite get used to—Agatha’s beauty wasn’t just on the surface. It was in everything about her. The way she carried herself, the way she spoke, the way she made Rio feel seen, understood… cherished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held her breath for a second, watching Agatha’s steady rise and fall as she slept, her body so close but still separate from hers. Rio didn’t want to move—didn’t want to disturb the fragile moment. She allowed herself to just breathe in the silence and take it all in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt strange, this feeling of being so… at home with someone. She wasn’t used to this. Not after all the years of protecting herself, of keeping her emotions carefully locked away. But with Agatha, it was different. She wasn’t afraid of being vulnerable. In fact, she wanted to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She marveled at how slowly, but surely, Agatha was letting her in. The walls Agatha had put up—so carefully constructed and resilient—seemed to be crumbling a little bit more with every shared moment. Every touch. Every quiet word exchanged between them. Last night… it had been more than just sex. It had been raw and real, unlike anything Rio had ever experienced. The chemistry between them had been electric, undeniable. But there was something deeper there, something that felt like it could become something more, something lasting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled softly to herself as she remembered the way Agatha had let herself go, the way she had responded to her touch, her lips. Rio’s chest tightened at the memory, a mix of awe and desire swirling inside her. Agatha had opened up to her in ways Rio hadn’t expected, ways she hadn’t allowed herself to even hope for. It had been intense, passionate, and yes, beautiful. And if she was being honest with herself, it had probably been the best sex she’d ever had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart ached, a sudden realization blooming in her chest. She was falling for Agatha Harkness. Fast. Hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The thought was almost terrifying. She had never been one for slow burns, always keeping things casual, never allowing herself to get too close. But with Agatha, there was no denying the connection they had. It was there, undeniable, pulling her in with a force that was impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed softly, her fingers lightly brushing through the strands of Agatha’s hair, mesmerized by how delicate she looked in that moment. She wondered if Agatha had any idea how much she had already begun to matter to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, she simply watched her, soaking in the quiet. They didn’t need to speak in this moment. Rio had never been so content to just be. To be here. With Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a slow, steady breath, making a silent promise to herself that she wasn’t going to let this slip away. Whatever this was, however complicated or messy it might become, she was willing to explore it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because, in this moment, all that mattered was now—and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was still lost in the moment when she noticed Agatha stir beside her. The faint shift of her body under the sheets, the soft exhale as Agatha’s eyelids fluttered open. In the quiet of the morning, the light spilling through the curtains, Rio could hardly breathe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked a few times, still adjusting to the brightness of the day, her blue eyes still soft with sleep but already stunning. God, Rio thought, how could someone look so gorgeous first thing in the morning? Her hair was a mess of dark waves, and her face—usually so composed and controlled—was soft and peaceful. But it was those eyes that captured Rio’s attention. That deep, intense blue, so alive and vibrant even in the midst of sleep. Rio couldn’t help but smile as she marveled at how breathtaking Agatha looked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning,” Agatha murmured, her voice a bit rough from sleep, but still melodic in its softness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio replied, her voice barely above a whisper. She reached out a hand, brushing a few stray strands of hair away from Agatha’s face. She could feel the warmth of her skin, the softness of her features. It felt almost surreal, being here with her like this. Rio didn’t want it to end. She didn’t want this moment to slip away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled sleepily up at her, and Rio leaned down instinctively, pressing a gentle kiss to her lips. It was soft, lingering, a shared breath between them. When they finally pulled away, Agatha chuckled softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have morning breath,” she teased, her eyes twinkling, but Rio only shook her head, amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine. You’re perfect,” Rio murmured, a smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, leaning in to kiss her, brushing it off as she deepened the kiss, showing Agatha that morning breath didn’t even come close to being a deterrent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then Agatha pulled back slightly, her gaze shifting as she checked the time on her phone. Her eyes widened slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no,” she muttered, sitting up quickly, “It’s already past nine. Nicky’s probably up by now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the pillow with a quiet chuckle, rolling her eyes. “I know the drill. Trust me.” She sat up fully and stretched, looking at Agatha fondly. “I’ll give you a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded gratefully, standing up to go check on Nicky. But before she did, she turned back to Rio with a playful glint in her eye. “I think I could get used to waking up next to you,” she said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled widely, her heart skipping a beat at how comfortable Agatha was getting with her, even in the early morning. “Me too,” she said quietly, as Agatha disappeared to check on her son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha popped her head back into the room a moment later, her voice carrying a hint of amusement. “Nicky’s not in his room,” she said, glancing back toward the hallway. “He’s probably downstairs already. I’m going to check on him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, still wrapped in the warmth of their shared morning. Agatha’s presence, so effortlessly domestic and kind, made her feel even more drawn to her. She hadn’t expected this morning to feel so… right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before Agatha turned to leave, she paused, looking at Rio with a small smile. “You’re welcome to take a shower,” Agatha added casually, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “Towels are in the cabinet under the sink, and there’s a fresh toothbrush in the first drawer. Help yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at the offer, appreciative of the quiet hospitality. “Thanks,” she replied, her voice soft but filled with a warmth that mirrored Agatha’s. She’d never expected a morning like this, but she was more than happy to embrace it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha turned to leave, Rio felt a spark of anticipation. The morning was still young, and there was something about being here with Agatha that made her feel like she was exactly where she needed to be. She couldn’t wait to see where this—whatever it was—was headed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a quick, refreshing shower, Rio stepped out, feeling the cool air against her skin. Her phone buzzed on the countertop as she dried off, and she quickly reached for it. A text from Mia popped up, making Rio exhale a sigh of relief. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Kiddo</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Still at Will’s. Might stay for lunch!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The weight that had been pressing on her chest eased. No awkward explanations to Mia about where she’d spent the night, no need for a hurried walk of shame. Just… peace. For now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she was dressed, slipping back into the same outfit she’d worn the day before, Rio headed downstairs. Her mind still lingered on the feeling of Agatha’s arms around her, the way they had tangled together last night, but there was no time to dwell on it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she reached the bottom of the stairs, she was greeted by an excited Nicky, his eyes lighting up when he saw her. “Morning, Rio!” he called, grinning like he hadn’t just gotten over a fever the night before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Nicky,” Rio replied, giving him a warm smile as she walked further into the kitchen. She could already smell the comforting scent of breakfast—eggs, bacon, and something else she couldn’t quite place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was already at the stove, expertly flipping pancakes, the light from the window catching the strands of her messy hair as she hummed softly to herself. It was such an ordinary scene, one that could’ve been any family on any given Sunday morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help herself. She took a quiet step closer to Agatha, making sure Nicky was focused on something else for a moment, before she pressed a soft kiss to the curve of Agatha’s shoulder. The heat of the skin under her lips, the way Agatha’s body tensed slightly in surprise, was enough to make Rio’s heart skip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio whispered, the words barely audible but full of promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced over her shoulder at her with a smile that made Rio’s stomach flutter. “Morning,” she replied, her voice low and warm, a little breathless. She didn’t pull away from the kiss, but instead, her hand brushed against Rio’s as if to say she was okay with this—okay with them, even if it was all still so new.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Breakfast is almost ready. Want some coffee?” Agatha asked, as she turned back to the stove to finish cooking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Rio replied, taking a step back to give Agatha space, though her fingers lingered on her shoulder for just a moment longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, blissfully unaware of the quiet exchange, was bouncing around, ready to dive into the food. “I’ll help!” he offered, practically running over to the table to grab a seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at him, feeling a wave of affection for the little boy. Despite everything—despite the strange, complex dynamic of the situation—this moment, this morning, felt right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon enough, the three of them sat down to enjoy the meal Agatha had prepared. Nicky, as always, was the first to finish his plate, his eyes already sparkling with excitement as he pushed his chair back from the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Rio,” he said, suddenly turning toward her. “You up for a jam session today? Since we didn’t get to do anything these past couple of weeks ’cause I was sick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Nicky, surprised by the request but smiling nonetheless. “A jam session, huh? I’d love to, buddy,” she replied. She glanced over at Agatha, who was quietly sipping her coffee and giving Rio a look that said she knew exactly what was about to happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s grin widened. “Yes! I’ve been practicing a lot. I can definitely keep up with you now.” His confidence was infectious, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright,” Rio said, her voice playful. “You think you’re ready to rock?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded enthusiastically. “I’ve been working on some new stuff, and you’re gonna love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened, watching the exchange between Rio and her son. She set her cup down and smiled, her voice warm. “You guys are going to make a great team. I’ll just stay out of the way, then. You know, just be the audience,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a grin. “You’re always welcome to join in, Agatha. But if you want to just enjoy the show, I won’t complain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll just enjoy watching the two of you, then,” Agatha replied, her smile never faltering as she pushed back from the table, giving them some space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, Nicky. Lead the way,” Rio said, getting to her feet. Her fingers itched for her guitar, the familiar comfort of the instrument calling her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grabbed his own guitar from the corner of the living room and made his way to the small music area that Agatha had set up in one of the corners. He gave Rio a quick thumbs-up, then started strumming a few chords, warming up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio picked up the other guitar and settled in beside him, she felt a deep sense of peace wash over her. It was moments like this—simple, easy moments—that she was growing to cherish more and more. She glanced at Agatha one last time as she sat back, watching Nicky and Rio prepare for their jam. Agatha’s smile told her everything she needed to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what’s the first song?” Rio asked, tuning her guitar as she looked over at Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something new I’ve been working on,” Nicky said, already plucking out a catchy riff. “It’s not perfect yet, but I think you’ll get the vibe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “I’m sure it’s going to sound awesome. Let’s do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the room filled with music—their music—a rhythm that felt completely natural. Nicky’s enthusiasm mixed with Rio’s experience, and for a while, they lost themselves in the sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat quietly, letting the music surround her. She couldn’t help but smile, seeing Nicky so happy and so full of life, and watching Rio so comfortably slip into the role of guide and mentor. It was a beautiful, peaceful sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they played, Rio found herself more and more impressed with Nicky’s growing skill on the guitar. But what really caught her off guard—again—was his voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first time she heard him sing, she thought maybe she’d imagined it, or that it was just a lucky moment. But no—Nicky had something special. His voice wasn’t just good for a kid; it had this raw, unpolished quality that carried emotion in a way that most people spent years trying to master.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finished the song, Rio let out a low whistle, shaking her head in amazement. “Damn, Nicky. You keep pulling this on me, and I’m gonna start thinking you’re trying to show me up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned, cheeks going a little pink at the praise. “You think so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know so,” Rio said, nudging his shoulder. “You’ve got something real, kid. And I mean it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, who had been watching from the couch, smiled softly but didn’t say anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They played a little longer before Nicky finally stretched his arms over his head and announced, “I need a break. And maybe a snack.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment he was out of sight, Rio turned to Agatha, still shaking her head in disbelief. “Okay, we need to talk about that kid’s voice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “What about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about it?” Rio repeated. “Agatha, his voice is—” She exhaled, running a hand through her hair. “I’ve heard a lot of singers, okay? A lot. But Nicky has something real. Natural.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, reaching out to brush a strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Really, I think your kid might be the next big thing. Not that I’m surprised. He’s yours, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was warmth in it. “He’s ten,” she reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So? Mozart started composing when he was five,” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a laugh. “I am not raising a child star.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No one said anything about that.” Rio smirked, leaning in just a little. “But you’ve got to admit, he’s good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t argue. She just sighed, her eyes softening. “Yeah,” she murmured. “He really is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced toward the hallway, making sure Nicky was still gone. Then, without another word, she leaned in and pressed a quick, soft kiss to Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was short but sweet, and by the time she pulled back, Agatha was looking at her like she wasn’t sure whether to scold her or kiss her again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could do either, they heard Nicky’s footsteps coming back down the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, stepping back just in time. “Guess we’ll table this conversation for later,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a pointed look, but there was no real annoyance behind it. “Mm-hmm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, Nicky was back, munching on an apple and none the wiser.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>After lunch, Rio stretched, feeling comfortably full and more than a little reluctant to leave. But she had things to take care of, and as much as she wanted to stay wrapped up in this little bubble with Agatha and Nicky, she knew she couldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should probably head out,” she said, glancing toward Agatha, who stood by the sink rinsing off the dishes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, still buzzing with excitement from their jam session, looked up from where he sat at the counter. “Already?” he asked, disappointment clear in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at him. “I’ll be back, rockstar. We’ve still got some work to do on your stage presence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky grinned at that. “You mean my totally awesome stage presence?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, ruffling his hair. “Yeah, that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dried her hands on a kitchen towel, watching them with quiet amusement before stepping closer. “I’ll walk you out,” she said, her voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, grabbing her leather jacket from the back of the chair and slipping it on before following Agatha to the door. Nicky trailed behind them, leaning against the doorframe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you later, Rio!” he said, waving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave him a two-finger salute. “Later, kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Nicky turned back inside, Rio and Agatha were left in the doorway, just the two of them. For a moment, neither spoke, both aware of the unspoken weight between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, shifting her stance slightly. “Thanks for staying. And for… everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “You say that like I won’t be back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched. “You will?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step closer, letting her fingers graze Agatha’s wrist before squeezing it lightly. “Try and keep me away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, and for a moment, Rio thought she might pull her in for a kiss. But instead, Agatha just shook her head, a smile dancing on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go,” she murmured. “Before I find a reason to make you stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, reluctantly stepping back. “See you soon, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, she turned and walked to her car, feeling Agatha’s eyes on her the entire way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the kitchen counter, staring at the untouched cup of coffee in her hands. She was still wearing last night’s clothes, but she couldn’t bring herself to care. The scent of Agatha’s perfume still clung to her skin, to her jacket, to the very air around her, and every time she shifted, it wrapped around her like a secret.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes, letting herself sink into the memory of the night before—Agatha’s lips against hers, warm and demanding. The quiet sigh that had escaped Agatha’s mouth when Rio had kissed down the elegant column of her throat. The way Agatha had trembled when Rio had whispered her name like a prayer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could still feel the weight of Agatha’s body against hers. Still hear the soft, breathy moan Agatha had let out when Rio had—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply and opened her eyes, willing herself to think about literally anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair, a slow grin tugging at her lips. Holy shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had slept with Agatha Harkness again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it hadn’t been just sex. No, that would’ve been easier to brush off. This had been something else. Something careful and unhurried, like they were both afraid of what it meant but unable to stop themselves from chasing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin faded as the weight of it settled in her chest. What now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The front door banged open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely had time to straighten before Mia and Will came striding in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia took one look at Rio and frowned. “You’re still wearing that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Will, ever the opportunist, let out a delighted gasp. “Oh my God. Ms. V had a </span>
<em>
<span>night</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, dragging a hand down her face. “Can I get five minutes of peace before the interrogation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Mia said flatly. “Not when you’re acting weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Will flopped onto the couch, kicking his feet up on the coffee table. “She’s</span>
<em>
<span> so </span>
</em>
<span>acting weird. Look at her. Dreamy expression. Last night’s clothes. Probably hasn’t even eaten because she’s too busy thinking about whoever rocked her world.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia gagged. “Will, for the love of God. That’s my </span>
<em>
<span>mother!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Will ignored her, eyes gleaming with mischief as he turned back to Rio. “So? Who’s the lucky lady?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fought the urge to fidget. “No one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Will scoffed. “Lies. Your whole aura is screaming ‘I had the best sex of my life and now I don’t know what to do with myself.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked on her coffee. “Jesus, Will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia groaned again, rubbing her temples. “Look, I don’t actually care. Just—if you’re dating someone, tell me before I find out from TMZ, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a short laugh. “Trust me, kid. If I ever get to the point where I’m really for real dating someone, you’ll be the first to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night, Rio found herself sprawled out on the couch, one arm draped over her eyes as she tried—and failed—not to think about Agatha. She had spent the entire day in a fog, her mind looping through the night before like a song stuck on repeat. The way Agatha had looked at her in the dim light, the quiet gasps that had fallen from her lips, the feeling of her fingers digging into Rio’s shoulders like she was afraid to let go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesus.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned and pressed her palm against her face, willing herself to think about literally anything else. It didn’t help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she reached for her phone, hesitating for half a second before pulling up Agatha’s contact.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So apparently I was “acting weird” today.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the message, then added—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Mia and Will wouldn’t stop teasing me. Will was convinced I had “the best sex of my life” last night and now I don’t know what to do with myself.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The second she hit send, she froze. Oh, for fuck’s sake, Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone vibrated almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And did you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her stomach flipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers hovered over the keyboard as she tried to think of a response that wouldn’t make her sound completely unhinged.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Did I what?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Have the best sex of your life?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly dropped her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the screen, heat crawling up her neck, and then, before she could talk herself out of it—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Are you fishing for compliments, Harkness?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I don’t need to fish when I already know the answer.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sharp breath, running a hand through her hair as a slow, helpless grin spread across her face.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Damn</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is that all you have to say?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>What, you want me to write a review?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A rating would suffice.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, debating how much she wanted to push her luck. Then—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>10/10. Would absolutely do it again. Would be doing it right now if I could.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The typing bubble appeared, then disappeared. Then, finally—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Noted</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled, shaking her head at herself, and typed—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So, when do I get to see you again?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Agatha didn’t answer right away. Rio watched the typing bubble appear, disappear, then reappear. She was just about to start overthinking it when the message finally came through.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Soon</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath, her grip tightening around her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could live with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Friday rolled around, Rio had been drowning in studio work for four days straight. The band was recording their next album, which meant long hours, endless takes, and creative tension running high. She loved it—there was nothing quite like the process of building something from the ground up—but it also meant she hadn’t seen Agatha since Sunday morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which was probably why she found herself standing in the recording booth, staring at her phone instead of focusing on the track they were working on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nudged her. “You texting your new girlfriend or…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look. “You wanna live to see this album release?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked but backed off, raising her hands in mock surrender.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring her, Rio pulled up Agatha’s contact and hesitated for half a second before typing.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Hey, I was thinking… do you and Nicky want to stop by the studio today?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She barely had time to set her phone down before it buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What exactly are you thinking?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Well, I couldn’t make it to Sonata Grove this week, so I figured I’d make it up to you by giving Nicky a behind-the-scenes look at how an album is made.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A pause. Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So, this is about Nicky?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed out a laugh.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>It’s mostly about Nicky.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Mm-hmm.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, then added—</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>And maybe I’d like to see you too</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The typing bubble appeared, disappeared, then reappeared.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe?</span>
</em>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Fine. Definitely. I miss you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another pause, longer this time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We’ll be there</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, pocketing her phone just as Alice walked back over, eyebrow raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, lover girl, you ready to actually work now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t keep the smirk off her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio went back to work, but kept checking her phone when Agatha texted her to let her know they were on their way a couple of hours later. Her bandmates were all in various states of pretending not to be nosy. Alice was tuning her guitar, a little too focused. Jennifer was leaning back on the couch, arms behind her head, watching Rio with an amused glint in her eyes. Natasha was sipping from her ever-present iced coffee, her blue eyes sharp with curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “Alright, listen up, because I know all three of you are about to be insufferable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked, plucking a string. “I have no idea what you mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer let out a low chuckle. “This is about Agatha, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s about the fact that Agatha and Nicky are stopping by today,” Rio corrected, pointing at them. “And I need you all to be cool about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha arched a perfectly shaped brow. “Define ‘cool.’ Because the last time you told us to be cool, Alice made that stupid joke about—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a </span>
<em>
<span>great</span>
</em>
<span> joke,” Alice cut in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a terrible joke,” Jennifer said at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose. “Focus, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned. “Alright, alright. So, what, no making fun of you for sleeping with your fancy pianist?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look. “Nicky doesn’t know about that, and I’d like to keep it that way. He idolizes me enough without adding my very impressive sex life to the mix.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer let out a loud, surprised laugh, and Natasha nearly choked on her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re ridiculous,” Natasha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean it,” Rio insisted. “No teasing. No weird jokes. No making me look bad in front of Nicky—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t make you look bad if you already—” Alice started, but Rio cut her off with a glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Alice</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed dramatically. “Fine, fine. We’ll behave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer grinned. “Can’t make any promises, but I’ll try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, running a hand through her hair. “Good. Because I actually want them to enjoy this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha eyed her over the rim of her coffee cup. “And you want to impress Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored the heat creeping up her neck. “I want her to see that bringing Nicky was a good idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smirked. “Uh-huh. Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could argue, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen and felt her heart skip—</span>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We’re here.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio straightened, shaking off her nerves as she looked at the others. “Alright. Showtime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice saluted her. “Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer chuckled. “Relax, Vidal. We got this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow breath. This was fine. Everything was fine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, she just had to survive the next couple of hours without completely embarrassing herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio strode out of the recording booth, running a hand through her hair as she crossed the hallway toward the entrance. She could already hear Nicky’s excited voice, talking a mile a minute, and Agatha’s quieter, more measured responses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a breath. Alright, Vidal. Act normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed open the door to the front lounge, and there they were—Nicky, bouncing on the balls of his feet, his eyes wide as he took in every detail of the space, and Agatha, standing beside him, effortlessly elegant despite the casual jeans and sweater she wore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, Rio forgot how to function for a solid five seconds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha looked good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last time they’d seen each other, it had been—well. Naked. Tangled up together in the dark. Agatha’s hair a mess, her voice rough from sleep, her fingers tracing slow, lazy circles against Rio’s skin. Sure, she had stayed for breakfast and lunch, but the image that really had been imprinted in her mind was Agatha’s naked form coming apart under her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, she looked composed, polished, every inch the woman Rio had met that first day at Sonata Grove. And yet, when Agatha’s gaze met hers, something in those blue eyes flickered—something Rio felt in her chest, her stomach, everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced herself to shake it off, turning her attention to Nicky before her brain could take her anywhere it shouldn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kid,” she said, offering a grin. “Ready to see some rockstar magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky beamed. “Yes! Are you recording today? Do I get to see you play? Can I touch the guitars?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “One question at a time, buddy. And we’ll see about the guitars.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “If you let him near an electric guitar, I will regret agreeing to this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Rio teased. “We have rules here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a pointed look. “You’re in a band with Alice Wu. I find that hard to believe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Fair enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned back to Nicky. “Alright, follow me, kid. Let’s get you a proper tour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped into the main recording area, Rio was pleased to see that—for the most part—her bandmates were actually behaving themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer was at the keyboard, idly playing a few warm-up chords. Natasha was sitting on one of the couches, sipping her iced coffee as always. And Alice—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice caught Rio’s eye and smirked. Here we go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could say anything disastrous, Rio shot her a look. “Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned but said nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, blissfully unaware of the silent battle happening over his head, stared around the space in awe. “Whoa. This is where you make the actual songs? Like, the ones on the albums?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep,” Rio said, ruffling his hair. “This is where the magic happens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky turned to Jennifer wide-eyed, as she played absentmindedly. “That’s the keyboard from the last album, isn’t it? The one on Shadow Theory?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer blinked, then gave him an approving nod. “Damn, kid. Good ear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked so pleased with himself, and Rio felt a ridiculous surge of pride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Rio said, “who wants to show Nicky how a song comes together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shot a glance at Agatha. “Depends. Are we allowed to let him touch the guitars, or does his mother disapprove?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “I should have known better than to bring him here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, this was already so worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her outside to the hallway once Nicky was fully distracted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow breath, shaking her head with an amused smile. “I should not have come here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Probably not. But I’m really glad you did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her then, really looked, and Rio knew that she wasn’t the only one still thinking about that night. The weight of it was in Agatha’s gaze, in the way her fingers curled slightly at her sides, like she was resisting the urge to reach out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step closer. “Just a little one,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “A little what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted a hand, fingers brushing the inside of Agatha’s wrist. A test. A question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Didn’t step back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she tilted her chin up—just enough, just barely—an unspoken answer that Rio didn’t waste a second interpreting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the space between them, pressing her lips softly against Agatha’s, just enough to feel the warmth of her, the familiar pull that had been lingering between them since that first night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, and then—slowly, finally—she kissed her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was brief, careful, more of a hello than anything else, but it sent heat curling through Rio’s chest all the same. When she pulled back, Agatha’s eyes were a little darker, her breath just slightly uneven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Now that’s a proper hello.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, shaking her head, but there was the faintest hint of a smile at the corner of her lips. “You’re impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, just enough to brush her nose against Agatha’s. “And yet, here you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, and for a moment, it seemed like she might kiss her again. But then—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“MOM! ALICE SAYS I CAN PLAY A SOLO ON THE NEXT ALBUM!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed deeply. “I really should not have come here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit back a laugh, stepping back and offering her hand. “Come on. Let’s go rescue your kid before Alice convinces him to drop out of school and join a band.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her an exasperated look but took her hand anyway. “I knew this was a terrible idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just grinned, lacing their fingers together for one last fleeting second before letting go. “Yeah, but you’re still here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she didn’t deny it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio and Agatha were getting ready to leave the studio, Nicky was fully absorbed in the world of music production. He had spent the last half-hour practically glued to Alice’s side as she let him mess with one of her guitars, while Jennifer showed him how different effects could completely change the sound of a song.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood next to Rio, arms crossed, looking at her son with a mix of amusement and wariness. “You’ve ruined him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, tilting her head. “I prefer to think of it as expanding his horizons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “You just gave him the most exciting day of his life, and now he’s going to expect this level of entertainment forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, that’s a good problem to have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a dry look. “For you, maybe. I’m the one who’s going to have to deal with him begging for music production lessons for the next six months.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if on cue, Nicky turned, eyes bright. “Mom! Can I—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky deflated instantly. “You didn’t even let me finish!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her forehead. “We’ll talk about it later, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “I can always put in a good word. Alice loves playing teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a sharp look. “Do not encourage him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held up her hands. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They finished gathering their things, and just as Agatha was making sure Nicky hadn’t ‘accidentally’ pocketed any of Alice’s guitar picks (“She gave it to me!”—“She gave it to you because she enjoys my suffering.”), Rio hesitated for a moment before clearing her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, rubbing the back of her neck, “why don’t you two come over to my place for a bit? I was just gonna order food anyway, and Mia’s home tonight, so she and Nicky could hang out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, brows lifting slightly. “Your place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to consider that for a moment before saying, “Or, we could go to mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That wasn’t a bad idea. If anything, Rio liked the thought of being back in Agatha’s space. It was calm, quiet, full of books and music—full of her. It was also the place where they’d spent that night, tangled in each other, Agatha’s hands warm against her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But—</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled. “Mia’s home tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied her carefully, and Rio knew she understood. She wasn’t ashamed to be here with Agatha, wasn’t hiding, but she wasn’t ready to walk through her front door and have Mia ask where she’d been.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t ready to lie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she wasn’t ready to tell the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha drove them to Rio’s place, Rio texted Mia to let her know she was bringing company and to make sure the house wasn’t a complete mess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>So Agatha and Nicky stopped by the studio today. I wanted to make it up to Nicky for missing our jam sessions. They’re coming home with me for dinner if that’s okay with you?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Kiddo</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I guess? I have tons of homework though so I won’t be able to stick around for long</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>That’s fine sweetheart, just wanted to make sure you were okay with it. We’ll be there soon. Can you make sure the house isn’t a complete disaster?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a sigh and Agatha turned to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, looking down at her phone to see that Mia had replied with a thumbs up emoji. “Yeah, I was just letting Mia know we’re on our way. How does pizza sound? Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pizza sounds awesome. I’m starving!” Nicky replied excitedly, much to Rio’s amusement. Agatha shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The way he talks it’s like I never feed him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a growing boy, you know? I need food,” Nicky immediately retorted, making Agatha roll her eyes. Rio stifled a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s got a point there,” she told Agatha, who shot her a look. “Hey, I’m just saying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a growing boy who should be eating more vegetables.” Rio watched as Agatha looked at her son through the rearview mirror. Nicky groaned. “But it’s Friday, so you get a pass tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sweet victory, my man,” Rio teased, reaching back to offer her hand for a high five. Nicky immediately complied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes! How many pizzas can we get?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia was already curled up on the couch, earphones in, flipping through her phone. She barely glanced up when the door opened—until Nicky practically burst inside, eyes shining with excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia! You will not believe where I was today!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia raised an eyebrow, tugging out an earbud. “Prison?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky huffed. “No! Better!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia snorted but sat up a little. “Doubt it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that was all the invitation Nicky needed. He launched into a rapid-fire retelling of his afternoon at the studio—how Jennifer had let him mess around with the soundboard, how Alice had shown him an actual guitar solo (“She said I had potential, Mia!”), how he’d gotten to hear a real song in the works.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia, for all her usual aloofness, seemed… interested. She didn’t interrupt, didn’t roll her eyes—just listened, nodding along as Nicky talked a mile a minute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, watching them from the kitchen, where she and Agatha stood finishing up setting the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See?” she said, nudging Agatha’s shoulder. “Told you they’d be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a side glance but didn’t argue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dinner had been easy—they did order pizza, because Rio was too lazy to cook, and Agatha wasn’t about to argue when it meant she didn’t have to either. The four of them had sat around the table, the kids dominating the conversation while Rio and Agatha exchanged quiet, amused glances over the top of their drinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a little while, it had felt… normal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had felt good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After dinner, Mia had retreated to her room (“I have homework.”—translation: “I need to be alone now.”), and Nicky had sprawled out on the couch, playing a game on his iPad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which left Rio and Agatha alone in the kitchen, the quiet hum of the house settling around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rinsed the last plate, placing it in the drying rack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned against the counter, watching her. “Not a bad idea, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed. “You get one point for this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Just one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned off the faucet, drying her hands with deliberate patience. Then, in a voice just low enough that only Rio could hear, she murmured, “You might earn a few more later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach flipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned slightly, arching a brow. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha only gave her a look before brushing past her, the faintest, deliberate press of her fingers against Rio’s arm as she moved toward the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was going to be a very good night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia had already come back downstairs for a glass of water and to say goodnight, and had gone back to her room a while ago. By the time Nicky started yawning, stretching dramatically across the couch, it was obvious he was crashing. He kept rubbing at his eyes, blinking stubbornly, clearly trying to will himself awake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Alright, kid. Let’s get going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before Nicky could protest, Rio cut in. “Why don’t you just stay a little longer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, glancing at her. “Stay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Yeah. Nicky looks like he’s about five seconds from passing out. He can crash in the guest room for now. And, you know…” She trailed off, watching Agatha carefully, before adding, “we could have a little more time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was silent for a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, finally—“Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky barely even reacted. He just mumbled something that sounded vaguely like “okay” and let Agatha nudge him off the couch, leading him toward the guest room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha came back to the living room, Rio turned to her, a slow smirk spreading across her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped in closer, hands settling lightly at Agatha’s waist. “We never really got to say hello properly earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a laugh, but her hands found Rio’s shoulders, steady and sure. “I’m pretty sure we did.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers traced slow, absent-minded circles against the fabric of Agatha’s blouse. She tilted her head, studying her in the dim kitchen light. “Are you sure you want to stay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, and Rio saw it—the moment her carefully constructed walls lowered, just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she murmured. “At least for a little while longer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need any more invitation than that. She closed the distance between them, pressing their lips together in a slow, deliberate kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t rushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t desperate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a quiet, steady promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed against her mouth, one hand sliding up to cup the back of Rio’s neck, deepening the kiss just enough to make Rio’s pulse stutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned against her lips. “I was thinking, you know…” She kissed her again, softer this time. “Maybe I could earn those extra points now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, considering. “Mmm. We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio was already pulling her toward the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they made it to Rio’s bedroom, Agatha had Rio pinned against the door, kissing her with an intensity that made Rio’s heart race. The urgency between them was palpable, as if they were both trying to catch up to the moments they hadn’t yet shared. There was something both familiar and brand new about this kiss—something that ignited the very core of Rio’s being.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t like the first time. That had been all heat, frustration, and release, the magnetic pull between them snapping the tightrope of restraint. But this? This felt more like two people discovering each other in a different light, like they were already comfortable enough with each other to give in to the quiet, simmering desire that had been building for weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss deepened, slow and languid, as if they had all the time in the world. Rio’s hands slid under Agatha’s blouse, feeling the warmth of her skin beneath her fingertips. She couldn’t help but trace the curve of her waist, the smoothness of her back, marveling at how something so simple could feel so electrifying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped softly against her lips when Rio’s hands brushed her skin, her breath hitching in that way Rio had already come to find intoxicating. There was something almost musical in the way Agatha responded—calm yet filled with an undeniable intensity. Every movement of Agatha’s body was measured, intentional, and it sent a thrill through Rio. Clothes came off slowly, sensually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel the heat of Agatha’s body beneath her, the way her hips arched up, seeking friction. Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s sides, her fingers trembling slightly as she cupped the curve of her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned into the kiss, her hands tangling in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, deeper. Their tongues tangled together, hot and slick, and Rio could feel the fire building in her belly, spreading through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke the kiss, her lips trailing down Agatha’s neck, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin there. Agatha’s breath hitched, a soft moan escaping her lips. “Rio,” she whispered, her voice trembling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curved into a smile against Agatha’s skin. She loved the way her name sounded on Agatha’s lips—like a plea, a prayer. She kissed her way down Agatha’s chest, her lips brushing against the swell of her breasts, her tongue flicking against a hardened nipple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands tightened in her hair, her hips arching up off the bed. “Please,” she whispered, her voice raw with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She kissed her way down Agatha’s stomach, her tongue tracing the curve of her hip bone. She could feel the heat radiating from Agatha’s core, the way her legs trembled as Rio settled between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused for a moment, her eyes flicking up to meet Agatha’s. </span>
<em>
<span>God, she was beautiful.</span>
</em>
<span> Her chest rose and fell with each breath, her lips swollen from their kisses, her eyes dark with desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio whispered, her voice trembling with emotion. “So perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her hands reaching down to cup Rio’s face. “So are you,” she whispered, her voice soft, almost reverent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled at the words. She leaned down, her lips brushing against the soft skin of Agatha’s inner thigh. She could feel the way Agatha’s body tensed, her breath hitching as Rio’s lips moved closer to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When her tongue finally flicked against Agatha’s clit, a soft moan escaped her lips. Rio’s hands tightened on Agatha’s thighs, holding her steady as she began to explore, her tongue swirling around the sensitive bundle of nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tangled in the sheets, her hips arching up off the bed. “Oh god, Rio,” she moaned, her voice trembling with pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled against her, her tongue swirling around Agatha’s clit before dipping lower, teasing her entrance. She could feel the way Agatha’s body trembled, the way her muscles tightened around her tongue as she pushed inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, a soft, keening sound escaping her lips. She reached down, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart raced, her own desire building with every moan, every gasp that escaped Agatha’s lips. She wanted to see her come undone, to feel her trembling beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled back slightly, her tongue flicking against Agatha’s clit as her fingers replaced her mouth, sliding inside her with ease. Agatha’s body tightened around her, a soft cry escaping her lips as Rio curled her fingers, searching for that spot inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she found it, Agatha’s body arched off the bed, a loud, desperate moan escaping her lips. “Oh god, Rio, please,” she begged, her voice trembling with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips curved into a smile against her. She could feel the way Agatha’s body was building, the way her muscles tightened around her fingers. She leaned down, her lips capturing Agatha’s clit, her tongue swirling around it as her fingers moved inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take long. Agatha’s body tensed, her breath hitching as she came, her muscles tightening around Rio’s fingers as her hips rocked against her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t stop, her tongue swirling around Agatha’s clit as she rode out her orgasm, her own desire building with every moan, every gasp that escaped Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally collapsed back onto the bed, her chest heaving, Rio pulled back, her lips swollen, her face slick with Agatha’s arousal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, her chest rising and falling with each breath. She reached for Rio, her hands trembling as she pulled her up, her lips crashing against hers in a desperate, hungry kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned as she tasted herself on Rio’s lips, the heat of her desire mingling with her own. Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s sides, her fingers trembling slightly as she settled between her legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hips arched up, her hands sliding down Rio’s back, pulling her closer. “Please,” she whispered, her voice raw with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She shifted slightly, her body pressing against Agatha’s, their cores aligning perfectly. She could feel the heat of Agatha’s body against her, the way her hips rocked up, seeking friction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their movements were slow at first, their bodies grinding together as they explored each other, their moans mingling in the air. But soon, the pace quickened, their bodies moving together in a desperate, hungry rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, her body trembling with pleasure as Agatha’s hips rocked against hers, her clit rubbing against Agatha’s with every movement. She could feel the fire building in her belly, spreading through her veins as they moved together, their bodies pressed so close there was no space left for hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tightened on Rio’s hips, her breath hitching as they moved together. “Oh god, Rio,” she moaned, her voice trembling with pleasure. “I’m so close again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart raced, her own desire building with every moan, every gasp that escaped Agatha’s lips. She could feel the way Agatha’s body was building, the way her muscles tightened around her as they moved together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha came again, her body tensed, her breath hitching as her hips rocked against Rio’s, her muscles tightening around her as she rode out her orgasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t stop, her own body trembling with pleasure as she came, her hips grinding against Agatha’s as they rode out their orgasms together, their bodies pressed so close there was no space left for anything but pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally collapsed back onto the bed, their chests heaving, Agatha reached for Rio, her fingers tangling in her hair as she pulled her close, their lips crashing together in a soft, tender kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re amazing,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling with emotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled at the words. She leaned down, her lips brushing against Agatha’s forehead. “So are you,” she whispered, her voice soft, almost reverent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled Agatha closer, just a breath away from feeling like the world around them could vanish, leaving only the two of them tangled in sheets and satisfaction. Agatha’s fingers threaded through Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, their breaths mingling in the quiet of the room. Rio pulled back for a moment, letting her forehead rest against Agatha’s. They were both still panting slightly, the closeness still tingling between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re thinking,” Agatha murmured, her lips grazing Rio’s ear as she spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, shifting so she could meet Agatha’s eyes. “Mmm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about?” Agatha asked, her voice a little more breathless now, her fingers brushing gently across Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled slowly, her eyes fixed on Agatha’s. “You staying.” There was a note of uncertainty in her voice, though she tried to mask it with a nonchalant tone. “I know you’ve got your reasons, but I was just… thinking. I wanted to sleep and wake up next to you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away for a moment, her expression softening as she let out a quiet breath. She took a step back, leaving a bit of space between them, and ran a hand through her hair. Rio didn’t need to say anything more; she knew Agatha well enough by now to understand her hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t.” Agatha’s voice was soft, but firm. “It’s just… not the right time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart sank slightly, but she nodded, though she could feel the disappointment in her chest. She could see the internal struggle on Agatha’s face, and she understood. Agatha wasn’t trying to hurt her; she was just trying to protect something—maybe herself, maybe Mia. Maybe a little of both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mia,” Rio murmured. “She’s old enough to understand what this would mean, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a small, understanding nod. “She’s aware of things. And she’s already had to deal with enough, Rio. I don’t want to put her in that position.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, feeling the weight of her own emotions. She reached for Agatha’s hand, squeezing it gently. “I get it. I really do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, neither of them spoke, just lying there, the quiet of the room settling around them like a blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… wish things were simpler,” Rio said after a beat, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I get it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, her thumb brushing against Rio’s hand. “Me too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stayed there for a few moments longer, just savoring the comfort of each other’s presence before Agatha finally broke the silence. “But I’ll see you soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words were comforting, but they also felt like a promise. Rio smiled at her, unable to hide the warmth in her chest. “Soon,” she echoed. “I’m holding you to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood and stepped away to grab her clothes, moving with the kind of grace that came from being someone who was always in control of her movements. Rio watched her for a moment, admiring the quiet confidence Agatha exuded even in the simplest things. The way she pulled on her shirt, the way she fastened her jeans—it all seemed like it had a certain rhythm to it, like she was playing her own private melody.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened. “You know,” she said, her tone playful, “I was just starting to think we could make a habit out of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked but didn’t say anything as she finished getting dressed. Rio chuckled, then pushed herself up from the bed to stand next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll get you next time,” Rio added, her voice low, teasing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, glancing at her with an eyebrow raised. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could answer, Agatha gave her one last lingering kiss—a kiss full of promise, one that made Rio’s heart race all over again. “Next time,” Agatha whispered, pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her chest tight with something that could only be described as anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Best sex of my life, by the way,” Agatha said, her tone casual but her eyes dancing with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but laugh, shaking her head in disbelief. “You’re terrible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha was already heading for the door, her hand on the handle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she said over her shoulder, smirking.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha drove home in the quiet darkness, the sound of the car’s engine the only thing filling the stillness. She couldn’t help but replay everything from the night—the unexpected tenderness, the urgency, and the way Rio had touched her like she was something to be cherished. The way Rio had kissed her, lingering like there was no time limit on their moment, like the rest of the world didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers gripped the steering wheel tighter as she thought about it. There had been a rawness to their connection, a depth she hadn’t anticipated. Agatha had always prided herself on control, on keeping her emotions in check, but this—this was different. She’d gone into this whole thing with the assumption that it was just a flirtation, an exploration of something new, something she could walk away from without much complication.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now, as she drove in the dark, it was clear her feelings were running deeper than she’d ever imagined. This wasn’t just an attraction—it was something more, something real. Something she wasn’t sure she was ready for. The mere thought of Rio made her stomach twist, her heart skip a beat, and she realized that the more she tried to deny it, the more real it felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire situation had spun out of her control, and Agatha wasn’t sure whether she was relieved or terrified. She couldn’t even tell up from down anymore. All she knew was that she couldn’t stop thinking about Rio, about the way they’d fit together so perfectly. Even now, a flutter of anticipation stirred in her chest as she pulled into her driveway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she got inside, she was greeted by the quiet hum of the house. Nicky was sleepy and passed out as soon as she walked him to his room, exhausted from the day’s excitement. She moved quietly through the house, locking everything, before she slipped into her own room. She undressed, feeling the weight of the night’s events still lingering on her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After brushing her teeth, Agatha grabbed her phone from the bedside table, her mind still running in circles. She took a deep breath before sending Rio a quick message:</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>Just got home. Nicky’s in bed. Safe and sound. Thank you for tonight, Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send and leaned back against the pillows, staring up at the ceiling, her mind buzzing with questions she wasn’t sure she had the answers to. What was she supposed to do with all of this? How did she balance these feelings when everything felt so chaotic?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not long after, her phone buzzed with Rio’s reply.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Glad you made it home safe. But I gotta ask… that ‘best sex of your life’ thing… was that a compliment or a challenge?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh softly, shaking her head at the text. Leave it to Rio to turn her vulnerability into something playful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha texted back, a smirk tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You know what, I think it was both.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, Rio replied with a string of laughing emojis. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Well, I’m up for the challenge any time you are</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at that. She could practically hear Rio’s voice in her head, the playful tone, the teasing lilt. A small, amused smile crept across her face as she typed her reply.</span>
</p><p align="right">
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p align="right">
<em>
<span>You’re impossible. But I think I’m going to hold you to that.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The words came out before she could think about it too much. There was something about Rio that made her forget about all the walls she’d built around herself, something about the way Rio made her feel seen. It scared her in the best way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed again, and Rio’s reply made her laugh out loud.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, I’m counting on it, Harkness.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile widened as she placed the phone down beside her, feeling a warmth spread through her chest. Maybe this wasn’t as complicated as she had thought. Maybe, for once, it could just be about them—no expectations, no limitations, just a chance to let herself be. For the first time in a long time, that felt like enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The week leading up to Thanksgiving felt quieter than usual for Agatha, despite the bustle of Sonata Grove. Her thoughts kept drifting back to Rio—her texts, her words, the feeling of her lips against hers, the memory of her touch. It had been days since they’d seen each other, and the ache of missing her had started to settle deep within Agatha’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept texting Rio throughout the week, little exchanges here and there, but it wasn’t enough. Agatha felt like she was caught in a strange, unresolved tension, and she couldn’t put it into words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda, as usual, was the one who could sense that something was off. Agatha had always been good at hiding things, but Wanda was a master at peeling back the layers. They were sitting on the back porch at Wanda’s house, sipping wine and watching the kids run around the yard, laughing and playing like it was just another day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s on your mind, Ag?” Wanda’s voice broke through Agatha’s thoughts. She hadn’t even realized that Wanda was watching her so closely. “You’re quieter than usual. Haven’t seen you this distracted in… forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even bother pretending she wasn’t caught. She exhaled and leaned back in her chair, staring up at the starry sky. “I’m fine, just tired. Nicky’s been keeping me on my toes.” It was a weak excuse, and Wanda saw straight through it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah?” Wanda raised an eyebrow, a smirk forming. “Tired, huh? Is that what they’re calling it these days?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened but tried to hide it behind a casual laugh. “You know, dealing with a kid who never stops asking questions.” She was trying to steer the conversation away, but Wanda wasn’t having it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned forward, a glint of mischief in her eyes. “Sure. But I don’t think it’s Nicky who’s been keeping you distracted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a confused look. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned, her eyes narrowing as she read Agatha’s unreadable expression. “You’ve been distracted for weeks. And you’re always texting someone now. Who’s got you so wrapped up in their texts, Aggie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach flipped at the mention of Rio. She hadn’t expected Wanda to call her out so directly. She forced herself to sit up straighter, but it felt like her heart was racing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No one.” Agatha protested, her voice higher than she intended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned in, lowering her voice slightly as if sharing a secret. “You know exactly what I mean. The one who’s been making your phone buzz non-stop this week. The one who’s clearly got you all… worked up.” She raised her eyebrows knowingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, despite herself. “You’re imagining things. It’s just a friend. I told you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda cut her off, her tone suddenly more serious. “Don’t give me that. I know you too well, Agatha. You’re practically glowing. You can’t hide it. Who is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a wave of heat flush her face. She couldn’t look Wanda in the eye for a moment. “It’s… It’s just Rio,” she finally muttered, barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Wanda repeated, incredulous. “You mean, </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> Rio Vidal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, feeling her heart beat faster, but she couldn’t stop the warmth that spread through her. “Yes, that Rio. It’s… complicated, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes widened in exaggerated surprise. “Complicated? That’s one way to put it. I thought you’d given up on all this… complicated stuff. You’ve always been so… cautious.” She leaned in closer, dropping her voice to a teasing whisper. “Come on, Agatha. What’s going on between you two?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples, knowing that there was no escape now. “We’re just… texting a lot, okay? But it’s nothing serious. Just talking. Nothing more.” But even as she said the words, she knew they felt hollow. She didn’t believe them, and Wanda wasn’t buying them either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda wasn’t giving up. She nudged Agatha playfully, her voice sweet but insistent. “Texting a lot, huh? Agatha, the last time you were texting this much, it was with me about a new piano piece you were working on, not some rockstar. You’re not fooling anyone. You’ve got that look in your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched. She felt a wave of vulnerability wash over her, and she couldn’t hide the way her body tensed at Wanda’s words. It was hard to even process how much of herself she was revealing without intending to. She had to admit it—Wanda was right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what to do, Wanda,” Agatha confessed after a beat, the words slipping out before she could stop them. “She, uh… She makes me feel things I didn’t think I could feel. I didn’t expect this… </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>.” She gestured vaguely to the space between them, trying to find the words to explain the emotional whirlwind Rio had unknowingly stirred inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s expression softened, and she gave Agatha a look that was both understanding and encouraging. “Agatha, listen to me. It’s okay to feel things, even if they scare the hell out of you. I’ve seen you locked in your own little world for years now, keeping everything tight and controlled. And now? Now you’ve got someone who makes you feel—what? Alive? Free? Wanted?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened, and she felt the full weight of the emotions she had been trying to ignore. She took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “Yeah. I don’t know what this is, but it’s real. It’s… it’s different. And it scares the hell out of me. I don’t know if I’m ready to let myself fall for someone again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled gently, but there was a touch of mischief in her eyes. “You don’t have to figure it all out right now. But Agatha, don’t let your fear hold you back. Especially when it comes to someone who makes you feel this way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her heart still racing. She couldn’t deny it. Wanda was right. She’d been trying so hard to maintain control, but now—when it came to Rio—she didn’t even know how to pretend anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft and uncertain. “But it’s not that simple, Wanda. I have Nicky to think about. I have to protect him, and… protect myself too. I don’t want to make a mistake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gave her a knowing look. “You’re not the same person you were before, Aggie. You’ve spent years building walls around your heart, and I get it. But at some point, you have to take those walls down, even if it’s just a little at a time. You deserve this. You deserve to be happy. And, hell, I think Rio’s the real deal. I can see it in your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her wine glass, swirling the liquid absentmindedly. She didn’t know what it was about Rio that had made her feel this way, but it was undeniable. The attraction, the connection, the overwhelming pull she felt every time they talked, every time they were together—it was like something deep within her had finally woken up. She was starting to care in a way that made her both excited and terrified.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I might be falling for her,” Agatha admitted quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda reached across the table, placing her hand gently on Agatha’s. “Then you should let yourself. Don’t overthink it, Agatha. You don’t need all the answers. Just take it one step at a time, and trust that you’ll figure it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up at her friend, gratitude filling her chest. Wanda had always been the one to call her out when she was being too guarded, too cautious. And right now, Agatha needed that more than ever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Wanda. I just… I’m scared of everything changing,” Agatha confessed. “I don’t know what it’ll look like if I let this in. If I let her in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll figure it out. Just don’t close yourself off, okay? You deserve to be happy,” Wanda said, giving her a soft but firm squeeze on the hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, trying to push back the overwhelming flood of emotions. She was still processing everything, but one thing was clear: Rio was no longer just a fleeting distraction. She wasn’t a mistake or a passing fancy. She was someone who had changed things for Agatha, made her see herself and her life differently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the evening went by in a blur of conversation and laughter as the kids played and everyone gathered around the dinner table. But Agatha found herself stealing glances at her phone, waiting for another message from Rio, wondering what she would say next. She couldn’t stop herself from thinking about Rio, even though she knew that this was only the beginning of whatever this was going to turn into.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>December had descended with a chill, but the real cold had been in Agatha’s chest—one that had little to do with the weather and everything to do with the whirlwind she’d been caught up in since she’d started seeing Rio. Between her upcoming solo concert and the annual performance at Sonata Grove, stress had taken over her life in a way she hadn’t anticipated. It had been years since she’d performed at this level—years since she’d put herself back in the spotlight—and it was scaring her in a way she hadn’t expected. The familiar anxiety crept back in, gnawing at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t let the kids see her stressed, so she kept a calm face at the school, but behind closed doors, Agatha was barely holding it together. The weight of preparing for both performances had her stretched thin, and it felt like there were a thousand things left to do. On top of all that, she was still navigating her complicated feelings for Rio. The connection was undeniable, but the emotions it stirred—those were terrifying. And yet, it felt so real, so right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been almost a week since Thanksgiving, and Agatha hadn’t seen Rio at all. Their schedules were hectic, and life was doing its best to pull them apart. But tonight—tonight, Agatha had the house to herself. Nicky was staying at Wanda’s with the twins for a movie night, and finally, </span>
<em>
<span>finally</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha had some peace. Some space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio knocked on her door that evening, Agatha had already been pacing the living room, her mind constantly spinning between her responsibilities and the pull she felt to Rio. She couldn’t help herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without a word, Agatha pulled open the door and immediately grabbed Rio by the coat, tugging her inside with a sense of urgency that surprised even her. Before the door could even close behind them, Agatha was kissing her—fiercely, as if she were starving for this moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s surprised gasp melted quickly into a soft, relieved hum, her hands finding Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer. The kiss was electric, heated, and full of everything Agatha had been holding back for the past couple of weeks. She hadn’t realized just how much she’d missed Rio until that moment—how much she craved this, her touch, her warmth, everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just for a moment, breathless, her eyes searching Rio’s face like she was trying to make sure she wasn’t imagining this, that this—them—was real. Rio’s eyes sparkled with the same longing, and in that moment, all the stress, all the worries, seemed to fall away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve missed you,” Agatha whispered, barely a breath between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, the corner of her lips curling up mischievously. “Yeah? I’ve missed you too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha breathed, pulling her in again, this time with more force, as if she could lose herself in the kiss—lose herself in Rio—and forget about everything else. The weight of her responsibilities, her fears about the performances, the looming pressure of her solo concert—it all melted away as she let herself get lost in this moment, in the touch of Rio’s lips, the feel of her arms around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled away, both of them a little breathless, Agatha couldn’t stop the soft chuckle that escaped her. “We didn’t even say hello,” she teased, her thumb brushing lightly across Rio’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her hands still firmly on Agatha’s waist. “Isn’t kissing me the better greeting?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Agatha said, her smile softening, but then a thought crossed her mind, a serious look passing over her face. “I’m sorry I’ve been distant,” she added, her voice quieter. “I’ve been… stressed out. About the concert and everything. I didn’t mean to pull away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cupped Agatha’s face gently, her thumb tracing over her skin in comforting circles. “I get it, Agatha. You’ve got a lot on your plate. But I’m here for you. Whenever you’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, leaning into Rio’s touch. It felt like Rio always knew how to make her feel grounded, to make her feel like everything would be okay, even when Agatha didn’t know how to fix it all herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she opened her eyes again, she met Rio’s gaze with a vulnerability she hadn’t intended to show, but it felt right. “I don’t want to be afraid anymore,” she said softly. “I want this. I want you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile was soft but full of warmth. “Then let me in, Agatha. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat, her heart racing. “Okay. Let’s… just be here, right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Rio kissed her again, this time slower, more deliberate. It was the kind of kiss that promised more, that held the weight of everything they had yet to explore together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, Agatha didn’t feel like she was drowning in expectations. She felt alive, free, and… loved. And in Rio’s arms, that felt like the only thing that mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led Rio into the living room, still holding her hand as if she couldn’t bear to let go. The warmth of Rio’s touch was a grounding comfort that Agatha desperately needed in that moment. When they entered the living room, Agatha gestured toward the small spread she’d prepared on the coffee table—a carefully arranged assortment of wine, cheese, olives, Parmesan toast, and other bite-sized treats. She’d been meaning to unwind tonight, to find a few moments of peace amidst the chaos of her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought we could relax,” Agatha said with a soft, almost apologetic smile, “Have a little wine, some snacks… I know I’ve been a little… distracted lately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, a knowing smile pulling at her lips as she took in the setup. She wasn’t fooled by the calm exterior Agatha was trying to present. She could feel the tension still radiating from her, even if Agatha was doing her best to mask it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks amazing,” Rio replied, squeezing Agatha’s hand before releasing it, moving to sit down on the couch. “But… I know that look. You’re still wound up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, standing for a moment as if weighing whether she should say anything at all. The truth was, Rio’s presence always made her feel like she could be honest, even about the things she was afraid to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed softly before sitting down beside Rio, feeling the familiar comfort of her presence. The soft light from the table lamps and the warmth from the wine made the evening feel a little more manageable, but it didn’t stop her mind from racing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the concert,” Agatha admitted after a beat, her fingers picking at the edge of the napkin on her lap. “I haven’t done anything like this in years, and I’m terrified. It’s… it’s hard to explain, but it’s not just the performance itself. It’s everything surrounding it—the pressure, the expectations, the spotlight. And I’m also trying to help the kids prepare for the annual performance at Sonata Grove, and… ” she paused, exhaling heavily “ I don’t know how to keep it all together, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, her eyes softening as she listened, the quiet understanding on her face a relief. She didn’t push Agatha to continue, letting her speak at her own pace. Instead, Rio’s hand found Agatha’s again, squeezing it gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds like you’re taking on a lot,” Rio said quietly, her voice calm and steady, like a rock in a storm. “But you know, you don’t have to carry all of it by yourself, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over at her, her eyes tired but appreciative. “I know,” she whispered, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “I just… don’t want to disappoint anyone. Especially Nicky. He’s already seen enough of me working late or being stressed. I want to be there for him. And I don’t want to let anyone down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a lot of weight to carry,” Rio replied, her thumb gently brushing against Agatha’s hand. “But you don’t have to do it all alone. You’re allowed to ask for help, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breath, feeling the weight on her chest lift just a little with Rio’s words. She wasn’t used to relying on anyone, especially not like this, but with Rio, it felt different. “I know. I just don’t… know how to ask for help. I’ve always had to do it all myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes softened with empathy. “I get it. I’ve been there. But letting someone in doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a lump form in her throat, emotions she’d been trying to hold back starting to surface. She blinked quickly, trying to push them down, but they wouldn’t stay hidden.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just scared of not being enough,” Agatha admitted, the words slipping out before she could stop them. “I’m scared of failing, of not being able to balance it all. Or worse, of Nicky seeing me as… too much. He’s just a kid, and I don’t want him to feel like he has to be the strong one for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted closer, closing the distance between them. She reached up, gently cupping Agatha’s face with both hands. “You don’t have to be perfect, Agatha. You don’t have to have everything figured out. Just… be real. Be there for Nicky. Be there for yourself. And I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart fluttered at the sincerity in Rio’s voice. She felt a tear escape, quickly brushing it away, not wanting to seem weak. But Rio, ever perceptive, leaned in and kissed her gently, offering comfort in the only way she knew how—through touch, through presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they broke apart, Agatha gave a small, shaky laugh. “I didn’t mean to unload on you like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, wiping away the tear from Agatha’s cheek. “Don’t apologize. I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. I’m not going to judge you, Agatha. Not now, not ever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips quivered into a small smile, the kind that came from relief, from feeling seen, from feeling understood. She knew that Rio wasn’t going to judge her—she wasn’t even sure she could judge her. But still, opening up like this felt new and vulnerable in ways she hadn’t expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft but steady. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You won’t have to find out,” Rio whispered, her hand never leaving Agatha’s. “I’m here. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in that moment, as they shared a quiet, intimate space together, Agatha felt the tension in her chest loosen just a little bit more. The world hadn’t stopped spinning, but at least, for now, she wasn’t facing it alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet between them stretched for a moment before Rio spoke, her voice soft but carrying a certain hopefulness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Agatha,” she began, a small, knowing smile playing at the corners of her lips. “Can I ask you for something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head slightly, her eyes still holding a trace of vulnerability from their earlier conversation. She gave a small nod, sensing that Rio wasn’t about to ask for anything too heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Could you show me one of the songs you’re planning on performing for your solo concert?” Rio asked, her tone light, yet earnest. “I know you’ve got a lot on your plate right now, but maybe if you play in front of someone, it’ll help you get out of your head for a bit. Just feel the music, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, surprised by the request. “You want me to play for you? After everything I’ve just… said? You really think that would help?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, her gaze tender as she reached out to gently touch Agatha’s hand. “Yeah, I think it might. Because, well…” She paused, her eyes locking with Agatha’s in a way that made the rest of the world feel like it faded into the background. “Mia keeps telling me that one of the most important things you teach her is to just let the music be a part of her, to feel it, not overthink it. So, maybe it’s time for you to practice what you preach a little. Just play for the music, Agatha. Let yourself be in the moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart fluttered at the words, a warmth spreading through her chest. She could feel the sincerity in Rio’s voice, the way Rio truly believed in her—believed in this—and it made her want to give it a try, despite how anxious the idea made her feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you’re right,” Agatha said slowly, her mind already running through the songs she’d been working on for her performance. She glanced over at the piano, the keys seeming to almost call to her. She stood up from the couch, her fingers twitching in anticipation. “I suppose there’s no harm in trying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her with a quiet intensity as Agatha made her way to the piano, the soft clicking of her heels against the hardwood floor the only sound. Agatha paused for a moment, her fingers hovering over the keys, her mind swirling. But as she took a deep breath, she let it all go—the anxiety, the pressure, the self-doubt—and simply focused on the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat down at the piano, her fingers grazing the first notes of a song she’d been composing in fragments for the concert. It was something close to her heart—something that had been inspired by a time of great emotional upheaval, yet had blossomed into a melody of hope, of strength, and of finding peace within the chaos. She hadn’t played it in front of anyone yet, not even Nicky, but in the quiet of the room, with Rio watching her, it felt like the right moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first few notes were tentative, as if Agatha was testing the waters. But as her hands moved across the keys, the music began to fill the space, to soothe her own troubled mind. The rhythm of it seemed to wash over her, and she let herself sink into the melody, feeling the tension melt from her body. Her eyes closed for a brief moment as she lost herself in the music, letting it flow through her like a current.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finished the piece, the room was filled with an almost eerie silence. Agatha opened her eyes slowly, unsure of what Rio would think.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence stretched on for a moment before Rio finally spoke, her voice soft but filled with admiration. “That… holy shit, that was beautiful, Agatha. You really are something else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over at Rio, her heart still beating a little faster from the performance, though she hadn’t been playing to impress anyone—only to release something she hadn’t realized she needed to. Her gaze softened as she met Rio’s eyes, feeling a deep, unspoken connection between them. “Thank you,” she said quietly, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips. “I needed to feel it, not just play it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled back, her eyes sparkling with something unreadable. “I think you’ll do great at your concert, Agatha. You’ve got all the right pieces. Just let yourself be in the moment like you did now, and you’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly, the words sinking in. She had been so focused on trying to be perfect, trying to control every aspect of her performance, that she’d forgotten what she had been telling her students all along. To just let it go. To let the music take over. It was a lesson that she was learning in so many ways—through her relationship with Rio, through her own self-reflection, and now, through the music she loved so deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I needed to hear that,” Agatha admitted, standing up from the piano and making her way back to the couch. “I think I needed to hear it from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her, a quiet smile still on her lips. She sat down beside Agatha once more, her fingers reaching out to gently trace the back of Agatha’s hand. “Well, I’m happy to be the one to say it. And I’m always here to remind you when you forget, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the weight in her chest lighten just a little. “Okay,” she said, her voice soft but full of gratitude.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them sat there for a moment, in the quiet of Agatha’s living room, the weight of the evening’s conversation shifting into something warmer. The music had cleared the air, and now, with Rio by her side, Agatha felt more ready to face the upcoming performance than she had in weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few moments of silence, Rio’s gaze lingered on Agatha, her expression thoughtful as she leaned slightly forward, her eyes soft but curious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she began, her voice tinged with an admiration that made Agatha’s heart skip a beat. “Is that song… is it your own composition?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to explain the depths of what she had just shared. The song was so personal, a reflection of her vulnerability and the emotions she’d been holding in for so long. She looked at Rio, feeling the weight of the question, and then, as if something inside her unlocked, she gave a small nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is,” Agatha said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. “It’s the first song I’ve written in the notebook you gave me for my birthday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened a little at that, and a slow, affectionate smile spread across her face. “You wrote that after the night we… after the night we first kissed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught, the memories of that night flooding her mind. The spark of something new, something raw and intense, had ignited between them, and she hadn’t been able to shake it since. The music she’d written that night was, in many ways, a reflection of that shift—a reminder of what was beginning to grow between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha admitted, her voice tinged with something deeper, something more vulnerable than she had intended. “I guess it just… it came from that place. I didn’t even know I was writing it at the time. It was like the music just took over. I haven’t been able to play it for anyone, not even Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back against the couch, her eyes soft with admiration, though a hint of something more intense lingered behind them. “I’m honored,” she said, her voice low. “It’s beautiful, Agatha. You really are something else. I… I never knew music could hold so much weight, so much feeling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze, her chest tightening at the intensity in Rio’s eyes. There was something about Rio’s presence, the way she held Agatha’s attention so effortlessly, that made everything else seem irrelevant. Agatha felt herself inching closer to Rio, drawn by a magnetic force she couldn’t quite explain. She found herself wanting to feel her, to connect with her in a way that went beyond just the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could second-guess herself, she found herself speaking, her words tumbling out before she had time to stop them. “I’m… I’m glad it’s you I’m sharing this with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips parted in surprise, but it was the heat in her gaze that made Agatha’s pulse quicken. “Agatha…” she murmured, her voice trailing off as she moved closer, her hand instinctively reaching out to brush a lock of hair away from Agatha’s face. “You don’t know what that means to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The space between them seemed to shrink in an instant, and Agatha’s breath hitched as she watched Rio lean in just slightly. Agatha’s heart raced, her thoughts spinning as she realized that the intensity of what was between them wasn’t just a fleeting connection anymore. This was something deeper. Something she couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, without thinking, Agatha closed the gap, her lips finding Rio’s in a kiss that was slow, tentative at first, as if they were both testing the waters. But the moment their lips met, the world seemed to fall away. Agatha felt herself melting into Rio’s touch, her body pressing closer as Rio’s hands found their way to her back, pulling her in with a gentle urgency. There was no space left between them now, no hesitations, no doubts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her with a softness that contrasted the fire she felt inside, and yet Agatha could feel it—that fire. That burning need that had been simmering between them since their first kiss, now ignited into something more. The kiss deepened, and Agatha responded with equal fervor, her hands finding their way to Rio’s neck, threading through the strands of her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they pulled apart for a brief moment, their foreheads resting against each other, Agatha’s breath came in shallow gasps. She could feel the heat radiating between them, her body buzzing with anticipation. “I don’t think I can hold back much longer,” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with desire, her chest rising and falling with every breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, a mischievous glint in her eyes as she traced the curve of Agatha’s jaw with her fingers. “You don’t have to,” she murmured, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear. “We’ve done this before, haven’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, her heart racing at the memory of their previous encounters. “We have,” she admitted, a spark of amusement lighting her eyes. “And I’m not complaining.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile deepened, her thumb gently caressing Agatha’s lower lip as if she were savoring the moment. “Then let’s not waste any more time,” she said softly, her voice low and inviting. “We know what we want, don’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart fluttered at her words. This wasn’t the uncertainty of their first kiss. No, this was something different—something that had grown between them over time. She could feel the weight of her desire, but also the comfort of knowing Rio, of having a deeper understanding of each other. They didn’t need to rush, didn’t need to second-guess. It was already there, and it was more than enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a slow, deliberate movement, Agatha pulled Rio closer, her hands threading through Rio’s hair as she kissed her again, this time with more urgency, more certainty. Their bodies pressed together, familiar, eager, as if they were both craving the connection they shared—the trust, the warmth, the passion that had only grown since the night they first kissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers danced down Rio’s back, pulling her into the kiss with a softness that contrasted with the intensity she felt inside. Rio’s hands roamed to Agatha’s waist, pulling her even closer, as if she couldn’t get enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a low moan as Rio’s lips trailed down her neck, the sensation sending a shiver down her spine. “God, I’ve missed this,” Agatha murmured, her hands finding the hem of Rio’s shirt, pulling it up slowly as her lips found Rio’s again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darkened with desire as she responded, her hands moving over Agatha’s body with the same familiarity, the same sense of urgency. “So have I,” she whispered against Agatha’s lips, her voice thick with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the world outside no longer mattered. They had already been here, shared this before—but each time, it felt as if it was brand new. Every kiss, every touch, was a reminder of the connection they had, a connection that wasn’t just physical. It was something deeper, something that went beyond their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t need to speak anymore—everything was said in the way their bodies moved together, in the rhythm they shared. Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest as Rio’s hands slid under her shirt, her fingertips trailing over her skin, making Agatha gasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was familiar, yes. But it was also different—richer, more intimate, and more real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind raced as her hands roamed over Rio’s body, the warmth of her skin, the softness of her touch. She felt safe, even in the most heated moments, and that safety allowed her to open up, to let go completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want this,” Agatha whispered, her lips brushing against Rio’s ear. “With you. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught, her hands pausing for just a moment, and when she looked at Agatha, the vulnerability in her eyes mirrored Agatha’s own. She leaned in, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead before pulling her back into another kiss—this time slower, more deliberate, savoring the closeness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as they finally gave in to the intimacy they shared, it was with the understanding that this wasn’t just a fleeting moment. This was something real, something that had been building for weeks. They both knew it. They felt it in every kiss, every touch. The only thing left was to embrace it, to let it all unfold as it was meant to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And they did, together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning light was soft, filtering through the curtains and casting a warm glow over the room. Agatha woke up slowly, her body still heavy with the satisfaction of last night, her mind a little hazy with the dream-like state she found herself in. She could feel Rio’s warmth beside her, the soft rise and fall of her chest, and the steady rhythm of her breathing. It felt like time had stopped, like this moment was meant to stretch out into eternity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled as she watched Rio sleep, her face peaceful, completely at ease. For the first time in a long time, Agatha didn’t feel the usual rush of anxiety or fear about the future. Instead, all she could feel was a deep, all-consuming contentment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t help it. She pulled Rio in a little closer, her arm around her waist, drawing her even nearer. Rio murmured in her sleep, and Agatha smiled softly at the sound. She knew what it meant. She knew what she felt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she lay there, her heart beating wildly in her chest, the thought settled over her: She was falling for Rio. Not a little. Not in some casual, distant way. She was falling in love with her—hard, fast, and with no way out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The idea terrified her. The last time she had let herself fall like this, it had ended in heartbreak. But something was different with Rio. Everything was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure if it was Rio’s smile, or the way she understood her without needing to say a word, or how safe she felt with her. It was everything. Every touch. Every laugh. Every moment they shared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart stuttered as Rio stirred beside her, a soft sigh escaping her lips. Slowly, Rio’s eyes fluttered open, and when she saw Agatha lying beside her, a sleepy smile tugged at her lips. That smile, so full of warmth and affection, made Agatha’s chest ache in the most beautiful way. She couldn’t help but let out a shaky breath, her emotions overwhelming her all at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio whispered, her voice low and thick with sleep. She reached up, brushing a lock of hair from Agatha’s face, her touch gentle, almost reverent. “I missed you even before I woke up,” she added, her smile softening as she gazed at Agatha with eyes still heavy with sleep but full of undeniable affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest, and she couldn’t stop herself from pulling Rio in just a little bit closer. “I missed you, too,” she whispered, her voice tight. “More than I thought I would.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, her hand trailing down Agatha’s arm, sending a thrill through her. She leaned in, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear, her breath warm and soft. “You don’t have to miss me, Agatha,” she murmured. “I’m right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A shiver ran down Agatha’s spine at the warmth of Rio’s voice, and before she could stop herself, she was kissing Rio, slow and gentle, letting the kiss deepen as she melted into it. Rio’s hands slid to the back of her neck, her touch tender, pulling Agatha closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the kiss lingered, Agatha could feel every inch of her body responding, the weight of Rio’s presence overwhelming in the best possible way. Rio’s lips moved down Agatha’s jaw, trailing soft kisses against her skin. Each kiss, each whisper, was like a promise—unspoken, yet understood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me take care of you, Agatha,” Rio whispered against her skin, her voice raw, sincere. “Let me show you how much I care.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft gasp escaped Agatha’s lips, and she pulled Rio closer, if that was even possible. She closed her eyes, her heart in her throat. And now, as she felt Rio’s lips on her skin, as she held her so close, as her heart felt like it was about to burst from the intensity of it all, she realized with painful clarity: She was in love with Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so very much in love with her. And there was no turning back. Not now. Not when everything felt this real, this undeniable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And despite the fear, despite the doubts that still lingered in the corners of her mind, she knew one thing for certain: she had never been more sure of anything in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio continued to whisper sweet nothings in her ear, pulling her deeper into the warmth of their shared intimacy, Agatha couldn’t help but surrender to it. To her. To everything they were together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time in a long time, Agatha let herself embrace the moment fully, knowing she had no control over what was coming. But maybe, just maybe, she didn’t need to.</span>

<p>
<span>The warmth of the morning sun bathed the kitchen in a soft golden glow, the gentle light illuminating the space in a way that made everything feel serene, almost magical. Rio moved around the kitchen with the ease of someone who had spent countless mornings like this—except this was different. This was their first true moment of quiet, undisturbed time, just the two of them, and Rio could feel the magic in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cracked eggs into a bowl, the sound of the shells breaking almost soothing. As she whisked the eggs, she caught Agatha’s soft gaze from across the room. There was something about the way Agatha looked at her—like she was seeing her for the first time, but also like she’d been waiting for this exact moment for her entire life. Rio smiled at the thought, her heart swelling with affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The movement in Agatha’s kitchen, the clinking of silverware as she set the table, the way she carefully folded napkins—all of it seemed so… homey. It felt like something Rio had longed for without even knowing it. This wasn’t just a morning; this was their morning. And it was perfect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha noticed Rio’s smile, catching her eye as she placed a glass of water on the table. A little blush crept up her cheeks, the intimacy of the moment not lost on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Penny for your thoughts?” Agatha asked, a teasing lilt in her voice. She walked over to Rio, placing her hands on the edge of the counter and leaning in slightly, a subtle challenge in her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, wiping her hands on the dish towel. “Just thinking about how lucky I am,” she said softly, her eyes locking with Agatha’s, sincerity evident in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hung in the air, settling between them with a weight that only made the space feel more intimate. Agatha’s breath hitched, a warmth spreading through her chest. Before she could respond, Rio was leaning in, kissing her cheek lightly, the touch soft and lingering, and Agatha’s body responded before her mind had the chance to catch up. Her lips curled into a smile as she turned her head, meeting Rio’s lips in a kiss that started out sweet but deepened quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands slid up Rio’s arms, pulling her closer, a silent invitation for Rio to close the distance between them. Rio kissed her back eagerly, the taste of her lips, the warmth of her breath, all of it filling Agatha with a sense of peace she hadn’t expected. She could feel Rio’s heart beating just as fast as hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the kiss ended, they stayed close, their foreheads resting against one another, their breaths coming out in shallow puffs. There was so much unspoken in the moment, so much that neither of them had yet put into words, but neither felt the need to. The quiet comfort of simply being together, of letting their actions speak for them, was enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step back, still smiling, and playfully reached up to adjust Rio’s hair, a small, tender gesture. “I think I’m starting to think you might actually like me,” she teased, her voice light, but her eyes were filled with something far deeper. Rio saw it—a vulnerability Agatha rarely let show, a tiny crack in the walls she had so carefully built around her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her heart swelling at the sight. “I think I might actually love you,” she said, the words slipping out so easily that it shocked even her. It wasn’t a declaration made out of impulse—it was the truth, simple and undeniable. It was the same truth Agatha must have been feeling too, even if it hadn’t been said aloud yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her eyes searching Rio’s face for any hint of uncertainty. But all she found was warmth, sincerity, and a depth of emotion that made her pulse quicken. She had heard the words, and the realization settled in her chest, making everything feel right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned in, closing the distance, her lips meeting Rio’s again, this time with more urgency. This kiss wasn’t tentative, nor was it slow; it was an affirmation. Agatha’s hands slid into Rio’s hair, holding her there as their lips parted only to reconnect in a more heated, hungry kiss. Their bodies pressed against one another as if they couldn’t get close enough. Agatha felt like she could lose herself in Rio’s arms forever, and she never wanted to find her way out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled away, both breathless, their faces flushed, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, her hands still tracing the familiar line of Rio’s jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I might love you, too,” Agatha whispered, her voice a mixture of disbelief and wonder. She hadn’t meant to say it out loud—it had just slipped out. But once it was spoken, once it hung in the air between them, it felt like the only truth that mattered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart surged. She brushed her lips against Agatha’s temple, a soft, contented sigh escaping her as she pulled her in closer, not wanting to let go. “You don’t have to say it back, you know,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with emotion. “I just… I want you to know I mean it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, the joy in her chest too much to contain. She squeezed Rio tighter, a deep sense of peace washing over her. “I think I know,” she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a long moment, they just stood there in the kitchen, holding each other, savoring the comfort of this new chapter in their lives. The rest of the world seemed so far away, like it didn’t matter right now. All that mattered was them—together, in this moment. And for Agatha, it was everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio pulled back slightly, her hands still resting on Agatha’s waist, reluctant to break the closeness between them. “I’m serious about this breakfast,” Rio said, her voice low, teasing. “You’ve got to try my eggs. They’re probably the best thing you’ll ever taste in your life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled softly, her fingers tracing the curve of Rio’s shoulder. “I’m not sure it can top your kisses, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, pulling Agatha back into her arms. “You’ll never know until you try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, their laughter filled the kitchen, a sound so light and carefree that it felt like the beginning of something beautiful—something neither of them had expected but both were now ready to embrace fully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were, finally, exactly where they were meant to be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning passed in a haze of bliss. Every kiss, every touch felt like the first, like a delicious discovery, and Agatha couldn’t get enough of Rio. The hours blended together in a carefree rhythm, with Rio’s laughter filling the air every time Agatha stole a kiss or pressed her body closer. They moved from the kitchen counter to the couch to the dining room table—each surface somehow more thrilling than the last. There was no hesitation, no self-consciousness. It was just them, lost in the moment, in each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until the clock ticked past noon that the reality of the world outside their little bubble began to creep in. Rio stretched, a contented sigh escaping her lips as she propped herself up on one elbow beside Agatha. She reached for the blanket that had fallen to the floor in the chaos of their afternoon, pulling it back up over them as she watched Agatha’s sleepy smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could get used to this,” Agatha murmured, her fingers tracing absent patterns on Rio’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Rio replied, her voice soft, but there was a sudden tension in her expression, a shift Agatha noticed immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asked, her fingers pausing. She looked up to meet Rio’s eyes, her gaze searching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated for a moment, the warmth of the moment still surrounding them, but she knew she had to be honest. “I hate to break this up,” she started, her voice gentle but firm, “but I need to head out soon. I’m meeting the band and our manager in a couple of hours to discuss logistics for the tour. We’re getting close to finalizing everything, and there’s a lot to work out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the tiniest pang of disappointment in her chest. She hadn’t even thought about the outside world yet, too wrapped up in the closeness they’d built. But she quickly shook it off, not wanting to let her emotions show too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course,” she said, her smile softening, though there was a bittersweet note in her voice. “I didn’t realize you had a tour coming up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, brushing a stray piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “Yeah, it’s going to be a whirlwind. We’re trying to make sure we have everything in place before we hit the road. I’ll be gone for a little while, but I’ll make sure to call and check in. And you can always come meet me somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, though a quiet sadness lingered in her chest. She hated the idea of Rio being away for so long, even if she understood that it was part of Rio’s life. “Yeah. I understand,” she said, her voice steady. “You have a job to do, after all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward and kissed Agatha’s forehead gently, her lips lingering there for a moment. “I’m really glad you understand,” she said quietly, her voice full of affection. “I’ve been thinking about this… about us. And I don’t want you to think this is just another casual thing. I want you in my life, even when I’m on the road. I just… I don’t want to leave things unsaid, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart swell at the words. Her own fears and insecurities about Rio’s lifestyle seemed to melt away for a moment. “I want you in my life too,” she said, her voice soft but certain. “I might not always know what to do with all these feelings, but I know I want to be with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened, and she smiled, a smile that made Agatha’s heart skip. “I’m glad. I can’t wait to see where this goes, even if I have to be away sometimes. I’ll always make time for us, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, feeling the weight of the truth in Rio’s words. “I’ll be here when you’re not touring,” she said, her voice warm, though her smile was tinged with sadness. “I’ll be waiting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached down to kiss her one last time, a kiss filled with both longing and a promise of more to come. “I’m going to miss you,” she whispered against Agatha’s lips before pulling back. “But we’ll have time when I’m home, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, holding her gaze for a long moment before she let go, sitting up and stretching her arms over her head. “Okay,” she said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, standing up and reaching for her clothes. “I’ll make sure we stay in touch. And it’s not like it’s right away. We still have some time before it all starts. Now, I really should get going if I want to make it there on time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed her to the door, giving her one last lingering kiss before she stepped outside, their fingertips brushing as they said goodbye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment Rio walked into the meeting room, Alice noticed it immediately—something was different. Rio was radiating an energy that was impossible to ignore. There was a lightness to her step, a softness in her smile that was so unlike her usual confident, no-nonsense demeanor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice raised an eyebrow, her voice teasing. “Well, well, well. Look who’s walking in like she’s got something to smile about. Spill it, Rio. What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a split second, then forced a casual smile. She tried to play it off, but there was no mistaking it. “Nothing’s going on,” she said with a shrug, though her face was already flushed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really?” Alice smirked, leaning forward in her chair. “You’re glowing, and we all know you don’t glow for nothing. Is it Agatha? Did she rock your world more than usual?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The mention of Agatha’s name was enough to make Rio blush harder, but she couldn’t help the smile that spread across her face. “Fine, fine. You caught me,” she admitted, dropping the act. “Yeah, it’s Agatha. We’re… doing this for real. Really giving it a go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The reaction from the band was immediate. Jennifer Kale gave her a wide grin, while Natasha raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. Alice leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, a playful grin on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so, we already knew you two have been up to something,” Alice teased. “We were just waiting for you to admit it. You’ve been acting all different lately, and you keep looking like you’re in some kind of love daze, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop the grin that tugged at her lips. “You guys are terrible,” she muttered, though there was no malice behind it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, you’re officially in love then?” Natasha chimed in, a smile tugging at her lips as she leaned forward, clearly enjoying this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio answered, her voice softer now, almost shy. “We said it to each other. We said ‘I love you.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room went quiet for a moment, and Rio could feel the heat rise in her face. She hadn’t expected to say those words out loud, but now that she had, it felt right. It felt like a relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn,” Alice said with a soft whistle, her tone a mix of admiration and teasing. “Look at you, Rio Vidal. Who would’ve thought you’d be the one getting all romantic on us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer nodded in agreement. “I’ve gotta say, it’s a little weird, but in the best way possible. You two definitely make sense together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her chest swelling with affection for Agatha. “Yeah, it’s… it’s definitely different. But it’s good. I feel good about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The teasing continued for a little while longer, but Rio couldn’t help the warmth in her chest, the feeling of being surrounded by people who understood. They might tease her, but they weren’t judging her. They weren’t making her feel embarrassed for falling for Agatha, for wanting to be with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, given that you’ve gone all soft on us,” Natasha said after a beat, “when do we get to see Agatha again, now as your better half?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes again but laughed. “I’m not that soft,” she protested, but it was clear the band was having a blast. “I’ll see what I can do. But don’t get your hopes up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Alice said, rolling her eyes. “We’ll see if you keep up this ‘I’m so in love I can’t stop smiling’ routine when we get to tour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just grinned. “Maybe I’ll bring her around at some point. But let’s not make it a thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sure,” Jennifer said, smiling. “We can’t wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the rest of the meeting, the band made light of the situation, but Rio couldn’t help feeling a little giddy. She hadn’t expected to say “I love you” to Agatha so soon, but once she had, it felt like the words had been waiting to come out. And hearing the support from her bandmates—it made her realize just how lucky she was. She was falling for someone who saw her, who loved her, flaws and all. And now, she had to figure out how to balance that with the whirlwind of her career and her life on the road.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, all she could think about was Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat at the piano in her studio, tapping the keys absently as she hummed the melody that had been chasing her for days. The lyrics to </span>
<em>
<span>The Space Between Notes</span>
</em>
<span> were etched into her mind, but the chorus still clung stubbornly to the edge of something unfinished. It needed more—more depth, more ache, more of that electric tension she felt every time Agatha looked at her like she was something unexpected and dangerous. The push and pull between control and chaos, between Agatha’s carefully arranged world and Rio’s wild, impulsive one—that was what she needed to find in the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She played the same chords again and again, trying to layer them with the right intensity, to catch the emotion teetering just beneath the surface. Every time she thought about Agatha, the contrast between them—Agatha’s polish and precision colliding with Rio’s mess of instincts—kept rising up in her chest. Her fingers hovered above the keys, twitching like they were ready to pour out everything she hadn’t yet dared to say. But the right words were still out of reach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night, after a long day of rehearsals, Rio went home exhausted but wired. She hadn’t eaten much, too consumed by the song and the looming deadline. She grabbed her guitar and a worn notebook, settling on the couch as the city’s hum echoed faintly through the windows. She strummed softly, her thoughts drifting to Agatha—the way she had slowly, cautiously begun to open up, like a flower unsure whether to bloom. It hadn’t just been kisses. It had been everything between them: the hesitation, the hunger, the quiet trust that neither of them quite knew how to name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The chorus came to her like a breath: </span>
<em>
<span>I’m the reason you’re letting go tonight</span>
</em>
<span>. And just like that, it felt right. It wasn’t just a lyric; it was a confession. She wasn’t writing about a song anymore—she was writing to Agatha. About them. About the way love had found them in the cracks of their defenses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next day in the studio, the band was prepping for the tour, but Rio couldn’t stop humming the new melody under her breath, tapping the rhythm against her thigh. Alice caught the sound and raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re still on that song?” she asked, tuning her guitar.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, not bothering to hide the preoccupation on her face. “It’s not done yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer gave her a sly look. “It’s the one, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer, but the way her lips curved gave her away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Alice said, her voice full of teasing curiosity, “who’s it for?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes dropped to the floor, a flush creeping into her cheeks. She sighed and pushed a hand through her hair. “It’s… personal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned back in her chair, pulse fluttering like she’d just said too much. But Agatha’s face wouldn’t leave her mind—the sharp wit, the hidden warmth, the way she looked at Rio like she might be dangerous in the best way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just someone who’s changed everything,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice let out a knowing grin. “So. It’s for Agatha.. You’re so in love it’s disgusting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, but the smile tugging at her mouth betrayed her. “You guys are impossible. I’m not—” She hesitated. Then exhaled. “Okay, fine. Yeah, I am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their laughter filled the studio, but Rio was already thinking about the track again, about how much of herself she’d poured into this song.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On Thursday, she arrived at the studio early. The band had the day off, and Rio relished the solitude. No distractions—just her, the mic, and the song. She ran through the chords, adjusting the tempo, shifting lyrics, chasing that perfect blend of vulnerability and fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first few takes fell flat, the emotion not quite landing. But then she thought of Agatha again—how she’d looked that night after their last kiss, soft and real in a way Rio hadn’t expected. That image struck something deep. When she sang the next take, the sound that came out of her felt like magic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hit the final note and sat in the silence that followed, letting out a shaky breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. That was it. It was raw. It was honest. It was everything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night, lying in bed with the finished track playing quietly in the background, Rio stared at the ceiling, her heart thudding slow and full. Relief washed over her, but it wasn’t just about finishing the song—it was about what it meant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought of Agatha’s reaction when she’d hear it, of how far they’d both come. The way Agatha had let herself bend, the way Rio had let herself feel. And in that moment, Rio understood something she hadn’t before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The song wasn’t just about letting go of control.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was about loving someone enough to let the chaos in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The auditorium was dimly lit when Rio arrived, the warm glow from the stage lights casting long shadows across the empty seats. A few students were still lingering, packing up their instruments, but Rio only had eyes for one person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood near the stage, flipping through sheet music with that same intense focus that made Rio want to both admire and thoroughly distract her. She had her reading glasses on—</span>
<em>
<span>Jesus Christ</span>
</em>
<span>—and her hair was loosely pinned up, like she’d shoved it out of the way in frustration hours ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like every time Rio saw her, she felt that familiar pull.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really know how to make a place feel dramatic, huh?” Rio teased as she made her way down the aisle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up, and the small, knowing smile she gave Rio nearly knocked the air out of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Says the woman who sells out arenas for a living,” Agatha retorted, setting the sheet music down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Touché. But I was thinking more about this moody lighting, the half-empty stage… it’s got that ‘haunted genius at work’ vibe. You should have a tragic backstory to match.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Should I?” Agatha arched an eyebrow, clearly amused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned on the edge of the stage. “I mean, don’t you? You’re a world-famous pianist with a tragic love life and a habit of working yourself into the ground.” She smirked. “You’re like one emotional breakdown away from becoming a tortured artist cliché.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head. “I’ll have you know, my love life is looking much less tragic these days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk faltered just slightly, replaced by something softer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” she asked, voice quieter now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her gaze for a long moment before giving a small shrug. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio wanted to kiss her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could say anything else, Mia’s voice rang out from across the stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned just in time to see her daughter emerging from backstage, hoodie slung over her shoulder, looking surprised but not upset to see her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, kid,” Rio said, schooling her expression into something a little less I desperately want to kiss your teacher right now. “You done for the night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Agatha wanted me to run through one more piece before I left.” Mia crossed her arms, giving Rio a knowing once-over. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just checking in, I haven’t seen you all day.” Rio said easily. “Just wanted to make sure you and Agatha aren’t secretly plotting my downfall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not tonight,” Mia deadpanned. “You’re safe for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know.” Rio stole a glance at Agatha, who was watching the interaction with quiet amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You heading home?” Rio asked Mia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In a bit. Gonna meet up with Will first. Is that okay?” Mia was already pulling out her phone, barely paying attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, sweetie,” Rio said, “Text me when you get home, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia hummed in acknowledgment, clearly distracted. Rio sighed, shaking her head. Teenagers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Mia walked off, Rio turned back to Agatha, stuffing her hands in her pockets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You work too hard, you know that?” she said, tilting her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “So I’ve been told. Mostly by a certain rockstar who conveniently forgets she’s just as bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a laugh, rocking back on her heels. “Okay, fair. But at least I have the good sense to take a break when I need one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you?” Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Because last I checked, you were running on caffeine and sheer determination trying to get your album finished.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, Ms. Harkness, point taken.” Rio held up her hands in surrender. “How much longer are you staying?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just need to finish up here, then I’m heading home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated for half a second, then said, “Then let me help. At least keep you company while you finish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a long, considering look, something unreadable passing over her face. Then, finally, she smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” she said, amusement dancing in her eyes. “But no distractions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, shifting a little closer. “No promises.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the way Agatha’s lips twitched—like she knew Rio was absolutely going to be a distraction—made Rio want to push her luck just a little more. But instead, she simply leaned against the piano, watching Agatha work, already counting down the minutes until she could have her to herself again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive over had been easy—comfortable in the way things had settled between them. Rio followed Agatha’s car through the streets of LA, resisting the urge to press too hard on the gas just to close the distance between them. The whole taking-separate-cars thing was necessary, but that didn’t mean she had to like it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled into the small strip mall where the Thai place was tucked away, Rio took a quick, careful scan of the area. The place wasn’t exactly a hotspot, but that didn’t mean she could let her guard down. Fame had a way of creeping up in unexpected places.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So before she even stepped out of the car, she checked her surroundings—the few patrons inside, the empty sidewalk, the parked cars nearby. No signs of paparazzi. No lingering fans with their phones out. Still, she adjusted her hoodie just a bit before stepping out, keeping her posture loose but alert.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was already waiting for her by the entrance, hands in the pockets of her coat. When she met Rio’s gaze, she gave her a small, warm smile—one that made Rio momentarily forget all about caution and carefully curated distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This place is a hidden gem,” Agatha said as they walked inside, the warm scent of spices and herbs wrapping around them. “Wanda and I used to come here all the time before Nicky was born.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I’m trusting you with my dinner,” Rio said. “You pick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in consideration, stepping up to the counter while Rio kept her back angled toward the entrance. She wasn’t about to take any chances. She was being careful—watching for cameras, for anyone that might recognize her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she was doing a good job keeping things professional. She was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Until Agatha glanced at her through those damn glasses and asked, “You okay with spice, or are you a baby about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Excuse you? I can handle spice just fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curled into the slightest smirk. “Mm. We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, Rio lost every ounce of patience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re playing a dangerous game, Harkness,” she murmured, stepping just close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of her presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her, but Rio saw the tiny shift in her posture—the way she inhaled a fraction deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I?” Agatha asked, still scanning the menu like she wasn’t trying to kill Rio on the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Rio breathed, keeping her voice low, intimate. “And I don’t think you’re ready for the consequences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made the smallest noise, barely audible, but Rio felt it—felt it in the way Agatha tensed, in the way her fingers curled just slightly at her sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then—Agatha’s expression schooled itself back into something sharp, unreadable, and she turned just enough to shoot Rio a pointed look over the rim of her glasses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Behave,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barely resisted the urge to grin. “I am behaving.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio took a half-step back, but let her fingers graze just lightly along the back of Agatha’s hand before pulling away. “I haven’t even done anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled slowly, then exhaled like she was summoning patience from the depths of her soul.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, of course, had no intention of making this easy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced herself to glance toward the restaurant windows—still clear, no one lingering too long, no phones held up suspiciously. Good. Safe. She could afford to have a little fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So while Agatha turned back to finalize their order, Rio let her fingers trace just slightly along the inside of Agatha’s wrist before pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha definitely noticed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she didn’t react—just finished paying, took the receipt, and turned back to Rio with an unreadable expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something interesting?” Rio asked, watching the way Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Emails.” Agatha didn’t look up. “You wouldn’t find them entertaining.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “You don’t know that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally looked at her. Her eyes were sharp, her expression calm—too calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Behave.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, considering. “I’ll think about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and went back to her emails, pointedly ignoring the way her ears had gone pink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, on the other hand, was having way too much fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood near the counter, waiting for their order number to be called. Agatha busied herself scrolling through her emails, but Rio saw the way her fingers hovered over the screen, not actually typing. She was distracted. Good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rocked on her heels, stuffing her hands into her hoodie pocket like she wasn’t dying to touch Agatha again. They weren’t being watched—not as far as she could tell—but she wasn’t about to take the risk. Not when they’d made it this far without anyone figuring them out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, that didn’t mean she couldn’t have a little fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio murmured, leaning in just enough that only Agatha could hear, “I can think of at least three ways I’d rather be spending this waiting time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her. “Is one of them standing quietly until our food is ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Not even close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, still staring at her phone. “I don’t even have to ask to know exactly where your mind is right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah?” Rio nudged her gently with her elbow. “Where am I, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally turned her head, giving her a flat, unimpressed look. “Not where you should be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip to keep from laughing. God, she was cute when she was trying to be stern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I remember correctly,” Rio said, “you were the one stealing kisses earlier. So who’s really at fault here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, turning back to her phone. “That was before we were in public.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “So you’re saying if we weren’t in public, you wouldn’t be able to resist me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a slow, measured breath, her fingers tightening around her phone again. “I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, dear?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, as if summoning patience from the depths of the universe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but grin. “You’re adorable when you’re trying not to murder me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could respond, the cashier called out their order number. Agatha immediately stepped forward, grabbing the bags like they were a lifeline. Rio trailed after her, stuffing her hands back into her hoodie as they walked toward the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible,” Agatha muttered as she pushed it open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look over her glasses, then shook her head as she walked toward her car. “Drive safe, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you at home, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused at her car door, just for a second. And then, before she got in, she finally let a small smile break through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt it in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she got into her own car, watching Agatha pull out first, she grinned to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, she was so gone for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as they stepped inside, Agatha set the bags of Thai food on the counter, shrugging off her coat. Rio did the same, rolling her shoulders with a sigh, finally relaxing now that they were home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Nicky, by the way?” Rio asked as she leaned against the counter. “I didn’t see him at the auditorium, and he’s not here either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her, tucking her hair behind her ear. “He’s at a friend’s sleepover birthday party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s head tilted slightly, processing the words. Then, slowly, a grin spread across her face. “So you’re telling me we have the place to ourselves?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely gave Agatha a chance to confirm before she was on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio surged forward, cupping Agatha’s face as she kissed her like she’d been starving for it. Because she had. All day—hell, all week—she had wanted this. Wanted her. And now, with no distractions, no responsibilities, no one else around—she wasn’t holding back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made a soft noise of surprise, but she melted into Rio in an instant. Her hands found Rio’s waist, pulling her in just as hungrily. The kiss deepened, all heat and need, a collision of want that left them breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked them backward until Agatha’s back hit the counter, not breaking the kiss, not slowing down. She nipped at Agatha’s lower lip, swallowed the quiet gasp it pulled from her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” Rio murmured against her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers tightened on her hips. “You’ve been with me for the past two hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back just enough to look at her—really look at her. Agatha’s lips were already swollen, her breath slightly uneven. And God, the way she was looking at her now—like she felt it too, like the ache of being apart for even a moment had been just as sharp for her—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat went dry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, her expression softening. Then, with a small, knowing smile, she threaded her fingers through Rio’s hair and pulled her back in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The food could wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Heat curled between them like a living thing, impossible to contain. Agatha’s hands were in Rio’s hair, nails scratching lightly against her scalp as she pulled her in, deepening the kiss. Rio groaned, her fingers digging into Agatha’s thighs where they were wrapped around her. She pressed closer, rolling her hips just enough to make Agatha gasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha breathed against her lips, a mix of need and warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t one to disobey warnings, but when it came to Agatha, all bets were off. She dragged her mouth down the elegant line of Agatha’s throat, savoring the little hitch in her breath. “Tell me to stop,” she murmured, voice husky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuddered. “I won’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was all Rio needed before she was lifting Agatha off the counter and carrying her toward the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, much later, they sat together in the living room, sated, wrapped in the glow of dim lighting and the warmth of each other. The Thai food had gone untouched for far too long, but neither of them cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat with her back against the couch, legs stretched out, one arm resting over the cushions where Agatha leaned against her. Agatha’s sweater was loose on one shoulder, her hair a mess, and Rio couldn’t stop looking at her, at the way she looked soft like this—content, at peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staring,” Agatha murmured, taking a sip of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Can you blame me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed a laugh, shaking her head as she picked up a piece of crispy spring roll and took a bite. She chewed, swallowed, then turned her head just enough to meet Rio’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha said slowly, “are you planning to actually eat dinner or just keep looking at me all night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for a dumpling and popped it into her mouth, chewing as she eyed Agatha playfully. “Happy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Very.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, leaning in to press a lingering kiss to her bare shoulder. “Good. Now, tell me—what’s the real reason you invited me over tonight? Was it the food? The company? Or were you hoping I’d sweep you off your feet and carry you to bed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t quite hide the way her lips curved. “A little of all three, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, reaching for her wine glass. “You really know how to make a girl feel special, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back against the couch, lazily swirling the wine in her glass as she studied Rio. “So,” she started, casual but curious, “what’s this mysterious new song you’ve been obsessing over all week?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, stretching her arms over her head before letting one settle around Agatha’s shoulders. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a dry look. “Obviously. That’s why I asked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leaning in to brush her lips against Agatha’s temple before whispering, “You’ll hear it soon enough. Hopefully at our first show at the Staples Arena.” She pulled back just enough to see Agatha’s reaction, her smirk widening when she saw the flicker of interest in those sharp blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going, right? Bringing Nicky too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, taking a slow sip of wine as if to pretend she wasn’t just slightly thrown by the casual expectation in Rio’s voice. “That depends. Are you planning to put me under the spotlight again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, tilting her head. “You’ll have to wait and see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, setting her glass down with a dramatic air. “Why do I put up with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, nuzzling against her shoulder. “Because you love me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out an exaggerated sigh, shaking her head as if in deep contemplation. “I have absolutely no idea why I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, pressing a dramatic hand to her chest. “Wow. Wounded. Right through the heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, sipping her wine leisurely. “I mean, you’re a menace. You never give me a straight answer. You make my life unnecessarily complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, inching closer. “And yet…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes playfully, her smirk growing as she leaned in. “And yet, I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t think she had ever been happier in her life. She took Agatha’s glass from her hands, setting it aside before pulling her into a slow, lingering kiss. Their banter, their rhythm, the warmth between them—it was all so effortless, so natural.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled back, resting her forehead against Agatha’s, she murmured, “Good. Because I have no idea why you love me either, but I’m really glad you do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Mia stood outside the practice room, glancing down at her phone. She’d been waiting for Agatha to finish whatever she was doing in there so they could start rehearsing, and the music was starting to mess with her focus. The closer it got to the recital, the more nervous she became, as Agatha wanted her to do a solo performance. Just thinking about it made her chest ache and her anxiety kick up a notch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was about to give up and maybe get some tea or something, when she heard Agatha’s voice. It wasn’t loud or demanding—just soft and familiar. Mia knew Agatha well enough by now to recognize when she was talking to someone she trusted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What Mia didn’t expect, though, was the light laughter that followed. It was warm and intimate, and for some reason, it made her stomach churn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped closer to the door, and her instincts screamed at her to stop, but curiosity pushed her forward. She needed to know who was in there with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she got closer, she overheard Agatha say, “I’m glad you’re here.” Her voice was warm, almost affectionate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t stay away,” came a voice Mia recognized instantly—Rio’s. It sounded like Rio, but softer, like she was saying something important. Something more than what Mia had ever heard from her. Curiosity won out and she looked through the small glass on the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was sitting on the piano bench while her mother stood in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia froze, her heart racing when she saw her mother take a step forward, standing in between her teacher’s legs, as Agatha’s hands immediately landed on her hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” Rio’s voice was quieter now, serious. “You know how much I care about you, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s heart dropped. This wasn’t what she’d expected at all. She knew her mom and Agatha had gotten closer over the past few months, but this? This was different.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s response was low, almost too soft to hear. “I know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, as if to answer her own question, Rio added, “I don’t want you to think I’m just going to leave, like everyone else. I’m in this. I’m staying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, standing up, before wrapping her arms around her mom’s waist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then they kissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On the lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s hand flew to her mouth, but she quickly pulled it away. She couldn’t be hearing this. Her mind couldn’t make sense of it. Agatha and her mom… they were together? Had they been for how long? How had she not known?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d seen the notes on the counter before—notes scribbled with lyrics, always in Rio’s handwriting. She’d seen the way they’d look at each other, but she never wanted to believe it. Not this. She thought they were just friends. Hell, she hadn’t even known Agatha was into women.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had always thought Agatha was her rock. Agatha was steady, reliable. Everything Mia wanted her to be when the rest of her life had been chaos. But now… now it felt like that safe, solid place was crumbling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest tightened. Why didn’t anyone tell her? She felt like something was being taken from her—like her one piece of stability, the one part of her life that hadn’t been tainted by Rio Vidal’s chaotic world, was slipping away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia stood frozen in the hallway outside the practice room, her eyes locked onto the floor as Agatha’s laughter echoed through the walls. It was the kind of laughter that made her stomach twist, not because it was forced or awkward, but because it sounded… happy. Too happy. Familiar. It didn’t sound like Agatha’s usual warmth with her students or the casual, friendly tone she sometimes used with her. It sounded… intimate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia’s breath caught in her throat, and her heart felt like it had dropped to her stomach. This wasn’t what she thought. This wasn’t what she expected at all. The pieces clicked together in a way she wasn’t ready for, and all at once, she felt like the floor had been ripped out from under her. The connection Agatha and Rio shared was something more than she’d ever imagined. They weren’t just friends. They were something… deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now that she thought about it…how much they had been hanging out lately, how often her mother came to rehearsal, to Sonata Grove. At first, she’d thought it was because of Nicky, because her mom was fond of the kid, but now…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>God, she was such an idiot!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The revelation stung like a slap to the face. Agatha, the one person Mia had come to rely on as the rock in her chaotic world, was now tangled up with the one person who’d always been unpredictable. Her mind raced, overwhelmed with a wave of emotions. Confusion, betrayal, and worst of all, a deep, aching fear that she was being replaced in a way she couldn’t quite explain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped back, trying to get away from the door, but in her panic, her foot caught on the leg of a chair that had been left in the hall. The chair scraped loudly across the floor, and Mia’s heart leapt into her throat as she instinctively flattened herself against the wall, hoping to disappear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, the silence was suffocating. Had they heard her? Were they coming out here to confront her? Her breath came faster as she fought the urge to bolt, to run away and hide from the overwhelming reality she’d just uncovered. She had no idea how to process it. She couldn’t process it. Her mind screamed for escape, but her body stayed frozen, waiting for the inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you hear that?” Agatha’s voice drifted out from the room, breaking the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia held her breath, praying that Agatha would just ignore it and go back inside. She didn’t want to be found. Not like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long, painful silence, Agatha came to the door and Mia held her breath as it swung open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had no choice. She couldn’t hide forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Mia pushed herself off the wall and turned toward the corner, stepping forward into the hall. Her heart hammered in her chest, her throat tight as she looked up at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um… hi. I’m, uh… I’m not feeling all that great,” Mia lied quickly, her voice sounding more uncertain than she intended. She hadn’t planned to say it, but the words just tumbled out of her mouth as she tried to make her escape. “I think I’m just going to go home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her for a long moment, concern flashing across her face. Mia couldn’t meet her gaze; instead, she kept her focus on the floor, avoiding the questions she knew were coming. She felt her pulse racing with anxiety, her chest tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Mia,” Agatha said gently, her voice filled with worry. “You’re sure you’re okay? You don’t have to stay if you don’t feel well. I can—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Mia cut her off, forcing a small, tight smile onto her face, though it felt like a mask she couldn’t hold up. “I just… I think I need some space, that’s all. I’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to hesitate, clearly unsure of what to say. Finally, she nodded, though her expression still held concern. “Okay. If you’re sure. You know I’m here if you need me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia just nodded, not trusting herself to say anything else. She turned quickly, before Agatha could say more, and hurried to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia sat silently in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the cool glass of the car window. She didn’t want to look at her mom, didn’t want to have to deal with the mess inside her head. It was too much—too much to process, too much to feel. The overwhelming ache of being left out, the sting of seeing Agatha and Rio together—it all swirled inside her like a storm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a shallow breath, hoping Rio wouldn’t notice how hard her heart was pounding. Maybe if she pretended to be tired enough, she could escape this night without saying anything, without having to face the fact that everything had shifted in the worst way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re sure you’re okay, Mia? Agatha said you weren’t feeling well.” Rio’s voice, soft and full of concern, cut through the silence. “Do you need to go see a doctor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia kept her gaze fixed on the street lights flickering past them, the blur of yellow and white offering no comfort. “No, it’s okay,” she muttered, her throat tight. “Just tired. A little worn out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated before responding. “You’ve been pushing yourself lately, huh? Maybe you just need to rest. You’re going to rock this recital, baby, you’ll see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t answer. She couldn’t find the words. Maybe her mom would drop it, maybe not. Either way, it didn’t matter. She needed to get out of this car, away from Rio’s care, away from this situation that felt suffocating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled into their driveway, the sound of the engine shutting off seemed to amplify the tension between them. Mia didn’t wait for Rio to speak. She unbuckled her seatbelt, ready to escape the silence before it swallowed her whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Mia,” Rio’s voice stopped her as she reached for the door handle. “Are you sure you’re okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia turned to face her mom, unable to hold it in any longer. She felt the anger and hurt rising in her chest like a tidal wave. “I’m fine,” she snapped, her voice shaky as she struggled to keep her composure. “I just want to go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened with concern, but Mia couldn’t stand it. She couldn’t stand the pity in her mom’s eyes. “Mia, talk to me. What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words were out before Mia could stop them. “You and Agatha. That’s what’s going on. I saw you at school. I don’t like it. I don’t like seeing you with her. It’s messing everything up. She’s my teacher, Mom. </span>
<em>
<span>My teacher</span>
</em>
<span>. Not someone you should be—” Mia swallowed, her breath catching. “Not like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was quiet for a moment, the hurt in Mia’s voice clearly hitting her hard. “Mia, I didn’t mean to make you feel like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia shook her head, her voice trembling. “I don’t care if you didn’t mean to. It just feels like you’re taking over everything. She was my safe place, Mom. Sonata Grove was </span>
<em>
<span>mine</span>
</em>
<span>, and now you’re just taking that too. That’s </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> world. I don’t want that. I don’t want to share her with you. Or the school. You already have Nicky hanging onto everything you say!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand reached for her, but Mia flinched away, not ready to be touched, not ready to hear Rio’s reassurance. “Mia, listen to me,” Rio said, her voice softer now, but still full of concern. “I’m not trying to take anything from you. You’re not losing your safe place, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia looked away, her eyes burning with unshed tears. “You’re not even here, Mom. You’re always so busy. You’ve been so focused on everything else, and now there’s her. She’s… she’s taking up all your attention. It’s like I don’t even matter anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand hovered in the air for a moment, unsure, before she gently placed it on Mia’s arm. “I’m sorry, Mia,” she said, her voice low and sincere. “I didn’t realize how much this was hurting you. I love you, you know that, right? You’ll always be my first priority.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Mia couldn’t shake the feeling of being left behind, of watching Rio drift away from her. She pulled her arm back, feeling the weight of everything crash down on her. “I don’t know how to fix this,” Mia muttered, her voice thick with emotion. “I don’t know how to feel about all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, neither of them spoke. Mia’s heart ached, a gnawing pain that made her want to curl up and disappear. She wasn’t sure what to do with all of these feelings, how to make sense of them, or if they’d even ever go away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio spoke, her voice gentle but full of resolve. “I can’t undo what’s happened, Mia. But I can promise you, nothing will change between us. You’ll always be my priority, and nothing—not even her—will take that from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia bit her lip, trying to hold back the flood of tears threatening to spill. She nodded, though she didn’t fully believe it. Maybe she would, one day, but right now, it didn’t feel like that was possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed her shoulder before she spoke again, quieter this time. “When you’re ready to talk, I’m here. I’m always here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mia didn’t reply. She simply turned away, heading into the house without another word. The weight of everything felt suffocating, but she didn’t have the strength to fight it anymore.</span>
