<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness had never experienced a typical adolescence. Her life was marked by turmoil: a father who betrayed her mother and abandoned their family when she was just a child, and a mother, Evanora, who arranged for her to marry far too young. </p><p> </p><p>At twenty, Evanora married Agatha off to the first man she found, <em>Ralph O’Connor</em>. But Agatha never loved him.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she turned thirty, Agatha had done everything in her power to avoid pregnancy. Yet, despite her efforts, she gave birth to a daughter, Nicole. The moment Nicole was born, Agatha was struck by the baby’s appearance. She didn’t resemble either of her parents.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole was hauntingly beautiful. Her features were delicate and well-defined, arched brows, sharp cheekbones, a petite nose, and piercing eyes that seemed to hold far more depth than a child her age should possess. Her dark, wavy hair framed a porcelain complexion, lending her an ethereal, almost otherworldly presence. </p><p>Evanora wasted no time accusing her daughter of infidelity, but a DNA test confirmed Ralph was the father with 70% certainty. The remaining 60% was attributed to a lab error, a common anomaly, they assured her. Still, Agatha couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that Nicole’s existence had something to do with her own subconscious longing to never have children with Ralph.</p><p> </p><p>A decade later, despite her wishes, Agatha became pregnant again. Her second child, Nicholas, didn’t resemble Ralph much either. Instead, he shared many of Agatha’s traits and looked strikingly similar to his sister, Nicole.</p><p> </p><p>Though her marriage was loveless, Agatha found happiness in her two children. However, her resentment toward Ralph never faded. She couldn’t stop wishing he would simply vanish. One day, he did. Ralph disappeared without a trace. For six months, there was no word, no evidence, no sign of his existence. The police were on the verge of declaring him dead.</p><p> </p><p>Late one night, as the clock passed midnight, Agatha sat in her living room with her closest friends, Wanda, Jen, Alice, and Lilia. Her children were asleep upstairs while the women shared laughter and glasses of wine.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda, a history professor with a penchant for the occult, pulled a book of witchcraft from her bag. Alongside it, she placed a Ouija board.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s find Ralph,” Wanda suggested with a mischievous grin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned. “I don’t want him back, Wanda. I’m fine with him gone.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just for fun,” Wanda teased. “And you’re the only one who can pronounce the Latin spells correctly.”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha muttered the words Wanda pointed to in the book. Silence followed.</p><p> </p><p>“See? Nothing happened,” Agatha said flatly, standing up. “This is ridiculous.”</p><p> </p><p>Frustrated, she excused herself to the bathroom. Inside, she splashed water on her face, trying to clear her head. But as she looked up, she froze.</p><p>In the mirror stood a woman who didn’t belong there. Her dark hair cascaded in effortless waves, her almond-shaped eyes glimmered with mischief, and her sharp, angular features held an air of danger. She wore a dark red lipstick that highlighted her smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stumbled back, her scream echoing in the small bathroom. She turned, and collided with someone standing behind her.</p><p> </p><p>The woman from the mirror was there, smirking at her. “I imagined you’d scream, but not like that, sweetheart,” the woman said, her tone amused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “Who the <em>fuck</em> are you?! How did you get into my house?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman tilted her head, her smile deepening. “You invited me in, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>"I'll call the police," Agatha said, gripping the doorknob. But the door wouldn’t budge.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s useless,” the woman replied, her tone sweet and mocking. “They can’t see me, my love. Only you can. You’re the only one who can see me.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell are you talking about?! Get out of my house!” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“You summoned me here.” The woman’s lips curved into a sly smile as she recited in a low, melodic tone: “‘<em>Mortem vocasti; hic sum.’</em> “I must say, your Latin pronunciation is, ” she kissed her fingertip “simply exquisite.”</p><p> </p><p>“That was just a game!”</p><p> </p><p>“I know... It’s always a game. Until it isn’t. In centuries, you’re the first to pronounce it correctly. Where did you learn?”</p><p> </p><p>“At university,” Agatha answered hesitantly, still pressing against the locked door.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm...” The woman tilted her head. “I believe in past lives, darling. Do you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe you need to leave.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that simple.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’ll banish you!”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that simple,” the woman repeated with an almost pitying smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Then how—” Agatha’s voice faltered as the woman’s smirk deepened.</p><p> </p><p>“You really don’t remember me, do you, Ag?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ag? No one calls me Ag...” Agatha paused, and then, as if a veil lifted in her mind, a memory surfaced.</p><p> </p><p>A dream, long forgotten but now so vivid it made her knees weak. A beautiful woman with that same face, dressed in white, standing beside her. The woman had called her Ag, and she had been furious. “It’s Agatha,” she had corrected sharply in the dream.</p><p> </p><p>“You... You appeared in my dream... fifteen years ago... But—”</p><p> </p><p>“You summoned me, my love, and I came.”</p><p> </p><p>“But I don’t know you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you do,” the woman said, stepping closer. “Just not in this life.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you—”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha! Did you fall in the damn toilet or what?” came Jen’s frantic voice, followed by rapid knocking on the bathroom door.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around toward the sound. When she turned back, the woman was gone.</p><hr/><p>Agatha unlocked the door with a frustrated tug, her heart still racing as she faced Jen, who stood with an eyebrow raised and arms crossed. Behind her, Wanda, Alice, and Lilia hovered curiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Well?” Jen demanded. “Did you fall in? Or were you having a moment with the mirror? Because your lipstick is still on point.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very funny,” Agatha snapped, stepping past her into the living room.</p><p> </p><p>Alice sniffed the air dramatically. “Hmm... the bathroom has this faint, mysterious ghostly tension. Did you summon Ralph in there?”</p><p> </p><p>“Or,” Wanda interjected, smirking, “was it something hotter than Ralph?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at them, her hands on her hips. “Yes, Ralph materialized, and I immediately threw him out the window. Any other stupid questions?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia grinned. “Oh, come on, Agatha. You’ve been in there for ages, and you come out looking like you’ve seen a ghost. Spill it!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed her wine glass from the table, taking a slow sip as she let the tension hang. “If you must know,” she finally said, her voice dripping with sass, “I saw the future in the mirror.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” Wanda leaned forward, intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s lips curled into a sly smile. “And it said that none of you will ever get a boyfriend with those horrible fashion choices.”</p><p> </p><p>The room erupted into laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she’s got jokes now!” Jen howled, nudging Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>“Bold words coming from someone who has been wearing that same cardigan since, what, 2005?” Alice teased.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, I wasn’t aware you needed instructions to recognize timeless fashion,” Agatha shot back, settling onto the couch. “Besides, let’s not forget who convinced you that bangs were a good idea.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia gasped. “Oh, burn. Someone get the salt.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up her wine glass, looking smug. “Ladies, remember: I only roast the people I care about. Consider yourselves blessed.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda raised her glass in mock salute. “To being blessed by Agatha Harkness. And her terrifying, sassy bathroom adventures.”</p><p> </p><p>They all clinked glasses, the tension easing into laughter. But as Agatha joined in, her mind lingered on the woman in the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Who the hell was she?</em>
</p><hr/><p>The morning light streamed through the kitchen windows as Agatha stood at the stove, flipping pancakes with one hand and clutching her coffee mug with the other. Nick sat at the table, kicking his legs and scribbling something on a piece of paper, a crayon drawing that, from the looks of it, was either a dinosaur or an oddly-shaped horse.</p><p> </p><p>“Another pancake, Mom!” he chirped, his plate already clean.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, sweetie,” Agatha muttered, her mind still clouded with thoughts of the strange woman from the night before. She told herself it had to be a hallucination, stress, wine, or Wanda’s stupid games catching up with her.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she plated the next pancake, a familiar voice sliced through her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around, the spatula clattering onto the counter with a sharp clang. Her breath caught in her throat. There she was, leaning casually against the doorway as if she belonged there, Rio. The dim kitchen light caught the sharp angles of her face, her dark hair framing her smirk, which was equal parts infuriating and unsettlingly charming.</p><p> </p><p>Nick gasped, nearly toppling off his chair. His eyes were wide, a mix of excitement and disbelief dancing across his face. “You can see her?!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's stomach twisted. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick scrambled down from his seat, crayons forgotten, his small hands gripping the edge of the counter for balance. His face was alight with excitement as he pointed to Rio. “You can see her! I thought she was just mine! Like… my secret friend!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heartbeat stuttered. Secret friend? She blinked, looking from Nick to Rio and back again, a cold dread creeping up her spine. “Your what?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick nodded eagerly, as if this were the best news he’d received all day. “Rio! She’s been my friend forever! I mean, since I can remember!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands tightened around the edge of the counter, her knuckles white. The air in the room suddenly felt too thick, too heavy. “<em>What are you talking about, Nick</em>? She hasn’t been here forever.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, she has!” he insisted, his crayon-stained fingers still pointing at Rio as though she might disappear if he stopped. “She talks to me when I’m bored, and she knows everything about dinosaurs, and she said I can call her whenever I want!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped to Rio, sharp and accusing. “You’ve been... talking to my son? For years?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio remained utterly unfazed, her smirk curling at the edges as if she found the entire situation amusing. She tapped a fingernail against the counter, her dark eyes gleaming. “He’s a very charming conversationalist, I must say. Much more pleasant than you were last night.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted into knots. Last night. The words clawed at the edges of her memory, just out of reach.</p><p> </p><p>Nick tugged at Agatha’s robe, his eyes full of innocent curiosity. “Mom, how come you can see her now? Did you do the magic, too?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took an instinctive step back, a tremor running through her hands. Magic. The word sent a shiver down her spine. “Nick, listen to me. This… person isn’t real. She’s not your friend, and she’s definitely not supposed to be here.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick frowned as if his mother had just said something completely ridiculous. “But she’s always been here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, pushing off the counter. “Oh, Agatha. Stop scaring the poor boy. You’re acting like I’m some kind of monster.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s pulse pounded in her ears. Her hands curled into fists at her sides. “You are a monster.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick let out a horrified gasp. “Mom! Don’t be mean to Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not being mean, Nick. I’m protecting you!” Agatha snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the thick air.</p><p> </p><p>Rio <em>tsked</em>, shaking her head as she leaned against the counter again, utterly at ease. “Let’s get a few things straight, darling. I didn’t ask to be here. You called me, remember? And now I’m stuck with you until we figure out why.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath came fast, her chest rising and falling in rapid succession. “I didn’t call you!” Her voice was raw, her throat tight. “I don’t even know you!”</p><p> </p><p>Nick looked up at Rio, completely unbothered by his mother’s rising panic. “You don’t remember her, Mom?”</p><p> </p><p>A sharp, ice-cold sensation slithered down Agatha’s spine. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick shrugged, his expression calm, as if he were explaining something as simple as the weather. “You used to talk to her, too. Before I was born. You just forgot.”</p><p> </p><p>The room seemed to tilt. The floor beneath Agatha’s feet felt unsteady, as though the world had suddenly become something she no longer understood.</p><p> </p><p>“Nick, what are you—”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hush,” Rio interrupted, waving a dismissive hand. “Don’t frighten her too much. She’s already teetering on the edge of a breakdown.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her fists so tightly her nails bit into her palms. “Get out of my house.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, her smile lazy and knowing. “We’ve been over this, love. It doesn’t work like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath came in sharp, shallow bursts. “Then how does it work?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped closer, her presence a force in the small kitchen. Her dark eyes met Agatha’s, something unreadable lurking beneath them. “It works like this: You figure out why you called me here. You remember why we’re connected. Until then... I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach lurched. The air crackled between them, something electric, something old.</p><p> </p><p>Nick, oblivious to the storm brewing between the two women, tugged on Rio’s sleeve. “Rio, can we play dinosaurs later?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nick!” Agatha’s voice snapped like a whip, harsher than she intended.</p><p> </p><p>Nick looked up at her, startled, confusion etched across his small face. “What? She’s my friend!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her glare back to Rio, her voice low, dangerous. “Stay away from my son.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her hands in mock surrender, her smirk never fading. “Relax, Agatha. I’m not here to hurt anyone. I’m here because you brought me here. If you have a problem with that, take it up with yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>The words sent a chill skittering down Agatha’s spine, her pulse roaring in her ears. Because deep down—somewhere buried in the part of her she had long forgotten—she feared Rio might be telling the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mom’s quite the character, isn’t she?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, the words echoing in her head. <em>She’s been here forever…</em> Agatha marched up the stairs, knocking sharply on her daughter’s door. “Nicky! You’re late for school. Let’s go!”</p><p> </p><p>A groan from inside was followed by the slow, creaking protest of the door. Nicole, Nicky, emerged, her expression one of practiced disinterest. At fifteen, she had perfected the art of looking like she wanted to disappear from existence entirely. Black nails, multiple piercings, clothes that looked like they had been stolen from a 90s grunge catalog, her aesthetic screamed rebellion, though Agatha knew better. Beneath the dark eyeliner and oversized hoodies, Nicky was responsible, smart, and, most importantly, followed Agatha’s three rules: no drugs, no criminal behavior, and definitely no teenage pregnancies.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning," Nicky mumbled, her voice flat, devoid of even the slightest effort to sound awake.</p><p> </p><p>"Not with that attitude, it's not," Agatha quipped, stepping back so her daughter could pass.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky trudged past her, dragging her feet down the hallway like the weight of existence itself was just too much. "Who were you yelling at earlier?"</p><p> </p><p>"Your <em>brother</em>," Agatha replied without hesitation, smoothing down her robe as if it could straighten out the morning's chaos. "Just one of his usual... things. Now go have breakfast before you're even later."</p><p> </p><p>She followed Nicky down the stairs, bracing herself for another encounter with her unwanted guest. And, sure enough, there she was, <em>Rio</em>, perched on the kitchen counter like she owned the place, lazily eating strawberries from Agatha's fruit bowl, the very picture of ease.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. "<em>Really</em>?" she muttered under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>But before she could launch into another round of exasperated demands for Rio to leave, she noticed Nicky had stopped in the doorway, her entire body stiff. Her breath hitched, her hands curled into fists at her sides, and her wide eyes were locked on the woman lounging on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky wasn’t <em>just looking</em> at Rio. She was staring at her like she had just seen a ghost.</p><p> </p><p>"Keep moving," Agatha said, nudging her forward. "She’s no one. Just go eat your breakfast."</p><p> </p><p>But Nicky didn’t budge. She turned to her mother, her expression somewhere between shock and disbelief. "You can see her?" Nicky whispered, her voice unsteady.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned. "<em>What are you talking about now</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>"The woman. Rio," Nicky said, her voice rising, frantic now, as she pointed straight at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stalled in her chest. A creeping unease slithered up her spine. "How do you know her name?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicky didn’t answer. Instead, she dropped her backpack with a heavy thud, crouching down to unzip it with trembling fingers. Her movements were rushed, frantic, as she flipped through the pages of a worn notebook before shoving it into Agatha’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without hesitation, she turned and ran straight to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to register what was happening before Nicky threw her arms around the woman, clinging to her with a desperation that sent cold panic rushing through her veins.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re back, mama!" Nicky cried, her voice cracking. "I missed you so much!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s world tilted on its axis. Her hands tightened around the notebook as her vision blurred.</p><p> </p><p><em>Mama</em>. The word rang in her ears, foreign and impossible.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze dropped to the notebook. On the first page, a child’s drawing, two figures, <em>one in green, one in purple</em>, each holding hands with smaller versions of Nicholas and Nicky. Agatha’s brow furrowed. She didn’t recognize the taller figures, but there was no mistaking the young faces of her children in the drawing.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers flipped through the pages, breath quickening, until she reached near the end. A sharp inhale caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>There, etched in ink with remarkable detail, was a perfect sketch of Rio. Her mischievous smile, the sharp arch of her brows, the playful gleam in her eyes. Every detail was there, as if the artist had known her intimately. And beneath it, in a child's shaky handwriting:<em> I miss you, mama</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s knees went weak. Her pulse roared in her ears, drowning out everything else. She turned her gaze back to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky was still wrapped around Rio, her fingers clutching the fabric of the woman’s jacket like she was afraid she’d disappear. And for the first time since Agatha had laid eyes on Rio, the woman wasn’t smirking. Her expression had softened, her usual air of teasing arrogance replaced with something quiet. Something... <em>almost fond</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re... back..." Nicky murmured, voice muffled against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>The world tilted again. Agatha's fingers slackened on the notebook.</p><p> </p><p>"This is not..." She swayed, stomach twisting, the weight of the moment suffocating. "What the hell is happening?"</p><p> </p><p>She took a step forward, her legs barely holding her, before the room swam around her. The floor rushed up too fast.</p><p> </p><p>The last thing she heard was Nicky’s panicked voice. "<em>Mom</em>!"</p><p> </p><p>And Rio, utterly unbothered, plucking another strawberry from the bowl, her voice dripping with amusement.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh dear," she mused, popping the berry between her lips. "She took that better than I expected."</p><hr/><p>
<em>The forest was alive with the soft rustle of leaves and the chirping of birds. Sunlight filtered through the canopy, painting golden patterns on the mossy ground. Agatha leaned against the trunk of a towering oak tree, her lips curled into a rare smile as Rio twirled in the clearing.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Come on, Ag,” Rio called, her voice full of laughter. “You can’t just stand there looking grumpy. Dance with me!”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha crossed her arms, feigning annoyance. “I don’t dance.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Of course you don’t,” Rio teased, stepping closer. “You’re too busy being stoic and mysterious.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Someone has to keep you out of trouble.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio grinned, her dark eyes glimmering with mischief. “Trouble? Me? Never.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>She reached for Agatha’s hands, pulling her into the clearing. Agatha resisted for a moment before finally giving in, rolling her eyes as Rio spun her around.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“This is ridiculous,” Agatha muttered, though her smile betrayed her.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio laughed, her voice rich and warm. “Life’s too short to be serious all the time. Especially when we’re together.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha paused, her breath catching as she met Rio’s gaze. There was something magnetic about the way Rio looked at her, like she was the only person in the world.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’re annoying, y'know” Agatha said softly.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“And yet, here you are,” Rio replied, leaning in closer.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p><em>The moment hung between them, timeless and fragile, as the world</em> <em> seemed to fade away...</em></p><hr/><p>"Mom! Wake up!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, her head pounding as consciousness dragged her back into reality. Her body felt heavy, her limbs sluggish, and a dull ache throbbed behind her eyes. Slowly, she pried her eyelids open, the soft glow of the living room light blurring into focus. She was lying on the couch. Nick and Nicky hovered over her, their faces tight with worry.</p><p> </p><p>“What... what happened?” she murmured, sitting up and pressing her fingertips to her temple. The room felt slightly off-kilter, as if the world had shifted while she was unconscious.</p><p> </p><p>Nick, eyes wide with something between excitement and concern, pointed across the room. "She carried you, Mom. She’s super strong!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed his gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat languidly in one of the armchairs, one leg draped over the other, her arms resting on the chair’s sides as if she were a queen on her throne. She looked infuriatingly comfortable, utterly unbothered, lazily twirling a strand of dark hair between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's stomach twisted.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky, however, was anything but calm. She turned to Rio, voice sharp with accusation. "Since when can she see you?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely glanced up from her nails. "Since yesterday, when she called me."</p><p> </p><p>The muscles in Nicky’s jaw tightened. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. "<em>You said this couldn’t happen</em>," she hissed under her breath. "Why did it happen?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked at her, the usual playful lilt absent from her voice. "I don’t know, <em>Nicole</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Nicky flinched at the use of her full name, but she didn’t back down. "You’re supposed to know everything! You’re the—"</p><p> </p><p>"Mama!" Nick interrupted, tugging insistently on Agatha’s sleeve, pulling her focus back to him.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, rubbing her temples, her thoughts a chaotic mess. The pounding in her head grew worse. "What is going on? Who are you two whispering about?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicky hesitated, biting the inside of her cheek. "It’s... complicated."</p><p> </p><p>She exchanged a look with Rio, one that made Agatha’s stomach clench. It was the kind of look that said they knew something she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked faintly but stayed where she was, still lounging like she had all the time in the world. "She’s taking this better than expected," she murmured, more to herself than anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s patience snapped. She turned to Rio, her voice low and dangerous. "Rio... <em>who are you</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t change. If anything, she looked almost amused. "You called me, darling." She shrugged, as if that answered everything. "You should already know."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s nails dug into the fabric of the couch. "It was a joke!" she snapped, frustration boiling over. "I wasn’t serious!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk vanished. Her eyes darkened, her voice turning sharp as glass. "And do you think I’d be here if it were just a joke?" Her words cut through the room like a blade. "Do you think I wanted this? To be stuck here? With you?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha surged to her feet, her hands trembling, rage and confusion tangling in her chest. "Then why is my daughter calling you Mama? And why the hell have you been following me?"</p><p> </p><p>For the first time, something flickered in Rio’s expression, something softer. It was gone almost as soon as it appeared, but Agatha caught it. A crack in the armor.</p><p> </p><p>"I’ve been with you longer than you’ve been alive, Agatha," Rio said, her voice quieter now, but no less intense.</p><p> </p><p>The room turned suffocating. Agatha felt the words press down on her chest, thick and impossible. Her breath came out in shallow, unsteady bursts. "What does that even mean?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood, her movements slow and deliberate, like a predator that didn’t need to rush. "It means," she said, stepping toward her, "there are things about yourself, about <em>us</em>, that you’ve forgotten."</p><p> </p><p>Something cold curled around Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>"But you’re starting to remember now," Rio continued, her voice softer, more knowing. "Aren’t you?"</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, she was.</p><p> </p><p>The image hit her like a slap, flashes of a dense forest, a hand gripping hers, laughter echoing in the trees, a warmth that felt like home. It was there, just out of reach, teasing at the edges of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>She staggered back, her breath catching. "What... <em>what</em> are you?" she whispered, voice barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled into a faint smile. "That’s the right question, darling." Her eyes gleamed. "And when you’re <em>ready</em> to hear the answer, I’ll tell you."</p><p> </p>

<p>“Nicky,” Agatha said, her voice steady despite the storm brewing in her mind. Her jaw was tight, shoulders stiff with tension as she fished the car keys from the pocket of her coat. The metallic jingle was sharp in the stillness of the hallway. She held them out to her daughter with a hand that trembled just slightly. “Take your brother to school.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky blinked, her eyes widening before lighting up with excitement. The gray fog of her morning sulk evaporated in an instant. “Wait, really? I get to drive?” Her voice rose with disbelief, hope crashing into joy.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha replied, closing her eyes for a second as she pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to hold back a pounding headache and the mounting anxiety creeping up her spine. Her voice came out low and tired. “But no detours, no loud music, and—”</p><p> </p><p>“No speeding, I got it!” Nicky cut in with a wide grin, already reaching for the keys. She bounced on the balls of her feet, her hands cold as she snatched them from her mother’s grip. The keys felt heavy and thrilling in her palm. Freedom.</p><p> </p><p>Across the room, Nick looked up from the worn sneakers he was hurriedly tying, one lace already tangled. His expression brightened with mischief. “Can we stop for donuts?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha and Nicky said in unison, Nicky shooting her brother a quick glance and a half-smile, Agatha’s tone sharp enough to slice through the request.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, come on!” Nick groaned, slinging his backpack over one shoulder. The zipper caught slightly on the fabric, and he gave it a yank.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She simply pointed toward the door, her arm stiff, her lips a firm line. “Out. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky grabbed her own bag from the hook by the door and slung it over her shoulder. The zipper jangled against the metal hook, echoing through the house like a starting bell. She grabbed Nick by the sleeve and practically hauled him toward the door. “Come on, squirt. Let’s go before Mom changes her mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not a squirt!” Nick whined, his voice cracking slightly as he tried to dig in his heels, but he was no match for his sister’s momentum.</p><p> </p><p>The front door creaked open, letting in a sharp gust of morning air that smelled like damp asphalt and the faint tang of gasoline. The chill bit at their cheeks as they stepped outside. Nicky’s laugh rang out, teasing and triumphant, while Nick grumbled under his breath, kicking at a loose pebble on the driveway.</p><p>Inside, Agatha stood frozen for a moment in the doorway. The silence left behind was heavier than she expected. She pressed a hand to her forehead and let out a long breath, her fingers brushing the worry lines etched deep into her brow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward Rio, who was still lounging in the chair like it was a throne, legs lazily crossed, fingers toying with the frayed edge of her sleeve. She looked annoyingly comfortable, like she belonged there, like this wasn’t a seismic shift in Agatha’s carefully constructed reality.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms tightly across her chest, the leather of her jacket creaking under the pressure. Her eyes narrowed, sharp as cut glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” she said, her voice low and clipped, the kind that came right before a storm. “<em>Talk</em>. Who are you, really? And why the hell is my family wrapped up in this... whatever this is?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a familiar smirk, but it lacked its usual spark. It was tired, almost bittersweet. She tilted her head, studying Agatha the way a chess master would eye a board mid-game.</p><p> </p><p>“Straight to the point. I like that,” she said, voice smooth like velvet dragged across something jagged.</p><p> </p><p>“Save the flattery,” Agatha snapped, her tone as icy as her stare. “Start explaining.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, her movements slow and deliberate, resting her elbows on her knees. Her voice dropped with gravity.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, darling. But you’d better sit down. This isn’t going to be easy to hear.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll stand,” Agatha shot back, lifting her chin. Her posture was rigid, fists clenched at her sides. She needed control — if not over Rio, then at least over her own body.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, a languid motion that seemed to mock Agatha’s tension. “Suit yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, she looked up, eyes locking onto Agatha’s with such intensity it felt like a tether had snapped taut between them.</p><p> </p><p>“You summoned me, Agatha. And not just yesterday. You’ve been calling me, consciously or not, <em>for years</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hit like a slap. Agatha’s breath hitched, barely audible, but her eyes gave her away—widening with confusion, flickering with fear she didn’t want to name.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice, though, stayed steady. “What do you mean, years? I’ve never met you before last night.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not in this life,” Rio said softly, her tone coated in something heavier now, grief, maybe, or reverence. “But in another? We knew each other. <em>Intimately</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The room felt smaller suddenly, as if the air had thickened with invisible weight. Agatha’s mouth went dry. She took an involuntary step back, her heel brushing against the edge of the carpet, grounding her to the moment. Her heart pounded against her ribs, each beat screaming <em>lie, lie, lie</em> — but something deeper hummed beneath it. <em>Recognition. Terror.</em></p><p> </p><p>“I don’t believe in reincarnation,” she said, but the words lacked bite.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, soft this time. Not mocking, not triumphant. Just… sad. “You don’t have to. I remember enough for both of us.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched, as if resisting the urge to reach for something, magic, memory, maybe even Rio. Her gaze flicked toward the window, where rain tapped against the glass in a steady rhythm, like a heartbeat she couldn’t name.</p><p> </p><p>“And what exactly did we mean to each other in this other life?” she asked, her voice quieter now, but no less firm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her for a long moment, then stood, her movements fluid, like the gravity in the room bowed to her. She stepped closer, not enough to touch, but close enough that Agatha could feel the subtle heat radiating from her. Her eyes, endless and dark, searched Agatha’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything,” Rio whispered. “You were everything.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hung heavy in the air, pressing on Agatha's chest like invisible hands. She didn’t move, didn’t speak, but something inside her shifted — an ache in her ribs, a tightening behind her eyes. For a fleeting moment, her mind drifted <em>to that dream, or was it a memory?</em> The dream of the forest. The light filtering through the trees. Rio’s laughter, rich and warm, echoing like a song she almost remembered. The way Rio had looked at her then — like she was the center of the world. Like she always had been.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re insane,” Agatha muttered, her voice low and brittle. She shook her head, as if the motion could cast off the creeping weight curling around her spine. “<em>This is insane</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the dim lighting catching the curve of her cheekbone. Her eyes sparkled with something unreadable. “Is it? Or is it that deep down, a part of you already knows I’m telling the truth?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha parted her lips to retort, but no words came. They caught, snagged on the edge of something fragile inside her. The memory sharpened, the sensation of fingers intertwined, the warmth of skin, a voice — Rio’s voice — calling her name in the hush of trees.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want from me?” she asked finally, barely more than a whisper. The question wasn’t laced with accusation now, but desperation. Her hands trembled slightly, tucked beneath her crossed arms to hide the quake.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back again, sinking into the chair like a queen on her throne, that maddening smirk returning. “Oh, darling. The better question is, what do you want from me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. Her fists clenched. Her whole body felt wired, caught between rage and something far more dangerous, curiosity. “I want my life <em>back</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The words came out rough, scraped raw from somewhere deep. Her life had been twisted, yanked off its axis since the moment she met this woman. And worse, it felt like she had been waiting for it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile faltered just slightly, softening into something mournful. Her eyes held something ancient and tender. “Then we’d better figure out why you called me here. Because until we do...” She leaned in, her voice gentler, more intimate. “I’m afraid you’re stuck with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and squared her shoulders, burying the flicker of unease that danced up her spine. “Can you stop speaking in riddles? You’re not a sphinx.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh rolled out low and melodic, tinged with something far too amused. She shook her head slowly, brushing her fingers through her hair. Her posture was unbothered, almost amused, as if she were enjoying Agatha’s unraveling.</p><p> </p><p>“If I told you the whole truth at once, Agatha, you’d succumb to madness,” she said, her voice smooth as silk but laced with weary undertones.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, a bitter sound. “So you’re protecting me?”</p><p> </p><p>“That,” Rio said with a smirk, “and the fact that I’m not allowed to talk about past lives to any living soul. Not in this world, this timeline, or any other.” She arched an eyebrow. “I can’t. It’s forbidden. The only way is for you to discover it piece by piece. Like breadcrumbs through the dark.”</p><p> </p><p>A long, frustrated sigh escaped Agatha’s lips. She paced a step, then stopped, her boots heavy on the hardwood. Her voice cracked through the tension. “Then <em>what</em> are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression changed, something deeper rippling beneath her skin. A shadow, a truth waiting just behind the veil. Her smile stretched wider, and yet it wasn’t threatening. It was reverent. Inevitable.</p><p> </p><p>“I am the natural order of things, my love,” she murmured. “I am the balance between life and death. No one lives without eventually passing through me. I can be the beginning...” she paused, leaning forward slightly, “but I am also the end.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cut the Shakespearean crap,” Agatha snapped, her voice sharp, but there was an edge of fear to it now. She hated that.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood.</p><p> </p><p>The movement was quiet, graceful, but with weight, like the air itself shifted around her. She stepped forward slowly, until she was inches from Agatha’s face. The scent of her, like smoke and cold earth, wrapped around Agatha’s senses, familiar and wrong at once. Her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, unwavering.</p><p> </p><p><em>Then something happened</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her flawless features shifted. Not like illusion or magic, but like a crack in a mask. Her face twisted, her skin turning pale as ash, lips darkening, eyes hollowing until they glowed with an eerie light. A skeletal edge peeked through her cheekbones, as if death itself were pressing just beneath her skin. Yet Agatha didn’t recoil. Her heart thudded violently in her chest, but she wasn’t afraid. Not of her.</p><p> </p><p>“I. Am. The...” Rio whispered, each word like thunder muffled by silk.</p><p> </p><p>Then, her voice dropped low, inhuman and cold enough to steal the warmth from the room:</p><p> </p><p>“<strong><em>Death</em></strong>.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat of silence followed. The clock on the wall ticked once.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her. <em>Not with fear. With recognition.</em></p><p> </p><p>“…Figures,” she muttered under her breath, more to herself than to Rio, but her voice betrayed the chill crawling down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s monstrous face relaxed, softening back to human. <em>Beautiful. Familiar</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you,” she said softly, “you called for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, her breath catching in her throat as the weight of the word settled into her bones like frost. "<em>Death</em>?" she repeated, voice thinner than she liked, her hand instinctively moving to her chest, as though trying to still the sudden thrum of her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She took a step closer, slow and deliberate, her voice rich and dark, soaked in silk and thunder. “That’s right, darling... <strong>Death</strong>.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound of that word, wrapped in honey and warning, made Agatha’s skin prickle. Her body was tense, rooted in place, caught between flight and the inexplicable pull toward the woman in front of her. Every part of her screamed danger — run<em>, scream, protect</em> — but her pulse betrayed her. She was curious. She was drawn in. That scared her more than anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice sharpened, the sting of disbelief slicing through her composure. “And why are you here?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated, and it was so brief, so unnatural, that Agatha noticed immediately. That flicker of something... <em>human</em>. Vulnerable. A crack in the mask.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said softly, almost like it pained her to say it.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Liar</em>,” Agatha hissed, stepping forward now, her anger finally overtaking the fog of confusion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms. “You’re lying.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t lie, <em>Agatha</em>!” Rio snapped, her voice slicing through the room like a whip. Her control cracked for the first time, the edge of command in her tone unmistakable. “You know that! It’s not <em>allowed</em>.” Her voice dipped again, thick with emotion and something darker. “You <em>begged</em> me to never appear to you again. <em>To leave you alone</em>. To stop making your life a living hell. And I did.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes searching Rio’s face for deception, for theatrics. But there was none. Only truth, raw and terrifying.</p><p> </p><p>“For <em>centuries</em>,” Rio continued, her jaw tight. “But then one day, you called me back. And I tried not to come. I tried…”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice broke just slightly, just enough to stir something in Agatha’s chest that she didn’t want to name.</p><p> </p><p>“When did I call you?” Agatha asked, quieter this time, like the question itself held teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, her gaze unblinking. “When you got married.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed like a slap.</p><p> </p><p>“You wished it would end, that you could die,” Rio said, stepping forward again. Her tone was gentler now, but commanding, like a hand at Agatha’s throat, not choking, just reminding her who was in control. “That your suffering would stop. But I couldn’t take you. I made a promise. So every night, you prayed and begged not to get pregnant, even though deep down… you <em>wanted</em> a child.”</p><p> </p><p>The memory slammed into Agatha like a wave, her knees pressed to the cold floor, candlelight flickering, whispering please, not like this, night after night, until silence answered back. Or so she’d thought.</p><p> </p><p>“So I gave you one... two,” Rio said, her voice thick now, laced with quiet reverence. “A child that doesn’t belong to your husband, but to you and —”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, and the word slipped out before she could stop it. “<em>You</em>.” Her knees buckled slightly. “Nicole looks like you. Nick looks like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t smile. Her expression was solemn, proud, almost possessive. “I gave you what you asked for. Somehow, the children could see me. Talk to me. So I stayed close. With them. To protect. To keep them safe.”</p><p> </p><p>She took another step closer. Agatha didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>“But every time you were nearby, I disappeared. Nicole figured it out first. That’s why she calls me ‘Mama.’” A soft pause. “Nick still sees me as his imaginary friend. The last time I did what you asked... was six months ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice barely rose above a breath, her lips pale. “Ralph.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s very annoying,” Rio muttered without remorse, rolling her eyes, but her tone was edged with something sharper — dark amusement.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face paled. “You killed my husband?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the corner of her mouth curling. “Do you <em>want</em> that?”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” she snapped, too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a single eyebrow, her voice dipped into something sinful. “Are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>The air between them crackled. That question wasn’t just about Ralph anymore, and Agatha knew it. Her throat tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Rio said, almost flippantly, stepping back just an inch, letting Agatha breathe. “After that, I left. Until you summoned me again. With that spell. So here I am.” She spread her arms with mocking grace. “Stuck with you, Agatha. Until you figure out how to send me away… again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stumbled back a step, trying to put distance between them that no longer existed. Her back hit the wall, cold against her shoulder blades. Her fists were still clenched, her breathing shallow. Her heartbeat thundered in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head again, that smirk returning with the kind of control that made Agatha’s skin flush. “You look like you want to hit me... or kiss me. Which is it, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Get out of my head</em>,” Agatha spat, but her voice trembled, traitorous.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in until her breath kissed Agatha’s cheek. “Darling,” she whispered, “I’ve lived in your head. I know every dark corner... and every place that makes you ache.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s words slid under her skin like smoke, unseen, but suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got some nerve,” Agatha hissed, voice low and trembling, not just with anger, but with the raw, volatile emotion barely caged beneath her skin. Her fists were clenched so tightly her knuckles had gone pale, nails biting into the flesh of her palms. “You’ve been meddling in my life, in my family, for years. And now you just expect me to accept that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back lazily against the wall, one boot casually crossed over the other, her arms folded like she had all the time in the world. That damned smirk curled across her lips, equal parts amusement and arrogance. “I didn’t <em>meddle</em>, darling,” she said, the word like a purr, a tease, a leash tug. “You called me. I simply answered.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a step forward, the distance between them charged like a live wire. Her jaw tightened, eyes flashing with fury. “You’re twisting everything!” she snapped, the pitch of her voice rising. “You talk about balance, about being death, but you’ve been manipulating me from the start! You—”</p><p> </p><p>“I gave you <em>exactly</em> what you asked for,” Rio interrupted, voice razor-sharp now, her smirk vanishing like mist. She unfolded her arms, her entire posture shifting into something more dangerous, controlled, focused, like a predator just before the strike. “You prayed for freedom. I gave it to you. You begged for children who didn’t tie you to that pathetic man. I gave you that, too. Every time you’ve reached out, I’ve <em>answered</em>, Agatha. So don’t you dare stand there and act like I forced myself into your life.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breathing was shallow now, chest rising and falling too fast. Her pulse thundered at her temples. She was unraveling, and she hated that Rio could see it.</p><p> </p><p>“You still should’ve stayed away,” she said, but it came out like a gasp.<em> A plea. A lie.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed off the wall with a single, fluid movement, the air shifting as she moved. She was suddenly there — inches away. Agatha could smell her now, that strange scent of smoke and earth and something faintly sweet like lilac clinging to leather. Rio’s dark eyes locked onto hers, searing.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Stayed away</em>?” she repeated, voice dropping into something low and velvet-smooth. “You think I wanted to come back? You think I chose to be tied to you?” Her lip curled just slightly, but her eyes betrayed her, there was pain there, and longing. “You called me, Agatha. Over and over again. And now I’m stuck here. <em>With you</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's knees threatened to give out, but she stood her ground. Their faces were so close now that she could feel the warmth of Rio’s breath against her lips, could see every detail in her eyes, stormy, endless, filled with memory.</p><p> </p><p>“Then leave,” she said, though her voice faltered. “If you’re so <em>miserable</em>, then just leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a faint, humorless smile, one that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I can’t. Not until you figure out why you summoned me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, trying to wrestle back some control, even if it was slipping like sand through her fingers. “Why I summoned you? You’re the all-powerful, mysterious Death,” she mocked, her voice a shade too brittle. “Why don’t you just figure it out yourself?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed then, but there was no real joy in it. It was low and dry, like wind through dead leaves. “You think this is easy for me?” she said, stepping even closer until their bodies almost touched, heat sparking between them like flint. “Being here? Being near you? <em>It’s torture</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s anger flickered, her brow knitting. Confusion cut through the fury like a blade. “What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped to a whisper, dark and reverent. “<em>You</em>. Being near you is torture.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed hard. Heavy. They reverberated through Agatha’s chest and made her stomach twist.</p><p> </p><p>“I remember <em><strong>everything</strong></em>,” Rio continued, her tone shifting again, softer, more intimate, yet commanding. Her fingers brushed along Agatha’s arm, feather-light, barely a touch but enough to ignite fire beneath the skin. “The lives we’ve lived. The things we’ve shared. I remember all of it, Agatha. Every <em>moment</em>. Every <em>touch</em>. And now I’m here, and you don’t even remember me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. Her body was frozen, betraying her mind, which screamed to pull away. But she didn’t. She couldn’t. Her heart thudded violently against her ribs, her skin tingling where Rio’s fingers trailed.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop it,” she said, voice trembling, smaller than she intended.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, pupils dilated. She stepped into Agatha’s space like she belonged there. “Stop what?” she murmured, her voice a silk thread coiled tight. “Reminding you of what you’ve forgotten... or getting too close?”</p><p> </p><p>“I said stop,” Agatha repeated, but it was a whimper now, not a command.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled again, this time not in amusement, but understanding. Knowing. Dominance wrapped in velvet. “You’re trembling.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha lied, voice barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>“You are,” Rio whispered, her other hand rising to brush a loose strand of hair from Agatha’s cheek. Her touch was gentle, reverent, as if she were worshipping a ghost. “I could leave you alone right now. Walk out that door. Vanish. Never touch your life again.” Her fingertips dragged just beneath Agatha’s jaw, tilting her chin slightly, controlling her without force. “But we both know,” Rio continued, eyes locked on hers, “you don’t want that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Couldn’t. Her body was aflame, her mind a battlefield of denial and desire. And Rio... Rio stood there like sin incarnate, like punishment wrapped in pleasure, like a promise whispered at the edge of surrender.</p><p>And God help her, Agatha wasn’t sure which part she feared most: <em>the truth... or how much she wanted it.</em></p><p> </p><p>The air between them was thick, charged, almost suffocating, as if the room itself held its breath, waiting to see who would shatter first. Agatha’s fingers, which had been clenched just moments before with the kind of fury that left crescent-shaped marks in her palms, now found themselves pressed against Rio’s shoulders. She pushed, not hard, not with intent to repel, but just enough to reclaim a fraction of space, a sliver of clarity she didn’t actually want.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a mistake,” Agatha muttered, though her voice betrayed her. It was raw. Low. And she didn’t let go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move back. Her body stayed rooted, steady beneath Agatha’s touch, like she knew how little resistance meant in the presence of want. Her lips hovered just a breath from Agatha’s, their exhale mingling, hot and intimate.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Rio whispered, her voice like velvet dragged over bare skin. “But it’s one we’ve made before.”</p><p> </p><p>A shiver coiled down Agatha’s spine. Her grip tightened at Rio’s collar, fingertips curling into the fabric like claws desperate for control. But control had already slipped through her fingers. The burn in her chest, the pounding in her ears, it wasn’t anger anymore. It was hunger. Frustration. Longing. Her. She hated how Rio always unraveled her, how she pulled the strings without ever trying, how she exposed truths Agatha had buried lifetimes ago.</p><p> </p><p>But right now, thought was a luxury she didn’t have.</p><p>The pull between them snapped. And then, finally — finally — their lips met.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t soft. It wasn’t sweet. <strong><em>It was war.</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Their mouths crashed together with the kind of violence only repressed desire could conjure. Agatha kissed like she was furious, like she needed to punish Rio for existing, for returning, for knowing her too well. Rio answered with fire, her lips parting just enough to tease, to command, to take. Their teeth clashed briefly, breath mingling in sharp gasps, and it felt like drowning, and neither of them cared.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slid up to the back of Rio’s neck, fingers threading through thick strands of dark hair, pulling her closer like she needed her closer or she’d burn alive. Rio didn’t hesitate; her arms wrapped tightly around Agatha’s waist, dragging her against her body with enough force to make Agatha’s breath catch. She was solid. Warm. Unshakable. The world tilted, disappeared, no walls, no floor, no time. Just skin. Just friction. Just them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em>moaned</em> against her mouth, low and guttural, and for a heartbeat she hated how <em>good</em> it felt. How <em>right</em>. How <em>dangerous</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But just as quickly as it started, she tore herself away, gasping like she’d broken the surface of deep water. Her chest heaved with shallow, ragged breaths, her lips swollen, her pupils wide. Her fingers hovered midair, unsure of whether to hold or hit.</p><p> </p><p>“This doesn’t mean anything,” she said, but the words cracked at the edges, trembling with everything it did mean.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips, red and glistening, curled into a slow smirk, but this one wasn’t sharp. It was soft. Dangerous in a different way. “If that’s what you need to tell yourself, <em>darling</em>...” Her voice was low, almost a purr, rich with satisfaction and the certainty of someone who knew she’d already won.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stumbled back a step, needing air, space — distance — but her body betrayed her, still humming, still hot. Her pulse thudded beneath her skin, and every nerve was painfully aware of where Rio had touched her. Of where she still wanted her to.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate you,” she said, trying to conjure venom, but the words came out husky, breathless, more like a confession than a curse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's smile widened, slow and indulgent, like a queen watching her favorite servant try to rebel. Her gaze slid over Agatha’s flushed cheeks, down to the subtle tremble in her hands. “You always say that,” she murmured, voice as intoxicating as wine spilled down silk. “Right before you let me <em>ruin you again</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had no answer, because part of her, deep, aching, undeniable, wanted to be ruined.</p><hr/><p>Agatha stood barefoot on the cool wooden floor, in front of her open closet, her fingers rifling through hangers with a little too much force. Fabric whispered and swayed with each frustrated tug. She was trying to find something, anything, that made her feel put together, in control. But her mind refused to stay focused. It kept replaying the kiss, the way Rio's lips had felt against hers, fire and fury and inevitability.</p><p> </p><p>She gritted her teeth and forced the memory away, yanking out a white blouse like it had personally offended her. <em>Not now. Not again</em>. She didn’t have time for emotional sabotage, not when work was already hanging over her like a guillotine. Taking a break wasn't a luxury she could afford — not with everything unraveling at once.</p><p> </p><p>As she buttoned her blouse, hands slower than usual, she could still feel Rio. It was ridiculous. The house was empty. She’d checked. The bathroom mirror no longer held shadows, and the bedroom was devoid of footsteps or lingering heat. But somehow, Rio’s presence clung to the air like expensive perfume, haunting and warm and maddening. It curled in the corners of rooms, danced along the baseboards, pulsed in the echo of silence.</p><p>Agatha sighed and stepped into her heels, grabbing her purse and slinging it over her shoulder with a bit more force than necessary. A sharp honk pierced the fog in her mind, snapping her attention toward the window.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s red car sat idling at the curb, the windows slightly fogged from the cold morning. Agatha took one last glance at the house, her jaw tense, then walked out, heels clicking down the front steps. She opened the passenger door with a practiced flick, tossed her bag into the backseat, and slid in with a heavy exhale.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda barely turned her head, one brow already arched. “What happened to your car?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nick and Nicky missed the bus,” Agatha muttered, rubbing her temples with two fingers. Her head throbbed — not from lack of sleep, but from thinking too much.</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re in such a great mood 'cause...?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head back against the seat, her voice flat. “I don’t know yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda glanced sideways, lips twitching into a smirk she didn’t bother to hide. “Is this about Ralph?”</p><p> </p><p>“Can we not talk about <em>him</em>?” Agatha snapped, fumbling for the seatbelt as if the motion could end the conversation by itself.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t flinch. She simply rested her hands on the wheel, drumming her fingers. “Agatha,” she said, her tone walking the line between playful and interrogative. “I’m not a cop, but refusing to talk about your <em>missing husband</em> every time someone brings him up kinda makes you look like a suspect.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, fixing Wanda with a razor-sharp glare that could’ve sliced through steel. Her voice was low and deliberate. “Explain to me how I’m a suspect in his disappearance when I was literally in the <em>hospital, Wanda.</em> Vomiting <em>blood</em>. From <em>food he bought</em>.” She let the words hang, acidic. “I just don’t want to talk about it. Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda blinked once, raised her hands in mock surrender. “Yikes. Someone’s cranky today.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed and finally buckled her seatbelt, the metal click sounding too loud in the tension between them.</p><p> </p><p>“You need to get laid,” Wanda said under her breath, lips curling into a wicked grin.</p><p> </p><p>“You need to mind your own damn business,” Agatha retorted, giving her a look that dared her to keep pushing. Her voice was sharp, but her cheeks were a shade pinker than before.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t miss it.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever you say, boss,” she teased, her smirk full of secrets as she shifted the car into gear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared out the window, arms crossed tightly, jaw set, but her heart thudded a little faster than usual. And no matter how hard she tried to ignore it, the taste of Rio still lingered on her lips.</p><hr/><p>Agatha stood at the podium, the cool varnish of the wood smooth beneath her fingertips as she adjusted her notes into a neat, controlled pile. Her eyes, sharp behind thin-framed glasses, swept over the rows of students. The low hum of casual chatter faded as the weight of her presence settled over the lecture hall. She didn’t need to raise her voice, her authority came naturally, with a quiet, commanding elegance that demanded attention.</p><p> </p><p>"Today," she began, voice clear and deliberate, “we’re diving into a fascinating and ancient concept, the beings said to govern the sacred balance of the universe.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused just long enough to let the words land.</p><p> </p><p>"These are the personifications of fundamental forces: Life, Time, Space, Destiny, and <em>Death</em>." Her tone was even, but her heart skipped slightly at the final word. She forced herself to ignore it. "In almost every culture, these forces appear not as abstract ideas, but as conscious entities — beings with purpose, often wielding immense power."</p><p> </p><p>A soft click echoed as she pressed the projector remote. The screen behind her flickered, casting a golden glow that highlighted the edges of her figure, a mosaic of the Moirai materialized, the ancient Greek depiction of fate taking form.</p><p> </p><p>"Humanity has always sought to understand the forces that govern existence," she continued, her heels clicking softly as she stepped to the side. "In early cultures, these forces were explained through mythology and personification. The Greeks imagined the Moirai as three women who controlled the thread of life, Clotho spun it, Lachesis measured it, and Atropos cut it."</p><p> </p><p>She turned to face her class, her gaze steady.</p><p> </p><p>"This triad represented the inevitability of birth, the passage of time, and death."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's voice didn’t waver, but her fingers curled slightly around the edge of the podium. Her skin felt too warm. The room, usually clinical and bright, felt heavy, like the air had thickened around her. She wasn’t thinking about the Greeks anymore. She could still feel the ghost of <em>Rio’s breath on her lips.</em></p><p> </p><p>She clicked to the next slide: <strong>a fresco of the Trimurti, bold and colorful, bathing the room in reds and golds.</strong></p><p> </p><p>"This framework wasn’t unique to the Greeks. In Hinduism, the Trimurti embodies creation, preservation, and destruction — Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. In Norse mythology, the Norns wove fate beneath Yggdrasil, the World Tree."</p><p> </p><p>As she spoke, she paced slowly across the stage, her heels echoing, voice flowing like silk through stone. The rhythm was second nature, but the center of her chest ached with pressure. Her body moved with precision, but her mind... her mind was spiraling.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She kissed me. I kissed her back.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She clicked again.</p><p> </p><p>A medieval image filled the screen: <strong>Death, skeletal and robed, holding a scythe that glinted under the light of a painted moon.</strong></p><p> </p><p>"And then, there’s <em>Death</em>," she said, and her throat tightened involuntarily.</p><p> </p><p>The word felt heavier today. Not symbolic. Not philosophical. <em>Personal</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Often portrayed as a solitary figure, Death is universally feared and revered. From the Grim Reaper of Western folklore to the Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatl, who governs the underworld, Death is not simply an end but a necessary part of the cycle."</p><p> </p><p>She stepped away from the podium, walking slowly to the front edge of the platform. Her fingers brushed against her thigh, restless. She let her gaze drift upward toward the students, though she didn’t see them.</p><p> </p><p>"But where did this theology arise? Why personify these forces at all?"</p><p> </p><p>Her voice softened, layered with a deeper question, one that wasn’t in the script.</p><p> </p><p>"The answer lies in our ancestors' need to understand the incomprehensible."</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled slowly through her nose, grounding herself.</p><p> </p><p>"Life, time, destiny, and death are universal constants. They are intangible, yet their effects are deeply felt. By giving them form, humanity made them relatable — something they could pray to, fear, or blame. These personifications became a way to impose order on chaos."</p><p> </p><p>A final click. A modern graphic appeared, elegant and minimal, five interlocking symbols: <strong>a flower, a clock, a thread, a star, and a scythe.</strong></p><p> </p><p>“Over millennia, the stories evolved. Oral traditions turned into sacred texts, then into art, and now, into academic study.” Her voice rose again, regaining its structure. “These beings, whether real or imagined, represent our quest to understand not only the universe… but our place within it.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused. A calculated beat of silence. But her eyes drifted down, unfocused, lost in thought.</p><p> </p><p>"And yet,” she said quietly, “despite all our theories and stories, we must ask ourselves, what if these beings are not just myths? What if they exist, not as deities or metaphors, but as manifestations of universal laws? Beings that maintain the balance, ensuring the cycle continues… whether we understand it or not."</p><p> </p><p>The classroom was silent. The hum of the projector was the only sound, punctuated by the scratch of a few pens moving slower now.</p><p>A muscle in Agatha’s jaw twitched as she glanced at the symbol of the scythe glowing behind her.</p><p> </p><p><em>Balance is necessary...</em> The thought echoed like a whisper in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>But what happens when the balance becomes personal? When Death lives in your house, sleeps in your air, wears your memories like perfume?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat lightly, pushing the tremor aside.</p><p> </p><p>“Now,” she said, her voice crisp again, sliding easily back into her professor's tone, “let’s break this down further by examining how these concepts manifest in different cultural frameworks. We'll start with the concept of Life through the lens of ancient Egyptian theology, Ma’at, the goddess of truth and balance.”</p><p> </p><p>The projector changed slides and Agatha, poised, composed, unraveling quietly beneath a professional mask, continued her lecture, while the scent of lilac and ash lingered faintly on her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood poised behind the podium, the wood warm beneath her palms despite the faint chill clinging to the air-conditioned room. A quiet hum of concentration filled the lecture hall, pages turning, pens scratching, students leaning in slightly, drawn into the rhythm of her voice. She thrived in this space, where logic ruled and curiosity had structure. But today, her foundation felt fragile.</p><p> </p><p>She was halfway through her explanation of the symbolic evolution of Ma’at when a hand shot up, quick and firm, slicing through the lull in her lecture. Agatha paused, nodding toward the source.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” she said, her tone smooth but cautious.</p><p> </p><p>A young man in the third row adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. “So, are these beings supposed to be, like, gods? Or are they something else entirely? You mentioned the Moirai, but how do they compare to, say, the Judeo-Christian God?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly through her nose, folding her arms and leaning slightly against the podium, one ankle crossing over the other. “Good question,” she said with a slight nod. “These beings aren’t gods in the traditional sense, at least not in the sense of creators or moral arbiters. They don’t seek worship. They don’t punish or reward.”</p><p> </p><p>She lifted her hand, gesturing toward the symbolic graphic on the screen, clock, flower, thread, star, scythe. “They’re more like… caretakers. Embodiments of cosmic function. If we’re comparing them to familiar theology, they’d be closer to archangels or sentient laws of nature than omnipotent deities.”</p><p> </p><p>The room murmured with scribbles and shifting bodies. Another hand rose in the back, feminine, fingers stained faintly with highlighter ink, her pen still tapping against her spiral notebook.</p><p> </p><p>“But wouldn’t that mean they still have free will?” the girl asked. “If they’re sentient, can’t they choose not to, you know… maintain balance?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued by the phrasing. “In theory? Yes,” she said, voice steady but thoughtful. “If they possess free will in the human sense, they could choose to abandon their roles. But most mythologies suggest that their purpose is their essence. Death doesn’t choose to take. She is the taking. Time doesn’t move forward because it wants to, it moves because it must.”</p><p> </p><p>The girl’s brow furrowed, her pen slowing. “So… they’re trapped by their own existence?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened for a moment. “In a sense,” she admitted, her voice lowering just a bit. “But whether they feel trapped is unknowable. They exist on a level beyond our comprehension. They may not experience time, or choice, or emotion the way we do. They just are.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced around, letting the words settle. The faint hum of the projector buzzed behind her like a second heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>Then, from the front row, another hand lifted, a boy, bright-eyed and eager. “What about Death specifically?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine stiffened. Her breath caught for just half a second, so quick it was barely noticeable. <em>But she felt it. She felt it.</em></p><p> </p><p>“What about <em>her</em>?” she asked, too fast.</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence. A flicker of confusion. Then the boy leaned forward. “Well, Death shows up a lot in stories as, like, a guide. The Grim Reaper, Charon, even some modern books and movies. But if Death’s just a cosmic force, why interact with humans at all? Why not just… happen? Like gravity.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed her palms flat on the podium, grounding herself. Her fingers tensed subtly. She kept her voice calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Death is… unique,” she began carefully. “Unlike Time or Space, Death is personal. She touches everything. Every living being meets her, eventually. She doesn’t create or destroy, she transitions. And because of that intimacy, many cultures gave her form. A face. A name. A role.”</p><p> </p><p>She took a step forward from the podium, her heels quiet against the floor. “To us, the end of life is terrifying. Abstract. So we imagined Death as someone who could guide us. Someone who… understands.”</p><p> </p><p>A few students glanced at one another. Whispers floated just out of earshot. It wasn’t the content that struck them — but the word choice. <em>She</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“But… why would it care?” the boy pressed again, frowning. “If Death’s just doing her job, why give comfort at all? Why show compassion? Why guide?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She glanced down, her fingers curling into her palm. She could still feel Rio’s lips on hers, still hear the whisper, <em>I</em> <em>remember everything.</em> A breeze that didn’t exist seemed to drift across the back of her neck.</p><p> </p><p>She looked back up, forcing stillness into her voice. “Maybe she doesn’t care,” she said, her words flat. “Maybe it’s just projection, us giving a face to something faceless.”</p><p> </p><p>But even as she said it, she knew she didn’t believe it. Not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Or maybe…” Her voice faltered.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe what?” a girl asked, leaning forward.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. Her gaze drifted toward the window, to the pale sky beyond the glass. “Maybe Death cares because she has to. Because without compassion, there is no true balance. Without empathy, death becomes chaos. Horror. And she is not chaos.” She turned back to the room, her expression unreadable. “Death isn’t just an end. She’s the threshold to something else. Whether we want to cross it or not.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence blanketed the room, thick and heavy. Several students stared, pens paused mid-sentence. Others exchanged glances, uncertain. Then, slowly, a single hand rose.</p><p> </p><p>“So… do you think Death could ever make mistakes?” the student asked. “Like, take someone she wasn’t supposed to?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her throat tightened, heat creeping up the back of her neck. She pictured Rio’s smirk, her sharp eyes, the way she’d whispered <em>You summoned me.</em></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Was Ralph a mistake? Or a choice?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Did she come for him… or for me?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said sharply, the word cutting through the stillness. “Death doesn’t make mistakes.”</p><p> </p><p>Her tone was final. Too final.</p><p> </p><p>More glances passed between students, now laced with confusion and curiosity. Whispers stirred again — soft, speculative.</p><p> </p><p>“And… why do you keep calling Death she?” someone asked cautiously. “Is that from a specific myth?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened, hands folding behind her back. “That’s just the interpretation I use. It’s… <em>personal</em>.” Her voice was clipped, cool again, the professor mask sliding neatly back into place.</p><p> </p><p>No one questioned her further.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” she said briskly, clapping once, the sound echoing like a reset. “Let’s move on to Destiny, and how it functions as both a narrative device and a metaphysical force. Any more questions about Death can wait until the end of class.”</p><p> </p><p>But as she turned back toward the screen, the weight of her own words clung to her like a second skin.</p><p> </p><p>And she couldn’t help but wonder, if Death didn’t make mistakes…<em>Then what, exactly, had she become?</em></p><hr/><p>Jen raised an eyebrow, her manicured fingers delicately circling the rim of her iced coffee as she tilted her head. Her gaze was fixed on Agatha, who sat across the café table, utterly unmoving, her eyes locked on something, or someone, outside the window.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s with her?” Jen muttered, her voice pitched low but unmistakably laced with judgment. “She looks… off. Like she’s watching a UFO landing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lack of sex,” Wanda replied without missing a beat, spearing a cherry tomato with surgical precision, her tone matter-of-fact.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s mouth curled into a smirk. “She looks more like she’s high. Staring out that window like she’s expecting to see something magical. What’s she hoping for, the moon at noon?”</p><p> </p><p>Both women leaned in slightly, conspiratorial. The chatter around them in the bustling café — clinking cutlery, steaming espresso machines, low jazz playing from ceiling speakers, faded behind the hum of their curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She hadn’t even blinked.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers were wrapped tightly around her coffee cup, its warmth long since faded. Her gaze remained locked on the window, or more accurately — on the figure just beyond it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rio</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>She stood as if placed there by a mischievous god, backlit by the early afternoon sun, her silhouette golden, her posture far too casual to be natural. She wore a laughably cliché high school uniform: pleated plaid skirt, fitted white shirt, navy sweater tied over her shoulders, and black knee-high socks. The disguise might’ve worked if not for the way Rio carried herself, with an undeniable, almost predatory elegance. She didn’t blend in. She dominated the space, even as she leaned lazily against the glass with her head tilted and a smirk dancing on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. Her pulse throbbed at her temple.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted a single brow, cocking her head, lips parting just slightly as if to say, <em>Well? Say something, pet.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose, pretending to be deeply focused on the lukewarm coffee in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen nudged Wanda with her elbow. “Seriously. She’s been zoning out like that all lunch. You think something’s up with Ralph?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda shrugged, her fork spinning idly in her salad. “I don’t know. But I’m betting on a midlife crisis. Probably fantasizing about running away with some sexy twenty-five-year-old and trading her minivan for a convertible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. Classic projection,” Jen mused, raising her cup.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped back to her tablemates. Her voice cut the air cleanly.</p><p> </p><p>“I can hear you, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Both women jerked slightly, caught mid-sip, guilty smiles spreading across their faces like children caught whispering during class.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Wanda said without missing a beat. “Maybe if you can hear us, you can explain why you’re acting like a ghost just walked over your grave.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened on the cup, her knuckles blanching. “<em>I’m fine</em>,” she said, the words brittle and sharp-edged.</p><p> </p><p>Jen crossed her arms and raised a skeptical brow. “You sure? Because you’ve been staring at that window like it owes you money. What’s so interesting out there?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed. She refused to look back, she could feel Rio’s stare. Could practically hear her smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” she muttered, reaching for her fork again.</p><p> </p><p>Behind the glass, Rio crossed her arms in a near-perfect imitation of Wanda’s earlier posture, then raised one elegant hand to mime sipping from an invisible wine glass, pinky out, exaggerated. Her smirk widened into a grin so smug it made Agatha’s eye twitch.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned forward, resting her chin in her palm, her bracelets clinking softly against her wrist. “Come on, Agatha. Spill it. You’ve been acting weird since I picked you up this morning. Did something happen? Like… major?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged a hand through her hair, her fingers catching slightly in a tangle. “It’s just work stress. <em>The usual</em>.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Liar</em>, Rio mouthed dramatically, placing both hands over her heart like a swooning heroine in a soap opera. Then she mimed vomiting, complete with a full-body retch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched again. Her fork hovered above her plate, unmoving.</p><p> </p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes. “You know, if you keep bottling stuff up like that, you’re gonna end up on one of those viral TikToks. The kind where some suburban mom explodes in a Trader Joe’s.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed heavily, forcing a tight, teeth-baring smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “Really. I’m fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, not buying it but deciding to let it slide. “Alright. But if you start talking to the moon or howling at it, we’re calling a therapist.”</p><p> </p><p>Across the glass, Rio pressed her hands together in prayer, mouthing <em>Please</em> do before bursting into silent laughter, her shoulders shaking, eyes gleaming with delight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at her before turning back to her plate, stabbing a piece of lettuce with unnecessary force.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we just eat?” she snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Wanda said, stretching lazily and settling back into her chair with a grin. “But for the record? I’m still voting for lack of sex.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and let her fork drop onto her plate with a metallic clatter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, doubled over in laughter now, mouthed That’s<em> two for two</em>, then blew her a kiss through the glass.</p><p>And Agatha, cheeks burning, could only stare at her salad and hope the universe would swallow her whole.</p><hr/><p>Agatha sat hunched over a long oak table in the quiet solitude of the library, her fingers buried in her hair, eyes burning from too much reading and not enough sleep. The faint scent of aging paper lingered in the air, mingled with the musty, familiar scent of polished wood and the distant hiss of air vents overhead. Towering stacks of books framed her like barricades, some half-read, others covered in sticky notes and scribbled annotations. Her pen danced frantically across the page, but her thoughts were fractured.</p><p> </p><p><em>Focus</em>, she told herself, under her breath. <em>Just focus. She’s not here. You’re alone.</em></p><p> </p><p>Her hand trembled slightly as she underlined a phrase, “<strong>Transcendental Manifestations of Eternal Forces</strong>”, for the third time. It didn’t matter. None of it was sticking. Not with Rio still haunting the edges of her memory like perfume you couldn’t wash off.</p><p> </p><p>Then—</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Hello, darling</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The voice curled behind her ear like smoke, warm, amused, and maddeningly soft.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha screamed.</p><p> </p><p>The pen shot from her hand and skittered across the table like a spooked insect. She jerked around in her chair, heart slamming into her ribs, breath caught somewhere between fury and fear.</p><p> </p><p>And there she was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat casually on the edge of the table beside her, one leg draped over the other, fingers pressed against the wood as she leaned back like she owned the place. She wore all black, tight slacks, an open blazer over a fitted turtleneck, boots with heels sharp enough to be illegal in several countries. Her expression was all teeth and mischief.</p><p> </p><p>“Ms. Harkness!” The librarian’s stern voice cracked from across the room like a whip. “This is a library, not a rock concert. <em>Silence, please</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha mumbled quickly, cheeks burning as she sank lower into her chair, avoiding the judgmental glares from the nearby tables.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered under her breath, her voice like velvet soaked in wine. “Subtle as always, I see. Honestly, you’re making it too easy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and hissed, “<em>What is wrong with you</em>? You can’t just sneak up on me like that!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged one shoulder with practiced indifference, the movement sending a silky ripple down her sleeve. “I can, and I did. Besides,” she said, glancing around with exaggerated curiosity, “this place is so… <em>quaint</em>. Old wood, soft lighting, the smell of dust and desperation. Really does something for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is a <em>library</em>, Rio,” Agatha hissed, her voice sharp but low. “People come here to study.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, yes,” Rio murmured, leaning closer until her breath ghosted over Agatha’s cheek. “And you came here to bury yourself in a pile of crumbling theories so you can pretend you’re not unraveling. But you are, aren’t you, <em>darling</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened, her fingers curling into fists. She hated how Rio could say so little and yet push her to the edge so effortlessly. “What do you want, Rio?” she asked, her voice colder now, controlled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a hand over her heart in mock offense. “What makes you think I want anything? Maybe I just <em>missed you</em>. Maybe I just wanted to see how stunningly tense you look under all that righteous fury.”</p><p> </p><p>“Go enjoy someone else’s company,” Agatha snapped, snatching her pen off the floor and trying to refocus on her notes. Her handwriting was shaking. "Out! You’re distracting me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a throaty chuckle and reached for one of the books in Agatha’s pile. She flipped it open with casual arrogance, skimming the pages like they were a menu. “Hmm... ‘<strong>Ancient Concepts of Universal Balance</strong>’. How very on-brand. This is bullshit </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. She reached out and yanked the book back, slamming it shut. “Put that down,” she growled through gritted teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Touchy, touchy,” Rio teased, her lips curving upward. “You used to love when I touched your books. And your—”</p><p> </p><p>“Do not finish that sentence,” Agatha snapped, a whisper of warning in her voice. Her face was flushed again, but not from embarrassment, this time, it was the heat of tightly leashed fury... and the sting of memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, voice dropping to a purr. “Your hands are shaking, professor. I’m starting to think it’s not the workload that’s got you so flustered.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, jaw tight, her chest rising and falling faster than it should. She kept her gaze locked on the open book in front of her, even though she couldn’t read a single word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, lazy, confident, a little cruel. She reached across the table and plucked a sticky note from one of the pages, holding it up. “You still use these? Adorable.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched it from her fingers. “You have five seconds to leave before I forget this is a public place.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “And then what? You’ll make a scene?” Her smile deepened, eyes gleaming. “Oh, please, <em>darling</em>. Do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, trying to calm her pulse. But Rio was close now, too close, and the scent of her, smoke, lilac, and something ancient, wrapped around her like a noose.</p><p> </p><p>“I will make you regret this,” Agatha muttered under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in again, her voice a soft sigh against Agatha’s ear. “You already do, baby. That’s the fun part.”</p><p> </p><p>She slid off the table with fluid grace, her boots landing soundlessly against the library’s worn floorboards. The scent of her followed, smoke and wildflowers and something older, something Agatha refused to name. Rio circled her like a predator amused by the prey’s attempt at calm, her presence overwhelming, her silence deliberate.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, darling,” she said, voice low and teasing, her words like silk wrapping around Agatha’s spine, “you could just ask me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. Her grip tightened on the page beneath her fingers. “Ask you what?” she whispered, already regretting the question, because Rio always answered.</p><p> </p><p>“Anything,” Rio replied, her heels echoing softly as she continued her slow orbit. “Everything.”</p><p> </p><p>She stopped behind her and bent down, the heat of her body grazing Agatha’s back. Her lips brushed the shell of Agatha’s ear, her breath warm and maddening. “Why you summoned me. Why I’ve stayed close all these years. Why you’re so drawn to me… even though you’d rather die than admit it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s whole body tensed. Her knuckles blanched as she gripped the edge of the table with enough force to splinter it. She tried to steady her breathing, but her chest was tight, her skin prickling with tension.</p><p> </p><p>Her words came out brittle. “You’re delusional.”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I?” Rio purred, satisfaction dripping from every syllable.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Ms. Harkness!</em>” the librarian’s voice cracked through the air like a whip, her glare slicing over her glasses with the precision of a dagger. “Do I need to ask you to leave?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened abruptly, clearing her throat. “No,” she said quickly, jaw clenched. “I’ll be quiet.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned away, laughing softly as she dropped into the chair beside her with the ease of someone who believed she belonged anywhere. She tucked a leg beneath her, smirking as she balanced on the edge, completely at home in Agatha’s discontent.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fun when you’re flustered,” she murmured, biting her lip. “I should do this more often.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, breathing through her nose like she was about to commit a felony. “If I ignore you, will you go away?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed thoughtfully. “Unlikely.” She reached for another book, flipping it open without glancing at the title. “But feel free to try. Watching you pretend I’m not here is incredibly entertaining.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head drop into her hands, fingers pressing into her temples. Her voice was low, strained. “You told me you couldn’t tell me anything. That it wasn’t allowed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly.” Rio propped her boots up on the edge of the table, her movements slow and unapologetic. She pulled a small nail file from her pocket, examining her fingers with the disinterest of someone who already knew she was winning. “But you called me. Which means I can play with the boundaries.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Then why say you’d answer anything?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced up from her nails, her smirk never wavering. “Because I will answer. It just might not be in a language you understand.” She blew on her nails and examined them. “But hey, you’re smart. Might be fun to see you try.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s sigh was long and sharp, like a valve releasing steam before she exploded. She turned back to the thick, yellowed tome splayed before her — the fragile pages etched with Latin phrases and chaotic sketches of hooded figures and skeletal forms. Her fingers hovered over a passage detailing Death’s presence during the Black Plague. Something about cold winds. Unseen eyes. A presence that arrived before breath left the lungs.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you appear to some people and not others?” she asked, her voice careful.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look up from filing her nails. “Imagine explaining to your dear friend Wanda that you’re seeing Death. That’s why. I only appear to those who are dying, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched at the bluntness. Her heartbeat quickened. “But I’m not <em>dying</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled. The nail file stopped mid-stroke. Then, slowly, she set it down. Her lips curved into a knowing, dangerous smile. Her voice dropped to a velvet murmur.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah… but you <em>did</em> die.”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned back in her chair, folding her arms across her chest, letting the silence linger between them like bait.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She turned to her, eyes wide. “What do you mean, I died? <em>When</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the soft golden light of the library catching the edge of her cheekbone like a halo, or a warning. “You’re clever,” she said, her tone syrupy and mocking. “Figure it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, heart pounding. Her palms were slick. The overhead lights buzzed faintly, as if the universe itself leaned in to hear what she’d say next. But Rio simply reclined, arms behind her head, smiling as if she held every secret in the world, and Agatha was just now beginning to realize how many of them were about her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped the book shut with a sharp thud, the sound echoing through the vaulted hush of the library like a gunshot. Heads turned briefly, but she didn’t care. Her glare was laser-focused on Rio, who remained impossibly composed, perched like a queen bored of her court.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha growled, her voice low and furious. “Let’s try this. Why do you care about me and my family? Why are you still here?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a single brow, her smirk softening into something that looked almost… introspective. Her tone shifted, warmer, lower, as if laced with genuine gravity. “Because your family is closer to me than most,” she said, gaze never leaving Agatha’s face. “Closer than they should be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, the words sinking like cold lead into her gut. “What does that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“It means,” Rio continued, taking a slow, predatory step closer, “you’re not tangled up in this because of bad luck, Agatha. There’s more at play here than you realize. This isn’t random. <em>You’re chosen</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The table creaked under Agatha’s weight as she leaned forward, the tension in her body crackling just beneath the surface. Her voice trembled with frustration. “Then <em>explain</em>! Stop talking in circles like this is some twisted riddle!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mask cracked just slightly. Her calm, cool air gave way to a sliver of restrained emotion—tension pulling tight across her shoulders, her mouth set firm, the corners twitching with something she didn’t let spill.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you,” she said, her voice lower now, more commanding, “I <em>can’t</em> give you direct answers. There are rules. <em>Chains</em>. And I wear them better than most, but they’re there.”</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer, her boots whispering against the wood. She stopped just beside Agatha, her voice brushing against her skin like silk drawn across a blade. “But I’m here for a reason, and so are you. Now, if you’re done interrogating me, maybe ask yourself why you keep coming back to these books. Why you need to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands curled into fists again, the edge of the table digging into her palms. She didn’t answer. She couldn’t. The truth was an ache in her throat she didn’t want to name.</p><p> </p><p>Rio paced slowly, circling her again like a tide, inescapable, slow, seductive. Her presence filled every inch of Agatha’s senses: the soft rasp of her boots, the barely-there scent of lilac and ash, the way the air seemed to shift when she moved.</p><p> </p><p>“You keep digging into these dusty old pages,” Rio murmured, her tone almost sing-song, teasing. “Reading about Death in plagues, in myths, in tragedies. But you’re not just curious.”</p><p> </p><p>She stopped behind Agatha and leaned in, her breath a warm ghost across Agatha’s ear. Her voice was intimate now, sultry and dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not looking for answers. You’re looking for <em>me</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The words ignited something in Agatha’s chest, a flare of heat that shot straight down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>With a sudden motion, she shoved the book shut again and stood, her chair groaning in protest. “Enough, Rio.” Her voice shook, part fury, part something else she refused to name. “I don’t have time for your riddles. Either help me or leave me alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the amusement returning, slow and wicked. “Oh, but you love my company,” she said, stepping into Agatha’s space without hesitation. “Admit it. Even if I annoy you. Even if I frustrate you. You want me here. Why do you think that is, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to face her, jaw tight, eyes blazing. “You’re insufferable. That’s why.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio placed a hand over her heart in mock offense, the motion graceful and theatrical. “Insufferable? Me? I’m being helpful.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not helping,” Agatha snapped, stepping forward, their bodies almost brushing now. “You’re dancing around every question. You appear out of nowhere, refuse to leave, and act like this is all some game.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile faltered, not gone, but changed. It became something deeper. More dangerous. She stepped closer still, until their breath mingled, until Agatha could see the quiet intensity simmering behind those dark, ancient eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s <em>not a game</em>,” Rio said, voice low and lethal. “You think I enjoy this? Being here? Bound to you like this? I’m not here because I want to be. I’m here because <em>you brought me back</em>. And until <em>you</em> figure out why, neither of us is going anywhere.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her spine pressing back against the table. The weight of those words dropped hard in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t ask for this,” she said quietly, but there was no conviction in it. Only guilt. Regret.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, not quite kind, but understanding. “Didn’t you?” she said gently. “Every whispered prayer. Every desperate plea. Every night you begged for change, for freedom, for something real. You may not remember, but some part of you does know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched. Her pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Knows what?” she demanded, her voice a whisper, hoarse.</p><p> </p><p>“That we’ve done this before,” Rio said. “And we’ll do it again, until you’re ready to understand.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, the room held its breath. Even the books seemed to hush.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio pulled away, the tension in her body unraveling like a bow being untied. She perched herself back on the edge of the table, effortlessly elegant, a wicked glint returning to her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Take your time, darling,” she said with a slow smile, twirling the nail file between her fingers again like a weapon she didn’t need to use. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at her, fury and confusion churning in her gut, before she snatched the book from the table and turned on her heel. Her footsteps echoed as she stormed down the aisle, heart pounding, throat tight.</p><p>And from behind her, Rio’s voice followed like smoke curling through keyholes, soft, amused, and impossible to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll talk again soon, Agatha,” she purred. “I’ll make sure of it. <em>Te veo.</em>”</p><p> </p>

<p>The late afternoon sun bled through the tall windows of Agatha’s living room, casting long, golden shafts of light across the hardwood floor. Dust hung in the beams like suspended time, and everything felt too quiet, <em>too heavy.</em> The couch’s fabric itched against her palms as she sat stiffly, back straight, hands clasped tight in her lap. On either side of her, her children sat unnaturally still.</p><p>Nicole, usually full of side-eye and snark, stared down at her knees, her fingers anxiously tugging at a loose thread on her shirt. Nick, half-leaning against Agatha's arm, held his breath like he was trying not to exist. Both of them watched the officers standing in front of them as though waiting for a verdict.</p><p> </p><p>One of the officers, an older man with a kind face half-hidden behind a graying beard, cleared his throat, shifting the clipboard in his hands. “Mrs. Harkness, we understand this isn’t easy,” he said gently. “But we need to go over a few more details about Ralph’s disappearance.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. Her lips were dry, and she tasted the coppery tang of anxiety at the back of her throat. “Of course, Officer Daniels,” she said, her voice even but brittle. “Ask what you need to.”</p><p> </p><p>The younger officer beside him, a woman with short dark hair and sharp, calculating eyes, flipped open her notepad. Her gaze flicked from Agatha to Nicole and back again, missing nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve been reviewing the timeline again. Ralph was last seen about six months ago, correct? Around the time you were hospitalized for food poisoning?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once, tightly. “Yes,” she said, careful. Measured. “I was in the hospital for two days. Ralph had gone out to pick up groceries... and I never saw him again.”</p><p> </p><p>She could still remember the moment clearly, lying in that sterile hospital bed, nausea clenching her stomach, and the eerie, oppressive silence that followed. No calls. No visits. <em>But being watched</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole shifted beside her. The couch cushion creaked under her small, nervous movements. “Do you think he’s…?” Her voice cracked, too thin to finish the sentence.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dead</strong>. The word hung there, thick and silent, like fog.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not drawing conclusions yet,” Officer Daniels said gently, giving the girl a reassuring nod. “But it’s been a significant amount of time without contact or leads.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick looked up, his wide, dark eyes brimming with something too complicated for his age. “Are you going to arrest my mom?”</p><p> </p><p>The question sliced through the room like a knife. Agatha’s body jerked, her head snapping toward him. “Nick,” she said sharply, cheeks flushing. “Don’t say that.”</p><p> </p><p>The young officer smiled, but it was a tight, forced thing. “No, of course not,” she said. “We’re just gathering information right now. These things take time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, a controlled breath to push down the panic rising like bile in her throat. Her pulse pounded in her temples, and she could feel Rio’s presence, like a whisper at the edge of her thoughts. She could sense her. Somewhere in the house. <em>Watching. Listening.</em> Feeding off this.</p><p> </p><p>She did this, Agatha thought. This is her chaos. Her mess. And mine to clean.</p><p> </p><p>“Is there anything else you remember, Mrs. Harkness?” Officer Daniels asked, snapping her back into the moment. His eyes were kind, but searching. “Anything unusual Ralph might’ve said or done before he disappeared?”</p><p> </p><p>Her mind flicked through a thousand images. A cold look across the dinner table. The way his voice snapped just before she doubled over in pain. The moment she realized he knew she was going to get sick. And Rio’s voice, You wished for it to end. So I ended it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her fists in her lap. Her nails bit into her palms.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said finally, forcing the word through clenched teeth. “Nothing unusual. He was his normal self.”</p><p> </p><p>The younger officer looked up, her eyes narrowing just slightly. “We noticed some tension between you two,” she said carefully. “Statements from neighbors suggest arguments, about finances, time spent away from home… anything like that escalate?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She could feel her children tense beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“We had disagreements,” she said flatly. “Like any couple. But nothing extreme.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. A beat too long.</p><p> </p><p>Then Officer Daniels nodded slowly, jotting something down. The tension in the room crackled like static.</p><p>Nicole leaned a little closer to Agatha, and Agatha could feel her daughter’s gaze flicker to her face, searching for something solid to hold onto. Nick stayed quiet, but his small hand crept into Agatha’s lap and curled around hers.</p><p> </p><p>She squeezed back. She couldn’t protect them from everything. But she could lie to keep them safe.</p><p> </p><p>Behind them, somewhere beyond the walls and the careful silence, she swore she heard the faint sound of a soft laugh, lazy, feminine, and cruel.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked toward the hallway. Her voice when it came was calm, composed, but laced with steel.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole crossed her arms, her body tense, her voice a bitter whisper that cut through the thick air. “He wasn’t exactly a great dad,” she muttered, her eyes flicking toward her mother with equal parts defiance and weariness.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicole,” Agatha snapped quietly, her tone sharp and immediate, slicing through the tension like a whip. Her glare was brief but unmistakable. Not now.</p><p> </p><p>The two officers exchanged a quick glance, some silent agreement passing between them, a note of interest logged without needing words. But before either of them could follow up, a sound broke through the silence.</p><p> </p><p>Laughter. Soft, distant. Dripping with mockery. It floated down from upstairs like a ghost’s breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Her blood iced over in an instant. Her pulse stuttered. Her body went rigid, fingers curling into fists where they rested against her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>The younger officer’s eyes sharpened, already stepping forward. “Did you hear that?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s probably just the pipes,” Agatha said, too fast, her voice strained at the edges. She forced a short, brittle chuckle. “This house is old. It groans like it’s alive sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole and Nick shifted nervously beside her. Nick reached out instinctively, his small fingers brushing the back of Agatha’s hand. Nicole pressed her lips together, not buying the excuse, but not daring to say more in front of strangers.</p><p> </p><p>Officer Daniels hesitated, clearly unconvinced, but unwilling to push. “Mrs. Harkness,” he said slowly, his voice dipping into something almost sympathetic, “if you remember anything — anything at all — you need to let us know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rose, smoothing her skirt with trembling hands, concealing the tension in every breath. “I will,” she said. “Thank you, officers.”</p><p> </p><p>The front door clicked shut behind them. The moment it did, the house seemed to exhale, like it had been holding its breath the whole time. Silence pressed in again, heavy, suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole turned to her mother, her voice low, loaded. “Mom… was it her?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. Instead, she moved slowly toward the stairs, her bare feet almost soundless against the polished wood floor. Her hands were trembling.</p><p>She stopped at the bottom step. The air was colder now, thick with her presence. That scent again: lilac and ash, sweet and ancient.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>!” she hissed, barely above a whisper, her voice cracking with fury. “Where are you?”</p><p> </p><p>No reply. But Agatha knew better. The silence wasn’t absence, it was intention.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom?” Nick’s voice was soft. Fragile. He tugged at the hem of her sleeve. “Is everything okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a smile so strained it felt like it might shatter her jaw. She crouched, smoothing back his hair, pressing a kiss to his temple. “It’s fine, baby. Go upstairs. Both of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole hovered for a moment longer, brows pinched together in quiet suspicion. But after a glance at her little brother, she grabbed his hand and led him up the stairs without another word. Their footsteps faded with each step, until only silence remained.</p><p> </p><p>And then, like smoke sliding from shadow, she appeared.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned lazily against the bannister of the staircase, one leg crossed over the other, fingers trailing along the railing as if admiring her own entrance. She looked effortless, stunning, wrapped in a dark silk robe over a lace bodysuit that was entirely too inappropriate for the setting. Her lips curled into a smirk so sharp it felt like a blade pressed to Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss me?” she purred, head tilted, a glint of something cruel dancing in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body coiled with fury. Her arms crossed as if holding herself together. “What the hell was that?” she snapped, her voice trembling with the effort to stay low. “<em>Are you trying to get me arrested?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk widened as she descended a step, her voice as soft as it was infuriating. “Please, darling. If I wanted you arrested, I’d let them find what’s left of Ralph in the crawlspace.” She paused, then added with mock innocence, “Oh wait, there’s nothing left.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. Her fists balled at her sides.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved in, slow and deliberate, her bare feet silent against the staircase. “That laugh?” she whispered, voice sliding over Agatha’s skin like a lover’s hand. “That was just a reminder. A little heartbeat in the walls. A taste of what happens when you keep pretending this isn’t real.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her ground, even as Rio stepped onto the same level, their bodies just inches apart. The heat between them was unbearable. She could smell her now, sweet and smoky, dizzying and maddening.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re reckless,” Agatha hissed. “My children were right there.”</p><p> </p><p>“And yet, you lied for me,” Rio whispered, her tone molten. “Defended me. Protected us.” She leaned closer, her lips grazing Agatha’s ear. “<em>You’re mine</em>, Aggie. And you always will be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She hated her body for responding, heart pounding, heat crawling up her spine, every nerve aware of Rio’s proximity.</p><p> </p><p>“I should hate you,” she whispered, trembling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled against her skin, her voice a dark promise. “Oh, you do. Just not enough.”</p><p> </p><p>“They could’ve taken me!” Agatha hissed, her voice barely above a whisper but brimming with venom. Her fists trembled at her sides, her whole body taut like a drawn bow. “Arrested me. <em>In front of the kids!”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laughter spilled from her lips like silk sliding over steel, soft, smooth, and laced with mockery. She leaned against the banister with an effortless grace that made Agatha’s rage feel clumsy and hot-blooded by comparison. “Relax, darling,” she purred, crossing her arms slowly over her chest. “I was just having a little fun. Those cops wouldn’t believe you even if you told them the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “How do you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, her dark hair slipping over one shoulder, voice low and mocking. “Because, Agatha, the truth sounds insane. ‘<em>The embodiment of Death took my husband and now she’s haunting my house’</em>? Really? They’d have you in a straitjacket before you could finish the sentence.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched so tight it ached. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms. “You took him, didn’t you?” she spat, stepping forward. Her voice cracked with the weight of everything she’d been trying not to say. “Ralph. You took him.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s playful smirk flickered, like a candle caught in a breeze. It didn’t vanish entirely, but her gaze sharpened, settled, steady now, darker. “He was annoying, yes,” she said, her voice cool and smooth as polished stone. “But you know I don’t take anyone who isn’t <em>ready</em>. Ralph’s disappearance isn’t on me... not entirely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “Then what happened to him?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a shrug that was too casual, too perfect, like it had been rehearsed. “That’s something you’ll have to figure out for yourself, darling.” She took a slow step closer, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. “But let’s just say... your little wish for him to disappear? It didn’t go unheard.”</p><p> </p><p>Those words hit like a slap.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned, a sharp twist of guilt and horror and helplessness. Her lungs felt too small. Her vision tunneled. “I never meant —” she started, voice breaking, but Rio cut her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t you?” she asked, softly now, almost sympathetically. “Even if it was just for a moment, with your head buried in your hands, choking on bitterness. You thought it. And darling…” she smiled, stepping into her space, “I hear everything.”</p><p> </p><p>The heat in Agatha’s chest turned to fire. She surged forward, grabbed the front of Rio’s silk blouse, and yanked her close. Their faces were inches apart, breaths mingling, eyes locked.</p><p> </p><p>“Where is he, Rio?!” Agatha growled, her voice shaking, her grip tight and trembling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled with amusement, but the corners of her mouth twitched into something darker. She didn’t resist, didn’t even flinch. Instead, she grinned, slow and dangerous. “Careful, darling,” she murmured, her tone suddenly thick with suggestion. “Don’t make me fall in love with you. <em>Again.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned. “Rio, I swear to God—”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said, cutting her off. And for once, the smile faded completely. Her voice was calm. Flat. Honest.</p><p> </p><p>“Li—”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, ah, ah.” Rio raised a finger between them, resting it gently against Agatha’s lips. The touch was feather-light, but it made Agatha freeze. “Before you accuse me of lying, remember, I can’t. <em>It’s against the rules</em>, my dear.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slapped her hand away, her chest heaving. “He’s the father of my children,” she spat, voice raw.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched an elegant brow, the smirk sliding back into place like it had never left. “Technically and biologically,” she said, her tone mock-casual, “<em>I’m the father</em> of your children.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face froze in disbelief. Her eyes widened. “What—?”</p><p> </p><p>Before she could think, her hands jerked, giving Rio a sharp shake, nothing painful, but violent enough to crack the illusion of calm between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio threw her head back and laughed, the sound rich and delighted. “What?” she said breathlessly. “I’m just saying!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to kill myself,” Agatha muttered, stumbling back from her, hands trembling, pressing them into her forehead like she could push the moment out of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Rio straightened her shirt, completely unbothered, and adjusted her collar with the air of someone having far too much fun. “Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” she cooed. “You’d just end up back with me faster.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, needing the distance, her hands pressed against the nearest wall like it was the only thing keeping her upright. Her chest ached. Her mind spun. “You’re impossible,” she whispered, barely able to speak. “You just stand here, making jokes, while my life — my family — falls apart.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak right away. When she did, her voice had changed. Softer. Still sensual, still teasing, but layered now, like honey poured over something deeper.</p><p> </p><p>“Darling,” she said, stepping behind Agatha, just close enough for her presence to be felt. “Your life isn’t falling apart. It’s rearranging itself.”</p><p> </p><p>She reached out slowly, one fingertip brushing a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s neck. The touch was too gentle. Too careful.</p><p> </p><p>“Painfully?” she continued, her voice a warm hum. “Yes. Messily? Absolutely. But sometimes... things have to break before they can be put back together.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, but said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not comforting,” she finally muttered, her tone brittle, distant.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand lingered, just barely touching the curve of her shoulder. “It wasn’t meant to be,” she said, voice like velvet stretched thin over something sharp. “But you’ll figure this out, Agatha. You’re stronger than you think.” A pause. “Even if you don’t see it yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there, staring blankly ahead, her throat tight, her heart unsteady. And Rio just smiled behind her, patient. Waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood rooted at the bottom of the stairs, arms crossed tightly over her chest like a shield. Her fingers dug into the soft knit of her sweater, nails pressing crescents into the skin beneath. The dim light from the hallway above cast long shadows across the floor, pooling around her feet like tension made visible. Her eyes were locked on Rio, burning with frustration, her jaw clenched tight enough to ache.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not as helpful as you think you are,” she said coldly, the words laced with exhaustion and something deeper, fear, maybe, or longing she refused to name.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled softly, stepping forward with a lazy grace that made Agatha want to scream. Barefoot, each movement soundless, sensual — deliberate. Her robe slipped slightly off one shoulder, revealing just enough skin to be distracting without being indecent, and she clearly knew it. Every step brought that scent closer — warm skin, lilac, something unplaceably ancient.</p><p> </p><p>“And yet,” Rio murmured, voice like velvet soaked in smoke, “you keep pulling me closer every time. What does that say about you, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes shimmered with mischief and challenge, glinting beneath the soft golden glow of the hallway sconces. There was no cruelty in her tone, but there was power — calculated, restrained, and wielded with precision.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to snap back, ready to tear her apart with whatever sharp words she had left in her, but stopped herself just as quickly. Her lips parted, then pressed into a firm line. She couldn’t think straight with Rio standing there — so close, so calm, so in control. Her heartbeat was too loud in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she turned, spine rigid, and started up the stairs with quick, angry steps. “I don’t have time for this,” she muttered under her breath, more to herself than to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s voice followed her, effortlessly composed, with that maddening, light-as-air tone that always made Agatha feel like she was one step behind.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me know when you want to continue our little therapy sessions,” she called, amusement curling at the edges of each word. “I’m always here for you, darling. <em>Te veo</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused at the landing, one hand braced on the railing, her back to Rio. Her body tensed as if debating whether to turn around, whether to yell, cry, or fall apart completely. But she didn’t give her the satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>She climbed the rest of the stairs in silence, teeth grinding, heart thudding. Behind her, Rio stood at the base of the steps, her smile slow and certain, watching the woman she’d been bound to for lifetimes walk away again, pretending it meant nothing. <em>Knowing it meant everything</em>.</p><hr/><p>Agatha descended the stairs with brisk, purposeful steps, her fingers gripping the banister like she might snap it off if it gave her even the slightest resistance. Her breath was sharp in her chest, her jaw set in a tight line. All she wanted was distance, just a sliver of normalcy, a moment to gather herself. But normal had left this house a long time ago.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced back over her shoulder. Of course.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was right behind her, as always. Her bare feet made no sound on the wooden steps, her pace unhurried, almost amused. The contrast between Agatha’s tension and Rio’s elegance was maddening.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha stepped into the living room, her pulse skipping with irritation, Rio had already claimed the couch like a throne. She lounged languidly between Nicole and Nick, one arm draped lazily over the backrest, her legs tucked underneath her like a lounging cat. She wore a smirk that had no business being so natural on the lips of Death.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted to her children.</p><p> </p><p>Nick leaned against Rio’s side, utterly at ease, grinning as if this were just another Saturday morning. Nicole sat with her legs crossed, chatting comfortably, as though she weren’t casually sharing the couch with the end of all things. The sight sent a hot, crawling sensation across Agatha’s skin, rage, disbelief, and something deeper... a flicker of fear.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to make dinner,” Agatha said, her voice controlled but tight as piano wire. She turned sharply, heading toward the kitchen, needing to move, to do something. She stopped in the doorway and turned just slightly, her gaze cutting toward Rio. Her voice was flat, too casual to be casual. “Do you... eat? I mean, do you eat food? Human food?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, now stretched belly-down across the back of the couch like a lounging cat, rested her chin on her hands and tilted her head, her eyes sparkling with amusement. “Human and non-human,” she said lightly. “Technically, I don’t need sustenance like you mortals, but I do find the idea of a family dinner amusing. Sitting around a table, passing bowls of things. Tension simmering over casseroles. It’s... quaint.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled tightly around the doorway, her knuckles pale. “So... that’s a yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin widened as she winked. “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha muttered, already turning away. Her footsteps hit the tile harder than necessary. “Dinner with Death. Wonderful. Just another normal day.”</p><p> </p><p>The kitchen was cooler, quieter, but only marginally. The air carried faint notes of old garlic and citrus cleaner, but it did little to soothe her frayed nerves. She yanked open the fridge, pulled out ingredients with clipped movements. Tomatoes. Chicken. An onion that she nearly crushed in her grip. Every slice of the knife hit the cutting board like punctuation.</p><p> </p><p>From the living room came the sound of Nick’s excited voice, high and bright with joy.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, do you like dinosaurs? Because I have this awesome T-Rex toy upstairs, and he’s super cool!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, knife mid-chop.</p><p> </p><p>“I do love a good T-Rex,” Rio replied, her voice warm, playful. “Strong, determined… though I’ve met a few who were rather dramatic about their extinction.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick giggled like it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole chimed in, dry and amused. “What about people who think they’re the center of the universe?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, darling,” Rio said with a theatrical sigh, “I’ve met plenty of those.” Her voice curved around the words like silk, and then she added with a glance toward the kitchen, “Some even cook dinner like they’re being watched by fate itself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip on the knife tightened, her lips pressed into a razor-thin line. She chopped a bell pepper like it had personally offended her.</p><p>The sizzle of oil in the pan couldn’t drown out the laughter from the other room. The clatter of utensils couldn’t mute the sight that played over and over again in her head, Rio, not just lingering in the periphery of her world, but nestled into the heart of it. Trusted. Loved by her children.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest ached, a slow coil of guilt and helplessness wrapping tight around her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>“Just get through dinner,” she muttered to herself, voice barely audible over the crackling oil. “Just survive dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>But even as she said it, she knew, Death didn’t just visit. <em>She moved in</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Nick climbed up onto the couch with the graceless energy only a child could pull off, legs folding beneath him as he settled beside Rio like it was the most natural thing in the world. He looked up at her, eyes wide and bright, face flushed from excitement and warmth. The cartoon on the TV continued to flash colors across the room, but his attention was fully on her.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re friends with Mom,” he asked curiously, “does that mean you’ve known her for a really long time?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head toward him, her dark eyes catching the light, glinting with quiet amusement. A knowing smile played at her lips as she tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. “Oh, sweetie,” she said, her voice smooth and velvet-soft, “your mom and I go way back. Longer than even she remembers.”</p><p> </p><p>On the other end of the couch, Nicole gave a small scoff, though there was no real sarcasm behind it. She folded her arms and leaned back, head tilting slightly. “That’s hard to believe. Mom walks around like she’s got her entire life catalogued and under control. You’re saying there’s stuff even she doesn’t know?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, a rich, warm sound that melted into the soft hum of the living room. Her fingers tapped lightly on her knee. “Oh, your mom knows plenty. But there are some... chapters of her story that haven’t quite come back to her yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick’s face lit up, legs bouncing beneath him. “So that means you’re like... a superhero or something?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole rolled her eyes, but it was playful. “She’s not a superhero, dork. If anything, she’s like... the mysterious aunt who shows up in black leather and sunglasses and makes all the neighbors nervous.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a hand to her chest in faux offense, her expression dramatic. “Excuse me, I am always the most interesting person at the party. And I don’t even need sunglasses to prove it.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick giggled, inching closer. “So what do you do then? For real?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated — just a flicker of something crossing her features, her smile dimming as her tone dropped into something more intimate. “I... help people find what they’re looking for,” she said gently. “Even if they don’t know they’re looking yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole raised an eyebrow, her voice softening into something almost teasing. “That’s vague. Are you like, I don’t know, a therapist?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, brushing a strand of hair from her face as she leaned forward, arms resting on her thighs. “Let’s just say I specialize in endings... and beginnings.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick tilted his head, one hand resting on her arm now, completely at ease. “Like when a book ends and you find another one to read?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to look at him fully, her expression warming. “Exactly, sweetheart. You’re a clever little one, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole smiled, and the teasing left her tone. She watched Rio with an odd fondness, the kind that didn’t come from just knowing someone, but from recognizing them in a deeper way.</p><p> </p><p>“So you’re not just here for Mom,” she said, almost as a statement. “You’re here for us, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, her gaze flickering toward the kitchen where Agatha was still moving noisily around, the clatter of pots underscoring the hum of domestic chaos. For a moment, her features softened completely. She leaned back slowly, exhaling through her nose.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just say,” she murmured, “your family is... special. You’re more connected to me than most. That makes you important.”</p><p> </p><p>“Important like superheroes?” Nick said eagerly, throwing his arms up with an exaggerated grin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed and pulled him into a side hug, kissing the top of his hair. “Sure, baby. Just like superheroes.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole leaned against the arm of the couch, gaze thoughtful. “Do you think Mom will ever remember everything?”</p><p> </p><p>“She will,” Rio said, her voice certain, her fingers absently brushing Nick’s curls. “When she’s ready.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole nodded slowly. Then, after a beat, she said softly, almost shyly, “You’re a little dramatic sometimes, Mama.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p> </p><p>She stopped mid-motion. The moment hung, suspended between a heartbeat and the next. Her eyes widened just slightly, not with shock, but with something else. Something far more tender.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips parted. “You… Can't you repeat that?”</p><p> </p><p>But Nicole didn’t repeat it. She just smiled faintly, her gaze drifting back to the TV.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared for a breath too long, her throat tightening as she blinked away something suspiciously close to emotion. Her hand curled around Nick just a little tighter, and when she finally spoke again, her voice was quiet, warm.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” she murmured, “I suppose I do like the sound of that.”</p><p> </p><p>And from the kitchen, Agatha stood silently by the doorway, a wooden spoon in hand, unnoticed. Her eyes lingered on the three of them, her children curled against the most dangerous creature she’d ever known, and for a moment… safe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked through the cozy hum of the house like a whip: “Dinner’s ready! Get in here!”</p><p> </p><p>It shattered the moment in the living room, pulling everyone from the warmth of cartoons and low murmurs. Rio turned her head slowly, a grin unfurling across her lips as her dark eyes danced between the kids. “Looks like it’s time to see what your mom whipped up,” she said with a wink. “Shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick didn’t hesitate. He grabbed her hand, small fingers curling around hers as if they’d done it a hundred times before, and tugged her eagerly toward the dining room. His laughter echoed off the hallway walls.</p><p>Nicole trailed just a step behind, arms folded, her gaze locked on Rio’s back. Her expression was unreadable, sharp and quiet, a look that sat between intrigue and caution. She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t look away either.</p><p> </p><p>In the dining room, the warm scent of roasted vegetables and garlic filled the air, undercut by the faint citrus tang of the floor cleaner Agatha had used earlier, too harsh, too sterile, like she’d tried to scrub the day away. She was already at the table, laying plates down with more force than grace, the silverware clinking loudly against ceramic. Her shoulders were stiff, jaw clenched, and the fake calm stretched across her face was wearing thin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio entered last, still hand-in-hand with Nick, her bare feet silent on the hardwood. She looked around with an amused hum, taking it all in: the too-neat table, the simmering tension clinging to the walls like steam. She locked eyes with Agatha just as the final plate landed on the table with a sharp clack.</p><p> </p><p>“This should be fun,” she murmured, sliding into the seat between the kids with a catlike smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner started in a quiet lull. Forks clinked against plates. Nick hummed between bites, swinging his legs under the table. Agatha didn’t look up. Her eyes stayed trained on her food, chewing mechanically, as if pretending hard enough could will Rio out of existence.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, looked completely at ease. She sat back with the kind of confidence that came from knowing she was the most interesting person in the room. She cut her chicken slowly, delicately, savoring every bite like it was a performance meant just for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Then Nicole, casual as air, reached across the table and said, “<em>Mama</em>, can you pass the salad?”</p><p> </p><p>Everything stopped. Agatha’s hand froze halfway to her glass, the word hitting her like a slap. Her heart stuttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, blinking in surprise. For a breath, her smirk faded, replaced by something softer, quieter. Her eyes met Nicole’s, and her voice caught ever so slightly before she recovered.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” she said with a smile that trembled just at the corners. “Of course, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>But at the same moment, Agatha reached for the salad bowl too. Their hands touched. Flesh against flesh. Warm. Electric.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked her hand back like she’d touched fire. Her chair scraped violently against the hardwood as she recoiled, breath catching in her throat. She choked on a mouthful of food, eyes wide as panic surged through her.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom?” Nicole leaned forward.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha coughed, gagging, hand clutching at the edge of the table. Rio moved before anyone else could.</p><p> </p><p>She was behind Agatha in a flash, one arm around her midsection, the other bracing her with practiced strength. “Hold still, darling,” she whispered into Agatha’s ear, her voice a calm undercurrent of control.</p><p> </p><p>Three firm compressions. Then Agatha sputtered, the bite of food dislodging onto her plate, saliva on her chin, breath coming in sharp gasps. She leaned over the table, both hands braced against the wood, her face flushed deep red.</p><p> </p><p>“Better?” Rio asked, brushing a hand down Agatha’s back like one might soothe a panicked animal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waved her off, her voice raw. “Yes... thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped back without gloating, her touch vanishing like smoke. She returned to her seat with graceful ease, wiped her hands on a napkin, and picked up her fork again, as if nothing had happened.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wasn’t done.</p><p> </p><p>She turned toward Nicole, her voice cracking with the weight of everything that had just erupted. “<em>She’s not your mother</em>!”</p><p> </p><p>The words hit like a thunderclap.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole flinched, but only slightly. She sat up straighter, her face defiant. “<em>She is</em>!” she snapped, voice rising. “I look like her, don’t I? You’ve said it yourself, Mom!”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t mean anything,” Agatha fired back, her eyes wild. “It’s coincidence. It’s genetics—”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole slammed her hand on the table. “It does too! I’ve seen her before!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. “What are you talking about?” she said slowly, her voice hushed now, like she was afraid of the answer. “You couldn’t have seen her before. That’s impossible. You're imagining things!”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole looked away for the first time, her voice quieter. “I used to talk to her when I was little. In my room. I didn’t know her name then... but I knew her.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat silently between them, eyes calm, watching the storm she hadn't created, but had never tried to stop. She glanced at Nicole, her expression unreadable but tinged with warmth, then looked to Agatha, something unspoken passing between them. Something deeper than fury. Older than rage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sank into her chair, her body suddenly heavy.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole sat up straighter, her hands curled into small, pale fists on the edge of the table, eyes fixed on her mother with unshakable resolve. “I saw her,” she said, voice steady and unflinching. “When Father yelled at you about my crib being too expensive. She was standing by the door. She looked at me and told me everything was going to be okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. “What?” she whispered, her voice barely audible, trembling like a leaf caught in the wind. “That’s... that’s impossible, Nicky. You were...” her voice cracked, “you were <em>inside me</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>But Nicole didn’t flinch. She didn’t soften. Her voice only grew more certain. “Not for her, Mom. She told me you were upset. And I didn’t like it. I started kicking because I was scared. I didn’t understand why you were sad, but I knew something was wrong. Then I saw her. She wasn’t in the room with you. She was in a forest...”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s eyes flicked toward Rio, who remained perfectly still, her hands folded in her lap, gaze steady and unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>“She said if I stopped kicking, she’d play with me someday,” Nicole continued. “And I did. I stopped. Because she made me feel... safe.”</p><p> </p><p>The room went silent. Even the clinking of forks had stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Nick, who normally couldn’t sit still for more than a minute, sat frozen in his seat, his fork still hovering in midair. His eyes were wide as saucers, flicking between his sister, his mother, and the calm, dark presence of Rio, who watched it all unfold without a word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand came up slowly, instinctively, pressing to her mouth as emotion surged through her like a tide. Her fingers trembled. The kitchen light above flickered once, unnoticed.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t breathe. Her mind dragged her backward through time, unbidden—</p><p> </p><p>That day.</p><p>
<em>The nursery wasn’t finished. The walls still unpainted, the floor littered with unopened boxes and empty promises. She had been kneeling beside the half-assembled dresser, her back aching, one hand absently stroking her swollen belly, when Ralph burst through the doorway.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>His voice was loud. Angry.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>“You used my card for that overpriced piece of wood?” he barked, waving the receipt like a weapon. “You think we can afford this shit? You think you’re the only one that matters now just because you're carrying it?”</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p><em>He didn’t say </em>her<em>. He said </em>it<em>.</em></p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha didn’t respond. She barely heard him. The baby was kicking hard, rhythmic bursts like tiny fists hammering from inside. Not just movement, panic.</em>

</p><p><em>She wrapped both arms around her belly, trying to still the frantic rhythm, trying to soothe the child who didn’t yet have words, only fear. She whispered nonsense, soft things: </em>It’s okay, baby. I’ve got you. I’ve got you. <em>But it didn’t stop.</em></p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Until...</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>It did.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Suddenly, utterly.</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p><em>Like a hush had fallen across her womb. The air had stilled. The pounding in her chest quieted. </em>Peace<em>.</em></p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p><em>A strange, enveloping stillness had wrapped around her and the child inside her. A warmth, not hers. Not from the house. Something older. Calmer. As if another presence had taken her daughter into invisible arms and </em><em>said, </em>shh. I’m here.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Rio</em></strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked back to the present, eyes stinging with tears. Her heart thundered in her chest, her limbs heavy with disbelief and something far more dangerous: <em>recognition</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Across the table, Rio met her gaze. Calm. Composed. But there was something new in her eyes now, an unspoken <em>yes</em>. She didn’t need to say it.</p><p> </p><p>She had been there. She always had.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved her chair back abruptly. The scrape of wood against tile jolted Nick, who jumped in his seat. Agatha rose on trembling legs, swaying slightly as she found her footing. Her voice cracked as she forced the words out.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look at Rio again. She couldn’t. Her eyes burned. Her chest was too tight.</p><p> </p><p>She turned and left the dining room, each step up the stairs heavier than the last. Her legs barely obeyed her, the air in her lungs too thick, like she was breathing under water.</p><p> </p><p>In the hallway above, she closed the door to her bedroom behind her, leaned back against it, and finally let the tears fall, silent and hot, tracking down her cheeks as her hands came to cradle her belly in memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had held her child before she ever had. And somehow, that broke her more than anything else ever could.</p><hr/><p>Agatha sat hunched at the edge of her bed, elbows on her knees, face buried in her hands. Her breathing came in short, uneven bursts as if the weight in her chest had grown too heavy to lift. Her skin was warm and flushed, sticky with the salt of her tears, and the once-soft cotton of her sweater clung uncomfortably to her damp skin. The room felt too still — too intimate — as if the air itself were waiting for her to break.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t notice the door open.</p><p> </p><p>Not until the unmistakable sound of soft footsteps crossed the threshold like silk brushing over stone.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Her name, spoken low, smooth, and careful, curled around her spine like smoke. She looked up sharply, her tear-streaked face hardening instantly as her eyes locked on the figure in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing in here?” Agatha snapped, voice rough. “Get out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She stood calmly in the doorway, her usual amusement absent. No grin. No sharp edges in her voice. Just stillness. That unsettling, graceful calm that made Agatha want to scream.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re upset,” Rio said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“Brilliant observation,” Agatha shot back, whipping her head away as she turned her back to her. Her voice cracked with strain. “Leave me alone.”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio, inevitably, infuriatingly, didn’t move away. She stepped inside instead, shutting the door behind her with a soft click that felt final.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I’m not going to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, the anger bubbling again beneath her grief. “You’ve already done enough,” she spat, spinning around. Her eyes were glassy, her cheeks flushed and streaked, but her voice was fire. “My kids, my daughter, thinks you’re her mother. Do you even realize what that feels like? What it means to me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move from her spot near the wall. Her expression didn’t shift defensively. She absorbed the words like a stone absorbs rain, quietly, completely.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t ask for this,” she said, her voice like the edge of a lullaby. “I didn’t choose to be seen by them. They saw me because they could. Because they’re...” her eyes flicked downward for a beat, then back to Agatha, softer now, “connected to me in ways you don’t yet understand.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked a laugh, bitter and broken. “That doesn’t make it okay,” she snapped, standing abruptly. Her legs shook under her, but she didn’t falter. “You’ve been in their lives without my permission. Without my knowledge. Without my consent.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice shook, too thick with fury and grief to hold steady.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t falter. If anything, it grew... tender. No less commanding, but touched by something close to sorrow.</p><p> </p><p>“I was never here to harm them,” she said. “Or you. I'm here to help.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, wiping angrily at her face. “You’ve turned my life into a twisted myth,” she muttered. “You walk in and speak in riddles and pull apart everything I thought I knew. And you call that help?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a slow, deliberate step forward. Her voice dropped into something intimate, something rich with dark sweetness. “You’re scared,” she said, voice like velvet. “And I get it. But Agatha...” Another step. “You’ve been scared for a long time. Long before I ever came back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her eyes flicked up, meeting Rio’s. The air between them thickened. Her lips parted to argue, but the words never made it out. Instead, her shoulders sagged, slowly, like all the fight had been wrung out of her. She turned away again, but this time, she didn’t run. She didn’t shout.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at the floor, her voice small.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped closer, her bare feet soundless against the hardwood floor, the faint scent of ash and lilac wrapping around Agatha like a memory she hadn’t realized she missed. Her voice dropped lower, velvet-smooth, intimate enough to stir something fragile.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re carrying so much, Agatha,” she said, her breath brushing the space between them. “Too much. Let me help.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head shook once, sharply, as if trying to dislodge the very idea. “I don’t want your help,” she whispered, the words tight and cracking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved — not into a smirk, but into something far more dangerous: understanding. She stepped in until her presence filled the space behind Agatha like a second shadow, her voice a soft hum of inevitability.</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” she murmured against the nape of Agatha’s neck, just close enough that the warmth of her breath kissed skin. “You’ve been holding this alone for so long… you’ve forgotten how it feels to let someone in.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her hands rose to her face again, fingers trembling as they pressed into her cheeks. She wanted to scream. Or disappear. Or be held. She didn’t know which.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need you,” she said, her voice a tremor pretending to be defiance.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t need me,” Rio echoed, her tone calm, certain, laced with dangerous patience. “But right now… you could use someone.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence between them deepened, thick as velvet. Agatha’s shoulders rose and fell with shallow breaths, and for a moment, she stayed frozen, like a glass figure balanced on the edge of a shelf.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio lifted her hand and placed it gently on Agatha’s shoulder. It was nothing more than fingertips at first, barely a touch. But it was grounding. Anchoring. A silent command wrapped in care.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here,” Rio said, and there was no mockery in it. No riddles. Just her voice. Just her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood perfectly still, her pride fraying at the edges. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears, a wild rhythm behind her ribs. And then, slowly, with the resistance of someone who didn’t know how to be soft anymore, she turned.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes were red, lashes damp, mouth set in a line that wanted so badly to tremble. Her gaze flicked from Rio’s face to her outstretched arms, uncertain. Unwilling. Needing.</p><p> </p><p>For a long beat, she hesitated. And then she stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arms came around her instantly, no hesitation, no permission needed. She pulled Agatha in close, firm but careful, like she’d been waiting to do this for centuries. Her hand splayed across Agatha’s back, her thumb brushing in slow, calming circles. The other slid up to cradle the back of her head, fingers threading through her hair with gentle command.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body was stiff at first, her fists pressed against Rio’s chest. But that warmth,  so steady, so maddeningly familiar, seeped into her. She sagged into the hold, her forehead dropping to Rio’s collarbone as the tension in her spine began to dissolve.</p><p> </p><p>The room smelled like wood and lavender, and Rio. That distinct, otherworldly scent that clung to skin and memory and dreams. Agatha breathed it in like air after drowning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, resting her chin lightly against Agatha’s crown. “That’s it,” she whispered. “Let it go, love. Just for now.”</p><p> </p><p>Her tone wasn’t sweet, it was dominant, coaxing, commanding, and kind all at once.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands opened slowly, clutching the back of Rio’s shirt, her fingers curling into the silk. Her breathing slowed. The ache in her chest loosened, not gone, but lighter. <em>Bearable</em>. Neither of them spoke. The only sound was the low hum of Rio’s breathing, the occasional creak of the house settling around them, and Agatha’s quiet, uneven exhales against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed pressed against Rio, her forehead resting lightly against the dip where Rio’s collarbone met the soft curve of her shoulder. Her breath was shallow, trembling through parted lips, as if even the act of breathing was too vulnerable now. The warmth of Rio’s embrace soaked into her skin, her body betraying her by melting into it. And for a fleeting moment, it was quiet. Not the kind of quiet that left space for thought, but the kind that blurred reality, that made everything outside the room feel like static on a forgotten channel.</p><p> </p><p>But then she felt it.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t physical, not at first. It was a pulse, subtle, electric, buried deep under her skin like a memory rising from the bones. The kind of memory that doesn’t belong to any one moment, but lives in the body regardless. Her lungs faltered. Her chest tightened. The air thinned.</p><p> </p><p>Something was waking up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand moved slowly against her back, her fingertips dragging in slow, deliberate circles, grounding and hypnotic. The scent of her skin, wild earth and burnt sugar, filled Agatha’s lungs. Her touch wasn’t demanding, but it held weight, intention. It lingered with purpose.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re holding your breath,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear, the warmth of her breath threading over her skin like silk.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tensed. She jerked slightly in Rio’s arms, breath catching. Her heart beat harder, faster, and her body turned rigid, like a deer cornered between the urge to run and the desire to stay. She pulled back, not far, just enough to look up.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p> </p><p>That spark flared again, sharp and intimate, like a match being struck in a dark room. It wasn’t lust, not exactly. It was deeper than that. It was recognition. Like a word sitting on the tip of the tongue, begging to be remembered. Like a name written across time.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha lied, her voice shaky, brittle around the edges. She tried to step back, to sever the tether between them.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t move. Her arms remained, loose but certain, her dark eyes following Agatha’s every flicker, like she was memorizing her all over again. “You don’t have to pretend with me,” she said softly, her voice like velvet dragged across skin. “Not anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched again, and her pride twisted painfully. She hated how Rio’s voice, her hands, her gaze, could peel back every barrier she had carefully built. “I’m not pretending,” she managed to say, though it sounded like a child insisting they weren’t crying.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled, slow and knowing, her tone laced with fondness and just a hint of dominance. “You always were a terrible liar.”</p><p> </p><p>That sentence struck something inside her, sharp and disarming. It reached places Agatha had forgotten existed. She felt naked under it.</p><p> </p><p>“This,” she whispered, her voice almost inaudible, “this isn’t... it’s not...”</p><p> </p><p>“Not what?” Rio murmured, dipping her head slightly, her breath brushing across Agatha’s cheek. Her voice held that teasing restraint again, low and coaxing, like a hand sliding under silk sheets. “Not real? Not dangerous? Not familiar?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but no words came. Her mind tried to form protests, but they collapsed under the weight of Rio’s closeness. She couldn’t lie — not to her. Not when every cell in her body was betraying her calm facade.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop looking at me like that,” she breathed, voice fraying at the edges. “Like... like you know something I don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened, glinting with quiet fire. She tilted her head just slightly, a slow drag of her gaze over Agatha’s face. “Maybe I do,” she said, the words soft but molten. “Maybe I’ve always known.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest burned. Her fingers curled into fists, nails pressing crescent moons into her palms. She couldn’t take it. The way Rio looked at her like she belonged to her. Like she always had.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, with a jolt of desperation, she stepped back, freeing herself from Rio’s hold as if it had scalded her. She turned away, pressing a hand to her sternum, her palm flat against her hammering heart.</p><p> </p><p>“This is ridiculous,” she muttered. “This is insane.”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio remained still. Poised. Patient. But there was something softer now, something that lingered behind her teasing. A gentleness that carried power.</p><p> </p><p>“Is it?” she asked, voice quieter now, less silk and more shadow. “Or is it something you’ve known all along?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. Her hand trembled against her chest. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, you do.” Rio’s voice throbbed with certainty. “You feel it. That spark. That pull. You’ve felt it before. You’ll feel it again. You just need to remember.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. And in that instant, she did.</p><p> </p><p>Not clearly, but flashes. A forest. Hands brushing hers. A promise spoken in another lifetime. A kiss that burned through lifetimes. Her breath hitched again, this time a gasp of grief and longing wrapped around a name she couldn’t say.</p><p> </p><p>“Get out,” she whispered, her voice cracking, soft but no less commanding.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. For a moment, the silence was heavy, thick with all the things unsaid. Then her voice came, gentle and reverent.</p><p> </p><p>“If that’s what you want… <em>te veo</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>She stepped away. The absence of her body left the room colder. Emptier.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally opened her eyes again, Rio was gone. But the ache remained. Pressed deep into her chest, under her skin, like an ancient truth waiting to rise.</p><hr/><p>The house had fallen into a hushed rhythm, a lull that only came once little feet stopped pattering across the floor and voices quieted behind closed doors. After Agatha sent her message, short, apologetic, raw, Nicole responded with a single word: Okay. And just like that, she stepped in, shouldering a responsibility too heavy for someone her age but worn like second skin.</p><p> </p><p>Downstairs, Rio did everything as Agatha would have done, but softer, smoother, with an ease that came not from routine but from an intimate knowledge of how this home moved when no one else was watching. She cleared the plates, her movements graceful and deliberate, as if every clink of porcelain was a ritual. She washed the dishes by hand despite the dishwasher, her fingers caressing each piece like it mattered.</p><p> </p><p>When she found Nick, he was half-asleep on the couch, curled around a stuffed dragon. Rio lifted him easily, carried him upstairs in silence, and guided him through brushing his teeth, washing his face, and climbing into his pajamas. He didn’t ask questions. He never did. He trusted her without ever needing to say why.</p><p> </p><p>Tucking him in, Rio leaned close, her palm resting gently over his heart as she whispered a single word in Latin, her lips brushing the shell of his ear like a kiss: <em>Somnum</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The boy’s lashes fluttered once, then stilled. His body relaxed instantly, the kind of peace that no dream would dare disturb. Rio stayed there for a moment, fingers brushing his hair from his forehead, her eyes dark and ancient. There was grief in her silence, but also reverence.</p><p> </p><p>She stood slowly and moved to Nicole’s room.</p><p> </p><p>The door was slightly ajar, the golden light from inside spilling into the hallway like warmth. Nicole sat at her vanity, brushing her long, dark hair in slow, practiced strokes. Her eyes were fixed on her own reflection, but her mind was far from it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped in without knocking. She didn’t have to. She simply walked in like she belonged there, barefoot and quiet as dusk. Without a word, she picked up the comb and took over. Her fingers were cool and steady, weaving through Nicole’s hair like she was untangling memory itself.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole didn’t resist. She simply lowered her eyes, her voice barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>“Why can’t I tell her the truth, Mama?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, the brush stilled in her hand. Their eyes met in the mirror, one gaze steady, the other searching.</p><p> </p><p>“Because her spirit wouldn’t survive it,” she said, her voice soft, tinged with sadness but never weak. “She has to remember on her own, amor meu. The truth has to rise from her bones, not fall from someone else’s lips.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s brow furrowed. She tugged at the hem of her sleeve, a gesture she’d picked up from Agatha. “But she’s suffering. She doesn’t remember the magic. She doesn’t remember... Nick. Not the first version of him. Not what happened to him. And she doesn’t even know where I came from. What I am.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand moved gently down a lock of Nicole’s hair, smoothing it.</p><p> </p><p>“She remembers his face. His laugh. But not his death. Not yet. That pain would shatter her right now. She’s still holding herself together with spit and saltwater.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s voice cracked. “She doesn’t remember me at all. That I didn’t come from her body. That I wasn’t born. That I happened because she loved you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio knelt beside her now, one hand resting on the girl’s knee, the other cradling the side of her face.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she whispered. “You weren’t born. You were created. Not from flesh, but from love so ancient and fierce it defied every law the universe tried to place on us. You came into being not because she knew me, but because her soul remembered mine. Because it needed me.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s eyes shimmered, the tears catching in the soft glow of the vanity bulbs.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve always been different,” she whispered. “I can feel when someone lies. I can see... things people can’t. I knew you weren’t human the second I saw you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled faintly, brushing a tear from Nicole’s cheek with the back of her knuckle. “No. I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then what are you?” Nicole asked, voice trembling, not from fear, but need.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>She brushed the comb once more through Nicole’s hair, gaze fixed on the mirror. “I’ll tell you, someday,” she said finally. “When it’s time.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole didn’t press. She nodded, accepting. Trusting. And yet the question still hung there, like incense in the air, sweet, thick, unanswered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rose and kissed the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p>“It was you, Nicky,” she murmured. “You were the light that called her back to me. Through death, through lifetimes, through dimensions. You are love itself. Born not from pain, but from hope.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole turned in her chair and wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, burying her face against her. “What if she never remembers?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stroked her hair, her voice steady as a vow. “Then I will stay. I will wait. Like I always have. Because love doesn’t yield, and neither do I.”</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for a long moment. The room humming with something invisible, timeless, aching, eternal.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio pulled back slightly and smiled. “Now. One more brush and then bed. Your mother will need you tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole nodded, wiping at her cheeks, her smile small but true. And as Rio finished combing through her daughter’s hair, the threads between them glowed with something more powerful than magic: love that defied death itself.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha thrashed beneath the tangled sheets, her breath ragged, her skin slick with sweat. The blanket had slipped halfway off the bed, her legs tangled in the fabric as though she were trying to escape something unseen. Moonlight spilled through the window in pale streaks, casting her room in shifting shadows, but it was the chaos behind her closed eyes that held her captive.</p><p> </p><p>In her dream, she was no longer herself.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She was younger , barely past twenty. Her face, unmarred by time, was smeared with soot and blood, strands of her dark hair clinging to her damp skin. Her heart pounded so loudly it drowned out the silence of the forest. The scent of iron hung thick in the damp night air, mixed with the earthy musk of crushed leaves and the sharp tang of ozone — residual magic still crackling in the aftermath of battle.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Around her, the clearing was a grave.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Bodies lay strewn in twisted shapes, limbs contorted, mouths frozen mid-scream. The witches she had fought — some familiar, some once-friends — were now nothing more than bloodstained corpses, their charms and talismans shattered beneath them. Their magic, once brilliant and wild, now gone like smoke in the wind.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha stood in the center of the carnage, her chest heaving, her palms soaked in red. Her fingers trembled, still glowing faintly with the residue of deadly spells.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She had survived. She had won.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And she felt nothing but dread.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“You think this is strength?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>The voice came like a blade across her skin, familiar, sharp, and cold. Agatha’s spine straightened with instinctive fear as she turned.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>From the mist beyond the trees, her mother emerged. </em> <em>Evanora’s form was regal, untouched by the blood that marred Agatha’s own. Her long cloak trailed behind her like smoke, and her eyes, those pale, glacial eyes, locked onto Agatha with judgment so potent it stole the air from her lungs.</em></p><p> </p><p>
<em>“They attacked me,” Agatha gasped, her voice hoarse. “They wanted to dismantle the coven. I had no choice—”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Evanora’s lip curled in disgust. “There is always a choice.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She walked through the corpses like they were scenery, her boots never touching blood. She stopped in front of Agatha, who could barely meet her gaze. “You could have disarmed them. Bound their magic. Rendered them powerless.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“They wouldn’t have stopped,” Agatha cried, her voice cracking. “They called me a threat. They came for me. For us.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“And so you slaughtered your own kind,” Evanora said flatly, her voice a cold wind. “Witches, Agatha. You killed witches.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha’s hands curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. “I protected the coven. I protected you.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Evanora raised her hand without warning. An invisible force crashed into Agatha’s chest like a hammer, throwing her to her knees. Her vision blurred from pain as magic ripped through her body, searing her nerves.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“You are reckless,” Evanora hissed, stalking closer, her magic pulsing like fire. “You think power is permission. You think domination is security. But you are wrong.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha screamed, her back arching as another wave of magic surged through her, carving pain deep into her bones. “I was trying to save—”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Silence!” Evanora’s voice cracked through the forest like thunder, and the air turned heavier. The leaves trembled in the trees above, the very ground beneath Agatha seeming to recoil.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“You are a disgrace,” Evanora seethed. “You don’t understand balance. You don’t know restraint. You are dangerous, and if you don’t learn control, you will destroy everything left in your path, including yourself.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha’s body convulsed with agony, her tears turning the dirt beneath her into mud. Her mother’s magic crushed her — merciless, suffocating. And then—</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Darkness.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>A voice sliced through the storm.</p><p>Agatha’s body lurched upright with a violent gasp, her hands clutching the sheets like a lifeline. Her heart slammed against her ribs, every breath a desperate gulp for air. She blinked wildly, disoriented. The nightmare still clung to her skin.</p><p> </p><p>The moonlight had shifted across the wall, painting the room in shades of pale silver and gray. Her bedroom, her sanctuary, felt alien and fragile.</p><p> </p><p>And sitting beside her was Rio. Not smug. Not teasing. <em>Serious</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand was firm on Agatha’s shoulder, grounding her, her thumb brushing in slow, soothing circles against her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>“You were screaming,” Rio said softly, her voice lower than usual, less a sound, more a balm.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body trembled beneath the damp fabric of her nightshirt. Her face was flushed, tears still clinging to her lashes. Her voice, when it came, was raw.</p><p> </p><p>“She was there,” she whispered. “My mother. She called me a disgrace. Said I’d kill myself if I didn’t control it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak right away. She simply moved her hand from Agatha’s shoulder to her back, rubbing slow, even strokes between her shoulder blades.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her face into her hands, her voice muffled and small. “I killed them. I remember now. I killed all of them.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned closer, her breath grazing Agatha’s temple. “They tried to kill you. You survived.”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make it right,” Agatha said, her voice crumbling. “It doesn’t make me right.”</p><p> </p><p>“It makes you human,” Rio whispered, her words soft but edged with power. “Even if you aren’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up slowly, her eyes haunted. “She hated me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face softened. She tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, her fingers lingering against her cheek. “She feared you. That’s not the same.”</p><p> </p><p>Their gazes locked, and in that silence, something old stirred again, something vast and familiar, painful and magnetic.</p><p> </p><p>“You were never a disgrace,” Rio added, her voice a quiet command. “Not then. Not now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, her vision blurring with tears she made no effort to wipe away. One slipped down her cheek, carving a slow, glistening trail to her chin. It clung there a moment, suspended, before falling, unnoticed, onto the thin cotton of her nightshirt. And still, she made no move to hide her face, no attempt to pretend she wasn’t crumbling.</p><p>For the first time in years, she allowed herself to feel, fully, deeply, painfully, and not apologize for it.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands fell from her face, limp against the blankets pooled in her lap, and she turned her head slowly to look at Rio. There was no armor in her expression anymore. No sarcasm, no deflection. Her gaze searched Rio’s with unguarded vulnerability, as if reaching for something — anything — that could dull the burn of memory still raw on her skin. Her voice, when it came, was a fragile thing, hoarse and low, coated in ash and regret.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know if I can forgive her,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. Her reply came with the clarity of someone who’d watched the world end more times than she could count, and still stood.</p><p> </p><p>“Then don’t,” she said simply, her voice gentle, but edged with quiet command. “Not yet. Maybe not ever. Forgiveness isn’t for them, Agatha. It’s for you. And it doesn’t have to happen now.”</p><p> </p><p>The words settled over Agatha like warm mist, seeping into the cracks she didn’t even know she had. They didn’t lift the weight entirely, but they shifted it — made it something she could carry for a little longer. Her chest ached, her ribs tight, but she didn’t feel like she was suffocating anymore.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned back slowly against the headboard, her spine brushing the cool wood, the pressure grounding her. The mattress dipped with her weight, her body finally beginning to ease from its coiled tension. Her head tilted slightly toward Rio, as if drawn by gravity, or something older.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She didn’t reach for her. She simply remained beside her, close enough for Agatha to feel the heat radiating from her skin. The scent of her — dark spice, warm earth, and something unnameable, wrapped around the space like a spell. She didn’t command attention, she claimed it, without force, without demand.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re stronger than she ever gave you credit for,” Rio murmured, her voice lower now, velvet wrapping around steel. “And you don’t have to prove that to anyone but yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her face slightly, her cheek brushing the edge of the pillow, her lashes heavy with salt. She didn’t respond, not out loud. But something inside her softened, shifted. Her breath left her chest in a long, trembling sigh. Her shoulders dropped, the knot in her spine loosening.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed wasn’t empty.</p><p> </p><p>It pulsed between them, charged, dense, intimate. It spoke in glances, in the brush of breath, in the way Agatha’s fingers curled slightly in the blanket, so close to Rio’s hand but not quite touching.</p><p>Agatha sat still, her breath finally beginning to steady, though her pulse continued to beat erratically beneath her skin. Her fingers trembled as she wiped the sheen of sweat from her brow, the lingering weight of the dream clinging to her like smoke. Her lips parted as she tried to speak, but the words caught in her throat, heavy and confused.</p><p> </p><p>“That... that never happened,” she managed, her voice raw and uncertain, like something scraped from the edge of memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She tilted her head, the dark pools of her eyes unreadable, too calm for the storm swirling between them.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, her voice low, threading through the quiet like silk on skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her throat dry. “My mother... she was cruel, yes. She controlled everything. She made me feel small, unworthy. But those lights. That kind of magic. That forest. That pain...” Her voice cracked, and she drew in a shaky breath. “She never used magic like that on me. <em>Magic doesn't exist</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted closer without a word. Her movements were slow, deliberate. She reached up and tucked a loose strand of damp hair behind Agatha’s ear, her fingers grazing her temple in a touch so careful it sent a tremor down Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure, my love?”</p><p> </p><p>The words were soft, but they pressed like fingertips against a bruise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened at the endearment, her eyes locking onto Rio’s. For a second, she forgot how to breathe. Her heartbeat echoed in her ears like a warning and a plea. “Yes. No... I—” She closed her eyes briefly, then forced them open again. “I don’t know. It felt so real. It felt like it happened, but it couldn’t have. Could it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand lingered in the air for a second before falling gently to her thigh. The motion was casual, yet there was nothing careless about it. Her gaze didn’t waver.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes,” she murmured, “the mind doesn’t remember the way the soul does. Sometimes, what we bury buries us back. You might not remember the details, but your heart... your heart never forgets.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders tensed, her fists tightening around the edge of the blanket. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Then why now? Why would I dream that now?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, and the space between them thinned to almost nothing. Her breath brushed against Agatha’s cheek, warm, steady, maddeningly calm. The air grew heavier, thicker, the scent of her — earth and dusk and something ancient, curling around them like smoke.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re starting to remember.”</p><p> </p><p>The room stilled. Every sound, the wind outside, the rustle of fabric beneath them, the creak of the bed frame, seemed to hush as Agatha stared into Rio’s eyes, desperate for a foothold. The answer terrified her, even as it sang with a familiar ache she didn’t want to admit she missed.</p><p> </p><p>“Remember what?” she asked, barely audible, barely brave.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she reached out again, her fingers brushing softly along Agatha’s cheek. The touch was feather-light but searing, as if her fingertips carried memory in their heat. Agatha’s eyelids fluttered, involuntarily, her breath catching.</p><p> </p><p>“You tell me.” Her voice was a challenge and a balm all at once. The kind of voice that could command kingdoms or whisper you apart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched, but not with anger, with resistance. Or maybe need. She couldn’t tell anymore. Her skin prickled under Rio’s touch, and she hated how easily her body betrayed her. The ache in her chest swelled again, sharp and intimate, the kind of pain that whispered in her bones and made her knees weak.</p><p> </p><p>“You do this on purpose,” she breathed, her voice cracking. “You push too close.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Instead, her thumb dragged slowly along the edge of Agatha’s jawline, tracing the tension there like it belonged to her.</p><p> </p><p>“And you don’t stop me. Never do.”</p><p> </p><p>The words fell between them like a key in a lock, soft, final, undeniable. Agatha’s breath hitched. She could feel it now — the heat of Rio’s breath brushing her lips, the quiet tremble in her own hands, the pull beneath her skin like a tide dragging her in.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a <em>mistake</em>,” she whispered, the plea in her voice trembling with something that wasn’t quite conviction.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move away. Her lips hovered just a breath from Agatha’s, her dark gaze locked onto her like a tether.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” she murmured, her voice a soft, sinful promise. “But sometimes, mistakes are the only way forward.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart thundered in her chest, a frantic rhythm pounding against her ribs. Her fingers curled tightly around the edge of the bed, the sheets beneath her knuckles wrinkled and damp with the sweat clinging to her palms. She leaned forward before she could stop herself, her breath hitching. Rio was close — too close — their lips brushing invisible space. Heat pulsed between them, thick and electric, like a storm caught just beneath her skin.</p><p>But just as Rio’s scent, <em>warm, earthy, and faintly metallic, like rain on stone</em>, filled her lungs, Agatha’s eyes widened. A shiver ran down her spine. She jerked back sharply, as though burned, the tension snapping like a bowstring. Her hand flew to her chest, as if to calm the aching throb building beneath her sternum.</p><p>Across from her, Rio didn’t flinch. She remained still, watching Agatha with unsettling calm, but her eyes flickered — dark, endless, unreadable. There was something ancient in her gaze, something hungry but patient.</p><p> </p><p>“You feel it, don’t you?” Rio asked softly, her voice a velvet whisper that seemed to curl beneath Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She pushed herself to her feet instead, her legs stiff and unsteady. The carpet was cool beneath her bare feet, a sharp contrast to the heat rising in her chest. Her breathing was shallow, like she was trying to outrun something that had already caught her.</p><p> </p><p>“This... this can’t happen,” she said, the words scraping out of her like a confession. “You need to leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. “I’ll leave when you’re ready for me to go. But not before.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice didn’t hold defiance. It was certainty. The kind that made Agatha’s spine stiffen even more.</p><p>Agatha turned her face away, unable to meet Rio’s eyes. The air between them was thick now, heavy with the scent of memory and unsaid things. Her hands trembled slightly as she rubbed her temples, the pressure of exhaustion pressing against her temples like a vice.</p><p> </p><p>"You should sleep, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>She scoffed without humor. “I can’t.”</p><p> </p><p>"I could sing for you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a dry, breathy laugh and turned her head sharply toward her. “<em>Death</em> is going to sing me a lullaby?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved, slow and knowing. “You’d be surprised by my talents,” she said, her voice low and almost sinfully smooth. “But you do need sleep, so... I will if you let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment, her jaw clenched. Then, slowly, she reached forward and caught the edge of Rio’s sleeve between her fingers. The fabric was soft, softer than it looked, and her grip was firm, but hesitant, as if she hated herself for needing the touch.</p><p> </p><p>“If you don’t annoy me, I’ll let you stay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her smirk spreading. “Oh, I wouldn’t dream of annoying you.” She leaned in just slightly, her voice dropping. “Except when it’s fun.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Get out</em>,” Agatha snapped, the flush on her cheeks betraying her.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay.” Rio raised her hands in mock surrender, her smile widening. “I’ll stay quiet. I’ll just stand right here. Silent. Like an incredibly charming and attractive spirit <em>haunting your room</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and narrowed her eyes, rubbing the bridge of her nose with two fingers. “You’re not staying in my room like some <em>obsessive ghost</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back against the dresser, her arms folding loosely across her chest, her hips tilting in that infuriatingly relaxed posture she always used when she knew she was winning. “Then where should I stay? The closet?” She smirked. “Took me <em>ages</em> to come out of there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God,” Agatha muttered, exasperated. “Just lie on the damn bed and shut up, <strong><em>Rio Vidal</em></strong>!”</p><p> </p><p>It happened in an instant. Rio froze, completely. Her smirk faltered, lips parting as her breath caught in her throat. Her body went perfectly still, like something delicate had cracked deep inside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned, caught off guard. “What’s with that face now?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was softer when it came, almost reverent. “<em>Vidal</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“What about it?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s my last name.” Her gaze locked onto Agatha’s, steady and slow. “But... Agatha, I’ve <em>never</em> told you that.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed was deafening. The room shrank around them. Agatha’s chest rose and fell in uneven breaths, her fingers slowly loosening their hold on her frustration as her mind scrambled.</p><p>The name had come too easily. It had rolled off her tongue like something she’d said a thousand times before.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips parted, but nothing came out.</p><p>Rio stepped forward slowly, each movement deliberate, prowling more than walking. Her bare feet whispered across the wood floor, and the soft scrape of skin against lacquered grain was the only sound that dared to exist between them. The air felt charged, thick with heat and silence, like the moment before lightning splits the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Her posture was elegant, predatory in the way only something ancient and certain could be. Shoulders squared, chin tilted down ever so slightly, her dark eyes locked on Agatha like she already owned every secret buried in her bones. She wasn’t approaching to conquer. She was approaching to reclaim.</p><p>There was no malice in her expression, just focus. A stillness that vibrated. Curiosity shimmered just beneath the surface of her calm exterior, but deeper still, like a current beneath ice, was something more dangerous. Longing. Hunger. Something primal wrapped in silk.</p><p> </p><p>“So tell me, Agatha,” she purred, her voice low, smooth, and thick like honey pulled from the comb. “How do you know my name?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. Her heartbeat surged violently, thudding against her ribs with such force she swore Rio could hear it. The name still echoed in her head like a song she didn’t remember learning but had known all her life. Her body had stilled, but her insides were rioting, blood rushing hot, nerve endings alight, her skin tight with tension.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips trembled. “I—I don’t know,” she whispered, voice trembling like a wire pulled too taut.</p><p> </p><p>But she did. Not with logic. Not with memory.</p><p> </p><p>It was in the way her body leaned in when Rio stepped closer. In the tremble beneath her skin. It was in the ache low in her belly, the goosebumps on her arms, the sudden burn behind her eyes. A knowing that bypassed thought entirely, soul-deep, bone-deep. <em>Old</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t explain it. But she felt it.</p><p> </p><p>A scent caught her, the faintest trace of clove, of warmth and storm-soaked leaves, the scent she now recognized as her. It wrapped around her like a cloak, thick and intoxicating. Familiar. Too familiar.</p><p>Rio’s gaze didn’t waver. She stepped even closer, so close now that Agatha could feel the warmth radiating off her body. Inches between them. No more.</p><p> </p><p>“That name, my name, lives in your bones, doesn’t it?” she whispered, her breath a brush of heat against Agatha’s cheek. “You’ve said it before. With your mouth on my skin, with your teeth at my throat, with your body under mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered, her lashes heavy with the weight of something unspeakable. A moan tried to claw up her throat and she swallowed it hard. Her hands clenched at her sides, fingers digging into the flesh of her palms as if pain could ground her.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop,” she breathed, but the word came out like a plea, not a command.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in until her lips hovered just beside Agatha’s ear, her voice a caress against the sensitive shell. “You called me home,” she murmured. “You always do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body shivered. Her knees softened, but she locked them tight. The ache beneath her ribs twisted, tightened, unfurled. Her throat was dry, her breath shaky, her skin hypersensitive to every molecule of Rio’s presence.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do I feel like this?” she asked, voice cracking open like a confession too long denied.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to look her in the eyes, those endless eyes that held centuries, storms, and tenderness like weapons. Slowly, deliberately, she raised her hand and let her thumb trace the curve of Agatha’s bottom lip. The contact was featherlight, but it burned.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you remember,” she said, her tone dark and reverent. “Even if your mind can’t say it, your soul already has. You remember me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered shut, overwhelmed by the weight of sensation and memory and want. She saw flashes in the dark behind her lids — hands tangled in hair, bodies pressed together in moonlight, a voice gasping her name with reverence and hunger.</p><p> </p><p><em>Magic. Ruin. Devotion</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her eyes slowly, her gaze glossy, raw. “What were we?” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in again, close enough that her lips barely brushed Agatha’s mouth, a phantom touch that sent a bolt of electricity straight to her core.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything,” she breathed. “<em>We were everything.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled. And still, she didn’t pull away. “I can't”</p><p> </p><p>Because somewhere inside her, she still belonged to Rio… And Rio... had never once stopped coming back to claim her.</p><p>Agatha drew in a shallow breath, her lungs tight, her throat aching from the weight of everything she couldn’t say. Her body still buzzed from Rio’s proximity, from the ghost of a touch that hadn’t quite happened, but nearly had. She closed her eyes for just a second, willing herself to stay grounded, to breathe past the fire curling low in her stomach and the overwhelming urge to give in.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands trembled. Not from fear. From restraint.</p><p> </p><p>Then she found her voice, cracked and breathless but steady enough. “Don’t make me do this...” she whispered, barely louder than a breath, her eyes fluttering open and locking onto Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>For a long second, Rio said nothing. Her expression didn’t flinch, but something behind her gaze softened. She stepped forward, close again, but not suffocating this time. Her hand lifted gently, reverently, and she pressed a tender kiss to Agatha’s forehead, so soft, so full of restraint it made Agatha’s knees buckle.</p><p> </p><p>The heat that had hung between them dimmed just slightly — not extinguished, never that — but turned into something more bittersweet.</p><p> </p><p>“I would never force you,” Rio murmured against her skin, her lips brushing warm and careful at the edge of her hairline. “Never, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>She lingered for only a second longer, then pulled away. Her hand lingered near Agatha’s cheek, fingers ghosting along the line of her jaw before tucking a lock of dark hair behind her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll wait for you,” she said, her voice low, but steady. “What I have, more than anything else, is <em>time</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat closed. The tenderness in Rio’s voice, the patience laced with quiet ache, made her chest ache worse than the dream had. She looked away, as if hiding the tears prickling at the corners of her eyes, and nodded slowly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers caressed her cheek again, the pad of her thumb dragging lightly beneath Agatha’s eye in a slow arc. “You need to sleep,” she said softly. “Still want me to stay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated. Her pride rose like it always did, a shield she’d worn for years, forged by fear and pain — but it crumbled just as easily in the face of Rio’s unwavering presence. The part of her that still didn’t understand this connection begged her to say no. But the other part — the deeper, older part that remembered without remembering, was already answering.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice came out fragile. Honest. “Please...”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave the smallest nod, something reverent flickering across her face. She leaned in, not to kiss, not to touch, but to promise.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she whispered, already moving toward the bed. “I’ll just lie here. Quiet, like I promised.”</p><p> </p><p>She settled on top of the covers, her long body stretched out in a relaxed pose, hands resting loosely on her stomach. Her eyes remained on Agatha, not demanding anything, just being there.</p><p> </p><p>And then, with a small, knowing smile that barely curved the edge of her lips, she added, “If you need me… you already know my name.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, climbing under the sheets with trembling fingers. She didn’t say anything, but her body did. The way she curled toward the warmth Rio’s presence gave off. The way her breathing, though shaky, finally began to slow. And the way, despite herself, she let her hand fall a little closer to where Rio lay.</p><p> </p><p>Just close enough to feel her there. Not touching.</p><p>But near.</p><hr/><p>A week later, Agatha sat in the familiar warmth of Wanda’s living room, sunk deep into the soft, oversized armchair in the farthest corner she could claim. The room was a haven of cozy chaos, books piled on every surface, flickering candles throwing lazy shadows across the walls, and the scent of red wine and vanilla-scented wood polish lingering in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Jen perched on the armrest of the couch like a lounging cat, swirling her glass and grinning over the rim. Alice and Lilia Calderu were mid-battle over the book club’s latest tragic heroine, their voices alternating between impassioned and amused. Wanda swept through the room with practiced flair, topping off glasses like a theatrical bartender at a speakeasy. She hummed to herself as she moved, too aware of everyone’s moods and sharp enough to cut through any silence with a single look.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wasn’t really there. Her wine sat mostly untouched in her lap. Her fingers drummed nervously against the stem, her nails clicking lightly in a rhythm she didn’t hear. The chatter, the laughter, it all came in waves. <em>Distant. Muted.</em></p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was there. Not in the way a normal guest would be. Of course not. Rio had never done anything normally in her entire unnaturally long existence.</p><p> </p><p>She lingered just behind Agatha’s chair, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her breath ghosting across her neck. Her presence was magnetic and suffocating all at once. She wasn’t touching her, she didn’t need to. Her energy wrapped around Agatha like a silk noose. Every so often, she leaned in just enough to let her lips brush the shell of Agatha’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“You smell like cinnamon and guilt,” she murmured softly, her voice sliding like satin against raw nerves.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened on the glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you even listening, Agatha?” Jen’s voice sliced through the haze, her perfectly manicured hand waving in front of her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked hard, straightening in her seat with a jolt. Her voice came out too fast, too high. “<em>What</em>? Yes. Totally listening.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen gave her a skeptical look, dark eyes narrowing with that particular brand of best-friend suspicion.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re zoning out <em>again</em>,” she said, folding her arms. “Let me guess, work stress? Or is it Ralph?”</p><p> </p><p>At the sound of his name, Agatha didn’t flinch. Not even a twitch. She kept her features carefully blank.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda threw herself dramatically onto the couch beside her, draping one leg over the other like a diva settling into an interrogation. “Please. It’s not Ralph. She doesn’t even flinch anymore when we say his name. It’s gotta be something juicier.” She sipped her wine. “Secret boyfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her a sharp glare. “I do not have a secret boyfriend.”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio let out a quiet chuckle. Her breath danced across Agatha’s neck, smug and maddening. “That would make me your secret girlfriend, wouldn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>The flush that bloomed in Agatha’s cheeks wasn’t from the wine. Her jaw tensed, but she refused to react. Not here. Not in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow from across the room, cocking her head like a curious crow. “Then what’s got you so distracted, Agatha? You’ve been off all week. It’s not like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat, reaching for her wine with a little more urgency this time, sipping to buy herself a second of composure. The wine was sharp, tart against her tongue. She barely tasted it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve just been... busy,” she offered, tone clipped and unconvincing.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda arched a brow, unconvinced. “Busy doing what? Meditating under waterfalls? Summoning a new man from a candle?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m summoning something,” Rio whispered, a smile curling around every syllable. “<em>You. Under me.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on the wine mid-sip, coughing into her sleeve as Wanda handed her a napkin with an overly dramatic sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Jen asked, though she was already smiling like she knew Agatha was lying through her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said quickly, forcing the words through clenched teeth. “Just... tired.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” Rio said sweetly, now casually strolling in front of her, folding her arms, her hips swaying with that impossible confidence that made Agatha’s jaw clench. “Tell them about me. Come on, I’m dying to meet your little <em>coven of gossip queens.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the arm of the chair. Every muscle in her body screamed restraint. Her lips twitched into what she hoped resembled a polite smile.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gave her a long look. “Seriously, Ags. We’re your friends. Whatever’s going on — you can tell us. We’re not gonna burn you at the stake.”</p><p> </p><p>“Speak for yourself,” Lilia muttered, sipping wine. “Depends on the scandal.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in again, her voice a low purr. “Tell them how I make you feel. How you dream of me. How your body still remembers mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood up so fast her glass nearly toppled. “I need air.”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone paused. Jen blinked. Wanda sat up straighter. Alice raised both brows now.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure you’re okay?” Wanda asked gently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. The noise, the wine, the constant brush of Rio’s presence like a shadow against her skin — too close, too aware. Her chair scraped against the hardwood as she stood abruptly, drawing the eyes of every woman in the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Bathroom,” she muttered, her voice too tight, too rushed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t wait for a reply. Her heels clicked sharply against the floor as she exited, pulse hammering beneath her skin. The hallway felt too narrow, the walls too close, and when she finally shut the bathroom door behind her, she leaned against it as though it might hold her together. The cool surface pressed against her spine, grounding her for only a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Her breathing was uneven, her chest rising and falling in quick bursts. Her hands trembled at her sides. Then, like silk sliding across stone, Rio’s voice emerged beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to blow your cover, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumped, eyes snapping open as Rio appeared in the mirror, casual, poised, lounging against the edge of the sink like she belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>She wore the smirk of someone who didn’t need permission to exist. Her hair tumbled in dark waves over her shoulder, her clothes as immaculate as ever. She looked like the embodiment of midnight: sleek, sharp, predatory. The low light glinted in her eyes like slivers of onyx, giving her a feline gleam — dangerous and darkly playful, like a black cat curled on a windowsill, daring you to try and tame it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s glare was immediate, but the heat in her face betrayed her restraint. “You’re making this <em>unbearable</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, her tone rich with mock innocence. “You’re the one who invited me into your life, remember?” She began to circle Agatha slowly, like a cat eyeing something warm and restless. “Called me. Craved me. Welcomed me in.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t invite you to haunt me,” Agatha hissed, turning her body to follow Rio’s movements. Her own reflection in the mirror looked flushed and wrecked, like someone running from a fire.</p><p> </p><p>“Haunting?” Rio clutched at her chest, lips parting in an exaggerated pout. “No, no. I prefer the term devoted companion.” She said the words like a purr, dragging out the syllables just long enough to make them feel intimate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, fingers pressing into her temples. Her body felt too hot for such a small room. Her palms were damp, her breathing quick again. “You’re a insufferable bitch!”</p><p> </p><p>“And yet…” Rio’s voice dropped to a murmur as she stepped in front of her again, the proximity enough to steal Agatha’s air. “You haven’t told me to leave.” Her fingertips hovered just above Agatha’s arm, not touching, just whispering heat between them. “Not for good, really.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body went still. The silence between them stretched thick and electric, laced with all the things Agatha wouldn’t let herself say. Her mouth opened — but no words came. She didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk deepened. “That’s what I thought. <em>Good girl.”</em></p><p> </p><p>And just like that, with the softest rustle of her coat and a flick of energy that felt like the brush of velvet against skin, Rio vanished. No dramatic exit. Just absence. Like smoke curling out of a candle’s flame.</p><p> </p><p>A beat later, Wanda’s voice floated faintly from the hallway. “Agatha? You okay in there?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her chest, willing her heartbeat to settle. “Yeah… just a minute!”</p><p> </p><p>She stared at her reflection for a long moment, jaw tight, cheeks flushed, the ghost of Rio’s presence still tingling across her skin. And somewhere deep inside her — beneath the fear, beneath the anger — was the terrifying truth she couldn’t escape: she didn’t want Rio to leave. Not really.</p><p>Taking a deep breath that did nothing to calm the thundering of her heart, Agatha straightened her shoulders, wiped her palms against her skirt, and forced herself back into the living room. The sound of laughter, clinking glasses, and light chatter greeted her as she stepped in — comforting noises that didn’t quite reach her this time.</p><p> </p><p>She moved like someone heading to war and not a couch full of friends, her heels silent on the rug, her posture too perfect. Her fingers tightened around the stem of her wine glass as she lowered herself into the seat, eyes darting toward the far end of the room.</p><p>Rio was still there, of course, leaning against the wall like a smug secret, arms crossed and eyes gleaming like midnight. She looked almost bored, but the twitch at the corner of her mouth betrayed her amusement.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda tilted her head, her wine swirling lazily in her glass. “Alright, spill. What’s going on? You’ve been acting like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled tighter around the glass, the coolness of the wine doing little to soothe the heat crawling up her neck. Her eyes flicked back to Rio, who wiggled her fingers in a silent wave, brows raised as if to say, <em>Go on, sweetheart. Tell them.</em></p><p> </p><p>She turned back to her friends. Her throat was dry. Her voice, when it came, sounded far too calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Hypothetically speaking,” she said, “what if I told you I’ve been seeing the <em>personification of Death</em> herself?”</p><p> </p><p>Silence fell like a dropped pin.</p><p> </p><p>Then—</p><p> </p><p>Jen burst out laughing, snorting into her glass and nearly tipping it over. “Oh my God, Agatha. What are you on, and where can I get some? Seriously, is this a shroom thing?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda squinted. “Wait, you’re not joking?” Agatha just looked at her, unsmiling. Wanda blinked. “You’re not joking.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice leaned forward, her eyes narrowing in suspicious curiosity. “Is this some kind of dark metaphor? Like… <em>Death is your toxic ex?</em> Your taxes? Your skincare routine after forty?”</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Yes</em>", she thought, "<em>she is my toxic ex</em>".</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s chuckle filled the room, smooth and smug like melted chocolate. “Oh, they’re way more fun in this life. I like them. Can we keep them?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a death glare — ironically — then turned back to her friends. “I’m not on drugs, and it’s not a metaphor. Just imagine it for a second. A literal being. Not a hallucination. Not a dream. A real, physical embodiment of Death.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s grin stretched even wider. “Okay, okay, let’s run with this. What does she look like? Classic Grim Reaper? Cloak and bones? Floaty and ominous?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, who spread her arms in a mock theatrical gesture, lips curled in pure mischief. She was barefoot now, her black slacks hugging long legs, shirt unbuttoned just low enough to show the suggestion of a tattoo near her collarbone. Her hair spilled wild and loose over her shoulders, her eyes catching the firelight and turning molten.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at her friends and muttered, “Not exactly. More like someone who would annoy you into your grave.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, clutching at her chest like she’d been wounded. “Rude,” she said, tone light and playful, “but fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s eyes flicked between Agatha’s expression and her tightly gripped glass. “Okay, now I am concerned. Are you sleeping at all? Eating? You look like you’re about to explode.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, her fingers flexing as she released the glass and pressed the pads of her fingers to her temples. “I’m sleeping. Barely. Eating. Sort of. Exploding? Absolutely.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio drifted behind the couch now, her fingertips brushing lightly along the back of it as if she were petting something alive. “Just tell them, baby. I don’t bite. Well. Not unless asked.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, her voice sharp. “<em>0</em></p><p> </p><p>“I lied,” Rio replied sweetly. “It’s kind of in the job description.”</p><p> </p><p>“You said you could lie!”</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned forward again, brows furrowed. “Agatha. Are you hearing voices? Because if you’re in danger or having a breakdown, we can help you. Seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at Jen, then Wanda, then Alice, and then Lilia, her oldest, most reliable circle, and something twisted painfully in her gut. The fear of sounding insane, of losing their trust. But worse than that was the fear of telling the truth and still losing them anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned in closer, the flame of curiosity flickering behind her eyes, her wine glass cradled loosely in her hand. “So, hypothetically... why is this Death-person following you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably, crossing one leg over the other, her gaze pointedly avoiding the sultry shadow lounging just within her peripheral vision. The room was warm from candlelight and laughter, but under her skin, there was a chill, one she’d come to associate with Rio’s presence. “I don’t know,” she said stiffly, fingers tightening around the glass. “She says I called her, but I don’t remember doing anything like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice cocked an eyebrow and exchanged a glance with Jen, amusement twitching at the corners of her mouth. “So, you summoned Death, and now she’s... what? Stalking you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha muttered, taking a long sip of her wine as if it could drown out Rio’s grin pressing against her awareness.</p><p> </p><p>Jen snorted, slouching back into the couch, her legs draped casually over the armrest. “Agatha, if this is your way of saying you’re stressed out, just say so. No need to invent some <em>hot goth Death chick</em> haunting you.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Hot goth Death chick</em>?” Rio repeated from behind Agatha’s shoulder, the delight in her voice unmistakable. “Oh, I love her. Please invite her over more often.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks burn. Her grip on the glass faltered slightly, and she turned with narrowed eyes, pointing at the space Rio occupied, though her finger passed through air as far as her friends were concerned. “<em>You’re not helping!”</em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s eyebrows shot up, slow and suspicious. “Uh... who are you talking to?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Her mouth opened, then closed again. She quickly looked away, her face coloring deeper. “No one,” she snapped, the lie hanging awkwardly in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Jen took a slow sip of wine, her grin wide. “You’re making this way too easy to tease, you know. But seriously, Agatha, maybe take a break. Get some rest. You’ve been... off lately.”</p><p> </p><p>“‘Off’ is one way to put it,” Rio whispered in her ear, her lips brushing the air like silk. “I prefer... deliciously unhinged.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s nails dug into the side of her thigh, her other hand white-knuckled around the glass. She inhaled slowly, trying to keep her voice level. “I’m fine. Really. It’s just been a long week.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda reached out and patted her arm, her tone softening. “Alright, alright, we’ll drop it. But if you start naming this invisible Death person, we’re staging an intervention.”</p><p> </p><p>“Too late,” Rio purred, practically vibrating with amusement now. “I already have a name. Want me to introduce myself?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and sank further into the couch, the wine glass tilted back in surrender. She didn’t dare respond.</p><p> </p><p>Jen leaned forward, reaching for the bottle, and handed it to her. “Here. You need something stronger, but wine will do for now. To hypothetical Death stalking you!”</p><p> </p><p>“To <em>hot goth Death chicks</em>!” Alice added, raising her glass high, her bracelets jingling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought an invisible glass to her lips, her smirk lazy and pleased. “Cheers, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed the rim of her glass to her lips but didn’t drink. Instead, she closed her eyes, pinched the bridge of her nose, and muttered, “It’s going to be a long night.”</p><p> </p><p>She could feel Rio grinning beside her. Smug. Warm. Unshakably there.</p><hr/><p>The lecture hall buzzed with the soft hum of laptop keys and the scratch of pens on paper, the murmur of bored students settling into routine. Dust particles danced in the golden slant of afternoon light bleeding through the tall windows, catching against the edges of Agatha’s coat sleeve as she gripped the podium. Her fingers were pale against the wood, her knuckles taut.</p><p>She tried to focus. Tried to keep her voice even. But her throat was dry. Too dry. Her heart thudded hard beneath her blouse, the echo of it throbbing behind her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Today,” she began, voice smooth but clipped, “we’re discussing pivotal moments in history where death, disease, and survival shaped civilizations, particularly during the Black Plague.”</p><p> </p><p>A soft click from the remote in her hand triggered the projector, and the grim image of a medieval woodcut flashed to life behind her, gaunt bodies sprawled in agony, a skeletal rider drifting in the corner like an afterthought.</p><p> </p><p>“The Black Plague, also known as the Bubonic Plague, decimated Europe in the 14th century. It was said to have claimed the lives of up to sixty percent of the population.”</p><p> </p><p>“Closer to fifty-two percent,” Rio corrected, casually perched on the edge of the projector cart like a feline who knew she was not meant to be there and reveled in it. Her legs were crossed, and her boots, scuffed, laced up to her thighs, swung lazily in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. But her nails pressed harder into the wood. Her tongue moved behind her teeth like she was grinding down fury, not words.</p><p> </p><p>“During this time,” she continued, “many turned to religion or superstition to explain the horrors around them. Some even blamed witches—”</p><p> </p><p>“Witches, yes,” Rio interrupted again, lips curling. “But it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as these books claim. They were more scared of their own shadows than actual witches. Believe me, <em>I was there.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tensed. She kept her eyes forward, away from Rio’s silhouette looming behind the beam of projected history. “The Church played a significant role in framing the Plague as divine punishment, which led to widespread fear and persecution.”</p><p> </p><p>“Divine punishment,” Rio scoffed, inspecting her nails like she wasn’t talking about centuries of suffering. “Please. It was rats. Fleas. Filthy water and the kind of hygiene that would make your skin crawl. But fear is easier to sell than science. And they sold it.”</p><p> </p><p>A quiet ripple of laughter passed through the students, at something whispered, or perhaps at her expression. Agatha wasn’t sure.</p><p> </p><p>“One common belief,” she said, pressing forward, her voice cool, “was that Death itself walked the streets. A skeletal figure. Cloaked. Hooded.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, swinging her legs. “Such a cliché. I wore black, <em>yes</em>, but a skeleton? <em>Really</em>? <em>I looked amazing</em>, Agatha. You should’ve seen it, red lips, waist like a dream, the cloak was velvet. <em>Velvet</em>. I still have the dress.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched, her lips twitching too, though not in amusement. Her fingers adjusted her glasses in a tight, practiced motion. She clicked to the next slide.</p><p> </p><p>“Mass graves became common,” she said. “Rites were abandoned. Bodies burned in heaps outside the cities.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped. Softer. “That part is true.” She stood from the projector, stepping out of the shadows and toward the aisle, her form flickering through the projector light like smoke. “Even for me, it was... unpleasant. There was no reverence. Just fear. And rot. But what they never write down...” She turned to Agatha, her voice laced with something heavier now. “...is how hard they fought to live.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>“They prayed,” Rio went on, her tone almost reverent. “Even when their hands were blistered from shoveling the dead. Mothers held their babies with skin peeling from fever. Lovers kissed over corpses. Hope—” her voice hitched faintly, just once, “—hope is stubborn. You wouldn’t believe how much it hurts to watch it break.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her hand trembled at her side, the clicker slipping just slightly. She looked straight ahead, but her voice dipped low, barely above the whisper of the projector’s hum.</p><p> </p><p>“And what would you know about resilience?” she murmured, unable to stop the ache behind the question.</p><p> </p><p>“I watched it,” Rio replied, her tone hushed now, reverent, like she was confessing something sacred. “I held the hands of those who begged to live one more day. I’ve taken kings and children and monsters and martyrs. And every time... they all looked for something to hold on to. That’s what resilience is, Agatha. The refusal to let go, even when you’re already gone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest rose and fell in rapid, uneven waves, as if her lungs were struggling to recalibrate around the tight, burning knot that had formed just beneath her sternum. A sheen of sweat clung to the nape of her neck, soaked into the collar of her blouse. She could feel the heat blooming across her chest, crawling up her throat, blooming high in her cheeks like some fever she hadn’t invited. Her palms were damp against the lacquered wood of the podium, fingertips gone cold despite the rush of blood just beneath her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Harkness?”</p><p> </p><p>The voice cut in, sharp, high-pitched, unsure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. The room snapped into focus.</p><p>Dozens of eyes were locked on her now, some confused, some curious, a few wide with concern. The low hum of the projector buzzed in her ear, nearly drowned out by the pounding of her own pulse.</p><p> </p><p>She adjusted her glasses with fingers that didn’t quite want to obey. “Yes, sorry,” she said, her voice sounding distant even to herself. “Does anyone have questions about this period?”</p><p> </p><p>The air was thick with tension for a heartbeat. Then, slowly, a forest of hands rose. Eager students. Innocent ones. Ones who hadn’t been alive when she had, if that memory had even been real.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely saw them. Her eyes slid, almost involuntarily, toward the shadow lounging at the edge of her vision.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Leaning against the back wall now, arms crossed over her chest, her black blazer open over a charcoal silk blouse that shimmered like stormclouds. She looked devastatingly calm, like a cat watching mice discuss the meaning of traps. Her eyes, dark and unrelenting, were fixed solely on Agatha. Not mocking now. Not playful.</p><p> </p><p><em>Calculating. Possessive</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned slightly, keeping her tone low, her voice sharpened by the tremor running just beneath it. “This isn’t over,” she muttered through gritted teeth, not trusting herself to look directly at her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved. A slow, knowing smile that spread with the grace of poured ink. She lifted two fingers to her temple and offered a theatrical, mocking bow, her voice brushing against Agatha’s mind like silk through thorns.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of it, darling.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in that last word made Agatha’s spine straighten, her entire body reacting as though Rio had touched her without lifting a finger. The sound of it was too familiar, too intimate, like the taste of a name whispered in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, snapping her attention back to the students. “You,” she said, pointing to the front row with a steadier voice than she felt. “You had a question?”</p><p> </p><p>A girl with bright eyes and a thick notebook sat up straighter. “Yes, Professor. Do you think the personification of Death during the Black Plague was a way for people to process grief collectively, or more about control through fear?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer, but her gaze caught Rio again, still watching her like she was the only person in the room that mattered.</p><p>She forced her eyes away.</p><p> </p><p>“Both,” she replied, stepping around the podium, her heels clicking softly on the floor. “Death was never just an end. It was a mirror. And people feared what it might reflect back at them.”</p><p> </p><p>As she spoke, she could feel Rio’s presence, warm, quiet, heavy, anchored to her thoughts like gravity. Even when Agatha turned her back to her, the weight of Rio’s gaze pressed between her shoulder blades like a hand that refused to let go.</p><p>And in that moment, the history she taught, the facts on the slides, the sanitized stories... they all felt pale.</p><p> </p><p>Because something inside her whispered what she hadn’t dared admit until now. The worst part of Rio’s presence wasn’t the haunting. It was how much Agatha wanted her to stay.</p><p> </p><p>The lecture hall was heavy with the stale scent of overused air conditioning and secondhand coffee. The overhead lights buzzed faintly, too bright for how exhausted Agatha felt. Her fingers curled tighter around the black pointer, knuckles whitening as she gestured toward the projection of a rotting city street lined with the dead. Her voice tried to remain authoritative, clear. She tried to stay in control.</p><p> </p><p>“Many accounts from the time describe scenes of devastation,” she said, clicking to the next slide. “Entire families wiped out, cities abandoned—”</p><p> </p><p>“Not entirely,” Rio’s voice slithered through the room, smooth and insolent. She was perched at the back now, leaning lazily against the edge of a tall bookshelf, arms folded over her chest like a queen overseeing a court of fools. “Plenty of people stayed, Agatha. Some out of fear, some out of stubbornness. I remember one merchant who swore garlic kept the Plague away. Died three weeks later. <em>Smelled terrible the whole time</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders stiffened. She didn’t look at her. Wouldn’t. Her fingernails pressed into her palm through the pointer’s grip.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice rose an octave, tight with tension. “... and even the medical community was overwhelmed, offering ineffective remedies from herbal concoctions to bloodletting—”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, the good old leeches,” Rio interrupted, mock-dramatic as she placed a hand over her heart. “They always thought I was responsible when their treatments didn’t work. Like I was personally hand-delivering the Plague in a velvet cloak.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered in her throat. Her hands were trembling now, barely visible beneath the podium. Her eyes flicked over her students, trying to keep her composure, but she could feel the heat crawling up her neck, embarrassment, irritation, and something more volatile rising in her.</p><p> </p><p>She forced herself to continue. “The bird-like masks of Plague Doctors have become iconic. They believed the herbs packed into the beak would purify the air—”</p><p> </p><p>“Ridiculous,” Rio muttered again, stepping off the wall and sauntering closer, her heels silent on the linoleum. “They looked like cursed scarecrows. I almost felt sorry for them. Almost.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw so hard it ached. Her head snapped toward the specter only she could see. Her voice was a knife’s whisper, slicing through clenched teeth. “Will you stop it? I’m trying to teach.”</p><p> </p><p>A few students turned, startled by her sudden motion, their brows furrowing. She blinked and forced a smile, flipping through her notes like she’d simply forgotten something.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, entirely unbothered, arched a brow, her voice a low purr that curled under Agatha’s skin. “I am helping. This is called... <em>context</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re giving me a migraine,” Agatha hissed, her lips barely moving, her smile frozen and forced.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re adorable when you’re flustered,” Rio murmured, leaning in just close enough for Agatha to feel the ghost of her breath against her cheek. “Did you know that, darling?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back toward the students, clenching her thighs together under the desk without thinking. Her pulse throbbed at her throat, and she hated, hated, how deeply Rio’s presence unraveled her. How it felt like she was unraveling and being stitched back together all at once.</p><p> </p><p>“Now,” she managed, her voice louder than it needed to be, “let’s examine how the Plague altered economic structures—”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t forget the <em>cats</em>,” Rio interrupted again, circling behind her. “They blamed them. Massacred them. Which, predictably, made the rat <em>problem worse</em>. Brilliant logic, really. Kill the rat-catchers and then wonder why the rats flourish.”</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>That’s it!</em>” Agatha snapped, turning with so much force the pointer clattered to the floor, the sound echoing through the room like a gunshot.</p><p> </p><p><em>Silence</em>. Every student froze. Conversations dropped mid-sentence. The entire lecture hall stared at her in stunned confusion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. She inhaled sharply, heart pounding like it was trying to rip out of her chest. Her cheeks flushed with heat and humiliation. She straightened her spine and tugged at the collar of her blouse, her voice suddenly too bright, too calm.</p><p> </p><p>“I meant,” she said, clearing her throat, “that’s it for this section. Let’s take five.”</p><p> </p><p>A beat. Then the room stirred. Chairs squeaked. Bags rustled. The low buzz of idle chatter returned as the students filed out or stretched in place.</p><p> </p><p>The second the room thinned out, backpacks slung over shoulders, murmured conversations drifting toward the hallway, Agatha turned on her heel. Her heels clicked sharply against the floor, her body coiled like a drawn bowstring. Her eyes, usually cool and composed, now burned with a wild heat.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re gotta be fucking with me” she hissed, stepping down from the podium and rounding on Rio. Her chest rose and fell in quick bursts, her voice strained with the effort to stay quiet. “Do you have any idea how <em>hard</em> it is to teach with you constantly interrupting me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood with one hip cocked, hands in the pockets of her trousers, the picture of unbothered arrogance. Her smile was slow and indulgent, like she was watching a kitten try to claw down a lion.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I have every idea,” she purred, her voice syrupy smooth, thick with amusement. “But it’s just so delicious watching you try to stay professional. All that restraint. <em>The control</em>. The way your voice tightens when you’re trying not to snap...” She leaned in slightly, eyes gleaming. “You’re very sexy when you’re frustrated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand through her dark waves, the movement exasperated and sensuous all at once. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I am,” Rio replied without missing a beat, her tone light but edged with something more intimate, something dangerous. “But in all seriousness,” she added, straightening slightly, her expression shifting, “you’re doing a great job, darling. Even if your sources are, how shall I say, adorably incomplete.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, her brow furrowed. “This is history, Rio. Primary sources. Scholarly research. You don’t just get to rewrite it because you were... <em>there</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a lazy step closer, her boots making no sound, her presence brushing against Agatha’s like static. Her voice dropped to a low hum. “I’m not rewriting it,” she said softly. “I’m telling you the parts they left out. The fear in a midwife’s eyes when she wrapped her baby in rags and prayed he’d see the next sunrise. The sound of someone singing — badly — while they carried bodies to the river. The hope. The desperation. The beauty in how stubbornly they tried to live.” She paused. “Isn’t that why you’re here, <em>Professor</em>? To teach the truth, not just the dates?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted slightly, her breath hitching. Her throat worked around words she wasn’t sure how to form. She looked away, jaw tightening, and folded her arms in front of her chest like armor.</p><p>She hated that Rio could say things that made sense. That sounded like care. That felt like something deeper.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she muttered, voice low, almost reluctant. “But if you’re going to ‘help,’ could you at least do it after class?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile curved like a blade. “As you wish,” she murmured, stepping back with a slight bow, the movement theatrical, mocking — and somehow respectful all at once. “<em>Professor</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned back toward the podium, her blouse sticking faintly to her back where her body had heated under the stress. Her fingers wrapped around the edge of the lectern again, this time with a different kind of tension, something more pulsing, more alive.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she could still see Rio lounging by the wall like a cat who’d just pawed open a cage and was waiting to see what her prey would do with the freedom.</p><p>Students began trickling back in, filling the seats one by one. Agatha cleared her throat, adjusted her notes, and let the carefully arranged mask of control slip back over her face.</p><p>But deep beneath it, her pulse was still racing, and she knew Rio could feel every beat of it.</p><hr/><p>The café smelled of roasted beans and cinnamon, the hum of quiet conversation and clinking cups creating a soft, familiar noise around them. Outside, gray clouds pressed low against the windows, casting a silver filter across the worn wood of the table between them.</p><p>Agatha sat rigidly in the booth, fingers wrapped tight around the ceramic mug, as if the heat might ground her. The faint steam curled toward her face, but she barely felt it. Her knuckles were pale, her jaw clenched so tightly the muscles near her ear twitched. A headache pulsed behind her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Across from her, Wanda sat with one arm draped casually over the booth, her coffee cooling in her other hand. She watched Agatha carefully — too carefully, eyes sharp with intuition. She always saw too much. “You’re not going to tell me, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. Her thumb traced the rim of her mug. “I already told you.”</p><p> </p><p>“ And I laughed,” Wanda said, setting her cup down with a soft clink. “Because what you said is absurd. Completely and totally absurd.” Her voice lowered, conspiratorial and teasing. “But hey, if this ‘<em>Death</em>’ thing is real, ask her to show herself to me. Then I’ll believe you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally looked up. Her eyes were tired. Not puffy or red, just hollow. Empty in a way that made Wanda’s smile falter. “It doesn’t work like that,” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“Then how does it work?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.” Her voice cracked slightly. She hated that.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned back, her fingers tapping against her cup. “So... hypothetically... Death is following you around, just casually haunting you while you go to work, do laundry, pick up the kids?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda arched a brow. “And you have no idea why.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda stared at her. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip on the mug tightened. Her nails dug into the ceramic, and the heat burned her palms, but she didn’t let go. It was something to feel. Something real.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said again, quieter now. “Are you sure this isn’t something else? Stress? Guilt? Ralph?”</p><p> </p><p>At that name, Agatha blinked. Her mouth opened slightly, but no sound came. She could still hear his voice sometimes, loud, sharp, blaming. Could still feel the cold pit in her stomach from the night he vanished. She could still hear Nicole’s voice calling Rio Mama like it meant something true.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that,” she said, finally, the words pushed through clenched teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s voice softened. “Then what is it? Because you look like you’re walking around with a bomb inside your chest.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her shoulders pulled in slightly. Like she was trying to make herself smaller. “It’s complicated.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned forward again, her hand brushing Agatha’s across the table. “I’m not trying to pry, Aggie. I just… I hate seeing you like this. You’re disappearing in front of me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met her gaze. Wanda’s eyes were kind. Steady. <em>Trusting</em>. A thread of warmth tugged in her chest, dangerously close to unraveling something.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, she thought about saying it all. Telling Wanda about the forest in her dreams, about Rio’s voice in her head, about Nick whispering to someone she couldn't see. About how her body still remembered hands on her hips, breath on her throat, lips that tasted like the end of everything. About how terrified she was that she wanted it all back.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips parted. And then, she felt it.</p><p> </p><p>A shift in the air brushed the nape of Agatha’s neck like a breath too close, unseen fingers trailing along her spine. The temperature dropped just slightly, enough to make the fine hairs on her arms rise. The café buzzed on around her, warm and harmless, but that familiar pressure curled in beside her like a storm tightening its grip.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could brace herself, a voice, velvet and venom, sliced through her thoughts. “Tell her. I’m sure she’d love to hear about me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted. Her eyes slid to the seat beside her, now occupied by Rio, who lounged like the booth belonged to her. One arm draped across the backrest, legs elegantly crossed, the very image of arrogance in tailored black and a glint of wicked amusement in her eyes. Her presence was magnetic and suffocating all at once, like desire laced with danger.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched so hard it ached. Her pulse thudded against her throat as she forced herself to look back at Wanda, whose gaze was pinned on her with quiet concern. “It’s fine. I’ll figure it out,” Agatha said tightly, her tone clipped, raw at the edges.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s brows pulled together. “You’re deflecting.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not.” The words came too fast, too sharp. She shot Rio a side-glare, venom in her eyes. Then she grabbed her mug, taking a long, scalding sip just to avoid saying anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Across the booth, Rio’s expression curled into one of mock delight. “Wow. You’re really holding it together, aren’t you?” she purred, voice syrupy and smug.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha hissed under her breath, fingers tightening around the ceramic until her knuckles blanched.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda blinked. “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha muttered quickly, too quickly. “I just... look, can we talk about something else?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t move for a beat. Her gaze searched Agatha’s face, as if trying to pry the truth out by will alone. Then, with a quiet sigh, she nodded. “Sure. But this isn’t over.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s never over,” Rio whispered like a kiss to her ear, leaning in close enough for Agatha to feel her presence against her skin, warm, intimate, invasive.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She forced her mouth into a tight smile, nodding along as Wanda launched into a story about a chaotic faculty meeting, something about someone stealing someone’s mug again.</p><p>But her coffee tasted like ash now. Her skin prickled under her sweater, Rio’s gaze crawling over her like silk sliding over bare skin, like claws tracing her pulse. Every breath was a balancing act. Every heartbeat a reminder that Death wasn’t just near, she was watching. <em>Waiting. Teasing</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was already unraveling thread by thread.</p><p> </p><p>The warmth of the café wrapped around Agatha like a heavy blanket she couldn’t shake off. The aroma of roasted coffee beans, cinnamon pastries, and worn books should have calmed her nerves. Instead, her fingers gripped the ceramic mug like it was a weapon. Across the table, Wanda chatted animatedly about her twins, completely unaware of the storm unraveling inside Agatha.</p><p>But the real weight pressing against Agatha’s chest wasn’t the coffee or the conversation. It was the cold breath at her neck, the whisper curling through her ribs like smoke.</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda Maximoff," Rio drawled, voice low and sharp, laced with venomous delight. "Of all the people to get chummy with in this life, it had to be her. You really do have a taste for irony, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened, her nails digging crescents into her palm beneath the table. "Not now," she hissed under her breath, not daring to look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda paused mid-sentence. "What was that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing," Agatha said with forced calm, flashing a tense smile. "You were talking about Tommy, right?"</p><p> </p><p>Wanda hesitated, brows drawing together, but continued. Rio didn’t. She never did.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you tell her?" Rio purred, drifting to the seat beside Agatha, one leg crossed over the other. Her body language was playful, but her eyes were cold. "Does she know you lied to her? That you tried to take her powers? That you sunk your claws into her grief, fed her illusions, then tried to strip her bare?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, her pulse skittering. "Stop," she murmured, barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, but darling," Rio mocked, leaning in until her breath brushed the shell of Agatha’s ear. "It gets better. You failed. She tricked you. Trapped you. Left you to rot in your own little mind-prison for three. Whole. Years. And now? You’re here playing house with her in this soft little world like it never happened. Like she didn’t try to kill you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, her hand tightening around her mug. Her heart pounded behind her ribs, a sick drumbeat of confusion and fear.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda glanced at her, concern flaring. "Are you okay? You look kind of pale."</p><p> </p><p>"I’m fine," Agatha replied quickly, but her voice cracked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, her posture feline, her grin cruel. "Oh, you should see your face. You really don’t remember, do you? That look in her eyes when she hexed you into the ground? When she smiled as she walked away, sealing your fate?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re lying," she whispered harshly, barely moving her lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Am I?" Rio leaned back, draping an arm over the backrest. "She called you a monster, Agatha. She left you broken in Westview. And now you sip lattes with her like she didn’t gut you. <em>It’s pathetic</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, jaw clenched. "She’s not like that. Not this Wanda."</p><p> </p><p>"No," Rio agreed, her voice dripping with mock sweetness. "This version is so kind. So helpful. So naive. She doesn’t remember either. How convenient for both of you."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda reached across the table, her hand brushing Agatha’s. "Hey. Seriously, what’s going on? You’re scaring me."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her hand back as though burned. She stood abruptly, knocking her chair slightly off balance. "I — I need to go."</p><p> </p><p>"Agatha? <strong>Wait</strong>—"</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t. She bolted from the café, the doorbell jingling as she escaped into the street.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio followed. Always.</p><p> </p><p>"You can run, darling," she said, voice a phantom brushing the back of Agatha’s mind. "But you’re the one who summoned me. And you don’t get to forget. Not forever."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s steps quickened, her breath ragged, but deep down, under the panic and the ache — she felt something else too.</p><p> </p><p><em>Guilt. Because part of her believed every word</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed the car door shut with a violent thud that rattled the frame. The cold echo of it reverberated through the interior, bouncing off the windows, pressing into her ribs. She gripped the steering wheel with both hands, knuckles whitening, fingertips aching from the force.</p><p>Outside, the city’s muffled hum carried on, cars, distant horns, the occasional burst of laughter, but inside the vehicle, a tempest brewed. Her breathing came in shallow bursts, heat prickling under her collar, sweat beading at her temple. The scent of her lavender hand lotion clashed with the sharp scent of leather and old coffee in the cupholder.</p><p> </p><p>Then the voices started.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“You’re a danger to everyone, Agatha. You always have been.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s voice. Not this Wanda. Another. <em>That Wanda.</em> The one who wore grief like armor and magic like vengeance.</p><p> </p><p><em>“You don’t get to make excuses,”</em> that voice growled, biting. “<em>You did this</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Another flash — Wanda standing over her, eyes glowing red, power vibrating in the air like thunderclouds caught in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You don’t get to tell me who I am.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha curled forward, her forehead pressed against the steering wheel, the hard plastic digging into her skin. “Stop it,” she whispered, the tremor in her voice betraying the crumbling wall of her resolve. Her palms lifted, pressing against her temples as if pressure could silence memory.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You have no idea what you’ve unleashed,”</em> Wanda’s voice echoed again.<em> “You don’t get to make it right. You don’t deserve to.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Images tore through her: hex-bound towns, her own magic snarling back at her, Wanda’s eyes blazing with wrath and heartbreak.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“I’ll give you the role you chose... and you’ll play it well.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha rasped, panic rising. “No, I didn’t... I didn’t mean to—”</p><p> </p><p><em>“You’re cruel,”</em> Wanda hissed, <em>“and you have no idea what you've done.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“STOP!” Agatha screamed, her voice ripping from her throat as she slammed her palm against the dashboard. Her body shook. Tears slid hot and sharp down her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>The storm didn’t ease. It cracked open further.</p><p> </p><p><em>“You don't get to win,”</em> the echo came, colder now, distant and suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>Her own voice joined the haunting: frantic, pleading, furious.</p><p> </p><p>“<strong>RIO</strong>!” Agatha cried, her voice breaking on the name like it was torn from somewhere primal. “MAKE IT STOP!”</p><p> </p><p>Silence fell.</p><p> </p><p>The air in the car shifted. Not cooled, no, it thickened. Like velvet pressed to skin. Every sound outside dulled to a whisper. Her pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>"Was that so hard?" Rio's voice slithered into the quiet, honey-warm but edged like a blade.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her head slowly, breath ragged, her eyes red and glistening. Her gaze found Rio in the rearview mirror, lounging in the backseat like a cat with blood on its paws, calm, indulgent.</p><p> </p><p>"Get out of my car," Agatha hissed, though the tremble in her voice betrayed her lack of bite.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, resting her arms on the headrest of the passenger seat, her eyes gleaming with something between affection and amusement. "You called me, darling. Quite theatrically, might I add. You practically begged."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward her fully, her voice breaking around the edges. "You said you’d make it stop. So do it. Make it all stop."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, not warm, but aware. Sharpened with memory. "It’s not that simple, Agatha. Those aren’t just nightmares. They’re echoes. Wounds that never closed. I can dull them, sure... but they’ll claw their way back. They always do."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands clenched in her lap, her nails biting crescents into her skin. "I didn’t ask for this. For you. For any of it."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile faded, just a fraction. Her voice dropped into something lower, something real. "But you did. You called me. Just like always. And when you do... I come."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. “Why me? <em>Why now</em>? Why can’t you just leave me alone?”</p><p> </p><p>"Because you’re not ready to let me go," Rio said, her tone velvet-smooth, eyes unwavering. "And you know it."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, jaw tight, the sting of truth cutting deeper than she'd admit.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, her breath brushing Agatha’s cheek. "You tried to take her power. You lied to her. You manipulated the grief she could barely contain. And she punished you for it. Three<em> years, stuck inside your own spell.</em> Playing a role."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, eyes darting to Rio. "You’re lying."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sweet thing," Rio whispered, her lips brushing the shell of her ear. "She cursed you. Left you hollow and docile in a house you couldn’t escape. And you never even saw it coming. You begged her to let you help, and she caged you instead."</p><p> </p><p>"I don’t remember," Agatha rasped.</p><p> </p><p>"No," Rio said. "But your soul does."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled again, her throat closing. Her chest felt too small to hold everything pressing against it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back into the seat with a languid sigh, her voice a purr now. "And now you play her friend. Sit across from her in cafés, listening to stories about her children. Does she even know what she did to you?"</p><p> </p><p>“She’s my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>“Now. Not before.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s knuckles whitened on the steering wheel, her body stiff as a drawn bowstring. The sharp scent of city rain clung to her coat, the faint hum of traffic beyond the windshield barely cutting through the pressure in her chest. Her jaw tightened. Then, slowly, she turned to face Rio, her glare burning hotter than the flush in her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t understand, Rio!” she snapped, her voice cracking. “<em>The past doesn’t matter</em>! What we were before doesn’t matter!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk faltered — not all at once, but like something precious fracturing behind her eyes. Her lips parted slightly, the beginnings of some clever retort curling on her tongue, but nothing came. She just... watched. Studied Agatha’s face as though it hurt to do so, and still, she couldn't look away.</p><p> </p><p>“Doesn’t it?” she asked, her voice low, but stripped of its usual mocking lilt. “Can you really ignore it, Agatha? Pretend it doesn’t exist?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, the sound bitter and wet with something unspoken. “What do you want from me?” Her voice trembled, teeth clenched, eyes shining. “You want me to go back to what I was? <em>To feel for you what I felt before</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Didn’t smirk. She sat perfectly still, like a shadow that had lost its anchor to the body. Her gaze didn’t soften — but it didn’t harden either. She wasn’t teasing her. Not now.</p><p>Because in that past life, <em>Agatha had hated her</em>. <em>Had cursed her name</em>. Had damned her across lifetimes. And Rio <em>didn’t want that version</em> of Agatha back.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t speak. Not because she didn’t have words, but because there were none that could carry the weight of what she felt. She simply stared, as if trying to memorize the exact shape of Agatha’s voice when she pushed her away.</p><p>Then, without a whisper, she began to fade, first her outline, then the curve of her mouth, the shadow of her collarbone, the echo of her presence peeling away like mist.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t argue. Didn’t beg. Because Rio never begged.</p><p> </p><p>And because Agatha had told her to leave. “Leave me alone, Rio.” And so she did.</p><p> </p><p>The temperature in the car shifted as if someone had opened a window, though nothing moved. The air grew less charged, but heavier in the heart. Agatha’s shoulders slumped as the pressure released, only to be replaced by something quieter. Lonelier.</p><p>She stared down at her hands, trembling now, her breath catching in her throat.</p><hr/><p>Rio sat outside on the steps of Agatha’s house, a cold beer in her hand, staring up at the stars. The bottle dangled loosely between her fingers as she replayed Agatha’s words in her mind, the pain in her voice, the anger, the frustration.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>The past doesn’t matter. What we were doesn’t matter.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head back, taking a long sip of the beer. Maybe Agatha was right. Maybe dragging her through those memories was the wrong approach. It wasn’t helping, if anything, it was only making Agatha hate her more.</p><p> </p><p>She stared down at the bottle in her hand, her grip tightening. “Even after I gave her Nick back. After I gave her another daughter. She still can’t stand me.”</p><p> </p><p>The words left her lips in a whisper, and for the first time in a long while, Rio felt uncertain about her choices.</p><p><em>What’s the point?</em> she thought bitterly. <em>Even if she remembers everything, she’ll still hate me. She always has.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, setting the empty bottle beside her. She needed to do something different, something to remind Agatha of the good, not just the pain.</p><p>She stood abruptly and walked back into the house, finding Nicole sitting on the couch with her legs tucked under her.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicole,” Rio said, her voice calm but firm.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole looked up from her phone. “What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Call one of your mom’s friends,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “Just do it. Your mom needs someone right now, and <em>I’m not it</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole hesitated, frowning. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Trust me,” Rio said, her voice softening. “She’ll listen to them.”</p><p> </p><p>After a moment, Nicole nodded and picked up her phone, scrolling through the contacts. Less than half an hour later, the doorbell rang, and Nicole answered it to find Lilia Calderu standing on the porch.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on, dear?” Lilia asked, her brow furrowing as she looked at Nicole.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole bit her lip, her eyes darting to the stairs. “Mom’s... <em>sad</em>. I didn’t know what to do, so... someone told me to call you.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia frowned. “Someone?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole shrugged, avoiding the question. “Just... go talk to her. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia nodded, stepping inside and heading up the stairs. Nicole let out a breath and turned to see Rio leaning against the kitchen counter, her arms crossed.</p><p> </p><p>“Was that hard?” Rio asked, her tone light but with a hint of teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole shot her a look. “I still don’t get what you’re trying to do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a small, tired smile. “I’m trying a new strategy, kid. Your mom’s been through enough for one night.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole nodded slowly, her expression softening. “I hope it works.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered toward the stairs, where Lilia had disappeared, and she murmured under her breath, “So do I.”</p><hr/><p>Lilia sat gently on the edge of Agatha’s bed, her movements calm and deliberate. She reached out, brushing a strand of Agatha’s hair away from her face and letting her hand linger there, stroking softly.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s troubling you, child?” Lilia asked, her voice low and comforting, like a mother speaking to her child.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sniffled, turning her head slightly to meet Lilia’s gaze, her eyes red and puffy. “It doesn’t matter,” she muttered. “You wouldn’t believe me. And even if you did, there’s no way I could prove it.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia tilted her head, studying Agatha with that knowing look she always had—the one that made Agatha feel like she was a teenager again, caught in some lie or emotional whirlwind.</p><p> </p><p>“Try me,” Lilia said simply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, her lips trembling. She wanted to push Lilia away, to tell her it was pointless, but there was something about the way Lilia sat there, unyielding and patient, that broke her defenses.</p><p> </p><p>After a long moment, Agatha sighed and rolled onto her back, staring at the ceiling. “Do you believe in... spirits?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “Depends on the spirit. Are we talking restless ghosts, mischievous poltergeists, or something else entirely?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a bitter laugh, covering her face with her hands. “Something else. Something much worse. Or better. I don’t even know anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>“Go on,” Lilia urged, her tone gentle but firm.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her hands and looked at Lilia, her voice trembling. “I’ve been... seeing someone. A spirit. No, not a spirit. Something bigger. More powerful.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s expression didn’t falter. She nodded, her hand still resting on Agatha’s hair. “And what does this... ‘someone’ want?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s just it,” Agatha said, sitting up abruptly, her voice rising with frustration. “I don’t know! She says I called her, but I don’t remember doing anything like that. She keeps talking about the past, about things I can’t even remember. And she won’t leave me alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s brow furrowed slightly, but she stayed silent, letting Agatha vent.</p><p> </p><p>“She says she’s... <em>Death</em>,” Agatha continued, her voice dropping to a whisper. “The literal personification of it. And the worst part is... I think she’s telling the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, the room was silent. Lilia’s hand stilled in Agatha’s hair, but her expression remained calm, thoughtful.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Lilia said finally, her voice steady, “that would explain why you look like you haven’t slept in weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the remark. “You’re not... freaking out?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia smiled faintly, leaning back slightly. “I’ve been around long enough to know that the world is full of things we can’t explain. If you say you’re seeing Death, who am I to doubt you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, her chest tightening with relief and disbelief. “You’re... serious?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia nodded. “Of course. The real question is, what are you going to do about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders sagged, and she shook her head. “I don’t know. She’s everywhere. She knows things about me I don’t even know about myself. I just... I feel like I’m losing my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia reached out, taking Agatha’s hands in hers. “You’re not losing your mind, child. But if she’s here, there’s a reason for it. Spirits, especially ones like this — don’t just show up for nothing. You need to figure out what she wants and why. And what you want. This isn't a one way road.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, her hands trembling slightly in Lilia’s grip. “What if I don’t want to know? What if it’s something I can’t handle?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia squeezed her hands gently, her voice soft but firm. “Then you lean on those who care about you. You’re not alone in this, Agatha. Whatever it is, we’ll face it together, okay, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled with tears again, but this time, they weren’t just from sadness. For the first time in days, she felt a glimmer of hope.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia smiled, brushing a tear from Agatha’s cheek. “Now, get some rest. Whatever this is, it can wait until morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, lying back down as Lilia stood. As the older woman left the room, Agatha stared at the ceiling, her mind still racing but her heart feeling just a little lighter.</p><p>From the shadows of the room, Rio watched silently, her expression unreadable. For once, she said nothing, simply fading back into the darkness, leaving Agatha to her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha nearly dropped her coffee when Wanda and Jen’s expressions froze mid-conversation, their gazes locked on something — or rather, someone — behind her.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>A creeping chill slid down her spine.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" she asked, her voice tight as she followed their stares, already knowing.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s lips parted slightly, her cheeks flushing with something between shock and intrigue. “Who’s...?”</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Hi, darling</em>," Rio’s voice purred directly into Agatha’s ear, the whisper hot and intimate, like a breath stolen too close. Her words brushed Agatha’s skin like silk and static all at once, and it sent a full-body shiver through her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s reaction was instant and catastrophic. She gasped, choked, and sputtered coffee back into her cup, slamming it down on the table. Heat rose violently to her face as she spun around.</p><p>Rio stood there in black leather and the kind of confidence that filled every inch of the room. One hip cocked against the table, arms crossed, her grin a weapon.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You</em>,” Agatha hissed, pulse slamming in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could form another word, Jen leaned forward, brow arched with interest. “Wait... you two know each other?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her gaze darted between Rio and her friends. “Hold on now! You can <em>see</em> her?” she asked, voice rising like a snapped string.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fortunately</em>,” Jen replied, eyes raking Rio with bold curiosity. “Very fortunately.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t speak. She was staring at Rio with something like recognition in her eyes. Her fingers clenched lightly around her glass, as if grounding herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, of course, was loving every second of it. She tilted her head toward Agatha, murmuring with a feline grin, “Oh, they’re delightful. You really do have excellent taste in companions.”</p><p> </p><p>Without giving her friends a chance to ask more, Agatha stood so quickly her chair scraped against the floor. She grabbed Rio by the wrist, flesh meeting flesh with a jolt of heat, and yanked her toward the back of the bar.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse us,” she barked, ignoring the startled looks.</p><p> </p><p>The door to the balcony slammed shut behind them. Cold night air met her skin like a slap. Agatha shoved Rio against the railing with both hands, furious.</p><p> </p><p>“What the <em>hell</em> was that?” she snapped, her breath a mix of panic and fury. “What are you doing, showing yourself now? Why can they see you?!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t resist. She just leaned casually back against the iron railing, as if it were a chaise lounge, not a boundary. Her expression was maddeningly serene.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice to see you too, darling,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched. “Don’t ‘darling’ me! You’ve been invisible for weeks. What changed? Why now?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a languid shrug, her black hair catching silver moonlight. “The veil’s thinning. You're remembering more. Your grip on reality? A little looser than before. Perfect time for a grand entrance.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back like she’d been slapped. “This isn’t a fucking game, Rio. You can’t just play with my life like it’s a stage.”</p><p> </p><p>The smirk faded, just a breath. Rio's eyes darkened with something older, deeper. “You called me. You brought me back. I didn’t force my way in. You tore open the door.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice wavered. “I didn’t <em>ask</em> for this. For you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe not in words,” Rio replied softly, stepping forward, slow, deliberate, until there was only breath between them. Her voice dropped, velvet and razor. “But you wanted me. Somewhere deep. You wanted truth. Power. Me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha trembled, her anger fractured by something molten crawling up her spine. She hated this, the way Rio could undo her with a look. “This isn’t fair,” she whispered. "It isn't fucking fair!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes glinting. “Life isn’t fair. Love certainly isn’t.” She paused, voice softening. “But I’m not here to ruin you, Agatha. I’m here because you’re changing. And whether you admit it or not, I’m part of that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, heart drumming like thunder in a glass jar. “You’re a terrible thing,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled gently, her lashes dropping. “I'll take it as a compliment.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a ragged breath, stepped around her, and reached for the balcony door. “Don’t,” she said, not looking back. </p><p> </p><p>As she rejoined Wanda and Jen, Agatha’s pulse was still thudding in her ears. She tried to suppress the flush creeping up her neck, but Rio’s presence lingered behind her like the imprint of a too-hot hand. Even out of sight, that aura — warm and sharp as a blade — brushed against the edge of her senses.</p><p>Jen and Wanda weren’t looking at her anymore. Their attention was fixed behind her, eyes wide, expressions flickering with a mixture of curiosity and disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked, trying to sound casual, but her voice came out tighter than intended. She turned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already seated at the table, legs crossed elegantly, as if she had always belonged there. The sunlight caught in her dark hair, her smirk slow and lethal. She looked like a woman who owned the room, and the people in it.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was the first to recover, cocking her head. “Who are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave them a look so smooth, it felt like silk sliding over skin. “Oh, I’m just a humble researcher in history,” she said sweetly. “I came here from Puerto Rico to intern with Professor Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her mouth opened slightly, words caught behind her teeth. She glanced at Wanda, then Jen, trying to assess just how much damage Rio intended to cause.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to Agatha for half a second, just enough for her to see the flicker of challenge in those eyes — before she turned back to the others. “I had the privilege of studying under her some time ago. She was brilliant. So inspiring. I knew I had to follow her here to learn more about... well, <em>humans</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Humans?” Wanda asked, her brow arching high.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and buried her face in one hand. She didn’t even have the energy to pretend anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward slightly, her voice rich with faux innocence. “Oh, yes. Humans are endlessly fascinating. Their histories, their little rituals, their mortality. So textured. Don’t you agree, <em>Professor</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine locked straight. The word sent a jolt through her every time Rio said it, like being tugged backward by a leash. The way Rio wrapped that title in honey and poison made her skin crawl.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped her hand and shot Rio a venomous look. “Oh, I absolutely agree. Nothing more fascinating than humans.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen gave a low, impressed whistle. “You’re definitely enthusiastic.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was more cautious. “And you studied together... where?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled without missing a beat. “In Europe. Briefly. The details are rather foggy now, you know how it is.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could practically feel the smoke Rio was blowing into the room. Every word was like a calculated little spark.</p><p> </p><p>“And Professor Harkness has been an incredible mentor,” Rio added, her gaze sliding to Agatha. “So patient. So... <em>commanding</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved back her chair with a sharp screech, standing fast. Her entire body buzzed with heat. “Alright. <em>That’s enough</em>. We need to get back to the classroom.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen blinked. “Wait, already?”</p><p> </p><p>“Now,” Agatha said, her voice brittle.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rose too, calm and collected, brushing invisible lint from her coat. “Of course. Lead the way, <em>Professor</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>As they stepped into the hallway, the moment they were alone, Agatha spun around, eyes blazing. “You are unbelievable.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression was mild, but there was mischief flickering behind it. “I take that as a compliment.”</p><p> </p><p>“You just sat down like you belonged there,” Agatha snapped. “You made up some fake internship, and then you—”</p><p> </p><p>“Gave them what they wanted to hear?” Rio interrupted, tilting her head. “It’s not like the truth would go over any better, darling. Would you rather I told them I’m Death and you’ve been having midnight conversations with me between grading papers and existential dread?”</p><p> </p><p>“<strong><em>You gave me the idea to tell them</em></strong>!”</p><p> </p><p>“I never said it was a good one.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through her hair. Her skin still burned from the way Rio had looked at her. Had spoken to her.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t do this right now. Just stay quiet. Stay invisible. And for the love of everything, don’t talk to my friends again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted one perfectly arched brow, her smile slow and dangerous. “As you wish, <em>Professor</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>That word again. It slithered down her spine, coiled around her thoughts. There was something about the way Rio said it — playful, reverent, mocking — that made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Agatha turned her back and walked, fast, trying not to feel the way Rio’s gaze burned into her as surely as sunlight through glass.</p><p>She didn’t have to look back to know the smirk was still there.</p><hr/><p>Rio sat comfortably in Agatha’s chair, one leg draped languidly over the other, her fingers tapping lazily on the wooden armrest. Her body was reclined, completely relaxed, like a queen overseeing a court of unwitting students. Her dark eyes glinted with mischief, and that maddening smirk curved her lips — one Agatha had come to recognize as a warning more than a smile. She didn’t look like she belonged in a classroom. She looked like a sin dressed in black silk.</p><p>Agatha stood at the front, shoulders stiff, doing her best to ignore the chaos lounging at her desk. The air in the classroom was thick with tension, not just hers, but something deeper, darker, humming in her blood. A slow burn beneath her skin. She pressed her pointer against the whiteboard like it could anchor her to the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“For many historians,” she said, her voice even but tight, “the transition from feudalism to centralized monarchies marked a pivotal moment in the shaping of Europe’s political structure.”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio twirled a pen between her fingers. The click of it echoed louder than it should have in the quiet room.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s true,” Rio chimed in, her voice silky and low, curling around Agatha’s nerves like smoke. “But don’t forget the famine that wiped out half the population just a few decades earlier. They don’t like to talk about that part, do they?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s spine straightened. She turned slowly, her gaze sharp. Her knuckles whitened around the pointer.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for the insight,” she said through clenched teeth, her tone saccharine and deadly, “but I think the students are fine with the content from the syllabus.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She leaned forward, propping her chin on one hand, her grin lazy and infuriating. “Oh, I’m sure they’d love to hear about the real causes behind the Hundred Years’ War. It wasn’t just about a vacant throne, <em>Professor</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio said "Professor", with that slow, mocking affection, sent a shiver up Agatha’s spine. The word no longer sounded like a title. It sounded like a collar.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>A few students chuckled, leaning in like this was part of the show. One even raised his hand, intrigued. “Wait, is she right? Wasn’t it also about land disputes and stuff?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss a beat. “It was about all that and more. You should’ve seen the royal tantrums, grown men pouting like children over fields and borders.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, her fingers tightening around the pointer like it was the only thing keeping her from throwing it across the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, thank you, Rio,” she said, her voice laced with restraint. “Let’s stick to the curriculum for now.”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t stop. She offered corrections, commentary, anecdotes that sounded too vivid to be hypothetical. Every word dripped with condescension, and yet the students seemed utterly charmed.</p><p> </p><p>By the time class neared its end, one student raised a hand, looking both confused and amused. “How do you know all this stuff? Like... you talk like you were actually there.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved with pleasure. Her eyes met Agatha’s, daring her to stop her.</p><p> </p><p>“I was <em>there</em>, kiddo,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Laughter rippled through the room. Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” she hissed, stepping between her and the students. “What she means,” she said quickly, trying to keep her voice steady, “is that she’s traveled extensively. Research. Fieldwork. You know, immersion.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in the chair, arms stretched out like a queen bored with ceremony. “That’s one way to put it.”</p><p> </p><p>The bell rang, and students began filing out, whispering among themselves. A few shot Rio curious glances, clearly intrigued.</p><p>As the last of them disappeared, Rio stood and stretched with a satisfied sigh, her shirt riding up slightly to reveal a strip of skin that made Agatha’s jaw tighten.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you enjoy making my life harder?” Agatha asked, her voice low and furious as she walked up to her desk.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned slowly, meeting her gaze with that infuriating, predatory calm. “Immensely, <em>Professor</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched — just a fraction — but Rio caught it. She always caught it.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop calling me that,” Agatha growled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes gleamed. She leaned in close, her breath brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear. “But you wear the title so well. It makes me want to misbehave.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back, pulse spiking, her face flushed with frustration and something else she refused to name.</p><p> </p><p>She turned away, grabbing her notes with sharp, angry movements. “We’re done here.”</p><p> </p><p>“But darling,” Rio said sweetly, already moving to the door, “we’ve only just begun.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a bitch,” Agatha muttered, her voice low and bitter as she slammed her notebook closed with a sharp snap that echoed through the now-empty classroom. Her hands trembled slightly, not from fear, but from pressure, from restraint. From the sheer effort of not throttling Rio where she stood.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She leaned against the corner of Agatha’s desk with feline ease, her hip cocked just so, one arm draped over a stack of books like she was posing for a Renaissance painting. “What?” she replied smoothly, brushing an invisible speck of dust from her dark slacks. “I was just trying to help. They seemed to enjoy it.” Her grin curled like smoke, slow and smug, eyes glittering with a dangerous kind of amusement.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned under her breath, the sound low and almost guttural, like it clawed its way from her throat. She shoved papers into her leather satchel with more force than necessary, the crisp rustle of pages harsh in the silence. “I don’t need your ‘help.’ And stop telling them you were there. Do you want them to think I’ve completely lost my mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, the movement slow and deliberate, her black curls sliding over her shoulder like velvet. “They don’t think you’ve lost anything, darling.” Her tone softened into something sultry, something that slipped under Agatha’s skin like silk and nettles. “If anything, they probably think you’re even cooler now. Having me as your... <em>assistant</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze mid-motion, a pen still in her hand. She turned, slowly, her stare sharp enough to cut glass. “Assistant?” she echoed, voice cold with disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin widened, baring teeth. “It has a certain charm, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not my assistant,” Agatha snapped, slinging the bag over her shoulder, the strap biting into her skin. She took a step closer, close enough to smell Rio’s perfume, warm amber and something old, like incense and thunderclouds. “You’re my—”</p><p> </p><p>“Companion?” Rio offered sweetly, her voice feigning innocence while her eyes told another story. “Confidante? Emotional support apparition? <em>Lover</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Annoyance,” Agatha snapped, cutting through the tease like a whip. Her tone was sharp, but her pulse betrayed her, beating hard against her ribs, her breath short.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed softly, the sound curling low and warm in the air like smoke. “Oh, I’ve been called worse. But if I’m an annoyance, why do you keep me around?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just turned on her heel and stormed toward the door, her heels clicking angrily against the tiled floor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fell into step beside her, walking leisurely, like a cat pacing its prey. “You know,” she said conversationally, “I could teach your students a thing or two about the Black Death next time. Maybe the part about how nobles tried bathing in rosewater to stay alive. Very poetic. Very stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Agatha muttered, gripping the strap of her bag like it was the only thing tethering her sanity to the earth.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio’s laughter followed, warm and rich and maddening. Like honey poured over razors.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. She didn’t have to. She could feel Rio’s eyes on her, sharp and possessive, like a storm that had already chosen its lightning rod.</p><hr/><p>Agatha decided to clean the house while the kids were still at school. The sun poured in through the windows, catching motes of dust dancing in the air. The hum of the vacuum filled the halls, giving her a rare moment of solitude, one she intended to enjoy without interruption.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had offered to help, emphasis on offered. After folding and refolding the same t-shirt with all the enthusiasm of a cat watching paint dry, she finally tossed it aside and proclaimed, “This fabric is inherently flawed. I refuse to wrestle with factory crookedness.” She’d vanished into the bedroom with a theatrical sigh, claiming “mental exhaustion.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mind. As long as Rio stayed out of her way, she could enjoy a few blessed hours of order.</p><p> </p><p>Or so she thought.</p><p> </p><p>Halfway down the stairs, her foot caught on the vacuum cord. In an instant, she was falling. Her heart jumped into her throat, eyes clenching shut, her stomach twisting. She braced for the sharp bite of wood against bone.</p><p> </p><p>But the impact never came.</p><p>Instead: arms. Strong, steady, catching her mid-fall like she weighed nothing at all.</p><p> </p><p>Gasping, Agatha opened her eyes to find Rio crouched beneath her, one arm around her back, the other supporting behind her knees. The world tilted. The vacuum hose slithered across the floor beside them like a lazy serpent.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you get here? You were in the bedroom!” Agatha’s voice was a rasp, her breath shallow, adrenaline crackling beneath her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked down at her with a smirk that curved slow and deliberate. “Which part of ‘cosmic, universal, all-powerful being’ in my résumé haven’t you figured out yet?” Her voice dripped with mischief, as casual as if they were discussing grocery lists.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to argue, to shove her away and bark something scathing. But her body betrayed her. Her heart was racing too fast. Her skin burned where Rio touched her, the heat of her body seeping through fabric like something elemental.</p><p>Gently, Rio set her down at the foot of the stairs. She knelt beside her, fingers undoing the vacuum cord with surprising tenderness — slow, focused, like undoing a knot of ribbon instead of electrical cable.</p><p> </p><p>The moment stretched.</p><p> </p><p>When she stood again, Rio didn’t move back. She stayed close, too close. Their breath mingled in the narrow space between them, and Agatha suddenly became acutely aware of everything. The tension coiling in her core. The ache just beneath her ribs. The scent that clung to Rio like a spell: petrichor, pine, and something darker, like wild magic in the middle of the night.</p><p>Rio’s hand lifted, slow and deliberate, like she was afraid Agatha might disappear if she moved too fast. Her fingers brushed a lock of hair away from Agatha’s cheek. The touch was featherlight but deliberate, trailing down to the curve of her jaw. Then lower, into her hair, slipping through it with maddening care. Not teasing. Not demanding.</p><p> </p><p><em>Savoring</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t speak. She didn’t dare. Her eyes fluttered shut without permission, and her breath caught when her body responded before her mind did, tilting her head just slightly, unconsciously, exposing her throat in a silent offering.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t pounce. She didn’t rush.</p><p> </p><p>She simply leaned in, brushing her lips, not her mouth, not yet, but the barest edge of them, against the curve of Agatha’s neck. The touch was a whisper of heat. Barely there. Maddening.</p><p> </p><p><em>And Agatha felt it everywhere</em>.</p><p> </p><p>A tremble rolled down her spine. Her lips parted. A sound slipped out, soft, unguarded, something between a gasp and a moan. The kind of sound she hadn’t let herself make in years. The kind born from a memory her body still carried, even if her mind refused to name it.</p><p>Rio didn’t gloat. She didn’t speak. She just let it linger. That weightless intimacy. That pressure that wasn’t pressure at all.</p><p> </p><p>Then her lips hovered there, just near Agatha’s ear, and in a voice so low it barely existed, she whispered, “I’d catch you again, you know. Every time. Every life.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes slowly, her breath shallow. “Stop playing with me,” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved near her skin. “Who said I was playing, my love?”</p><p> </p><p>Encouraged, Rio leaned in further, her breath brushing hot and slow along the delicate curve of Agatha’s neck. The warmth of it sent a flush up Agatha’s spine, her breath catching mid-exhale. She stood perfectly still, as if any movement might unravel her completely.</p><p>Rio's lips hovered, not in haste but with reverence, tasting the silence between them. Then, deliberate, slow, she pressed a kiss just below Agatha’s jaw. Not rushed, not demanding. It was intimate, almost devotional. The contact ignited something low in Agatha’s belly, something she hadn’t let herself feel in years.</p><p>The sound that escaped her lips, deep, unguarded, sinful, cut through the quiet like a secret. She felt it vibrate in her throat before she even realized she’d made it. And Rio, gods, Rio, smiled against her skin, savoring it like a victory she hadn’t needed to chase.</p><p>The world outside faded. The vacuum cord. The mess. The silence of the house. All of it dissolved into the charged air between them.</p><p>Rio lingered. Not just with her body but with her presence, so heavy and commanding it made Agatha dizzy. Her breath still ghosted over Agatha’s pulse, her fingers brushing lightly at the nape of her neck, playing with a strand of hair, winding it slowly between two fingers like a binding spell.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse fluttered under Rio’s mouth, frantic, traitorous. She <em>hated</em> how Rio made her feel seen. How she could turn her bones to fire with a whisper.</p><p>Rio drew back only slightly, just enough to meet her eyes, dark, bottomless, hungry, but patient. Her expression had shifted. Gone was the smug grin, replaced with something deeper. Something that made Agatha’s knees weaken.</p><p> </p><p>“Say the word, <em>Agatha</em>,” Rio murmured, the words spoken in that low, devastating voice that coiled around the base of Agatha’s spine. “Tell me to stop, and I will.”</p><p> </p><p>Her name had never sounded so much like a command and a promise at once. Agatha swallowed hard, her lips parted to answer, but no sound came. She leaned forward instead, imperceptible, involuntary, drawn in by the gravity between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. She simply watched. Waited. Her fingertips grazed Agatha’s cheek, a reverent touch that made her tremble. “You don’t have to fight it,” she whispered. “You never did.”</p><p> </p><p>Something broke loose in Agatha then, guilt or fear or something raw she didn’t have the language for. She stumbled backward, nearly tripping on the baseboard. Her chest rose and fell in quick, shallow bursts, like she couldn’t get enough air.</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t, this can’t ...” she stammered. Her voice was hoarse, cracking under the pressure of wanting and not wanting. “You can’t just show up and… and do this. You don’t get to have this much power over me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood still, framed by golden light pouring in through the window behind her. She didn’t argue. She didn’t deny it. Her gaze was steady, her voice softer now, no trace of teasing. “I didn’t do anything you didn’t want.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides. “That’s not—” She stopped herself. The words died on her tongue. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “I don’t know what I want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, her hands sliding into the pockets of her slacks. She didn’t look disappointed. She didn’t gloat. She simply nodded, the gesture small and grounded. “Then figure it out,” she said. “Because I’m not going anywhere. Not until you do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her back to her, pressing her palm to the wall like it might anchor her. Her whole body vibrated with tension, her senses still flooded with Rio, her scent, her voice, the ghost of her mouth on her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Just…” Her voice cracked. She closed her eyes. “Just give me space. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Then the sound of quiet steps. Rio moving away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look. She couldn’t. But she felt the shift in the air, the absence of heat, the way the room seemed colder the moment Rio left it.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally moved, it was to slump down onto the bottom step, her spine curving with the weight she couldn’t name. The wood creaked softly beneath her, cool against her thighs through the fabric of her jeans. Her hands rose to cradle her face, fingertips pressing into her temples like she could knead away the storm brewing beneath her skin.</p><p> </p><p>The silence in the house pressed in on her, but inside her head, everything screamed.</p><p> </p><p>She had leaned in. She hadn’t pulled away. And worst of all, she wasn’t sure she ever wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught as she let her head fall back against the railing. The bannister felt solid, grounding, but it didn’t stop the flickering memories from bleeding in, the drag of Rio’s fingers through her hair, the heat of her breath against her skin, the exact point on her neck where her lips had touched.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>God, she could still feel it.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut. The phantom pressure of Rio’s mouth played on a loop, and the sound she’d made, raw, involuntary, humiliating, echoed like a confession. The way her body had tilted toward Rio’s without thought, without permission. As if it remembered something her mind had buried.</p><p> </p><p>She sucked in a breath, trying to steady herself, to wrestle her traitorous heart back into submission.</p><p> </p><p>“Is everything okay, Mom?” he asked, his voice soft, like he wasn’t sure if he was interrupting something private. His head tilted slightly, studying her face with that uncanny, too-perceptive gaze of his.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat up so quickly she nearly knocked her own knees. Her hand shot to the banister, steadying herself.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Oh my God!”</em> she gasped, voice shrill with surprise. “Sweetheart! I ... I was just...” She blinked rapidly, searching for something, anything, to say. “I was just resting my eyes.”</p><p> </p><p>Nick stood a few feet away, backpack still slung over one shoulder, his small brows drawn together with concern. His sneakers were muddy from the walk home, one shoelace untied.</p><p> </p><p>Nick squinted at her. “On the stairs?”</p><p> </p><p>Before she could embarrass herself further, Rio’s voice slid in like silk, smooth and smug and far too pleased. “She’s just tired, champ,” she purred, stepping into view behind him, one arm resting lazily against the wall. Her expression was a picture of relaxed dominance, comfortable, confident, utterly in control.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire body tensed. She could already hear the wicked amusement in Rio’s tone. That knowing glint in her eye set her nerves on fire.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, her voice dropping as she looked between mother and son. “What do you say we go upstairs, change into something a little more comfortable, and hit the garden? Maybe play a game or two?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick’s face lit up like a sunrise. “Really? Can we?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised her hand, fingers cutting the air like a blade. “Not before he finishes his schoolwork,” she said, her tone clipped, sharp, pointed. She was reclaiming control, or at least trying to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio crouched to Nick’s level, her hand tousling his hair, her grin all teeth. “Cut the kid some slack, my love. One little break, then he can drown in homework. Deal?” She turned her full attention to Nick, ignoring Agatha entirely. “Race you to the stairs?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah!” Nick took off running, laughing as his backpack bounced wildly behind him.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, ready to yell something else, but Rio was already gliding after him, barefoot and effortless, like a shadow with hips.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” she snapped, dragging herself to her feet and glaring toward the second floor. “Don’t you dare let him skip his homework!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, <em>Professor</em>!” Rio’s voice echoed down the stairs, all singsong and dripping with smugness. “I’ll make sure he learns... something.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned aloud, dragging her hands down her face. Her entire body felt hot, too hot. Not just from the physical tension, but from the weight of everything Rio stirred in her.</p><p> </p><p>And now the teasing nickname again. That infuriating, devastatingly seductive “<em>Professor</em>” that always left a bloom of heat in the pit of her stomach and crawled under her skin like silk and nails.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s going to drive me insane,” Agatha muttered, but even she could hear how breathless she sounded. And worse — how fond.</p><p> </p><p>Despite her frustration, Agatha couldn’t stop the lingering warmth coiling through her chest, the phantom press of Rio’s lips still ghosting her skin like a fever dream. She shook her head sharply, trying to shake it off, but as she bent to coil the vacuum cord and tidy the mess left on the stairs, the memory clung to her like smoke.</p><p>Nicole stood at the base of the staircase, one hip cocked, arms folded with casual defiance. Her brow was arched in that signature way that Agatha had come to dread — so reminiscent of Rio it made her teeth grind. The teen’s expression danced between amused mockery and cool judgment, and her silence said everything before her mouth even opened.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow,” Nicole finally said, her voice dry, laced with the kind of disdain only a teenage daughter could master. “You’re absolutely wrecked in your self-pity, Mom. It’s almost impressive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped her eyes up, heat rushing to her cheeks. “Go bother someone else, Nicky.”</p><p> </p><p>But Nicole didn’t budge. She leaned casually against the banister, and the dim light caught the curve of a smirk curling her lips. “What did she do to you this time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, stalking toward the kitchen. “It’s none of your business,” she snapped. “Go upstairs, change, and make your brother a snack.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole padded after her, the sound of her socks whispering against the floor. “Uh-uh. Not happening. You’re acting weird, weirder than usual. Spill.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a tight breath, opening the fridge as a distraction. The cold air kissed her flushed skin, but it did nothing to cool the heat that had taken residence inside her. “Nicole, not now.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole didn’t miss a beat. She perched on a kitchen stool, folding her arms again with dramatic flair. “You’re deflecting. That means something happened. So what was it? Did she trip you with one of her cryptic metaphors? Did she kiss you and blow your mind? Or,” her grin widened “was it both?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed the fridge shut. “Nicole. Upstairs. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole laughed. “Come on, Mom. You’re practically humming with it. Whatever happened, it got under your skin. Admit it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha collapsed into a kitchen chair, dragging a hand down her face. “I tripped on the vacuum cord. She caught me. That’s it.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole narrowed her eyes. “That’s not it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you care?” Agatha muttered, barely above a growl.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re being cagey,” Nicole said, resting her chin on her palm. “And because I’ve never seen you look like this. Like you’re trying not to panic and melt into the floor at the same time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, jaw clenched. Silence stretched.</p><p> </p><p>“She got... too close,” she said finally, her voice low, raw.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s brow lifted, but her voice softened. “And you didn’t stop her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole sat back, the weight of realization blooming across her face. “Oh my God. Mama got to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a deadly look. “Nicole. Not another word.”</p><p> </p><p>But Nicole was already grinning. “I knew there was something. You’re constantly fighting with her, but it’s not just that. You like the fire. <em>You like her</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned into her palms. “Why are you like this?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole hopped off the stool, snagging an apple from the fruit bowl. “Because I live here. I'm your daughter. And because, honestly, this is better than TV.”</p><p> </p><p>She headed for the hallway, her voice floating back over her shoulder. “But you better figure out what you want, because she already has. And she’s not backing down.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her go, the silence that followed almost worse than the teasing. She let out a groan, slumping in her chair.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course she’s not giving up,” she muttered, staring at the tile beneath her feet. “She’s Death.”</p><hr/><p>The golden afternoon light spilled across the garden, casting soft, dappled shadows over the wooden table. Warm sun clung to their skin, and the scent of jasmine from the trellis wound its way through the breeze. Agatha sat with her back rigid, her teacup balanced between careful fingers, trying to pretend that this was normal. That Rio, sitting across from her with legs crossed and a plate of untouched sandwiches, wasn’t slowly, artfully unraveling her nerves.</p><p> </p><p>Nick, oblivious to the tension, bit into a cookie with the kind of innocent joy only children possessed. Crumbs clung to his cheeks. "Mama Rio," he asked, blinking up at her with wide eyes, "where do you come from?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her tea, a strangled cough escaping her lips as she turned toward her son. Rio, on the other hand, leaned back with feline grace, her fingers languidly brushing a stray curl from her face. She grinned, sharp, sweet, dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>"Where do I come from?" she echoed, tasting the question on her tongue like dark chocolate. Her eyes flicked toward Agatha, catching the tight line of her mouth. It only made her smile deepen. "That's a very interesting question, little one."</p><p> </p><p>Nick beamed, rocking slightly in his chair with excitement. Beside him, Nicole watched in silence, arms folded, her dark gaze unreadable. She always watched Rio like she was waiting for her to slip, or waiting to see more.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cradled her teacup in both hands, the porcelain warm against her palms. "I come from everywhere... and nowhere," she said, her voice soft, laced with old shadows and quiet wonder. "I’ve walked through deserts so hot the air shimmered like water, cities that breathed smoke and steel, forests where the wind spoke in forgotten tongues."</p><p> </p><p>Nick's eyes sparkled. "Everywhere? Really?"</p><p> </p><p>"Really," Rio said, her tone reverent. Her gaze lifted, distant for a moment. "I’ve seen dawn rise over stone temples swallowed by jungle. I’ve seen stars fall into oceans so deep they swallowed light."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole raised an eyebrow, skeptical. "That’s poetic. But... are you just saying you travel a lot?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio met Nicole’s stare, lips twitching. "You could say that. But my travels —" her voice dipped, slow, measured, "have lasted a bit longer than most."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted uncomfortably in her seat. "Don’t tell them too much," she said, voice clipped, her hand gripping her teacup too tightly.</p><p> </p><p>"Don’t worry, darling," Rio murmured, without looking at her. "I know where to draw the line."</p><p> </p><p>Nick leaned in, elbows on the table. "What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever seen?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, the expression softening something in her usually sharp face. She set her cup down, fingers lingering on the rim. "Once," she began, "there was a valley, hidden between two mountains. The flowers there only bloomed at night. They glowed, not from magic, but from the way they absorbed the moonlight. The people believed the stars had kissed them. Every evening they sang to the sky. The air shimmered with their voices. It felt like standing inside a prayer."</p><p> </p><p>Nick gasped. "That sounds magical!"</p><p> </p><p>"It was," Rio said, her voice hushed. "But it’s gone now. Time changes everything."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole frowned, leaning her chin on her hand. "You talk like you were there a hundred years ago."</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her gaze to her, her smile returning with a spark. "Maybe I was."</p><p> </p><p>Nick, still enchanted, asked, "Did you have friends there?"</p><p> </p><p>The question seemed to land somewhere deeper. Rio hesitated, her gaze dropping to the center of the table. "A few," she said finally. "But when you’re... different, staying is hard. People leave. Or you do. They are afraid of you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's heart clenched. There was something raw in Rio’s tone, unguarded for once. She didn’t like it. It made her feel too much.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright," she said sharply, standing and beginning to collect plates. "Storytime's over. Nick, you still have homework."</p><p> </p><p>"Aww," Nick whined, but he slid off his chair. Nicole rose slowly, her eyes lingering on Rio with an expression Agatha couldn’t quite place.</p><p> </p><p>Left alone, Rio lounged in her seat like she belonged there, like she was already woven into the bones of the house. Her eyes followed Agatha with quiet amusement. "You didn’t like my story?" she asked, voice smooth as velvet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha set the plates down harder than she meant to. "It’s not about liking it. It’s about boundaries. They don’t need to know... everything."</p><p> </p><p>Rio's smirk was gentle now, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. "Don’t worry, Agatha," she said softly. "I only tell them what they’re ready to hear. Sometimes I'm a responsible adult."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She stood in the doorway for a moment longer, watching Rio in the light-drenched garden, the soft wind tousling her hair like it belonged there. Like she belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>Under the fading gold of the afternoon light, Agatha huffed and turned toward the house, the soft crunch of her boots pressing into the garden path. The breeze was warm against her skin, but the chill that clung to her chest came from somewhere deeper. Each step away from the table felt heavier than it should have. As she carried the last of the plates inside, she couldn’t stop the nagging pull in her gut — Rio hadn’t told that story just for the children.</p><p>When she returned, Agatha dropped into the chair with a sigh, her movements slower now. She rested her elbows on the table, one hand propping up her chin, the other listlessly brushing a crumb off the tabletop. The air between them held weight — not tense, not hostile, just... thick. Like a silence that remembered too much.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re quiet,” Rio said at last, her voice a velvet murmur. “That’s new.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away. She tilted her head just enough to glance at her, the gesture sharp but weary. “I’m tired, Rio. Tired of... this.” Her hand gestured vaguely in the space between them, as if the shape of their mess was too large to name.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her, her fingers still idly stroking the porcelain of her teacup. “Tired of me,” she said, voice dipped in low amusement, “or tired of everything else?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, then closed it again. Her eyes dropped to her lap, and for a moment, her thumb rubbed circles into the fabric of her jeans. “I don’t know,” she said, softer now. “Both. Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, the movement slow and feline, her posture lazy but precise. Her eyes, impossibly dark, glittered in the light as she studied Agatha’s face. “I don’t think it’s me you’re tired of,” she murmured. “I think you’re tired of fighting.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched at the edge of the tablecloth. She tried to scoff, to summon some cutting response. But the effort fizzled under the truth of it. “I’m not fighting anything,” she muttered instead.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fighting yourself, Agatha,” Rio replied, not cruel, not smug, just certain. “You’re clinging to this version of yourself that you think you’re supposed to be. Strong. Controlled. Unshakable. But I see the real you. The one buried under all that armor. The one who remembers what it’s like to burn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to her, sharp and wounded. “Don’t act like you know me.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed between them like a blade, but Rio didn’t flinch. Her smirk softened, almost vanishing. “I don’t have to act,” she said, her voice stripped bare. “I do know you, Agatha. I’ve known every version of you. In every life, in every world. I’ve loved you through your rage, through your brilliance, through your ruin.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the problem,” Agatha said, her arms folding tight across her chest, as if trying to keep herself from splintering open. “You keep talking about this past I don’t even remember. You speak like it’s gospel, like it should mean something. But it doesn’t feel real to me. None of it does.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t leave her. Her voice was quiet now, low and slow, the kind of softness that demanded attention. “Do you feel it now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “Feel what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t smile this time. She simply looked at her, really looked. “This,” she said, gesturing between them with a single movement of her hand. Her fingers were long and elegant, and Agatha couldn’t help but track the motion with her eyes. “This pull. This current between us. You try to dismiss it, to rationalize it away. But it’s here. It’s always been here. And it scares the hell out of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s pulse jumped, too quick beneath her skin. She swallowed hard, her mouth dry. Her fingers gripped the edge of her seat like she might fly apart if she didn’t anchor herself. The wind brushed against the back of her neck, raising goosebumps she wished she could blame on the weather.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not scared,” she said, but her voice didn’t hold. It cracked, thin and strained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back, one arm draping lazily over the back of her chair, the other toying with the hem of her sleeve. “You’re terrified,” she said, not unkindly. “And that’s alright. But stop lying to yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest rose and fell unevenly, her arms crossed tight over her middle like she was bracing for a storm that had already landed. The fading light painted gold across the table and warmed her skin, but inside, everything felt tight and cold.</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t mean anything,” she said, her voice hollow. She meant for it to sting, but it slipped out softer, uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair with a grace that was almost feline, her body relaxed, but her eyes never leaving Agatha. Her smile was small, private. “Doesn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a sharp breath and dragged her fingers through her hair, tugging a little too hard at the roots. The pressure grounded her for a moment, but it did nothing to silence the echo of Rio’s voice under her skin. “You’re impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been called worse,” Rio murmured, her tone light but her gaze unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed wasn't empty, it pulsed between them like a living thing. Agatha could feel it in her throat, thick and heavy, like all the words she couldn’t say were pressing upward and refusing to be swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>She shifted in her seat, fingers drumming against the edge of the table. Her eyes stayed fixed on her lap, on the patterns her hands made against the fabric of her jeans. “Why do you care so much?” she asked finally, her voice low. “Why not just... leave me alone? You clearly have better things to do with your cosmic, all-powerful existence.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t laugh this time. She watched Agatha carefully, her expression softening in a way that stripped her of every mask. “Because you called me, Agatha. And because I love you, whether you believe it or not.”</p><p> </p><p>The words were simple. But they sank like stones in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She blinked hard, staring down at her hands, at the slight tremble in her fingers, the tiny scar on her knuckle, the chipped nail polish. Anything to avoid the weight of Rio’s gaze. Her throat tightened, aching with all the things she didn’t know how to say.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not asking for anything from you,” Rio continued, her voice quieter now, edged with something deeper. Not sadness. Not pity. Patience. “I just want you to stop running from yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how to stop,” Agatha whispered, her voice cracking around the edges.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood slowly, the movement fluid and unhurried. She circled the table and knelt beside Agatha, one hand rising, not forceful, not demanding, just there. She placed it gently on Agatha’s shoulder, the warmth of it blooming through fabric and muscle like a pulse.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to figure it out all at once,” she said, her breath brushing against Agatha’s jaw. “Just... let yourself feel. Start there.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She couldn’t. Her heart pounded so violently it echoed in her ears, drowning out the quiet rustle of leaves around them. Her eyes closed. Just for a second.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t lean into Rio, but she didn’t pull away either.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let Agatha take the lead, her dark eyes steady and unyielding as Agatha leaned in. The kiss was cautious but laced with tension, a slow, tentative meeting of mouths that carried the weight of lifetimes and the promise of something dangerous. Agatha's lips trembled against Rio's, a soft exhale escaping her as her fingers brushed the edge of Rio's jaw. The kiss was brief, a flicker of heat, not a fire, but it left Agatha breathless.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled back, blinking hard, her cheeks burning. The air between them buzzed with static. Before either could speak, the sharp sound of the doorbell rang out, cutting through the silence like a blade.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She remained perfectly still, her posture loose and feline, head tilted, eyes gleaming with amusement. “Expecting someone, darling?” she asked, her voice a low hum, soaked in velvet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped away, her body flushed with the aftershock of the kiss. Her lips still tingled. She ran a hand through her hair, trying to compose herself. “No,” she muttered. “Not... really.”</p><p> </p><p>Her steps to the front door were measured but fast, her breath unsteady, the soft creak of the hardwood under her bare feet the only sound besides her heartbeat thudding in her ears. Behind her, Rio leaned against the hallway wall like a shadow that refused to let go, cool, unreadable, but humming with the thrill of proximity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened the door and met the calm, stoic faces of Officer Daniel and his partner. The weight of reality settled hard over her shoulders, snuffing out the warmth that lingered behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Officer Daniel,” she greeted, her voice carefully even, though her pulse fluttered with apprehension. “What can I do for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Harkness,” Daniel replied with a curt nod, his tone as firm as always. “We have an update regarding your husband’s case.”</p><p> </p><p>The knot in Agatha’s stomach twisted tighter, like barbed wire pulling through soft flesh. She held the door wider, her fingers briefly slipping on the handle from the sheen of nervous sweat. “Of course,” she said, stepping aside. “Come in.”</p><p> </p><p>The officers entered with quiet authority, their presence dragging cold air in with them. Rio remained in the hallway, her form still and attentive, her eyes never leaving Agatha.</p><p>As Daniel and his partner stepped into the living room, the familiar scent of chamomile and cinnamon lingered in the air from the abandoned teacups. The light through the window had softened, casting golden edges over everything it touched, except for the tension that tightened Agatha’s spine the moment Rio’s name almost slipped free.</p><p>Daniel’s sharp eyes landed on Rio first. She was draped over the armrest of the couch like a cat in the sun, legs crossed, posture loose, but her gaze sharp. She didn’t stand. She didn’t flinch. Her dark eyes met his, calm and assessing.</p><p> </p><p>“And you are?” Daniel asked, his voice clipped and precise, the question more accusation than inquiry.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head slowly, a corner of her mouth curving upward. “Rio Vidal,” she began, voice slow and rich, like warm honey laced with venom. “The Deat—”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Friend</em>!” Agatha’s voice snapped through the room like a breaking glass. She stepped in front of Rio so fast her tea nearly sloshed over. Her pulse pounded in her throat, every muscle in her body tensed. “She’s my friend. A close friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s eyebrows lifted slightly, and though he nodded, the skepticism in his eyes stayed rooted. “I see.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio offered nothing but a feline smile in response, folding her hands neatly in her lap. “Don’t worry, officer. I’m just here to support Agatha. Harmless, I assure you.”</p><p> </p><p>Her tone was playful, but Agatha caught the subtle gleam behind her words, the deliberate needle meant to unnerve. She shot Rio a look that could’ve flayed lesser beings.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel turned away with a slight, skeptical grunt. “You mentioned an update?” Agatha prompted, her voice calm but taut.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel pulled a folder from under his arm, the rustle of paper loud in the quiet room. He flipped to a page and held up a photo. “We’ve spoken to a witness. A neighbor. They claim they saw your husband the night he disappeared. Leaving alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned, her throat tightening. She folded her arms as if shielding herself. “Alone? Are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“They were adamant. He got into a car down the street. Unfortunately, the vehicle description is vague, but it’s progress.”</p><p> </p><p>As Daniel spoke, Agatha could feel Rio’s gaze on her, calm and steady like a hand pressed to the center of her chest. She could see it out of the corner of her eye, Rio’s amused smirk as if she already knew how this story ended.</p><p> </p><p>“And how long have you been staying here?” Daniel shifted his tone, suddenly addressing Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile never faded. She turned slightly toward him, her profile catching the light, elegant and unreadable. “Not long. Just helping Agatha... through her grief.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a cool finality in her voice. Daniel’s jaw tensed. “Well. If either of you remembers something else,” he said, eyes locked on Rio now, “call us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Agatha answered, too quickly. Her fingers tightened around the hem of her sweater, knuckles pale. “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>As the officers turned to leave, Daniel glanced back one last time. Rio raised her hand in a slow, mock-sincere wave, the glint in her eye making Agatha’s stomach twist.</p><p> </p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around the second they were out of sight. “What the hell was that?” she hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stretched luxuriously, like a predator who’d just finished toying with prey. “I was charming.”</p><p> </p><p>“You were provoking him.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m always provoking someone. It’s part of my charm.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “You nearly said it. <em>Your name</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rose and moved toward her, slow and deliberate. “And you stopped me. That’s progress. You're reading me already!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared up at her, her jaw tight, lips parted, breath shallow. The silence between them pulsed, hot, taut, unforgiving. Her hands were fists at her sides, nails biting into her palms to keep her grounded, to stop the tremble that threatened to betray her. The air between them felt too thick, too charged, like it might snap and spark if either of them moved too fast.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. She didn’t need to. Her words alone were an earthquake.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re mine, Agatha” she said softly, each syllable brushing over Agatha’s skin like velvet-lined steel. “And I don’t like being forgotten.”</p><p> </p><p>The sentence struck low, just beneath Agatha’s sternum, where her pulse lived. It wasn’t just the words. It was the way Rio said them, the ownership wrapped in intimacy, the quiet fury in the softness. No raised voice. No demand. Just truth, delivered like a secret promise and a threat all in one.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but nothing came. Her throat had gone dry. There was too much heat in her chest, and not nearly enough breath to hold it.</p><p> </p><p>So she turned, sharply, the movement too fast, too defensive. “I need a drink,” she muttered, her voice lower than intended, edged with something raw. Her heels clicked against the floor as she stormed toward the kitchen, not to escape Rio, she told herself, but to drown her in silence.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio’s laughter curled through the air like smoke. Low, knowing. Sinful.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take one too, darling,” she called, the nickname sliding off her tongue like a touch against bare skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s steps faltered, just once. She hated that word from Rio’s mouth, hated how it sounded like possession and worship all at once. Hated that it made her thighs clench and her mouth dry.</p><p> </p><p>In the kitchen, she yanked open the cabinet and grabbed a glass. Her fingers trembled slightly as she poured the whiskey, just one finger more than usual. She didn’t pour Rio’s. Not yet. That would be a surrender.</p><p>The sound of approaching footsteps was soft, but her body knew. She felt Rio before she saw her, felt her heat like a hand at her back, felt the air shift with her presence. The kitchen lights cast a golden glow, and when Agatha turned to face her, Rio was already leaning lazily against the counter, arms crossed, eyes dark and fixed on her.</p><p> </p><p><em>Predatory. Patient</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not going to win, Rio,”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said quietly, her voice low but taut, knuckles white against the marble counter behind her. She didn’t look at her—refused to. Her breath was tight, her spine straight, but her pulse betrayed her, beating too fast, too loud.</p><p> </p><p>“You think you can get under my skin,” she continued, voice trembling just enough to betray the war inside her. “Twist me into knots until I give in. But I’m not the same woman I was in whatever life you think we shared.”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, footsteps moved slowly over the kitchen tiles, bare, deliberate. A quiet click of boot against floor. <em>Then silence</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Then warmth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice came next, smooth as poured whiskey, low as a whisper at midnight. “Oh, Agatha…” she purred, stepping close enough for her breath to ghost against the shell of Agatha’s ear, “you’re exactly who you were. You just don’t remember how good it felt to stop pretending.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her fingers dug into the edge of the counter.</p><p>Rio circled her like smoke, her presence like silk and threat all at once. Her fingers brushed lightly across the small of Agatha’s back, so faint it could’ve been a breeze, but the shiver it left was electric.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me make you another drink,” she murmured, now behind her. Her lips brushed the curve of Agatha’s ear, her breath warm and laced with mint and liquor. “Or…” she said, dragging the syllable out like a promise, “you can keep pretending that glass in your hand is the only thing shaking.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand trembled. The glass wobbled. She set it down too hard, the sound sharp and brittle in the stillness between them.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t respond. She didn’t have to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled behind her, slow and self-assured, and when she moved again, her touch was no longer subtle. She pressed a hand against Agatha’s hip, her thumb anchoring into the bone just enough to claim. Then another touch, fingers gliding up her spine, dragging fire in their wake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head tilted back when Rio’s lips found her neck, just below the ear. A gasp tore from her lips before she could catch it. “Rio… baby, don't...” she breathed, warning or plea, it didn’t matter. It was already too late.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Her arms slid around Agatha’s thighs in one fluid movement, lifting her effortlessly. Agatha let out a surprised sound, half moan, half disbelief — as her body was settled onto the counter, cool marble kissing the back of her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>The heat between them was immediate. <em>Hungry</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s legs wrapped instinctively around Rio’s waist, her heels pressing into the small of her back. Her arms curled around Rio’s shoulders, her fingers tangled in her dark hair as she pulled her in, mouth crashing into hers.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss wasn’t gentle. It was molten. Teeth, tongue, breath shared like sin and air.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tasted of whiskey and mint and something wild, something not of this world. Agatha’s hips rolled forward on instinct, seeking friction, contact, something, anything, because<em> her skin was burning</em>, her body pulsing in places she hadn’t remembered feeling in years.</p><p>Her moan was swallowed into Rio’s mouth. Desperate. <em>Embarrassed</em> by how much she needed this. How badly her body betrayed her control.</p><p>She ground her hips against Rio’s stomach, greedy, frantic. The heat between her legs was maddening, soaked in want, in shame, in something that felt like surrender.</p><p> </p><p>God, it was wrong. It was so wrong.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em>Rio was Death</em>.</p><p> </p><p>But it didn’t feel wrong. It felt like gravity. Like <em>home</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio… please…” Agatha gasped, her voice broken against Rio’s mouth as her lips trailed along her jaw, then lower, until they found her neck.</p><p> </p><p>The plea was layered. Tension and permission. Yes and not yet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio heard it all. She always did.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth stilled against Agatha’s pulse, lips parted against her skin. Then slowly, she pulled back. Her hands cupped Agatha’s face gently, reverently, thumbs brushing against her flushed cheeks.Their foreheads met. Breath to breath. Heartbeat to heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was soft now, deep and warm, curling like smoke between them. “See, baby?” she whispered, her gaze locked on Agatha’s parted lips. “I already have you.”</p><p> </p><p>A pause. A cruel, tender smile.</p><p> </p><p>“I won.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, her body still aching, still trembling against Rio’s. And for a moment — just a moment — she stopped pretending it wasn’t true.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you did"</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha sat stiffly in the principal’s office, the edge of her seat digging into the back of her knees. Her hands gripped the armrests like anchors, her knuckles blanched from pressure, nails half-mooned into her palms. The room was too bright, sterile. The overhead light buzzed faintly, like it knew tension was thick enough to slice.</p><p>Next to her, Nicole sat coiled like a spring, arms locked across her chest, legs tucked under her chair as if daring anyone to look at her wrong. Her jaw was clenched, her foot tapping a silent rhythm that betrayed the storm beneath her silence.</p><p> </p><p>Principal Lively adjusted her glasses slowly, deliberately, as though the pause might defuse the room’s charge. “Mrs. Harkness, while we understand that children sometimes have disagreements… physical violence cannot be tolerated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled through her nose, steadying her pulse. “I understand,” she said, voice tight, formal.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could elaborate, the office door opened with a gust of cold air and something wilder. Rio entered like a storm cloud — heels clicking, coat open, dark hair swept back from her face with casual arrogance. Her eyes locked immediately on Nicole, scanning her with a mix of protectiveness and fire. She looked like she was ready to gut someone with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood so quickly her chair screeched. “<em>Rio</em>,” she hissed, eyes wide with alarm. “Not now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her. She always did when her blood was hot. She walked with a predator’s ease to the center of the room, her voice sharp and smooth. “Now is exactly the time.”</p><p> </p><p>Principal Lively blinked, visibly caught off guard. “And you are?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cocked her head slightly, lips curving in a way that could only be described as dangerous. “I’m her <em>mother</em>,” she said without hesitation, nodding toward Nicole. “Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>The principal’s eyes darted toward Agatha, brows drawn tight. “I’m sorry, what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned under her breath and rubbed her temples, the beginnings of a headache thrumming behind her eyes. “She’s not wrong,” she muttered through clenched teeth. “Rio Vidal donated the eggs for both of my children. She is their biological mother, in some way. But she is not here in any <em>official capacity</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flashed Agatha a look that said <em>yet</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Principal Lively blinked again, clearly unsure what to make of the dynamic now unfolding in her office. “I see,” she said slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just here for my daughter,” Rio added, voice softer now, though it still carried an undercurrent of steel. “And because she’s clearly not being protected properly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, stop,” Agatha snapped, her voice dropping lower in warning. “You’re not helping.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes slid back to Nicole, who hadn’t looked up once. “Nicole,” she said, gentler now. “What happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole still didn’t lift her gaze, her shoulders rigid. “I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then don’t,” Agatha cut in, stepping between them. “She doesn’t have to explain herself here.”</p><p> </p><p>“She deserves to be heard,” Rio countered, gaze unwavering, jaw tense. “Even if she’s angry. Especially if she’s angry.”</p><p> </p><p>"Dad..." Nicole’s fists trembled where they rested on her lap. Her voice, when it came, was quiet but raw. “She said you killed him.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped like a stone. “<em>What</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole’s head finally rose, and her eyes shimmered — not just with tears, but with rage, betrayal, and a confusion that made Agatha’s heart twist. “She said the police think you did it. That you killed Dad and lied. But you didn’t, right? He left us. I know he left.”</p><p> </p><p>The words slammed into Agatha like a blow to the chest. She stumbled backward a step, her mouth open, but nothing came out.</p><p>Rio was already moving.</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body stilled, then turned to steel. Her hands clenched at her sides, knuckles cracking. “Who said that to you?” she asked, voice like ice over fire.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned, trying to regain control of the spiraling conversation, but Rio didn’t even glance at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicole,” she said again, softer but firmer, crouching slightly so they were eye to eye. “Tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole sniffed and wiped at her nose with the sleeve of her hoodie. “Morgan Stark.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood straight. “Morgan Stark?” Her lips curled. “Give me five minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lunged forward, grabbing Rio’s wrist before she could make it to the door. “Don’t you dare.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned sharply, her pupils blown wide, voice razor-sharp. “That little brat humiliated my daughter. She made her cry. She made her doubt <em>you</em>. And I’m supposed to do nothing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes!” Agatha hissed. “You are supposed to not threaten a child, Rio! You’re supposed to be better than this. We are adults. She’s a kid.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t give a fuck about her age,” Rio growled. “Words like that don’t come from nowhere. Someone taught her to say it. And I’m going to find out who.”</p><p> </p><p>“And then what?” Agatha challenged. “You’re going to scare her into silence? You’re going to threaten her family? Because that’s not justice, Rio. That’s revenge. And that’s not what Nicole needs right now.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole had gone silent again, her eyes darting between them like she was watching a match lit too close to dry grass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breathing was heavy, her chest rising and falling, her fists still clenched. “You think I’m wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her voice quieter but firm. “I think you’re hurt. So am I. And I think you’re scaring her.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at Nicole — really looked — and something in her face cracked. She exhaled, shoulders sinking as the fury bled into exhaustion.</p><p> </p><p>“I just want her to feel safe,” she said, almost to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer and touched her arm, not as a command this time, but as an anchor. “Then let’s do that. Together. The right way.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak again. She simply nodded once, jaw tight, then turned back toward Nicole. Her hand reached out slowly, resting gently on Nicole’s shoulder.</p><p>The principal, clearly overwhelmed, held up her hands with a firm but tired grace, her fingers trembling just slightly as she adjusted the glasses perched at the tip of her nose.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s all take a moment to calm down. Mrs. Vidal, was it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, her voice clipped and tight, though it simmered with restrained fury just beneath the surface.</p><p> </p><p>The principal offered a strained smile, trying to restore authority. “Mrs. Vidal, please take a seat so we can address this appropriately. We can contact the Starks and arrange a meeting to discuss these allegations.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved slowly to the chair, every motion deliberate, a storm barely leashed beneath the surface. She sat down with an air of reluctant compliance, her spine rigid, one leg crossed tightly over the other as her knuckles whitened where they gripped the armrest.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she said, each syllable cool and sharpened like glass. “But let me be clear — no one spreads lies about my daughter’s family. No one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, stop,” Agatha said softly, her voice trembling with exasperation and something else — fear, maybe, or the overwhelming need to maintain composure before it shattered entirely. Her eyes briefly met Rio’s, pleading in a language they had never agreed upon but both understood instinctively.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak again. Her jaw tensed, her lips pressing into a thin line, but she leaned back in her seat with a quiet, tight nod.</p><p> </p><p>The principal cleared her throat, reclaiming the silence with effort. “Mrs. Harkness, Mrs. Vidal, we will handle this matter professionally. Nicole, I trust you understand that violence is not the answer, no matter what’s said?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole, still curled in on herself like a blade drawn too tight, nodded without raising her eyes. Her voice had dried up entirely, replaced by the cold press of shame and the heat of still-bubbling fury. Her nails dug crescent moons into her sleeves.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” the principal said, standing with finality. “I’ll reach out to the Starks and we’ll resolve this matter together. In the meantime, I expect Nicole to avoid further contact with Morgan until a meeting has taken place.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood slowly, her movements precise, her breaths long and even like she was counting each one to keep from unraveling. Nicole followed without a word, and Rio stood last, her heels clicking with sharp finality against the polished tile.</p><p>Once outside the office, away from the polished politeness and tightly wound tension of administration, Agatha rounded on Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was low, but furious. “You cannot keep barging in and making things worse.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t flinch. If anything, her brow arched in amusement. “Worse? I just defended you and our daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>“You escalated it,” Agatha spat, her voice catching in her throat, her face flushed — not with embarrassment, but with the heat of helplessness. “You always escalate.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk shifted into something softer, subtler — no less dangerous, but laced with a tenderness that only infuriated Agatha more. Her gaze flicked to Nicole walking ahead of them, her small shoulders square with anger she hadn’t been taught to carry.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t escalate anything,” Rio said smoothly. “I protected my family.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped walking, planting her heels against the polished hallway floor. “Stop saying that.” Her voice was hushed but sharp enough to cut. “Stop saying things like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like what?” Rio asked, her voice low, all velvet and edges. “The truth?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, something unreadable in her eyes — wounded, shaken, pulled in too many directions. Her lips parted, then closed again as if any word she tried would be the wrong one. The moment stretched.</p><p>And then Nicole turned to glance back at them, her expression unreadable, watching them both like she was waiting to see who would blink first.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, not closing the space between them, just brushing the edge of Agatha’s personal gravity. Her voice was quiet now, barely above a whisper. “Let’s just go home. We’ll deal with this together.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a second longer before her shoulders slumped. The air left her lungs in a slow, weary exhale.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she muttered. “But no more drama, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin was small, almost tender — too knowing. Her eyes gleamed with something that looked like a promise and a warning.</p><p> </p><p>“No promises, Professor.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, pressing two fingers to her temple as she turned toward the door. Behind her, Rio fell into step, her presence like a second shadow — laced in fire, cloaked in chaos, and far too close to Agatha’s heart for her to admit out loud.</p><hr/><p>Nicole sat in the car with her arms crossed, her brows drawn together in a permanent scowl, the weight of exclusion pressing hard against her chest. Through the tinted window, she tracked every step her mothers took up the Starks’ pristine driveway. Rio’s posture was relaxed, almost feline, all fluid grace and coiled restraint. Agatha, in contrast, was rigid with tension, her heels striking the pavement with purposeful, clipped clicks.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know why they won’t let me be there,” Nicole muttered, her nails tapping irritably against the car door.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably because they know you’d make it worse,” Nick answered from the backseat, not even glancing up from his tablet. His fingers moved rapidly across the screen, the game’s sound muted but its glow illuminating his young face.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole twisted in her seat to glare at him. “She deserved it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Nick mumbled, clearly more invested in leveling up than in sibling drama.</p><p> </p><p>Up the path, Agatha inhaled sharply as her finger hovered over the doorbell.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” she said, her voice tight and low. “Let me do the talking. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a slow, indulgent smile, her hands tucked neatly behind her back. "Of course, darling. I’ll be as silent as your conscience." Agatha didn’t bother hiding her eye roll.</p><p> </p><p>The door opened before she could reply, revealing Pepper Stark in a crisp cream blouse and tailored slacks. Her gaze was cool, precise. Her smile, if it could be called that, didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Harkness,” she said, each syllable clipped. Her eyes shifted to Rio. “And...?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Rio purred smoothly, stepping forward, hand extended in mock politeness. "A pleasure."</p><p> </p><p>Pepper didn’t take it. Her gaze returned to Agatha like Rio hadn’t spoken at all. “I assume this is about Morgan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha answered, voice level but tight. “May we come in to discuss it?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a heartbeat of pause before Pepper stepped aside, allowing them into a living room so spotless it felt untouched by life. The scent of polished wood and subtle citrus cleaner hung in the air. Everything — from the pristine cushions to the gleaming surfaces — screamed order, control, and curated appearances.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, have a seat,” Pepper said, gesturing to the white couch with all the warmth of a museum tour guide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered herself carefully, smoothing her skirt as she sat. Rio remained standing, pacing slowly around the room like a cat let loose in someone else’s territory. Her eyes moved from photo to photo, her lip curling slightly at the sight of Morgan’s framed cheerleading portrait.</p><p> </p><p>“I understand Nicole had an altercation with your daughter,” Agatha began, tone measured. “She told us some things were said that were... troubling.”</p><p> </p><p>Pepper raised one elegant brow, arms folded. “Troubling? Your daughter struck mine. That’s more than troubling — it’s aggressive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled slightly on her lap. “She reacted because Morgan said something deeply inappropriate.”</p><p> </p><p>“About Agatha,” Rio interjected, her voice suddenly like velvet over steel.</p><p> </p><p>Pepper’s mouth twitched. “And what, exactly, does that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but Rio beat her to it.</p><p> </p><p>“It means your daughter accused Agatha of killing her husband,” she said, voice calm but with a venomous edge. “A baseless, revolting thing to say, especially considering the source.”</p><p> </p><p>Pepper stiffened visibly, her mask faltering. “I—I don’t know where she would’ve heard that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a slow blink. “Don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha snapped under her breath, reaching to still her with a hand.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio stepped forward, her gaze fixed. “Let’s not pretend kids make up things like that without help. So tell me, Pepper, what exactly have you been whispering about my family?”</p><p> </p><p>Pepper’s cheeks flushed. “I beg your pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“You heard me,” Rio said, folding her arms. “Rumors like that don’t just appear. So unless Morgan’s been reading police reports on her own, someone planted that thought.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. <em>Enough</em>,” Agatha said firmly, rising to her feet and placing a restraining hand on Rio’s arm. Her grip was tight. “We are here to resolve this, not start a war in someone’s marble foyer.”</p><p> </p><p>The air between them vibrated with tension. Pepper looked between the two of them — Agatha, visibly trying to keep the situation from boiling over, and Rio, who exuded unshakable menace beneath the calm of her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Stark straightened, her composure beginning to crack beneath Rio’s unrelenting stare. Her polished exterior — perfectly tailored blouse, flawless hair, that poised smile — strained at the edges. "I assure you, I’ve said no such thing," she insisted, though her voice carried the tiniest tremor. "If Morgan said that, it’s because she misunderstood something."</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head slowly, her expression sharp, amused in that dangerous way she had. Like a lion entertaining the idea of play but always two seconds from a bite. "Misunderstood, huh? How convenient."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped in then, sliding between them like a barrier made of tense muscle and restraint. The heat radiating off Rio made her skin prickle. "Mrs. Stark," Agatha said, tight-lipped but polite, her voice coated in ice. "Whatever the source of this misunderstanding, it’s caused a lot of hurt. I think it would be best if you had a conversation with Morgan about the importance of being mindful of what she says."</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Stark’s jaw twitched. She nodded curtly, clearly itching to usher them out of her pristine home. "Of course. I’ll speak with her."</p><p> </p><p>"Good," Agatha replied, her words clipped as she stepped toward the door, signaling the end of the conversation. "And I hope we can put this behind us."</p><p> </p><p>The sun was low on the horizon as they walked back to the car, staining the driveway gold. Agatha’s heels tapped briskly on the pavement, but Rio’s footfalls were silent, predatory. She stayed quiet, but her energy buzzed — dark, unreadable, like a coiled storm held barely in check.</p><p>Agatha could feel the burn of her gaze without even turning. Her own jaw ached from clenching it too tightly.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the car, the air was thick with unspoken tension. Nicole leaned forward between the seats, her voice quick and sharp. "Well?"</p><p> </p><p>"Handled," Agatha muttered, jamming the key into the ignition. Her fingers trembled slightly as she gripped the wheel. "Barely. And if you ever, <em>EVER</em>, interrupt me like that again, I'll—"</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a low chuckle from the passenger seat, all sin and silk. "I'll take the punishment happily, like the good girl I am."</p><p> </p><p>The words dropped like a spark into kindling. Agatha’s breath caught, her knuckles whitening on the wheel. She turned her head slowly, narrowing her eyes. "You think this is funny?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in just enough for her breath to ghost along Agatha’s neck, her voice a low purr. "No. I think you trying to control me is funny. You know you love it when I <em>misbehave</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole groaned in the backseat. "Oh my God, can you two not flirt while I'm trapped back here like a hostage?" Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, biting back the urge to throttle both of them. </p><hr/><p>Agatha sat on the couch with Nicole nestled close, her arm around the girl's slender shoulders, thumb tracing slow, soothing circles over the fabric of her shirt. Her voice was calm, measured, like a spell laced with comfort, pulling the anxiety out of the air one word at a time. Nicole didn’t speak much, just nodded, her eyes still a little too wide, too glossy. The tension of the day clung to her like a second skin.</p><p>Across the room, Rio moved like a storm barely held together — her boots hitting the hardwood with impatient, clipped steps. Her hands curled and uncurled at her sides, and the sharp line of her jaw flexed every time her mouth tightened. Her eyes, dark as obsidian and twice as sharp, flicked across the room like she was searching for something to break.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio, can you stop for a second?" Agatha asked, her voice holding both exhaustion and edge as she looked over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze mid-stride, then turned toward her with fire sparking behind her lashes. "No, I can’t," she snapped, tone laced with a simmering fury that made the room feel warmer. Her hands gestured sharply, slicing the air. "That Stark woman is infuriating. And her kid — Morgan — entitled, cruel, and clearly learning it at home. I should’ve done more."</p><p> </p><p>"You’ve done enough," Agatha replied, voice low but unwavering. There was no venom in her tone, only weariness. The kind that settles into your bones. "Let me handle the rest."</p><p> </p><p>Rio barked out a dry, humorless laugh, pacing again. "Handle it? Right. That’s what Ralph used to say, wasn’t it? '<em>Let me handle it</em>.' And what did he ever handle, Agatha? Nothing but his ego. Nothing but silence and lies."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, her hand instinctively tightening on Nicole’s shoulder for a heartbeat before she consciously loosened her grip. Her lips thinned. She didn’t respond. Didn’t take the bait.</p><p> </p><p>"Nicky," she said softly, turning to her daughter, brushing a few strands of hair back from her face. "Why don’t you go upstairs, sweetheart? Run a bath. Light one of the lavender candles, the one you like. I’ll come up soon."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole hesitated, her gaze moving warily from her mother to Rio. Her voice was small but firm. "You sure you’ll be okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, offering her a gentle smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. "I promise. Go on."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole pushed herself up from the couch, still tense, and started toward the stairs. She paused, glanced back over her shoulder at Rio — whose entire posture screamed agitation — then disappeared up the steps. The quiet thump of her bedroom door echoed faintly in the silence that followed.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, rising slowly, smoothing her skirt down as if to shake off the lingering static of the moment. She turned to face Rio fully. The way Rio looked at her — like she was starving, like she was tethered to Agatha by something invisible and unyielding — made Agatha’s pulse stutter.</p><p>Some small flowers sprouted and died immediately where Rio stepped. As if the traces of her anger left behind a trail of uncontrolled power.</p><p> </p><p>"You're spiraling," she said, voice tight. "You need to calm down."</p><p> </p><p>"I am calm," Rio snapped, then immediately dragged a hand through her hair in frustration. The flowers that were in the room all rose with a little more life. It took a lot out of Agatha to simply not laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Her body said otherwise, too — chest heaving subtly, jaw tight, shoulders set with that almost predatory tension she wore when she was seconds from doing something reckless. </p><p> </p><p>"You scared Pepper Stark," Agatha continued, stepping in close, lowering her voice but not her strength. "You nearly lit her house on fire with your glare. You don’t get to bulldoze people just because you feel righteous. And you're filling my living room with flowers like it's the Amazon rainforest."</p><p> </p><p>"I protected our daughter," Rio hissed, eyes flashing. Her voice dropped, silk over steel. "And I would do it again."</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved her hands impatiently and the flowers disappeared and the plants in the room took on their natural shape.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood firm, breathing in slowly, letting it fill her lungs, force her to think. "You don’t get to walk into my life, claim territory like you’re entitled to it, and drag fire in your wake."</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, invading her space, the air between them crackling. Her voice dipped into something dark, something possessive. "I don’t need to claim what’s already <em>mine</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She hated the way her body reacted — heat coiling low, a traitorous ache curling in her belly. Her fingers twitched at her sides.</p><p> </p><p>"You don’t own me," she said, though her voice faltered at the end.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her breath ghost across her jaw. Her next words were barely a whisper. "<em>Don’t I,</em> though?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but the words never came. The room buzzed with tension. And beneath the fury, beneath the exhaustion and unspoken history, was the pull — gravity between stars destined to crash or burn.</p><p> </p><p>"Come with me," Agatha said, her voice low but commanding, each syllable carrying the weight of something unspoken.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped mid-step at the edge of the hallway, brow arching, lips parting into a lazy smirk. "Why? You’re not planning to lecture me again, are you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Just follow me," Agatha replied, already turning on her heel, the click of her boots muffled on the carpeted hallway as she made her way toward her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>The air between them was thick with tension, but not the kind that demanded distance — no, this was heat. Something coiled, tight and waiting to snap. Rio’s curiosity piqued, and she followed, her gait slow and fluid, feline in its grace.</p><p>They stepped into Agatha’s room, the door closing behind them with a muted thud. The soft scent of lavender clung to the sheets, mingling with something uniquely Agatha — warm spice, aged books, and something sharp like ozone. The dim golden light from the bedside lamp bathed the room in a soft, sensual glow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned her shoulder against the closed door, arms crossed, her tone mocking but her eyes sharply alert. "So," she drawled, voice low and velvety, "what’s the plan? You going to tell me how much of a burden I am again? How I’ve ruined your life?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t speak. She crossed the room slowly, the soft rustle of fabric brushing between them as she stopped in front of Rio.</p><p>Then, without a single warning, she reached out and grabbed Rio by the lapels of her coat, pulling her forward with purpose. Her mouth crashed against Rio’s, fierce and hot. It wasn’t soft or uncertain, Agatha kissed like someone claiming territory she was tired of pretending didn’t belong to her.</p><p>Rio stilled for a moment, startled. Her body tensed before she melted into it, hands finally rising to rest on Agatha’s hips, fingers digging just enough to make it felt. When Agatha pulled back, breath ragged and lips flushed, Rio stared at her, speechless, pupils blown wide, her smugness utterly erased for the first time in what felt like forever.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Rio whispered, a rare flicker of vulnerability threading her voice. "What... what was that?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slid from Rio’s chest but didn’t retreat. They settled at her collarbones instead, fingers still curled slightly. "That was me realizing something," she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, trying to ground herself. "Realizing what?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked her lips, her voice hoarse and honest. "That was hot. You defending us. Defending me. Ralph never did that. Not once. He never made me feel like someone was in my corner."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk returned slowly, but it was different this time — less arrogant, more predatory. "Ralph," she said, the name like a curse on her tongue, "doesn’t mean anything to you. Or to this family. And you know it."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, jaw tight, emotion simmering behind her eyes. "I know. And that’s what makes this so... confusing."</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, her hands now brushing up Agatha’s arms in slow, deliberate motions. Her voice dropped into that husky register that always made Agatha’s knees weaken. "It’s not confusing, Agatha. You’re just scared. You’re not used to wanting something this badly and having it want you back."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. The words landed like fire on bare skin. She looked away, but Rio’s fingers tilted her chin gently back.</p><p> </p><p>"I hate that you’re always right," Agatha muttered, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, her mouth ghosting near Agatha’s ear, lips brushing just close enough to feel heat but not touch. "I’ll take that as a compliment, baby."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivered, her hands unconsciously gripping Rio’s arms tighter. Her body was betraying her mouth again — leaning in when she meant to push away. Rio didn’t move to deepen the moment further. She just held her there, close, steady. Waiting. A predator who knew she didn’t have to chase anymore.</p><p> </p><p><em>She’d already been chosen</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved with shallow, uneven breaths, her pulse hammering against her throat like a war drum. Her fingers twitched at her sides as she stared into Rio’s dark, patient eyes — eyes that shimmered like obsidian, calm on the surface but betraying a coiled hunger just beneath. There was no teasing grin now, no clever remark waiting on her tongue. Just silence. Tension. An invitation.</p><p>The air between them was thick with heat, alive with everything they hadn’t said. And Agatha hated it — how much she felt it. How much Rio made her feel, damn her. She clenched her jaw, nails digging into her palms, fury and want tangled too tightly to tell apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn you,” she growled under her breath, her voice hoarse. And then she moved.</p><p> </p><p>In one breathless moment, she closed the space between them, grabbed the front of Rio’s shirt with both hands, and yanked her forward. The kiss landed hard — desperate, greedy, tasting of frustration and fire. No prelude, no hesitation. Just lips on lips, teeth grazing, heat meeting heat.</p><p> </p><p><em>A little pain... So little, so uncomfortable</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“It feels wrong,” Agatha heard her own voice in her mind. But it wasn’t her — not the her of now. Her voice was young. Innocent. Afraid. Warm. Hopeful.</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled sharply against her mouth, startled — but it melted away in an instant. She groaned low in her throat, hands flying to Agatha’s waist, fingers tightening as if she meant to hold her there forever. Her body curved into Agatha’s like it belonged there, like it had always belonged there. Agatha ignored the voice, the pain, the flashes, the past that she didn't remember.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Is it bad</em>?" Rio asked... Not this Rio — the one in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss deepened, messy and hungry, Rio’s mouth parting willingly beneath Agatha’s. Agatha moaned softly when Rio’s tongue brushed hers, the sound embarrassingly raw, too honest. She didn’t care. She couldn’t care. </p><p>Her head hurt. <em>It hurt so much</em>. Her eyes were filling with tears, but she didn’t stop, she didn’t break the kiss. Not when Rio was responding with that perfect blend of control and reverence, like she was taking her apart cell by cell and savoring every second of it.</p><p>Agatha pressed closer, crushing their bodies together, her thigh slotted between Rio’s legs, her fingers fisting the collar of Rio’s shirt like she needed it to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>"<em>No... it’s not bad... You’re not bad, Rio</em>." The flash of her — <em>young, fifteen, dressed in a white dress, old, a little stained with mud, forest, the sound of running water</em> — appeared in her head. </p><p> </p><p>Her senses were drowning in her — Rio’s scent (earthy, electric, pine and leather), her heat, the way she tasted (like red wine and rebellion). Her hands burned where they touched. Her whole body trembled with the effort not to fall too far.</p><p>Rio’s hands slid upward slowly, possessively, until they cupped Agatha’s jaw with aching tenderness. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I am Death, Agatha."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her thumbs brushed along Agatha’s cheeks, soft and reverent in contrast to the fire in the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Then why do I feel so alive beside you?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>When they finally broke apart, gasping, their foreheads pressed together, lips red and swollen, Rio let out a low breathless chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>“That,” she murmured, her voice rasping like velvet over stone, “was unexpected.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes were dazed, her lashes fluttering, a single tear insisting on appearing. Her fingers were still twisted in Rio’s shirt, trembling slightly. “Don’t act like you didn’t want it,” she whispered, her voice unsteady but defiant.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled slowly, darkly. Her voice dropped to a purr. “Oh, I wanted it, mi amor. I’ve wanted that for centuries.”</p><p> </p><p>That word — <em>mine</em> — sent a tremor straight down Agatha’s spine. Her stomach twisted, not from shame, but from the terrifying truth of it. Because she had wanted it. And she hated how much she wanted it again.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“I am Death, Agatha.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Still, she pulled back slightly, trying to collect herself, to build up some sort of barrier again. Her fingers smoothed Rio’s shirt almost absentmindedly, brushing the place where her lips had just been. “This doesn’t mean anything,” she said flatly. Or tried to.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“It feels wrong.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in again, brushing her lips just shy of Agatha’s ear, her breath warm against skin too sensitive. Her voice was a sinful whisper, dangerous and teasing. “You say that, Professor,” — and Agatha shivered, damn her, damn that title — “but you’re still holding onto me like you’re afraid I’ll vanish.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands jerked back like she’d been burned. She turned sharply, pacing a few steps toward the door, needing space, needing oxygen that didn’t smell like Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make this a thing,” she snapped over her shoulder, but her voice cracked.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio leaned back against the wooden beam like a queen on her throne, arms crossed lazily, eyes devouring. “Oh, my love,” she drawled, her voice like liquid smoke, “That's what you said the first, the second, the third time... And counting..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, groaning softly, dragging a hand through her hair. Her skin still tingled where Rio had touched her. Her lips ached. Her heart wouldn’t calm down.</p><p>She didn’t know what this was. She didn’t know what to do with it. But she knew one thing: she wasn’t ready to let go.</p><p> </p><p>Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Then why do I feel so alive beside you</em>?”</p><hr/><p>The television flickered dimly in the room, casting cold flashes of artificial light over the tense silence. The news anchor’s solemn voice crawled into every corner of the house like smoke, the words “Ralph O’Connor: Missing Seven Months” burning into the bottom of the screen like an accusation. Agatha sat upright, her spine rigid as steel, her fingers white-knuckled around the glass in her hand. Each breath she took felt like swallowing glass — sharp, acidic, punishing.</p><p>Her eyes were locked on the screen, but they didn’t really see the footage — blurry security cam stills, reporters outside a courthouse, an old photo of Ralph smiling tightly beside her. It all felt like someone else’s life, someone else’s mess.</p><p>Nick and Nicole sat flanking the couch like silent witnesses. They weren’t speaking, but their bodies were coiled in the kind of tension only children pick up on — the unspoken weight hanging in the air, pressing into their small chests, making everything feel a little colder than it should.</p><p>Rio moved with the quiet certainty of someone who was never unsure of herself. She didn’t ask — she didn’t need to. She stepped forward, slipped between the children, and sat down, pulling both of them into the curve of her arms like she’d done it every day of their lives. Her fingertips combed gently through Nick’s curls, then over Nicole’s sleek ponytail, the touch as intimate as it was grounding.</p><p> </p><p>But her eyes never left Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was low, coaxing, intimate. “Sit down, my love,” she murmured, like she was trying to reel Agatha back from a ledge only she could see. Her thumb traced soothing circles on Nick’s shoulder as she added, “Nick, change the channel, would you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She was a portrait of control barely holding together at the seams. “This isn’t right,” she whispered, the words rasping out as if they hurt to speak. Her throat bobbed with the effort of keeping her composure. “He’s out there. Lost or... or dead.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was soft, but it carried like a whisper cutting through glass. “Not dead,” she said under her breath, the corners of her mouth twitching into a wry smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Nick giggled, the sound small but piercing in the thick quiet. “Mama Rio’s funny,” he said, nudging Nicole, who gave a reluctant, shy smile in response.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped her head toward Rio, her expression cracking open. “Rio!” she hissed, her voice sharp and raw. “This isn’t a joke.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio held up her hands in exaggerated surrender, her eyes glinting with something unreadable — half amusement, half caution. “What? I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry?” Agatha echoed, her voice pitching higher, trembling. “I’m sitting here choking on guilt, wondering if I should’ve done more, called more, been more — wondering if he’s suffering somewhere — and I... I—” Her voice broke. She bit her bottom lip hard, trying to swallow down what came next.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finished the sentence for her, her voice low and loaded. “And you kissed me.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed between them like a slap, intimate and explosive. The room seemed to tilt.</p><p>Agatha froze. Her hand trembled as she set her glass down with a shaky clink on the table. Her lips parted, but nothing came out. She looked like she’d just realized the floor beneath her was made of glass, and it had started to crack.</p><p> </p><p>“I kissed the personification of death,” she said finally, her voice bitter and broken. “While my husband is—”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Not dead</em>,” Rio said again, cutting her off. This time, her tone was different — firmer, with an edge of something darker underneath. “And I’d know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her then, really looked at her. The shadow in Rio’s eyes was real, ancient, but so was the fire. She looked impossibly calm — unbothered, but not unfeeling. The kind of calm that came with knowing too much and saying too little.</p><p> </p><p>“And I’m just supposed to take your word for it?” Agatha asked, her voice cracking, her arms crossed protectively over her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.” Rio’s answer was instant. Steady. Certain. “Because <em>I’m the one who would know</em> if he were gone. And he’s not. Not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed was taut, drawn like a bowstring. The only sound was the quiet rustle of Nick’s hand against his blanket, the low hum of the TV now turned to a nature documentary — distant and irrelevant.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Nick’s small voice broke through the tension. “You’re funny, Mama,” he said again, his tone sweet and oblivious, curling closer to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, soft and real this time, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. “I try, champ.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the scene — Rio cradling her son like she belonged there, like she had always belonged. The weight of it hit her chest with something like grief, or maybe longing. She wanted to be angry. She should have been angry. But all she could feel was this aching warmth curling behind her ribs, fragile and infuriating.</p><p> </p><p>She rubbed her forehead, muttering, “You’re going to ruin everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look at her. Just kept stroking Nick’s hair with that maddening gentleness. “Or maybe,” she said quietly, “I’ll finally make it mean something.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Couldn’t. The words stuck somewhere in her throat, tangled in the tangle of guilt, desire, and something that felt a lot like fear.</p><p> </p><p>And still — still — she didn’t look away.</p><p> </p><p>“I need some air,” Agatha said abruptly, standing and heading for the back door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t follow immediately. She stayed with the children, her hands still resting on their heads as she watched Agatha disappear into the night.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay, Mama?” Nick asked, looking up at her with wide, trusting eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her gaze softening. “I’m fine, champ. But your mom... she’s got a lot on her mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll make her better,” Nicky said matter-of-factly, her voice carrying a surprising amount of confidence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, though there was a hint of sadness in her tone. “I’ll try, kiddo. I’ll try.”</p><p> </p><p>She stayed with them a moment longer, ensuring they were at ease, before excusing herself to find Agatha. Whatever storm was raging inside her, Rio wasn’t about to let her weather it alone.</p><hr/><p>The din of the cafeteria felt like a dull roar in Agatha’s ears, the clatter of trays and clinking of cutlery serving as background noise to her slow, calculated chewing. She sat stiffly at the table, spine straight, eyes locked on her plate like it held the answers to every possible escape route.</p><p> </p><p>But nothing could save her from what was coming.</p><p> </p><p>Rio returned from the food line like she owned the entire damn building — hips swaying, chin lifted, her tray balanced easily in one hand. Her dark hair was pulled back in a loose, elegant twist, and the slinky black blouse she wore did nothing to minimize the way half the cafeteria turned to look. Including Alice.</p><p> </p><p>“God! Your intern is a whole delici—” Alice began, her voice a low purr, eyes tracking Rio’s every step like a cat sizing up a meal.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Alice</em>!” Agatha snapped, her voice sharp as broken glass, low but slicing. Her cheeks flushed crimson, and she refused to look up from her chicken and rice like it might swallow her instead.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t falter. She slid into the seat beside Agatha like she belonged there — which she absolutely didn’t — and set her tray down with maddening poise. Her scent hit first: something earthy and magnetic, like warm amber, wet stone, and trouble.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, her arm brushing deliberately against Agatha’s as she whispered, “Don’t stifle her creativity, <em>darling</em>. Let her express herself.” Her voice was all silk and teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward her, eyes narrow slits. “I will end you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s only response was a slow, knowing smile.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda, ever the instigator, lifted her fork and gestured lazily. “Why does she call you pet names? Did I miss the wedding?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she’s annoying,” Agatha muttered, stabbing at her rice like it had insulted her personally. She still hadn’t made eye contact with anyone, least of all Rio, whose presence was a furnace against her side. “That's why.”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio wasn’t done. She leaned back, arm draping over the back of Agatha’s chair, fingers brushing the fabric of her jacket. Her voice dropped — low, confident, utterly unbothered. “<em>I’m in love with Agatha</em>. Have been since the first day I saw her teaching.”</p><p> </p><p>The table fell silent. Agatha choked. A bit of chicken flew from her lips and hit her plate with a wet plop.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at Rio like she’d just announced she was the Queen of England. “<em>What</em>?!” Her voice cracked with disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her, eyes dark and steady, lips curved in that same maddening smirk. “What?” she repeated, all faux innocence. “You know I don’t lie. It’s not allowed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, then closed again. Her face was blazing with heat, and her brain was tripping over itself, refusing to string together any sentence that didn’t end with her screaming.</p><p> </p><p>She groaned and pinched the bridge of her nose, her voice a strangled hiss. “Okay! Just... just eat your food, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio plucked a piece of arugula from her salad with dainty fingers and smiled. “Anything for you, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned across the table, resting her chin on her hand, eyes gleaming like a woman who’d just found her new favorite soap opera. “Hold on. Are you sleeping with my best friend?”</p><p> </p><p>“WANDA,” Agatha snarled, whirling to face her, eyes blazing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t blink. “Not yet,” she said easily, popping the arugula in her mouth and chewing slowly. “But <em>I’m trying. Very hard.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Jen, who’d been sipping her coffee with forced detachment, immediately sputtered, nearly choking. She grabbed her napkin, coughing into it while Alice burst out laughing so hard she had to clutch the edge of the table for balance.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you!” Agatha slammed her napkin down, her voice nearing a growl. “You’re all unbearable.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned in with a wicked grin. “So, you’re not denying it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at her, her lips trembling with the effort not to explode. “There’s nothing to deny. And for the love of everything, can we drop this topic?”</p><p> </p><p>The room buzzed with background noise — cutlery scraping against plastic trays, the soft hum of conversations layered over each other — but at their table, time felt narrowed down to one simmering point of focus. Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s touch was featherlight, barely there, but it lit up Agatha’s nerves like a fuse. Her fingers slipped beneath the stiff collar of Agatha’s blouse, slow and deliberate, grazing the sensitive skin at the nape of her neck. It was a ghost of a touch, but it made Agatha’s entire body tense. A spark of heat shot down her spine, blooming beneath her skin in a way that was both infuriating and dizzying.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re blushing, Professor,” Rio murmured into her ear, the word Professor rolling off her tongue with a familiar teasing reverence that curled under Agatha’s skin. Her voice was smoke and silk, designed to unravel. “Should I take that as a yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked back just slightly, jaw tightening as she hissed, “Fuck off!” The curse fell from her lips sharp and breathless, more defense than denial.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Instead, she took another measured bite of her food, her lips curving around the fork like a slow promise. The sharp edge of her smirk dulled into something softer — still dangerous, but touched with fondness. “You know they’re just jealous, darling,” she said, her tone lazy, her eyes half-lidded as she looked Agatha over like something decadent. “I mean, look at you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging her hands down her face and letting her elbows clatter loudly on the table. “I hate all of you. I hate you, Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t,” Rio said easily, confidence oozing from every syllable as if it were gospel. “You just want to.”</p><p> </p><p>Another glare. Another skip in Agatha’s pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Jen, having finally recovered from her earlier coughing fit, raised her coffee cup in Rio’s direction like it was a weapon. “You’re trouble, aren’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her own glass of water, the gesture elegant and laced with irony. “The best kind.”</p><p> </p><p>The table burst into laughter — Alice practically wheezing beside Wanda, who had tears of amusement in her eyes, and Jen shaking her head as she sipped her drink. The tension in the air dissolved, the group sliding easily back into their rhythm, though with an added charge — like someone had flipped the current on.</p><p>Agatha muttered something incoherent under her breath, her face hidden in her hands, but a tiny smile tugged traitorously at the corners of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio saw it. She always did. And she leaned in once more, voice a hush meant for Agatha’s ears alone. “You can keep pretending, my love,” she whispered, her fingers lightly tracing the curve of Agatha’s spine beneath the table. “But your body always tells the truth.” Agatha didn’t look at her. Didn’t respond, but she didn’t move away either.</p><p> </p><p>The air around the lunch table shimmered with tension barely masked by the forced clatter of cutlery and the occasional dry laugh. Agatha sat rigid, her jaw tight, stabbing at the wilted greens on her plate like they’d insulted her. Every inch of her posture screamed restraint — shoulders tight, lips thin, eyes flickering toward Rio with murderous restraint. The fork in her hand trembled once, betraying the weight of her composure.</p><p>Across from her, Rio lounged like she owned the table — and perhaps Agatha too, in spirit if not in fact. Her long fingers toyed with the rim of her glass, idle, predatory. The smug tilt of her smirk hadn’t moved since she sat down, like it was stitched into her very bones. Every so often, she’d glance sidelong at Agatha — not to speak, not to push, but simply to look. Watch. Wait. Daring her to crack.</p><p>Wanda, arms folded and coffee in hand, studied the pair with the precision of someone used to sniffing out secrets. Her brow furrowed as she slowly stirred her drink, the silence stretching around the table like a slow-building spell. Then she spoke, voice laced with suspicion.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” she mused aloud, eyes never leaving Agatha, “I’ve known Aggie for years. And I’ve never seen her let someone get away with this much... nonsense.”</p><p> </p><p>The fork slipped from Agatha’s hand and hit the plate with a sharp clink. Her eyes snapped to Wanda like flint to steel. “Wanda, I swear—”</p><p> </p><p>“No, no,” Wanda said, waving a dismissive hand, “I mean it. You don’t just let people call you darling. Or touch you. Or breathe within five feet of you without vaporizing them with a look. And now she’s dropping the ‘I’m in love with Agatha’ thing?” She leaned forward. “It’s weird, Aggie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call me Aggie,” Agatha snapped, her cheeks blooming red like fire pressed under porcelain. Her voice was low, taut, and ready to shatter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised one elegant hand, as if asking for the stage. “If I may,” she purred, her voice drenched in amusement, “it’s not weird. It’s destiny.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen, leaning on her elbow, arched a skeptical brow. “Destiny,” she repeated flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely,” Rio said without hesitation. She leaned forward like a lover reciting a vow, her eyes locked on Agatha’s. “How else would you explain this magnetic pull between us? A love that transcends time and logic and reason—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed her palm down on the table with a loud bang, her breath catching like fire in her lungs. “Oh my God, stop talking! Too much, Rio, too much!”</p><p> </p><p>Alice spat her drink back into her cup, coughing through a burst of laughter. Wanda chuckled into her hand, and even Jen cracked a crooked smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could barely look at any of them. Her skin was hot, her chest tight, and her whole body pulsing with a blend of embarrassment and something that felt suspiciously like desire. She grabbed her tray with jerky motions and stood, her chair scraping loudly against the floor. “I’m going back to my office.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood too, fluid and graceful, her movements a complete contrast to Agatha’s storm. “Need company?” she asked, voice silken with just the right amount of insolence.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha barked over her shoulder, not slowing down.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s cute. You think I was asking.” Rio’s grin spread, lazy and indulgent, as she followed like a shadow too confident to hide.</p><p> </p><p>Behind them, laughter rang out again, louder this time — Alice howling, Wanda wiping tears from her eyes. But Agatha didn’t turn back. Her heels clicked hard against the floor, Rio’s steps echoing lightly behind her, perfectly in rhythm.</p><p>And though Agatha didn’t speak again until they were down the hall, her flushed cheeks and clenched fists betrayed her. So did the small, involuntary glance over her shoulder. And Rio saw it. Every flicker, every flick of longing buried beneath fury. She always did.</p><hr/><p>The office door clicked shut behind Rio with a gentle finality, sealing them off from the chaotic noise of the cafeteria. The moment felt heavier than it should have, weighed down by silence, by tension so thick it clung to the walls like heat after a storm.</p><p>Agatha dropped her tray on the desk with a loud thud, the metal rattling as if echoing her frustration. She turned sharply, her brows drawn in a glare already forming on her face — but it faltered the moment she caught Rio’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t smirking this time. <em>Not at first</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She stood against the doorframe with one hand casually braced above her head, her body language relaxed but eyes... intense. Dark and unreadable, they traced over Agatha like a slow tide, savoring the stillness between them. Her mouth curved just slightly — an expression that held amusement, yes, but also something far more dangerous. Hungry. Focused. Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” she snapped, folding her arms tightly across her chest like armor. Her voice was firm, but her heartbeat betrayed her, thudding erratically behind her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes dipped, deliberately slow, from Agatha’s eyes to her lips, then lower. She shrugged with a casual grace that somehow felt like it had teeth. “Nothing,” she said, her voice velvet-lined. “You’re just... fun to watch when you’re all fired up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes hard enough to anchor herself back in reality. “Well, stop watching. Don’t you have something better to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” Rio said, her voice a little softer now, and she took a single step forward. “Unless you’re suggesting I find something else to focus on.”</p><p> </p><p>The change in her tone was subtle but devastating. That teasing cadence gave way to something thicker, lower. Like a secret shared under candlelight. Agatha’s breath hitched despite herself, her fingers twitching where they gripped her sleeves.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re insufferable,” she muttered, averting her gaze, pretending the floor was suddenly fascinating.</p><p> </p><p>“And yet…” Rio moved closer — too close now. She reached up, not to touch Agatha’s face this time, but to gently gather a handful of her hair. “You keep me around. Like a loyal <em>poppy</em>.” </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slid through the silky strands at the nape of Agatha’s neck with calculated slowness, making Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, close enough for Agatha to feel the whisper of her breath at her ear. “Why is that, I wonder?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, the scent of Rio suddenly enveloping her — dark spices, rain-soaked wood, and something floral buried deep beneath it all. She felt the ghost of Rio’s lips near her jawline, the warmth of her breath skating over her skin. And then — softly, purposefully — Rio tugged her hair, just enough to tilt her head, baring the curve of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned, though the edge in her voice was thin, barely there. “Don't…”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t stop. She leaned in fully now, her mouth brushing against Agatha’s pulse point with the lightest kiss — just enough pressure to stir the blood underneath. Then her lips parted and she sucked gently, enough to leave behind a faint, blooming mark. Agatha gasped, her hands gripping the edge of the desk behind her for support. Her knees felt loose, heat pulsing low in her stomach like a spark had been struck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back slowly, her lips still close enough to graze the mark she’d just left. Her voice was a satisfied murmur, smug and intimate. “Just wanted to leave something for you to think about.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open, her face flushed with shock and fury and something far too dangerous to name. “You—”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was already stepping away, her smirk fully returned now, glittering with wicked delight. “I’ll be around,” she said lightly, like she hadn’t just unraveled Agatha’s self-control with a single touch.</p><p> </p><p>And with that, she turned and exited the office without looking back, her departure quiet, calculated, and entirely triumphant — leaving Agatha standing there, breathless and burning, with a fresh mark blooming red on her neck and a storm gathering behind her eyes.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind Rio, and only then did Agatha allow herself to move. She reached up slowly, her fingers brushing the side of her neck where her skin still tingled. Her fingertips met the mark — warm, sensitive, unmistakable. A flush bloomed under her skin as reality hit her like a crashing wave.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God,” she whispered, stumbling to the mirror on the far wall of her office. “<em>That bitch!”</em></p><p> </p><p>Under the harsh overhead lights, the evidence was impossible to ignore: a red, blooming mark just above her collarbone, stark against her pale skin. She stared at it, wide-eyed, her heart galloping in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I have class. I have a room full of undergrads in ten minutes—” Her voice spiraled as she paced. “I kissed Death. I let her bite me. I let her mark me. What the hell is wrong with me?”</p><p> </p><p>The door creaked open again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I brought you the notes for — oh.”</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>Lilia</strong></em>.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped inside with a cup of tea in one hand and a file in the other, then paused, blinking once, then twice, her eyes landing right where Agatha’s hand hovered near her neck.</p><p> </p><p>A slow grin spread across her face. “<em>Well, well</em>,” she said, shutting the door with her foot. “Looks like somebody had an... extracurricular activity over lunch.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped around, mortified. “Don’t start.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sweetie. I don’t have to start anything. That mark’s already giving a whole TED Talk.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, I’m serious!” Agatha barked, her voice cracking slightly. “<em>This isn’t funny</em>! I—I just lost my husband. He’s still missing, and I’m walking around with a mark from someone else on my neck! I can’t—” She broke off, her hands fluttering uselessly as panic took over. “What if someone sees? What are the students going to think? What if the faculty—?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s smile softened, her teasing expression falling away as she crossed the room. “Okay, okay,” she said gently, setting the tea aside and placing both hands on Agatha’s arms. “Breathe. Deep breath in, hold, and out, honey. Come on. You’re going to pass out if you keep spinning like this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did as she was told, her chest heaving as she fought to calm herself. Lilia tilted her head to get a better look at the mark and clucked her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright. Let’s get you some concealer before someone decides your ‘ghost girlfriend’ is tattooing hickeys on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, dragging a hand down her face. “<em>It’s not a hickey.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Honey,” Lilia said, pulling a compact from her oversized purse, “It’s exactly a hickey. And you didn't deny the ‘ghost girlfriend’ either.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sank into the chair beside her desk while Lilia crouched in front of her, dabbing expertly at the mark with a practiced hand. The makeup was cool against her skin, the scent of Lilia’s citrus-scented lotion grounding her slightly.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia glanced up with a mischievous smile. “So… was it the tall, dark, and terrifying Death you’ve been seeing or the one who is ‘in love with you’?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer at first. Her lips parted slightly, eyes flickering with guilt and something she hated admitting to herself, something dangerously close to joy.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” she said finally, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia leaned back, cocking a brow. “Well. Doesn’t seem like she’s all that <em>dead</em> to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia wasn't specific. Something in her tone seemed to connect the dots. Agatha decided not to question it for now. It would raise too many questions, questions she didn't have the head or time to answer. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a dry look. “It’s not funny, Lilia.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a little funny.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “She just… gets under my skin. She says things, and I know I should tell her to leave, but she doesn’t listen. And then... she’s kind to the kids. And she makes me laugh. And she defends me. And then I’m kissing her in my room, my office, like a damn teenager.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stood and smoothed Agatha’s collar gently over the now-concealed mark, her touch light. “That sounds like someone you care about. You look... lighter when you talk about her. Happier.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned. “I’m not supposed to be happy. Not right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not how grief works, Agatha, my child.” Lilia smiled softly. “It comes in waves. So does healing. Sometimes they crash into each other, and sometimes they give you a little room to breathe.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her reflection in the mirror, at the carefully hidden mark, the faint pink still warming her cheeks, the quiet tremble in her hands. She didn’t know what to do with any of it.</p><p> </p><p>"How does she make you feel? Be honest, Agatha." Lilia asked, looking into Agatha's blue eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes filled with tears as a phrase, a memory came into her head:</p><p> </p><p>"Then why do I feel so alive beside you?”</p><p> </p><p>“She makes me feel... <em>alive</em>. I feel alive next to her." Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to swallow a tear. Her throat was tight, red, sore. "Death's kiss brings me life, Lilia... That shouldn't happen, should it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm... Well, <em>Death's kiss</em> and <em>The Kiss of Death</em> have a big difference, Agatha. You don't kiss her expecting to surrender to Death, you kiss her expecting to surrender to that feeling. The feeling that she, her soul gives you. This feeling, Agatha, has a simple name. And you already know what it is, don't you?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and looked away. Yes, she knew. She knew what it was about. But she wouldn't accept it, couldn't accept it. </p><p> </p><p>“<strong><em>Love</em></strong>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn't be right about this madness from another life. What was so bad that happened in that other life for Rio to come to her in this life? And why after another life did she still feel this way about none other than Death herself?</p><p> </p><p>No, she didn't believe it. If she didn't say it out loud, it wouldn't be real. </p><p> </p><p>“<em>Love. It is not love.</em>”</p>

<p>The past month had stretched like silk over wire — soft in some places, taut in others. Agatha moved through her days as though rehearsing a life that wasn’t entirely hers, and yet, somehow, it had begun to fit. Morning routines bled together: the warm scent of fresh toast in the air, the scuffle of Nick’s socks sliding over wooden floors, the groan of Nicole's teenage moods behind slammed doors. And then, always, Rio, silent and smirking in the doorway, a mug of untouched coffee cradled in her hands, her gaze heavy with meaning that never needed words.</p><p>Rio had woven herself into the rhythm of the house without resistance, like ink blooming in water — impossible to undo, and strangely beautiful. She moved barefoot through the kitchen, humming tunes from centuries past. She left fresh, fragrant flowers on Agatha’s nightstand each morning, their scent clinging to the sheets long after Rio had slipped away. She sat cross-legged on the floor helping Nick untangle puberty and first heartbreaks, as if she’d ever been human enough to live through them. She played basketball with the kids in the yard, her laughter echoing under dusk light, and when Agatha curled up with cramps and exhaustion, Rio didn’t ask — she simply pressed a heating pad to her stomach, rubbed her back with strong, steady hands, and whispered, “<em>Breathe, baby. Just breathe</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>It was <em>terrifying</em> how <em>right</em> it felt.</p><p> </p><p>There was a softness blooming in the spaces Rio touched — <em>domestic, easy, real</em> — and Agatha hated how much she welcomed it. She’d stopped questioning the surreal normalcy of having Death lounging on her couch. The boundaries blurred faster than she could rebuild them. One day Rio was the shadow at her back. The next, she was folding Nicky’s laundry and fixing a cabinet door that hadn’t closed properly in years. It was unsettling. Perfect. Unnatural. And somehow, exactly what they needed.</p><p> </p><p>But despite it all, Agatha couldn't find rest.</p><p> </p><p>While Rio lay sprawled across the couch, reading one of her grimoires upside-down — <em>of course</em> — and the kids dozed in front of a flickering cartoon, Agatha sat hunched at the kitchen table, candlelight painting her skin in shades of bronze and fatigue. The air was thick with wax and ink. Her fingers, stained from hours of scribbling, clenched her pen too tight. Her eyes flicked toward the tangled mess of a board she’d created on the wall — maps pinned at odd angles, red string stretching between blurry photographs of Ralph, half-buried police reports, and symbols she didn’t recognize but somehow felt.</p><p> </p><p><em>Nothing fit</em>. Nothing answered the hollow in her chest or quieted the hum beneath her skin. The leads had frozen. Her memories were like fogged glass — she could feel the shapes behind them, the weight of something she was meant to remember. But when she reached, there was only silence. Even Ralph’s voice had faded from her mind, hollow and distant, like a dream that never really belonged to her.</p><p> </p><p>The pen trembled in her hand. Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t trust this stillness. Not the quiet house, not the scent of pine and night that lingered in the doorway, not the woman made of shadow and stars curled comfortably on her couch like she belonged. Because maybe she did. And maybe that was the most dangerous thing of all.</p><p> </p><p>“Staring at that wall won’t bring him back,” Rio said, not bothering to look up from her book. Her voice was that familiar blend of velvet and blade — soothing to the ear, but every syllable pricked. It slid under Agatha’s skin like silk over a wound.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Her eyes remained fixed on the wall of files and strings, her spine rigid, fingers digging into the arms of the chair. She could feel Rio’s words curling around her like smoke, intentionally low, intentionally provoking. She refused to meet her gaze. Nicole had already teased her enough that morning — little smirks and knowing looks about how Rio seemed to orbit around her mother like a woman who had already claimed the house and everyone in it. She would not give either of them the satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, the leather of the couch shifted as Rio sighed and placed the book aside. The rustle of pages was followed by the slow stretch of limbs, long and unhurried, the kind of movement that belonged to someone completely unbothered by time. Rio arched her back like a cat, her ribs rising with a deep breath that pulled her shirt up just enough to show a sliver of tattooed skin along her hip. Agatha saw it from the corner of her eye — and hated the way her throat tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“You haven’t slept properly in a week, <em>sweetheart</em>.” Rio’s voice grew softer, almost concerned — but still laced with heat. “Your energy is starting to taste... burnt.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, the muscles in her neck tight from holding tension. Her eyes locked onto Rio, hard. “I would be sleeping if you were actually talking about what you know about all this. He is the father of my children!” Her voice cracked at the end, sharper than she meant, betraying her exhaustion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t blink. She stepped forward, her expression unreadable. “<em>No. He’s not</em>.” Her words were quiet, but they hit like thunder. “And you <em>know</em> that.”</p><p> </p><p>The room thickened. Something dangerous coiled beneath Rio’s skin, quiet and patient and utterly untouchable. The dim lighting deepened the shadows around her eyes, made the lines of her jaw sharper, her gaze more animal than human.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood halfway, jaw clenched, eyes burning. “Then tell me something, Rio. Where is he?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved.</p><p> </p><p>She rose with that impossible grace — bare feet silent on the hardwood, every motion intentional, practiced, powerful. She circled the room slowly, the way a predator might test the edge of a trap it didn’t fear. Her fingers dragged along the edge of Agatha’s desk, grazing parchment and wood like they were hers to touch. Her nails, black and chipped, whispered across the pages like ink itself. The scent of her wrapped around Agatha in waves: smoke, jasmine, earth after lightning. It made her chest tighten.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the one who answers that question, Agatha,” she murmured, stopping just behind her. Her voice brushed against the shell of Agatha’s ear, so low it vibrated through her bones. “All you have to do is remember.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched in her throat. Her hands trembled slightly against the edge of the table. “I don’t want to remember,” she rasped. “I’m tired!”</p><p> </p><p>“You want to,” Rio whispered, “and you will. Because it’s already unraveling. You feel it. When I touch you. When I say your name.” She dragged the syllables of it out like worship. “It hums under your skin.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop it,” Agatha said, but it came out breathless. Weak. Her hands clenched the desk like an anchor. “You don’t know what I feel.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile — when it came — was slow, deliberate, dangerous. She stepped closer still, until her lips grazed the skin just beneath Agatha’s jaw. A shiver erupted down Agatha’s spine. Rio didn’t kiss her — just exhaled there, warm whiskey and mint spilling across sensitive skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly dropped her glass. Her body surged forward in instinct, her eyes fluttering shut. A soft gasp escaped her lips — too honest, too telling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back, not out of mercy, but because she wanted to see the damage. “Oh, I do,” she said darkly. “And soon, you’ll admit it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, every nerve frayed, every cell screaming. She hated this. She hated her. She hated how much she wanted her.</p><p>Then Rio’s voice turned to something harder, colder.</p><p> </p><p>“You want answers?” she said, circling back to the front of her. “You’re looking in the wrong places, <em>Professor</em>. Ralph’s disappearance isn’t the beginning of your story. It’s the <em>consequence</em> of your hiding.” Agatha opened her mouth to ask what the hell that meant, but Rio was already walking away, the hem of her loose shirt whispering along her thighs. “Now, go to bed,” she called over her shoulder. “Or don’t. But either way... stop trying to bury what already clawed its way to the surface.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared after her, the ache in her chest matched only by the buzzing in her fingertips.</p><hr/><p>The soft flicker of the television bathed the room in warm, golden hues, casting dancing shadows across the walls. The animated ballroom scene glowed on screen, but the real magic sat right in the living room — Rio, her body relaxed but her presence always electric, gently threading her fingers through Nick’s dark curls as he dozed, his head nestled on her lap. Nicole lay curled on the other side of the couch, her face half-buried in a pillow, pretending not to watch but quietly mouthing the lyrics to “<strong><em>Tale as Old as Time</em></strong>.”</p><p>Agatha, however, was anything but calm. The wine had dulled her nerves only slightly. Her fingers were stained with ink, nails chipped, her pajama top slipping off one shoulder as she sat cross-legged in the center of an organized chaos of old leather-bound volumes. Pages filled with elegant script were scattered around her like relics, and she hunched over her open journal, writing in bursts, as if her thoughts might vanish if she didn’t capture them fast enough. Candlelight flickered beside her, illuminating the furrow of her brow and the determined tightness in her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Then came the knock. Three short, clipped taps, too polite to be casual, too familiar to be friendly.</p><p>Agatha froze mid-sentence, her pen hovering in the air. Her breath caught in her throat. Cold dread slid down her spine like ice water.</p><p> </p><p>Nick stirred slightly, mumbling something against Rio’s leg.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole lifted her head. “That better not be the cops again.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” Agatha muttered, setting her pen down. Her hand reached blindly for the wine glass, but it was empty.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll get it, my love,” Rio purred, rising with feline grace from the couch, gently lowering Nick’s head to a throw pillow without disturbing him. She smoothed the blanket over him and cast a glance at Nicole that was both reassuring and commanding. “Keep your brother calm.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole narrowed her eyes. “Don’t start anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a wink, then turned to Agatha, who had already started to rise. “<em>Rio</em>—” Agatha began, her voice low and tight.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was already moving, barefoot across the hardwood floor, the hem of her loose shirt brushing her thighs, posture relaxed but coiled with power. She glanced back once, her voice laced with something warmer than teasing this time. “Relax. I’ll play nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her knuckles against her lips, watching the sway of Rio’s hips as she disappeared toward the entryway. Her heart was pounding, not with fear, but with that familiar dread that came every time the door knocked. Every time the past tried to creep back in.</p><p>From the front hallway, the low murmur of voices began. A male voice, firm, measured, was met with Rio’s velvet tone, smooth and unsettling. Agatha couldn’t hear the words, but she could feel the shift in the air: something electric, something sharp.</p><p> </p><p>She closed her eyes, exhaling through her nose, whispering under her breath, “Please don’t provoke them…” But she already knew that was asking the moon not to pull the tides.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha saw Daniel’s silhouette at the door, something cold settled in her stomach. It was always him — always the same unreadable expression, always the same stiff stance like he didn’t quite believe her, like he was waiting for her to slip. And now he was looking at Rio with that same edge of polite condescension he wore like a badge.</p><p> </p><p>“Good evening,” Daniel began, but his voice lacked any warmth. His eyes flicked down to the way Rio leaned against the frame, bare feet on the tile, arms crossed loosely, a smirk tugging at her mouth like she was playing with him. It made him visibly uncomfortable. “We’re here to speak with Mrs. Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re speaking with me,” Rio purred, her tone smooth as velvet, but there was a current under it, something slow-burning, like a lit fuse.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s jaw twitched slightly. “Mrs. Vidal, is it?” He flipped a page in his notebook, pen tapping the edge. “Are you her... legal counsel or something?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, eyes dark and unreadable. “Or<em> something</em>,” she murmured, lifting a single brow. “But don’t worry, Officer. Whatever you need, I can handle it.”</p><p> </p><p>That one sentence sent a ripple down Agatha’s spine from across the room, her breath catching before she even knew why. Rio had said it lightly, but she knew that tone. It was a warning wrapped in silk.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel, however, wasn’t amused. “We need to speak with Mrs. Harkness directly,” he said, this time with steel beneath his civility.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you do,” Rio said, voice syrupy sweet as she stepped aside with a mockingly graceful gesture. “She’s right in the living room. Don’t let the candlelight intimidate you.”</p><p> </p><p>The officers stepped past her, but not before Daniel gave Rio one last glance, a mix of distrust and irritation. Agatha rose from the floor slowly, her joints stiff from sitting too long, her mind trying to click into something sharper than panic.</p><p> </p><p>She brushed her hair out of her face, tucked it behind her ear, and offered them a polite, tight-lipped smile. “Officers,” she said evenly, her voice smooth but taut like a bowstring. “What can I do for you this time?”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re following up on Ralph’s case,” Daniel replied, his partner nodding like a silent echo behind him. “It’s been seven months. We’re reviewing all aspects of the investigation.”</p><p> </p><p>The word “seven” hit harder than Agatha expected, a pressure that bloomed behind her ribs. Seven months of silence. Of stares. Of waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Her arms crossed automatically, her fingers digging slightly into the sleeves of her cardigan. “And that requires asking the same questions over and over again?”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel didn’t flinch. “We just want to ensure we haven’t missed anything.” His gaze shifted downward to the scattered books: the cracked leather bindings, the curling parchment pages covered in Latin, symbols, and underlined passages. “You’ve been doing some... reading?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Just research. Nothing relevant to Ralph. I'm a historian and a teacher.”</p><p> </p><p>She hated how defensive it sounded. As if she had something to hide. As if the books weren’t her last desperate attempt to make sense of the woman lounging now behind the officers, arms crossed, watching everything like a panther ready to pounce.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a soft chuckle, and though it was barely audible, it dripped with amusement. “I’m sure your time is better spent chasing actual leads, Officer,” she said without looking up, her voice a weapon dressed in silk gloves.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s eyes flicked to her for half a second but returned to Agatha like she hadn’t spoken at all. “Have you remembered anything new? Anything unusual about Ralph’s behavior before he disappeared?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a slow, measured breath, the scent of wine and candlewax lingering in her nose. She could feel the warmth of the fire at her back, and the weight of Rio’s stare like a palm pressed to her lower spine.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said flatly. “And I’ve told you everything I know. <em>Repeatedly</em>.” Her voice cracked slightly at the end, but it was still sharp. Controlled. <em>Barely</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward just enough to make her presence known again, not touching Agatha, but close enough to cast her shadow beside her. “She’s not hiding anything, Officer. But I have to say, your fixation is starting to look more like <em>harassment</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s eyes narrowed, his lips twitching toward something like a warning, but he kept his tone even. “We’re doing our job, Mrs. Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>The tension in the room shifted the air like pressure before a storm. Agatha’s arms remained locked across her chest, her nails digging into her sleeves. She felt caged between the weight of protocol and the raw protectiveness clawing in her chest. Her breathing was shallow, lips pressed in a thin line, but her gaze was unwavering as she looked at the officers.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s voice broke the silence, deceptively calm. “Mrs. Harkness,” he said carefully, like each word had been weighed, “we’d like to speak with your children before we leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s posture changed immediately, spine snapping straighter, her chin tilting slightly as though daring him to repeat himself. Her fingers twitched against her biceps, the only crack in her otherwise statuesque control.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” she asked, her voice low, almost too quiet, dangerous in its restraint.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel’s partner stepped forward, his voice smoother, trying to diffuse. “Sometimes children notice things adults might not. Even something small, someone at the door, a sound, a car. We just want to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could gather a response, Rio’s presence surged forward like a silent wave crashing into the conversation. Her bare feet padded across the floor with feline grace, and when she stopped beside Agatha, her eyes bore into the officers with something fierce, something ancient.</p><p> </p><p>“<strong>No</strong>,” she said, the word slicing the air like a blade. “Absolutely not.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel blinked, his brow furrowing. “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not dragging <em>my</em> kids into this,” Rio snapped, stepping slightly in front of Agatha. Her body was relaxed, but her stance was protective, possessive. “They don’t know anything, and even if they did, they’re not your fucking leverage.”</p><p> </p><p>The smirk that Daniel usually wore was gone. He exchanged a glance with his partner, both men suddenly more cautious. “We’re not accusing them of anything, ma’am. Just routine.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth curled in disdain. “Don’t ‘ma’am’ me. I’ve seen what your ‘routine’ looks like. You want a confession from a child to justify your stagnation. Not today.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, <em>honey</em>,” Agatha said, her voice quiet but firm. She laid a hand on Rio’s forearm, fingers curling lightly, grounding her. “Let them ask. If either of the kids feels uncomfortable, I’ll end it. Right then.”</p><p> </p><p>The fire in Rio’s eyes flickered as she looked down at the hand on her arm. Agatha’s touch was always soft, too soft, and it disarmed her in ways nothing else could. Still, she didn’t move, didn’t pull away. Her jaw clenched, lips parting to argue, then sealing again as she studied Agatha’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re sure?” Rio asked, voice low, almost growled. Her fingers brushed briefly against Agatha’s wrist like she was reading her pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’m sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped back slowly, the gesture deliberate. She didn’t remove her gaze from the officers, didn’t soften. “Fine,” she said finally. “But I’ll be listening. And if I think for a second you’re pushing them, this stops.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel nodded once, professionally. “Understood.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Rio murmured, her arms folding again across her chest, her body now a silent wall between them and the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>As Agatha turned to call for the children, she felt Rio’s presence still close — tension in the air, in the heat rolling off her skin. And as much as it unnerved her, it also steadied her.</p><p>The weight of the room seemed to shift as Nicole and Nick stepped closer, their sock-covered feet making no sound against the floorboards. The muted glow of the television flickered across their faces, casting soft shadows that made them look even smaller, even more guarded. Nick’s little hand remained knotted in Nicole’s sleeve, his thumb brushing the fabric like it gave him courage. Nicole’s jaw was set tight, her chin lifted defiantly despite the unease in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice was gentle, but behind it trembled a mother’s dread. “These officers have a few questions about your dad,” she said, her tone carefully measured. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, but it might help.”</p><p> </p><p>The children exchanged a glance. Nick’s brows knit together, his small mouth pressing into a line before he finally gave a reluctant nod. Nicole didn’t move, but her stance shifted forward slightly — like a shield.</p><p>Daniel knelt on the rug in the living room, lowering himself to the children’s level with a gentle smile. His badge glinted faintly in the late afternoon light pouring through the blinds. His voice was warm, not overly sweet, but inviting — like a teacher who knew how to reach even the shyest student.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Nicole. Nick,” he said softly. “I know this is all a little weird, but I just wanted to ask if either of you noticed anything unusual before your dad left. Anything you remember. It can be small.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole sat slouched on the arm of the couch, arms crossed, her face unreadable. Nick perched beside her, shoulders hunched, eyes on the floor. Nick spoke first, voice quiet but steady. “He wasn’t a good dad.”</p><p> </p><p>The words made Agatha’s stomach tighten. She didn’t interrupt — she couldn’t. Her eyes flicked between her children, but mostly, they lingered on Nick’s small hands twisting in his lap.</p><p> </p><p>“He always came home late,” the boy continued. “He didn’t go to school events or help with homework. He forgot my birthday one time. He never remembered wedding anniversaries, it made Mom sad.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart ached, but she said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel tilted his head slightly, staying kind. “That sounds really hard, buddy. Did anything feel different before he disappeared?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick nodded slowly. “Yeah. He was acting weird. Like… more than usual. He kept muttering stuff. Said he was trapped. That he didn’t want to be in another <em>spell</em> again.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel frowned. “Spell?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick shrugged. “That’s what he said. Said he was stuck. That he needed to get out. That someone was watching him.”</p><p> </p><p>A shadow passed over Rio’s face where she stood behind the children. Agatha’s eyes caught the change — her stance straightening, head tilted ever so slightly. Her lips were pressed in a line, the amber in her eyes dimming to a mossy, unnatural green. Her attention wasn’t on the children anymore. It was fixed — sharp and calculating — on Daniel.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. “<em>What is she doing…?</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Nick went on, oblivious. “He met with a woman. She always wore red. Blood red. He said she was like a therapist. But he only saw her at night.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole scoffed. “More like the slut he was screwing. He thought we didn’t notice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nicole! Language!” Agatha warned.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel shifted his weight, noting that down quietly. “Did he ever say her name?”</p><p> </p><p>Nick shook his head. “No. He just said she helped him ‘see clearly.’ Said Mom made him sick. But he never said why.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched. It felt like the floor was slipping beneath her feet.</p><p> </p><p>“She was a jerk.”, Nicky said angrily.</p><p> </p><p>“He stopped letting us call him Dad,” Nick added softly. “When we were alone. Said it didn’t feel right.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right how?” Daniel echoed.</p><p> </p><p>Nick nodded. “Like he wasn’t supposed to be here. Like someone had put him in the <em>wrong place</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole finally spoke again, her voice flat and cold. “He didn’t matter. Not to me. Not to Nicky either. Not to mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Daniel looked up. “What do you mean, Nicole?”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t answer. Just glanced briefly — deliberately — toward Rio. And Rio… smiled. Not warm. Not cold. Just knowing.</p><p>Agatha’s heart twisted. She was torn between watching her children open wounds she hadn’t realized were still bleeding… and watching the eerie stillness blooming in Rio. Her body so still it didn’t even seem to breathe. Shadows clung to her cheekbones like fingers. Her pupils dilated, almost fully black, and that green in her irises shimmered like moss on wet stone. <em>Not human</em>. Not hiding.</p><p> </p><p>“For him it was all about the chains<em>.</em>” Nick said.</p><p> </p><p>“What chains?” Daniel asked gently.</p><p> </p><p>Nick blinked. “I don’t know. He didn’t say. But… after that, Mom got really sick. And then he left.”</p><p> </p><p>His face softened, but he didn’t cry. Just looked up with a sadness far too grown for his age. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want him to be hurt. I don’t. But I’m glad he’s gone. We’re… happier now. Our family’s better without him.”</p><p> </p><p>He turned to Rio with a shy smile. The look in his eyes cracked Agatha’s chest wide open. And just like that, Rio’s face shifted. That dark, focused intensity vanished like smoke. Her usual expression returned — soft, teasing, familiar. She winked at Nick and knelt beside him, resting a hand gently on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Daniel cleared his throat, standing. “That’s… that’s more than enough. Thank you, Nicky. Nick. And thank you, Mrs. Harkness.” Agatha nodded mutely, her throat too tight to speak.</p><p> </p><p>As Daniel walked to the door, Rio remained crouched, brushing a thumb over Nick’s shoulder. She looked up once — only once — and her eyes caught Agatha’s like a snare.</p><p> </p><p>There was something else buried in that look. Something that said, <em>Never say I didn't help you with anything. </em>“I told you, darling... sometimes absence is a mercy.” Rio’s voice was mocking, yes — almost cheerful — but it curled at the end like a blade drawn slow. It wasn’t cruel. It was worse. <em>It was satisfied</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers reached down, brushing gently through Nick’s soft hair. He leaned into the touch without a word, his small body pressing closer, and something inside her cracked. The room around her, warm in color but cold in feeling, was too quiet — the cartoons still playing in the background sounded warped now, far away, as if underwater.</p><p>Her arms folded across her chest in a tight, protective grip. Her nails dug into her sleeves. She stared ahead but saw nothing. Her jaw clenched so tight it ached, the pressure moving up into her skull. Her pulse roared in her ears, louder than anything else. She felt like she was watching herself from outside her own body. Floating. Drowning. Both. Boots touched the wooden floor behind her — soft, soundless — and Agatha didn’t have to turn. She could feel her. That quiet gravity Rio carried with her, like dusk spilling into a room.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked, voice velvet-soft. Not teasing. Not laced with amusement. Just low. Intent. Focused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to answer, but the words wouldn’t come. Her legs buckled slightly, not from pain — from weight. The emotional weight of it all. And Rio caught her without hesitation. Agatha fell forward, slow but certain, until her cheek pressed into Rio’s shoulder. Warm. Solid. And dangerous in the most comforting way.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She only held her. Her arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist with that effortless strength that always felt barely restrained. Her scent — cool pine, night air, sea salt, something older and wild and unexplainable — wrapped around Agatha like a spell she didn’t remember casting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's voice came low, almost inaudible, muffled against Rio’s chest. “Tell me what you know about this, Rio... Tell me something. <em>Anything</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Agatha could feel the tension coil in her spine — like a bow drawn but never loosed. Her breath moved against Agatha’s collarbone, warm, steady, too calm.</p><p> </p><p>“The only thing I can tell you…” Rio whispered, her tone carefully measured, “is that he’s not dead. Not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha pull back. Her eyes locked onto Rio’s, brows furrowed, confusion and dread battling behind them. “So, he’s dying?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio’s answer came too quickly. Too definite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice rose, cracked. “Then what? Did you know what he was doing to them? To our kids?” Her voice trembled, but it didn’t break. “Did you know, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated. Just a flicker. Barely there. But Agatha saw it. And the cold that followed felt like ice water down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>It hit like a slap. Agatha stumbled back, arms wrapping tight around herself again, but this time as armor. “You’re not telling me everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward again, slow, hands raised slightly in a gesture of peace — but she didn’t touch her. “I can’t, Agatha. You don't understand.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why the hell not?” The words ripped from her like lightning.</p><p> </p><p>“Because <em>I’m not allowed</em>,” Rio snapped, but even her anger was controlled. Refined. Her voice darkened, dropping lower. “That answer belongs to my sister, not to me. Maybe my <em>stupid brother</em>! If I break that line, I’ll shatter you. Your soul wouldn’t survive it. I've done it before. And the only way to fix it was death. They died.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence thundered between them.</p><p> </p><p>The air between them was so charged Agatha could taste it — metallic, thick, like the moment before a storm. She looked at Rio — really looked — and hated that despite everything, her body still ached for her. Still wanted to lean in. Still trusted her more than it should.</p><p> </p><p>“You live in my house,” she said, voice raw. “You sleep under my roof, touch my children, bring me flowers, <em>kiss me</em> like you’ve done it a hundred times before — and you still keep this from me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I care more than you realize,” Rio said, low and certain. “But there are boundaries I can’t cross. Even for you. Especially for you. Not again. You already paid once for being <em>my favorite</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She hated the way those words stirred her — how her legs weakened and her skin warmed even as fury climbed her ribs. Rio wasn’t touching her, but her restraint was worse. It was the restraint of someone who could take but chose not to. And that burned more.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice broke on a whisper. “And what line did you cross when you kissed me? When you came back for me? When you gave me two kids? How much is this going to cost, Rio?” Her throat tightened. “How much more do I have to pay for you to love me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze. She didn’t blink. She didn’t breathe. But her eyes — green, dark, endless — flashed. Her voice came like thunder muffled in silk. “I’d burn my realm for you, Agatha, if that means to keep you safe.”</p><p> </p><p>She stepped in, her mouth a breath from hers, her thumb brushing the edge of Agatha’s lower lip — not kissing, just hovering. “I already did once.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked away from the living room with a heaviness that sank into her bones. The kids were still there, absorbed by the flicker of cartoons, ignoring the tension between their moms, their laughter distant and weightless. She couldn’t feel it — the normalcy. It scraped against her nerves like a dull blade.</p><p> </p><p>The kitchen light was <em>too bright.</em></p><p> </p><p>Her fingers wrapped tightly around the neck of the wine bottle as she pulled it from the counter with a practiced, impatient twist. She didn’t bother with elegance. The liquid poured into the glass like blood. Rich, red, promising something it wouldn’t deliver. She downed the first glass in one unbroken swallow. Her throat burned, her chest warmed. Not enough.</p><p> </p><p><em>After all this,</em> she thought, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, <em>I’m going to need a liver transplant. Or a damn intervention. </em>She poured another. This one she held.</p><p> </p><p>And she knew — she knew — Rio was watching. Not moving. Not speaking. Just there. Silent in the doorway like a shadow waiting to be invited in. Agatha could feel her — the hum of her presence was as physical as heat. Her body thrummed with it, even as she pretended not to notice. But she wasn’t pretending well.</p><p>She could hear the soft creak of boots on wood as Rio stepped into the room, unhurried, deliberate. Her breath caught before she could stop it — not from fear. Not anymore. From anticipation. From the kind of tension that felt like the moment before thunder cracked the sky open.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio—” she started, but the name barely passed her lips before fingers slid into her hair.</p><p> </p><p><em>Soft. Warm. Possessive</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t yank — not cruel — but firm enough to tilt Agatha’s chin, exposing the length of her throat. The pulse that fluttered under her jaw. The vulnerable line where skin met collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, voice fraying at the edges.</p><p> </p><p>“Just proving a point,” Rio murmured, and her breath ghosted over Agatha’s cheek, her jaw. It was warm. Whiskey-sweet. A little mint. And utterly intoxicating.</p><p> </p><p>Then her mouth was there. Not kissing. <em>Claiming</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips closed around the skin just under Agatha’s jaw, her tongue sliding over the pulse before she suckled, slow and deliberate. The pressure wasn’t painful — but it was enough to make Agatha’s knees weaken, enough to steal the breath from her lungs. Her hand shot out instinctively, fisting in the front of Rio’s shirt.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t push her away. <em>She held</em> <em>on</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her body betrayed her entirely — her legs trembling, her skin burning, her hips pressing forward with shameful instinct. And when Rio finally pulled back, the mark she left behind bloomed just under the neckline of Agatha’s shirt — red, tender, and hers.</p><p> </p><p>“There,” Rio whispered, her breath still brushing against Agatha’s lips. “Now we’re both hiding something and breaking boundaries.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched again. Her voice trembled with disbelief and something darker. “<em>You’re insane,</em>” she whispered. “You do know that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk returned, slow and sharp — but this time, quieter. Almost fond. “And you’re not as scared of me as you pretend to be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away with a huff, arms crossing tight around her chest, fingers digging into her sides. She stared hard into the hallway’s shadows, into the places her thoughts didn’t want to follow. Her pulse still hadn’t slowed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tired of not knowing, Rio,” she said, the words rough as gravel.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio didn’t move. Not yet. But her voice dropped again, deeper, weightier. “You’ll find out, Agatha. I’ll help you.” A pause. Then the catch. “But not everything comes with answers. Some things…” her voice sharpened slightly, like a blade sliding free, “come with <em>consequences</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She only stood there, trembling from the inside out. The wineglass shook in her grip. Her mind raced, her body screamed, her heart begged for silence.</p><p>After a long moment, she moved. Walked away — not quite steady — and collapsed onto the edge of the couch, her limbs folding in on themselves.</p><p>Rio remained in the kitchen doorway, watching her with eyes that had seen too much and still chose to stay. There was no smile now. No sharp remark. Only something softer — and far more dangerous. She didn’t follow. Not yet. She knew when to wait. Because Rio had already won the moment Agatha leaned into her.</p><p> </p><p>And they both knew it.</p><hr/><p>The evening settled over the house like a thick blanket — soft, quiet, and heavy with the weight of everything unspoken. The earlier tension had dulled to something muted, something tolerable. Familiar, even. Upstairs, the air carried a mix of lavender soap, warm towels, and the faint peppermint sting of toothpaste as bedtime crept in.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the doorframe of the bathroom, arms folded, watching her son butcher the concept of dental hygiene with the grace of a baby raccoon. Her expression was tired but fond, lips twitching in restraint as Nick scrubbed across his teeth in lazy zigzags, foam already threatening to spill from the corners of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Nick, brush your teeth properly this time,” she said, her voice low and pointed, stern enough to suggest authority, but not enough to stop him from humming through the bubbles.</p><p> </p><p>“I always do, Mom,” he mumbled through a mouthful of mint and froth, dribbling slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm-hmm,” Agatha deadpanned, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio appeared beside her like a shadow stretching across the frame, leaning against the opposite side of the door. The light hit her just right — highlighting the sharp curve of her cheekbone, the amused glint in her dark eyes. She crossed one ankle over the other, impossibly at ease.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s not wrong, Agatha,” she said, voice warm and lilting with that usual dose of mockery. “‘Properly’ is such a subjective word. Philosophically speaking.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward her with a dry glare. “You’re not helping.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned like sin, her gaze raking slowly down Agatha’s figure before settling somewhere near her collarbone. “Am I ever?” she asked, and while her tone was light, there was something sultry buried beneath it, something that made Agatha feel suddenly aware of the loose neckline of her worn T-shirt and the heat blooming at the base of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could reply, a door creaked open behind them, and Nicole padded into the hallway in her oversized hoodie, arms crossed over her chest, expression as unimpressed as it was predictable.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you two stop <em>flirting</em>?” she asked flatly, glancing between them with theatrical disgust. “It’s weird. And disgusting.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened — and then closed again. Her cheeks flushed a guilty pink. “We’re not—” she tried, her voice too defensive, too fast.</p><p> </p><p>“We are,” Rio said at the exact same time, her tone smooth and completely unapologetic, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. "And you should be happy, little demon, that means you moms love each other."</p><p> </p><p>"I do not-"</p><p> </p><p>Nicole snorted. “Whatever. Just keep it down. I’m trying to sleep and you’re embarrassing.”</p><p> </p><p>Without waiting for a reply, she spun on her heel and vanished into her room, door shutting with a soft click that left the hallway still and charged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and pinched the bridge of her nose, fingers pressing between her brows as if she could physically push the heat out of her face. “This is my life now. Amazing…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled low in her throat, the sound like dark honey. She pushed off the doorframe and stepped close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her body, the whisper of her breath brushing her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“And what a life it is, darling,” she murmured, her voice low and velvety, hand grazing lightly along Agatha’s back as she passed behind her. “Tragic, chaotic... <em>delicious</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned just in time to catch the smirk sliding across Rio’s lips like a secret. Her gaze lingered — too long, too soft — and for a heartbeat, she didn’t speak. She just stood there, watching Rio walk down the hall with a sway that was half goddess, half provocation.</p><p> </p><p>“Go put him to bed,” Agatha finally muttered, half under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tossed a grin over her shoulder. “Only if you’re next.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She just stood in the hallway, heart thudding a little too hard for her own comfort, biting the inside of her cheek to fight the smile that was already rising, unwanted but undeniable.</p><hr/><p>Later, with the children finally asleep and the house blanketed in a stillness only found after chaos, Agatha stepped into her bedroom. The dim light from the hallway poured in behind her, casting a long shadow across the wooden floor. Her body ached. Every muscle begged for rest. She tugged the tie from her hair, letting it fall messily around her face as she moved toward the bed.</p><p>And then she froze. A familiar weight shifted on the mattress behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you still here?” she asked, her voice sharp, but laced with exhaustion rather than surprise.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lay sprawled across the bed like she owned it, limbs stretched, one foot hanging off the edge, her tousled hair a halo of rebellion against Agatha’s otherwise structured world. Her dark eyes glinted in the low light.</p><p> </p><p>“Where else would I be?” she said lazily. “The couch? Dreadful upholstery. I like it here. I like watching you unravel. It's... <em>delicious</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a heavy sigh, crossing her arms over her chest. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed herself up on one elbow, the fabric of Agatha’s bedsheets bunching beneath her. Her smirk curled slow and precise, like she’d been waiting all day to wear it. “Confess, baby, I remain your favorite houseguest.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not a guest,” Agatha shot back, moving toward the dresser with clipped steps. “You’re an infestation. Like termites. Or mold.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped theatrically, a hand to her heart. “You wound me, my love. <em>Mortally</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>"You don't die" Agatha yanked open a drawer and pulled out her pajamas with more force than necessary. “And I don’t have the energy for your theatrics tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’d have more energy,” Rio said, sitting up fully, her legs folded beneath her, “if you let go of that <em>tight little leash</em> you keep on yourself. All this brooding, this... control… it’s exhausting, but sometimes fun, just watching you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned on her heel, eyes flashing, her fingers clenching around the fabric in her hands. “<em>Fun</em>? You think today was fun? The cops sniffing around again, the kids talking about how useless their dad is, me finding out he was cheating on me with a whore?! Was that funny?</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, one brow raised as she stood from the bed. Her voice dipped into something sultrier, lower. “No,” she said. “But watching you flustered? That was fun.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha warned, her tone clipped. Her skin prickled with awareness as Rio crossed the room with lazy, predatory grace — bare feet silent on the wood, the scent of pine, rain, and dark earth trailing in her wake.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio murmured, stepping into Agatha’s space. “You’re cute when you’re mad. And irresistible when you’re trying not to be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat tight, every nerve in her body suddenly hyperaware of the closeness, the heat, the magnetic pull that made her knees feel unreliable. She stepped back — just a little — but Rio followed, slow and deliberate.</p><p> </p><p>“You could just admit you like having me around,” Rio said softly, brushing an imaginary strand of hair from Agatha’s shoulder with a feather-light touch. “Wouldn’t kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks were already flushed, her breathing uneven. “I like having you around as much as I like migraines,” she muttered, voice thick.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, amused. “You didn’t seem to hate me earlier,” she whispered, dipping her head just enough that her lips hovered by Agatha’s ear, breath warm against her skin. “When you melted into me. When I kissed your neck like it belonged to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened, the heat in her belly flaring, but she masked it with a glare. “That was a mistake.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk didn’t falter. “Mistakes aren’t usually so... repeated. Are you still counting?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re pushing it,” Agatha growled, backing toward the dresser until her spine met wood.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped inches from her, the soft press of her palm finding the edge of the dresser beside Agatha’s hip. Her other hand rose — slowly, teasingly — to catch a lock of Agatha’s hair between her fingers. She twisted it gently, tugging just enough to tilt Agatha’s head and bare her throat. Then she leaned in, lips brushing just beneath Agatha’s ear before trailing lower, letting the heat of her mouth hover over the delicate curve of Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to mark you again,” she whispered, her breath like sin. “But not out of punishment this time. Out of promise. All your body now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted in a silent gasp, her eyes fluttering shut for the briefest second.</p><p>Then she felt it — Rio’s mouth, soft and deliberate, kissing the hollow of her throat. A slow, languid suck of skin that sent a ripple down Agatha’s spine, hot and possessive. Her breath caught. The sensation was maddening — a blend of heat and ownership that left her trembling. Her fingers dug into the dresser behind her, nails scraping against the wood as her knees threatened to give out. The sting was subtle but deliberate, and when Rio pulled away, licking the mark like a signature, Agatha gasped.</p><p>Rio stepped back just enough to let her gaze linger on the fresh bloom of red beginning to form. The curve of her mouth turned up into a slow, satisfied smile.</p><p> </p><p>"You'll feel that every time you move tomorrow, every time you see yourself in a mirror." she murmured with a wink, her voice dripping with satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hand flew to her neck, her fingers brushing the still-warm spot. "<em>Rio</em>!" she hissed, her voice shaking with a mix of fury and something far more dangerous. “Seriously! Are you twelve? A fucking bat?”</p><p> </p><p>Her heart pounded wildly in her chest, breath hitching as Rio leaned in again — closer now. Close enough that Agatha could feel the warm exhale of her breath on her lips. That wild scent of pine and rain, smoke and spice, curled into her nose, grounding her and setting her ablaze all at once.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered shut for a second. Her body screamed at her to move, to step away, but she stayed rooted in place. Frozen. Waiting.</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me to stop," Rio whispered. Her voice was a husky breath, barely audible, her lips hovering just inches away. “<em>I'll be good</em>  for you and stop if you say so.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Couldn’t. Rio searched her eyes, something raw and serious flickering beneath the mischief. She didn’t move. She didn’t push. She waited.</p><p> </p><p>"Just say the magic words, my love," Rio whispered, her voice now softer, almost reverent.</p><p> </p><p>The words sank deep into Agatha’s chest, wrapping around her ribs and pulling tight. She could feel the heat coiling low in her belly, the ache building with every second of that charged silence. She wanted to scream. She wanted to give in. She wanted to be touched again, to be ruined and rebuilt by the very creature she’d been resisting for weeks. But she couldn’t speak. She couldn’t find the words. Rio didn’t push. She stayed. Perfectly still. Eyes locked on hers. A quiet storm, waiting for permission.</p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, her whole body tight with restraint. Her throat worked as she tried to speak, to form the one word she wasn’t sure she meant.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, a breath escaped — ragged, helpless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's gaze softened. Her smirk melted into something quieter. Something close to love. "Take your time," she whispered. "I'm not going anywhere."</p><p> </p><p>And she didn’t.  She waited, patient and still, until Agatha whispered, almost brokenly, "Fuck you!." Then she moved.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss crashed between them like a wave. Agatha grabbed Rio by the collar and pulled her in, mouths colliding in a storm of need and frustration. It wasn’t delicate. It was wild, desperate. Agatha clung to Rio like she was afraid she’d disappear. Rio groaned softly against her lips, pressing back with just as much hunger, her hands sliding over Agatha’s waist, gripping her tight. Marking the skin with the squeeze she gave, eliciting a tearful moan from Agatha. </p><p>Their bodies met like puzzle pieces snapping into place — the heat between them instant and blinding. Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss, and Rio followed eagerly, her mouth hot and possessive, her kiss aching with all the things she hadn’t said. Agatha felt her chest rise and fall, her heart threatening to punch through her ribs. Her skin buzzed with sensation. Rio tasted like wild honey and thunder.</p><p>Rio pulled Agatha's hips against her, placing a thigh between Agatha's legs just to tease her and when she tried to rub herself, Rio just pull her knee away. Only to repeat it again.</p><p>They didn’t stop until breathing became a necessity. When they pulled apart, panting, their foreheads touched. Agatha’s lips were red, kissed raw. Her hands were still fisted in the fabric of Rio’s shirt, and she didn’t let go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes shone with something primal. Something ancient. "That," she whispered, her voice hoarse, "was fucking worth the wait. So worthy... every millennia."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, breathless and shaky. "You’re a devil."</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, brushing a strand of hair behind Agatha's ear. Her fingers lingered. "No, my love. I made the devil myself."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s lips met hers again, slower this time — so deliberate, it felt like a question and a promise all at once. The fire hadn’t dimmed, but it had shifted into something molten, deeper. Rio’s mouth moved over Agatha’s with reverence now, not hunger. As though she were rediscovering a temple long abandoned.</p><p>Rio’s hands didn’t roam. They stayed anchored — one resting lightly on the curve of Agatha’s waist, the other sliding up her back with aching patience, fingertips grazing the slope of her spine. She wasn’t pulling Agatha closer anymore. She was holding her there, steady and still, like she might disappear if she let go too fast.</p><p>Agatha felt her knees give slightly, her hands bunching in the soft fabric of Rio’s shirt. Her chest rose and fell against Rio’s with every uneven breath. Her body trembled — not from fear, but from the overwhelming intimacy of it. There was no performance in this touch. No teasing. Just Rio.</p><p>Rio drew back, just enough for her lips to hover over Agatha’s. Her breath was warm, and the faint scent of pine and rain clung to her skin — sharp, fresh, unrelenting. Her voice dropped to a hush.</p><p> </p><p>"Slow," she murmured, eyes half-lidded and dark with heat. "I want to feel you. All of you. After everything... after how long it’s been."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened on her shirt. "Rio..." Agatha was surprised by her own voice. That tone, that need, she had never felt that for anyone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, brushing the tip of her nose against Agatha’s cheek, her voice velvet and steel. "Let me. Don’t rush this. You’ve been <em>surviving</em>. I want you to feel alive."</p><p> </p><p>The words pierced through her. Agatha’s throat bobbed with a swallow, her heart hammering against her ribs. Her skin felt too hot and too cold at once. Her senses sharpened — the scratch of Rio’s collar beneath her palms, the subtle tremble in her own legs, the wetness.</p><p>Rio leaned in again, but this time, she didn’t go for her lips. Instead, her mouth brushed along the line of Agatha’s jaw, barely a whisper of touch. A breath. A promise.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, and she tilted her head back without thinking, granting access without a word. Rio’s lips ghosted over the shell of her ear, the hollow beneath it, then lower — every press feather-light but precise, like a map she’d traced before and never forgotten.</p><p>Her mouth settled once more on Agatha’s neck, just over the spot she’d claimed earlier, but this time there was no bite. Just warmth. Intention. She kissed there gently, and again, slower. She was taking her time — savoring, not staking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers slid up into Rio’s hair, threading through those dark waves with slow reverence. “You're doing it again,” she breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her head, their foreheads touching, her gaze heavy and unreadable. “Doing what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Making me stop thinking”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, not the usual smirk, but something smaller. Quieter. “Good,” she whispered. “It’s about time.”</p><p> </p><p>She had Agatha in her arms again — warm, breathless, surrendering. After lifetimes spent watching her burn behind walls of control and silence, having her like this, pliant and open, was a kind of sacred violence. She slowed the kiss, guiding Agatha's mouth with hers, savoring the taste of wine on her lips, the sharp little gasps that escaped each time their rhythm changed.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio…”, Agatha's voice came out as a whisper that was almost impossible to hear.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slid beneath the hem of Agatha's shirt, not greedy but reverent, skimming the soft skin just above her hipbones. The shiver that answered her touch made Rio smile against Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>"You feel the same," she whispered between kisses, her voice low and rasped with restraint. Her breath was warm against Agatha's jaw as she moved her mouth along the curve of her throat, tasting her slowly, deliberately. “<em>My Agatha</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands gripped the back of Rio's shirt, desperate and unsure. Her breath came in shaky exhales, her pulse a frantic rhythm against Rio's lips. "Rio, <em>baby</em>," she breathed, half warning, half plea. Her voice trembled with need and the terror of losing herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hushed her gently, pressing her forehead against Agatha’s, her thumbs stroking slow circles on her waist. "I won’t break you, mi amor," she murmured. "You can give in. Just this once. Let me feel you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. Every inch of her was on fire, and Rio wasn’t even trying to consume her — she was unraveling her. Undoing her with every glance, every whisper. And gods, it had been so long since someone touched her like she mattered. Since she wanted to be touched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio drew back just enough to see her. Hair messy, disheveled, his blue eyes were now dark due to the dilated pupil, red lips, swollen from the kiss, red face and neck, marks on the neck, frantic breathing… “So beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>Her dark eyes were heavy-lidded, but focused. Commanding. Her fingers moved with slow purpose, unbuttoning the first clasp of Agatha’s pajama top. Then the next. Then another. Not with hunger, but with ceremony, like unwrapping something sacred. Her gaze never left Agatha's face, watching every breath, every flinch, every flutter.</p><p> </p><p>"Still with me, amor?" she asked, voice like velvet, with the faintest edge of dominance threading through it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, unable to find her voice, but her body answered for her. She leaned in, burying her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, inhaling her deeply. Pine, earth, and something darker — something ancient.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Good girl</em>," Rio whispered, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha's ear. Her hands cradled her gently, reverently, like holding something both powerful and breakable. “My good Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha trembled. The heat spreading between her legs. <em>How could two words make her feel like that? </em></p><p> </p><p>The room was thick with heat and silence, only broken by the steady rhythm of their breathing, the soft rustle of fabric. Rio lowered them both onto the bed, slowly, never once letting her go. She didn’t take — not yet. She explored. Memorized. Worshipped. Agatha's hands wandered up Rio's spine, fingers threading into her hair, tugging lightly, not in command, but in silent desperation.</p><p> </p><p>"I remember this," Rio murmured into the hollow beneath her collarbone. "You always made me beg first. You were a crazy control freak."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a soft, helpless sound. "I’m not making you beg, am I?"</p><p> </p><p>“Not this time.” Rio lifted her head, lips parted, eyes burning. </p><p> </p><p>And in the stillness that followed — as the world outside held its breath — Agatha realized, maybe for the first time in this life, that Rio wasn’t just a haunting or a disruption. She was the only thing that had ever made her feel whole.</p><p>Rio's breath was steady, warm against Agatha's cheek as she hovered close, her fingers gently brushing the hem of the professor's shirt. The fabric was soft between her fingers, but not as soft as Agatha’s skin beneath it. Her movements slowed, reverent, deliberate — as though she were touching something sacred. Not because she thought Agatha was fragile, but because the moment was.</p><p> </p><p>"May I?" Rio's voice was a whisper, a tremor of restraint running just under the edge of her control. Her gaze stayed locked with Agatha's, and though her tone was steady, there was a deep hunger behind her eyes. One that had waited lifetimes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, lips parted slightly, her breath uneven. Her body was humming with tension and anticipation, her heartbeat loud in her ears. The room around them faded into soft shadows. Only Rio's presence mattered now. The heat of her body. The scent of pine, rain, and the faintest trace of something wild and unnameable.</p><p>Rio eased Agatha’s bra up and over her head, each inch of revealed skin handled with a patience that bordered on reverence. She didn't rush. Her fingers mapped familiar territory like a pilgrim returning to holy ground after centuries in exile. Agatha's shoulders, the little freckles, she paused, her thumbs brushing along the slope of her collarbones. Her breath hitched, eyes softening.</p><p> </p><p>"It's like seeing you for the first time," Rio murmured, her voice thick with awe. "As if every life we lived before... I never really looked close enough."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivered, not from cold, but from the intensity of Rio's gaze. Her throat worked as she swallowed back the swirl of emotion. And when Rio reached for her slacks, she stilled.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait," Agatha said, her voice catching in her throat. Her eyes shimmered, glassy, her lashes wet. "Don’t treat me like something broken and fragile, Rio."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands froze, but her expression didn't shift into pity. It deepened, softened with a gravity that made Agatha feel like the center of the universe.</p><p> </p><p>"Why would I do that?" she whispered, her voice low, unshakable. "You're not broken. You survived. And I love you for that. I love you... entirely. And I take care of what I love, Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, pressing her lips gently to the wet trail beneath Agatha's eye. Not wiping it away. Honoring it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath trembled, her fingers reaching up to clutch lightly at Rio's wrist. Her voice was barely audible. "Then don’t stop."</p><p> </p><p>Rio guided her toward the bed with a quiet authority, every step backward paced and sure. She kissed Agatha slowly, deeply, letting it linger, letting her feel every ounce of restraint it took not to devour her all at once. She laid her back against the mattress like something precious but not delicate. A queen, a storm, a legacy she remembered from centuries ago.</p><p> </p><p>As Rio hovered over her, the weight of her gaze heavier than touch, she whispered, "You don’t have to be anything tonight. Not strong. Not composed. Just mine. Just you… please."</p><p> </p><p>The way she said it wasn’t possessive — it was devotion made into breath. Agatha reached up, cradling the back of Rio’s neck as their foreheads met, her voice breaking in a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>"Then be careful with me... but don’t hold back." Agatha placed a soft kiss on Rio's cheek and inhaled her scent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands moved with reverence, not haste. Her fingers slid under the waistband of Agatha’s sleep shorts and paused, waiting — silently offering Agatha the chance to stop her. But Agatha didn’t move. Her chest rose and fell with uneven breaths, her eyes locked on Rio’s with a mix of defiance and surrender. Rio took her time. She peeled the fabric away with a slowness that made Agatha tremble, easing it down her thighs, past her knees, until it fell into a forgotten pool at her feet. The cool air kissed bare skin, but the heat pulsing between them was unmistakable.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck” Rio said feeling her whole body shiver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laid back at Rio’s unspoken direction, her body sinking into the mattress, her head tilting slightly to the side in vulnerability she rarely let anyone witness. The soft rustle of sheets, the faint scent of wine and pine lingering in the air, the warmth of Rio’s palm pressing against her thigh — everything was heightened. Every sense alive.</p><p>Rio leaned over her, brushing her lips across Agatha’s collarbone, slow and deliberate. Her tongue flicked gently over the delicate skin before her mouth descended lower. She kissed one breast, worshipping the curve with a gentleness that betrayed the raw hunger in her eyes. Marking with her tongue every piece of exposed skin on that breast. Her look was of someone who had never breastfed even once in her life. Her hand cupped the other, thumb brushing across the nipple until it pebbled under her touch. When her lips closed around the opposite one, Agatha gasped, the sound helpless and involuntary.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck! Rio!” Agatha's hips instinctively rose, seeking friction against Rio's ass as she sat on top of her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>God, when did she become so needy, so desperate for contact?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"So responsive," Rio murmured against her skin, her voice soaked in satisfaction. She circled her tongue again, savoring the way Agatha arched into her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her nipple a light bite, making Agatha arch her back, then she soothed the burning sensation with her tongue in circular motions. The other hand squeezed Agatha's breast, moving up and down her torso, scratching the skin with her fingernail. Her hips slowly rolled over Agatha, moving back and forth, rubbing against Agatha's belly. Teasing her, taking away her ability to reason. Moaning sinfully, sighing, purring against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Shiit!” Agatha threw her head back. One of her hands found Rio's waist, guiding her at the pace she wanted to see Rio grind on her. The other hand squeezed Rio's breast still covered by the oversized shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel the heat dripping from her pussy. <em>Hot, wet, and irritating</em>. She wanted relief. She needed relief. She was sure she could cum without Rio touching her, just grinding like a sin on top of her. Moaning as he sucked her breast and left marks all over her torso.</p><p>Then, without fanfare, Rio slid her hand lower, slow but sure, until her fingers rested against where Agatha ached for her. Rio couldn't hold back the moan that left her as she soaked her fingers in Agatha's arousal. Hot and pulsing.</p><p> </p><p>She watched her lover’s face, searching for resistance — and found only parted lips and heavy, needful breath. “You never let me down, my love. You're so ready for me.”</p><p> </p><p>She pressed two fingers inside, and Agatha’s body bowed in a silent cry, her hand flying to grip the sheet beside her. The sound that escaped her was dangerously loud.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clamped her free hand gently over Agatha’s mouth, her tone low and commanding, but still edged with affection. "Not so loud, my love. Let’s spare our children the soundtrack."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes fluttered open, glassy with emotion, her thoughts spinning. Our children. Not just hers. Theirs. Created through something she couldn’t explain but felt to her bones. Love. Maybe that was the only explanation that mattered. Her body pulsed with more than arousal. It was trust. Pain. <em>Love</em>. Memories she couldn’t name but knew Rio had carried through lifetimes.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Please!” she whispered, voice cracked with need and emotion. “More, I need more, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio withdrew her hand, slow, as if savoring the feel of her skin. Agatha moaned in frustration as the fingers pulled painfully slowly out of her. </p><p> </p><p>Then she leaned down, placing a kiss over Agatha’s stomach, reverent. "Don’t be so impatient," she said, sliding lower. "I’ve been starving for centuries. Let me savor this."</p><p> </p><p>“Bitch,” Agatha growled between clenched teeth, breathless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled darkly, voice silken and smug. “For you, it’s ‘<em>my love</em>.’ We’ll work on that, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth found Agatha’s inner thigh next, placing a kiss so soft it made her shiver. Then another, slower. And then a small bite — not to hurt, but to remind. Who she was. What she was.</p><p> </p><p>“Open them for me, baby,” she whispered, voice low and coaxing, each word sliding under Agatha’s skin like silk and smoke. “Let me see you. If you're ready for me.”</p><p> </p><p>The room cloaked in the hush of midnight, save for the occasional creak of the old wooden floor and the distant, rhythmic tick of the clock on the wall. The air between them was warm, humid with shared breath and rising desire. Her skin tingled with the lingering trail of Rio's fingers, with the taste of her name still echoing in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Rio remained fully clothed, a fact that made Agatha feel more exposed, more vulnerable. But it was more than that. <em>It was intentional. It was power.</em></p><p> </p><p>When Rio dipped between her thighs, she didn’t speak. She didn’t have to. Her mouth, her hands, her devotion did all the talking. The way she moved was reverent — slow, deliberate, almost sacred. Like rediscovering something she had lost in another life. Agatha’s back arched the moment she felt it — the hot press of Rio’s mouth, the softness of lips against the most intimate part of her. She gasped, fingers flying to the sheets, then to Rio’s hair, burying deep in those dark, untamed curls as if grounding herself in reality.</p><p>Rio slid her tongue from the beginning of Agatha's entrance to her clitoris, where she gave a suck, which made Agatha lift her hips off the bed and bite her own arm to stop the loud noise from coming out. Rio held Agatha's waist, but without using her arms... With a thin, green vine that appeared out of nowhere and hugged her waist, pulling her down. The cold of the vine made Agatha's skin crawl, the knowledge that Rio could immobilize her without using her hands didn't make her afraid, it made her more hot and needy.</p><p>Rio entered Agatha using her tongue. Agatha's arousal dripped down Rio's chin. She drank as if she were dying of thirst. And then she went in and out a few times with her tongue, then moving up and sucking on her clitoris.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god!” Agatha covered her eyes with the back of her arm. "Fuck, fuck!!”</p><p> </p><p>The sensation was too much and not enough. Her thighs instinctively started to close, but Rio’s hands were firm, holding her open, gently but with absolute authority. A low sound escaped Rio’s throat, deep and satisfied, and it vibrated against Agatha’s skin like a current.</p><p>Agatha’s breath came in sharp stutters. She bit her lip, trying to hold back the sounds clawing their way out of her chest. Her hips bucked slightly, and Rio answered not with words but with pressure — her mouth working in tandem with her fingers now, slow strokes inside that made Agatha cry out before she could stop herself.</p><p>Rio started with slow thrusts, following the suction, but without warning she moved quickly, moving in and out, curling her fingers towards the spot inside Agatha, while the other hand squeezed a breast and played with rotating the nipple between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” A strong hand reached up, covering her mouth, a silent reminder. Not too loud. The children.</p><p> </p><p>“Shhh! Behave or I'll put that loud little mouth of yours to good use.” Rio raised her face only to command Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The moment her lips brushed against Rio’s palm, something snapped inside her. She moaned into that hand, needy, desperate, trembling. Her fingers fisted in Rio’s hair and tugged hard. Rio groaned in response — a low, guttural sound that only made the heat in Agatha’s belly tighten further.</p><p>Her body twisted, restless under the worship, overwhelmed by the tenderness and hunger of it. Rio didn’t stop. She didn’t rush. Her rhythm was maddening, purposeful, designed to push Agatha higher but never let her fall. Every flick of Rio’s tongue was matched by the curl of her fingers. Every sigh that escaped Agatha’s mouth was met with a deeper stroke, a firmer hold, a softer kiss.</p><p>Agatha’s world narrowed to Rio’s mouth, Rio’s fingers, the steady whisper of her breath against flushed skin, and the sound of her own heart, beating out a rhythm of surrender. Her chest heaved, her muscles trembled, and her voice finally broke through her restraint.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio... please," she whimpered, voice broken and raw. “More”</p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio said nothing. But her hands answered. Her mouth deepened. And Agatha could feel it — the slow, undeniable build toward something she could no longer hold back from. She wasn’t there yet. But she was close. <em>So close. Just a little more…</em></p><p>Rio felt it, Agatha’s breath catching, her thighs trembling beneath her touch, the muscles of her body tightening like a bow ready to snap. The way Agatha gripped the sheets, the way her head tilted back and her lips parted, soft and desperate, it was all the signal Rio needed. Rio knew that body. Every inch of it had once been hers. And nothing had changed. Agatha was still hers. She knew that in a little while longer Agatha would come completely in her hand, on her face and in the bed.</p><p>She moved slowly up Agatha’s body, not breaking rhythm, her fingers still moving inside her with precise, reverent control. But her mouth found Agatha’s — tasting, claiming. Her lips were slick with Agatha’s arousal, and she made no attempt to hide it.</p><p> </p><p>“Your taste,” Rio whispered against her mouth, voice low and velvet-smooth. “Feel it on me.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned into the kiss, the sound raw and unfiltered. She could taste herself on Rio’s lips — salted warmth and something she couldn't name — and the intimacy of it hit her harder than she was ready for. Her body arched, instinctively seeking more, overwhelmed by the vulnerability of it all.</p><p>Rio didn’t say another word. She let her hands speak now, her fingers curving just right, her palm steady against Agatha’s hip. She knew every reaction — every tremor, every breathless whimper — and she worshiped them in silence. Agatha tried to close her legs, the intensity too much, too fast. But Rio summoned the vine again, which clung to Agatha's legs, keeping them apart. With a single look, she made her command clear:</p><p> </p><p><em>Don’t</em>.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha reached down, fingers tangling in Rio’s hair in a desperate pull, Rio let out a quiet, muffled sound — half pleasure, half warning. Her mouth didn’t leave Agatha’s skin, but her smirk was unmistakable, even through the heat.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>She wanted her like this. Unraveled. Beautiful. <strong>Hers</strong>.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The pace of her fingers grew steadier, deliberate. The sound of Agatha’s breath grew ragged, her cries no longer restrained. Rio watched her, eyes dark and unwavering, needing to see her fall apart. She pressed her forehead to Agatha’s temple, lips brushing against the edge of her cheek as she whispered nothing — just warmth, just presence.</p><p>Rio felt Agatha's walls clamp down on her fingers, with an absurd force, almost breaking if she could. She was ready. She was ready to cum, grinding on her fingers, hot and tight. Rio missed feeling and seeing this so much. The most pleasurable sin in the world was called Agatha Harkness. And when she felt Agatha teetering on that last edge, her back arching off the mattress, Rio reached up, exposed her own throat, and held it just close enough.</p><p> </p><p><em>A silent offering</em>. Agatha understood.</p><p> </p><p>She bit down, muffling the scream that tore from her chest, her entire body locking around Rio’s hand. The world blurred — light and shadow, heat and tremor — and she shattered, not just from pleasure but from years of restraint finally releasing into something real. Something that asked for nothing. Demanded nothing.</p><p>Rio held her through it. Slow, grounded strokes. Whispered praise. A kiss to her temple. Her body moving gently with Agatha’s until the shaking stopped.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it,” Rio murmured, brushing sweat-damp hair from Agatha’s face. “Come back to me, baby. You were perfect. Like always… let it go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t speak. Her body was limp, her throat raw, her skin burning and cold all at once. She whimpered softly as Rio kissed her again, her lips like silk on overheated flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t speak,” Rio whispered. “Just breathe. I’ll take care of you.”</p><p> </p><p>She pulled away slowly, her movements gentle, never rushed. A warm cloth appeared in her hand, conjured from the ether like it was nothing. She wiped Agatha with care — between her legs, over her stomach, across her chest. Not to erase, but to soothe. To honor.</p><p>The soaked blanket beneath her disappeared with a whisper of sound, replaced by soft, cool linen. Rio adjusted the pillows, then brushed a kiss over Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to turn on the AC. If you get cold, just say the word.”</p><p> </p><p>She snapped her fingers once — subtle magic — and the hum of the air conditioner filled the room. Then, conjuring a bottle of water, she handed it to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Here. It’s at the perfect temperature.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took it with shaking fingers, drinking slowly, her throat parched. She stared at Rio, still fully dressed, hair tousled, cheeks flushed from devotion, not need.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to stand again, but Agatha’s voice, hoarse and quiet, stopped her. “Rio... <em>baby</em>... just lie here with me. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, surprised by the softness in Agatha’s tone. “You want me to stay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, managing a smirk despite the exhaustion. “If you keep looking like a lost puppy, maybe not.”</p><p> </p><p>That earned a grin. Rio kicked off her shoes and slid into bed, careful as ever. Agatha reached for her instinctively, curling into her side, her head resting on Rio’s chest. The thump of Rio’s heart under her cheek was steady, grounding.</p><p>Rio pulled the blanket over them both, one arm wrapped securely around Agatha’s shoulders, her fingers stroking lazy circles into her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Rio whispered again, barely audible over the sound of the AC and the quiet hum of the world slowing down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond with words. She didn’t have to. Her body, soft against Rio’s, said enough.</p><hr/><p>The room was dim, illuminated only by the soft glow of moonlight bleeding through the sheer curtains. Silver light pooled across the tangled sheets, casting long shadows over the two women lying in the quiet aftermath of something that had shifted the ground between them.</p><p>Agatha lay on her side, her back half-turned to Rio, legs curled beneath the messy sheets. Her body was still flushed, skin warm, lips faintly swollen from kisses that had spoken truths she hadn’t yet found words for. Her breath had slowed, but her mind buzzed, crowded with echoes she couldn’t yet name. Beside her, Rio sprawled on her back, one arm lazily draped across her forehead, the other resting palm-up on the mattress between them. Her dark eyes, half-lidded, glittered with mischief as she smirked up at the ceiling, basking in the silence like a cat in the sun.</p><p> </p><p>"You know," Rio said, her voice breaking the stillness, husky and lazy from sleep and sex, "for someone who insists she doesn't like me, you certainly seemed to enjoy yourself."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She groaned, grabbed a pillow and blindly flung it in Rio's direction without looking. “Can you stop ruining every peaceful moment with your insufferable personality?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught it midair without so much as lifting her head. “Never. It’s part of my charm.”</p><p> </p><p>A reluctant, crooked smile tugged at Agatha’s lips, even as she rolled her eyes. She turned onto her back, letting the air cool her flushed skin. The sheets tangled between her legs felt too warm, too real. The scent of Rio still clung to her skin, layered with the lingering traces of wine and sweat and something older, something that lived in her bones.</p><p>They spoke casually after that — idle words about the children, mundane moments, Nick’s obsession with puzzles, Nicole’s sarcasm, the idiotic shows Rio insisted on watching just to see Agatha roll her eyes. And then—</p><p> </p><p><em>Pain. Sudden, stabbing, bright</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, her fingers flying to her temple as a wave of heat and pressure surged through her skull. She clutched the sheets, her nails curling into the fabric as the world tilted sideways. And then it came — a memory, not a dream, not a fantasy. A memory. It hit her like a knife slid clean between the ribs.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Let him live! Please, my love</em>." Her voice, but not this voice. Younger. Desperate. Choked by grief.</p><p> </p><p>She saw herself on her knees, in robes soaked with blood and ash, hands curled around Rio's sleeves. Tears streamed down her face, and Rio, a different Rio, the same eyes — looked down at her with something broken in her gaze.</p><p> </p><p><em>Nick</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, whispering through the storm in a voice that cracked as it shattered, <em>“I can only give you time.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha in the memory sobbed, clinging to her. “<em>How much time?”  </em>But Rio was already fading.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on air as she snapped back into her body, her chest heaving. Tears streaked down her cheeks before she realized she was crying. Her fists twisted the sheets, pulling them taut as nausea curled deep in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>!” Rio’s voice, real this time, full of alarm. The mattress shifted under her as Rio reached for her, hands warm and grounding on her arms. “Agatha, talk to me. What’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned, and her voice broke on a whisper: “You took him from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze. The words landed like a blade. Her face changed instantly, her playful expression vanishing, replaced with horror. Her hands trembled against Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No</em>,” she whispered, almost to herself. “No. <em>Not that one</em>. Not that memory. <em>Please, my love</em>, <em>no</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed upright, her body shaking with the weight of the truth. “You didn’t give <em>me</em> a choice. You took him from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stumbled back like she'd been struck, her face hollowing out.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I</em> didn’t have a choice,” she said, her voice cracking, rough with a grief she couldn’t hide. “I didn’t want to do it. <em>Agatha, please</em>. You have to believe me. I didn’t want to take him. I couldn’t stop it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood, her hands gripping the sheets like lifelines. Her breath came in harsh gasps. “You let him die. You let Nick die.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head violently, her composure crumbling. “I fought for him. I fought for you. But the rules, they were older than both of us. I can't control it.” Her voice fell to a whisper, thick with old sorrow. “You think I wanted to take him from you?”</p><p> </p><p>She turned away, her arms wrapped tight around herself, like holding in the scream threatening to rip from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Rio whispered, broken. “Please <em>don’t hate me again</em>. I can’t go through that again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her instinctively. “Rio—”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio recoiled. “No,” she said, voice hollow. “I can’t stay here. I can’t—”</p><p> </p><p>She bolted. One moment she was there, the next her feet were hitting the hardwood, the sound harsh and sudden in the night-silent house. The air she left behind was cold, almost scorched with magic.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>!” Agatha cried, stumbling after her.</p><p> </p><p>She ran into the hallway, heart slamming in her chest, but the space was empty. No footsteps. No sound. No trace.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio was gone</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped in the middle of the hallway, her chest rising and falling as the weight of the memory, the argument, and the loss threatened to crush her. For the first time in weeks, the house felt unbearably empty, even with her children sleeping just a few doors away.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned against the wall, her knees threatening to give out as tears slipped silently down her face. “What have I done?” she whispered to herself.</p><p> </p><p>But no answer came. Only the suffocating silence of a love fractured once again by the ghosts of their past.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom?” Nicole’s sleepy voice broke the silence, her small frame leaning against the doorway as she rubbed her eyes. “What’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, startled, struggling to find her words. “I...”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole stepped closer, her brow furrowed with concern. “What did you remember? Let’s go to the kitchen. I’ll make you some tea, and you can tell me, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Nicole took her mother’s hand, gently leading her to the kitchen. Agatha followed in a daze, her thoughts still tangled in the vivid memory that had resurfaced.</p><p>As Nicole busied herself making tea, her quiet movements grounding the moment, Agatha began to speak, her voice trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“I was giving birth,” she started, her fingers clutching the edge of the counter. “Leaning against a tree, terrified, in so much pain, and... alone. Completely alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole paused, listening intently but letting her mother continue.</p><p> </p><p>“And then I saw her,” Agatha said, her throat tightening. “Rio. She was standing in the distance, holding a flower in her hand. I remember feeling so much fear, so much anger. I wanted her to go away. I didn’t want her there because... because her being there meant the baby, meant Nick, was going to die.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole carefully placed a mug of tea in front of her mother, sitting down across the table. “And?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, tears pricking at her eyes. “She gave me time,” she whispered. “Time to hold him. To love him. But even then, when the time was over, I hated her. I hated her for taking the only person I had left in that life. And when I remembered that tonight, I felt that hatred all over again. I used it against her, Nicole, and it hurt her. I know it did.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole sipped her tea, her expression thoughtful. “Did you apologize?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her hands trembling slightly as she held the mug. “She didn’t give me a chance. She left before I could. And, Nicky... I’ve never seen her like that before. She was—” Her voice broke. “She was desperate.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole tilted her head, a small, knowing smile playing on her lips. “You have seen her like that before, Mom. You just don’t remember yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, confused. “What do you mean? How do you know about all of this?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole leaned back in her chair, her expression calm. “She told just enough” she said simply. “She used to tell me stories when I was still inside you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a shaky laugh, disbelief flickering in her eyes. “She told you stories? Inside me? Really?”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole nodded seriously, her tone unwavering. “She’s a great storyteller. And, for the record, she’s a good mom too.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened as she looked down at her tea, her face flushing. “She’s not—”</p><p> </p><p>“She is,” Nicole interrupted gently, smiling softly. “She’s a good mom. And she’s a <em>good wife</em>, too.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face turned crimson as she averted her gaze. “Nicole, stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicole chuckled, taking another sip of her tea. “Don’t worry, Mom. She’ll come back. She always does. Like she loves to remind you, she’s stuck with you.”</p><p> </p><p>"She's hiding things from me, Nicky... Did you see the way she looked at that police officer today?"</p><p> </p><p>"She has her reasons, Mom. She was protecting us." Nicky touched his mother's hand, trying to calm her down.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you know what she is, Nicole?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicole paused, looking straight to her mother eyes and Agatha could swear that her eyes changed. "Do you?"</p>

<p>Rio didn't know how much time had passed for Agatha since she'd fled.</p><p>The memory — <em>that damn memory</em> — gnawed at her, hollowing out a space inside her chest that even her cosmic power couldn't fill. It hurt. It burned. And worst of all, it scared her.</p><p><em>Goddamn it</em>, she thought bitterly. <em>She was Death</em>. She was the <em>fucking Death.</em> A cosmic entity, omnipresent, omniscient, unstoppable. No creature, no god, no time-worn king could escape her. And yet here she was — curled in the corner of her own house in the Death Realm — feeling small. Feeling cold. Feeling something that tasted dangerously close to grief.</p><p>Her nails were bitten to the quick, chewed away in her endless cycle of self-recrimination. They had already grown back — small obsidian points — but still she sat there, unmoving, staring into nothing.</p><p>Tiny black flowers had bloomed beneath her bare feet, curling through the warped floorboards, fed by her spiraling emotions. The scent of them was rich, almost sweet, cloying in the still, damp air. Outside, the wind howled against the rickety walls of the little cabin, rattling the windows so fiercely they sounded like sobs.</p><p>It had been so long since she'd come back here, her own home felt alien. Like a haunted house abandoned by time.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio hated haunted houses. They reminded her of ghosts — and there was nothing in existence she despised more than ghosts. <em>Ghosts meant regrets. Ghosts meant unfinished business. </em></p><p> </p><p>And she had so, so many.</p><p> </p><p>The Death Realm itself, usually a lush, eerie paradise of overgrown vines and ageless creatures, now looked sickly.</p><p> </p><p>The green-black mist hung heavier than normal. The plants drooped, shriveled, pressing against the broken glass. Even the creatures lurking outside — things from ancient worlds, prehistoric beasts, spirits too stubborn to pass on — seemed to slink in the shadows, hiding from the weight of her despair.</p><p>The door creaked — <em>no, clicked</em> — delicately open, like it refused to offend the silence inside.</p><p> </p><p>And into the gloom stepped a figure so luminous it almost hurt to look at her. <em>Eva</em>… or <em>Life</em>, your middle twin sister of triplets. Rio's twin. Older by mere seconds. Yet she always made it seem like centuries.</p><p>Where the room was dark, moldy, and desolate, Eva strode in like a burst of gold — her heels clicking smartly against the rotting floorboards, scattering black petals wherever she stepped. She wore a dress spun from starlight itself, golden and extravagant, clinging to her statuesque figure with effortless grace.</p><p>Her long, silver-white hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, almost glowing in the dimness. Her lips were curved in that same familiar smirk that always made Rio want to punch something — and maybe also cry.</p><p> </p><p>She looked like a goddess or a very expensive cosplay model from a cheesy video game. Rio didn’t lift her head. She barely blinked.</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s voice, rich and melodic, carried easily through the thick, dead air. “Well, this place has certainly seen better days. Honestly, Rio, it’s giving... late-stage Plague Era realness. But for that we had reasons… <em>now</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Her heels crunched over the vines as she stalked closer, her presence filling the cabin with an unsettling light.</p><p> </p><p>Rio barely muttered, voice dead. “Go fuck yourself, Eva. I'm not in the mood for you and I don't have time.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva tsked loudly, the sound somehow both affectionate and insufferable.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, darling, what else do we have but <em>time</em>? It's practically our third sibling.” She spun on her heel theatrically, letting her dress flare around her like a sunburst. “Now, tell me... what did you do?”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio finally lifted her head. Her black hair clung to her cheeks, her black eyes duller than usual. There were bruises under her eyes — emotional bruises, soul-deep.</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s grin widened, sharp as a blade and twice as dangerous. “Ohhh, let me guess. Starts with an ‘A’, ends with ‘-gatha’?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's jaw clenched.</p><p> </p><p>Eva took a delicate step closer, crouching in front of her like a cat stalking wounded prey. “You’re miserable. And that’s saying something, considering you’re always this close to existential misery. But today? Today’s a new record, little sister. <em>Bravo</em>.” She clapped once, slow and mocking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand twitched like she might actually punch her. I<em> want to punch her so badly</em>… Instead, she dug her fingers into the flowers blooming underfoot, crushing the petals in her palm, staining her skin black.</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s smirk faltered slightly at the sight. “What happened, Rio? Talk to me. ” she asked, softer now. “What did she remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard, the lump in her throat so tight it hurt. “It wasn’t me, I didn't do it.,” she whispered, voice raw, almost childish in its brokenness. “I didn’t want her to remember. Not yet. <em>Not that</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s head tilted, hair sliding forward like liquid metal. “But she did,” she said, almost gently. “Didn’t she?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, a single, miserable jerk of her chin. The storm outside raged louder. The windows trembled. Eva reached out, brushing a thumb against Rio’s cheek, almost motherly.</p><p> </p><p>“My poor little Death,” she murmured. “You can’t control everything, you know. Not even her heart. Especially not her memories. I've told that, baby sis, so many times.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shivered under her touch. She hated how right Eva was. Hated it with everything she had left. And yet, for the first time in longer than she could remember, Rio didn’t shove her sister’s hand away. She just sat there, broken and silent, while the storm howled around them.</p><p> </p><p>"I tried to stay away... I swear," Rio whispered, voice shaking, the weight of her confession heavy between them. Her hands trembled slightly as she buried them in the fabric of her black jeans. "But I can't, Eva. You—you, of all our siblings, you understand... <em>Reia</em>—"</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s face darkened slightly. Her bright golden glow dimmed, as if the very thought soured the air around them. She moved, the rustle of her starlight dress brushing softly against the rotting floor, and sat beside Rio with an elegance so natural it made the dilapidated house feel even more haunted.</p><p> </p><p>"We're not here to talk about my <em>past</em>, sister," Eva cut her off, her voice as smooth and cold as polished marble. "We’re here to talk about your <em>present</em>."</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look at Rio when she spoke. She couldn’t. Because no matter how poised Eva appeared, deep inside, she hated this conversation. Hated hurting her baby sister more than anything. Of all of them — Death, Life, Fate, Time — Rio was the most human. The only one who had ever managed to revive her own heart. <em>For love</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Eva inhaled slowly, steadying herself. Her crystal heels clicked faintly against the warped wood as she shifted. "Fate and I made it clear, Rio," she continued. "No matter how much you love Agatha… your relationship with her is a risk. A danger. Not just to you. Not just to her. But to the balance of the universe itself."</p><p>Outside, the storm raged louder, the wind slicing against the shutters like knives. The scent of decay and wet earth saturated the air.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a dry, humorless laugh — sharp and broken. Black petals fell from her palms as she clenched her fists. "So the risk isn't <em>us</em>," she spat, "it’s <em>our creators</em>. Because if what you're saying is true, then it means for the first time since the dawn of the goddamn universe — since the birth of Space and Void — we’re not playing by their stupid, fucking rules anymore!"</p><p> </p><p>Her voice cracked under the weight of her fury, reverberating off the broken walls.</p><p> </p><p>Eva remained silent, her golden lashes lowered. "The rules exist for a reason, Rio," she said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>"Stupid fucking reasons, Eva!" Rio exploded, springing to her feet.</p><p> </p><p>The floor groaned under her bare soles. Dark vines coiled higher up the walls like angry serpents.</p><p> </p><p>"Why can’t I have her?" Rio demanded, her voice breaking into a hoarse cry. "<em>Why can’t I love her</em>? If love is forbidden, why was I given the <em>capacity to love her?</em> Why wake me up with this <em>beating thing</em> in my chest just to punish me for feeling it?"</p><p> </p><p>Her chest heaved violently. Her arms wrapped around herself, trying to contain the raging tide boiling inside. Tears welled in her eyes — fat, burning tears that blurred the edges of the golden glow her sister radiated. Rio didn't know how to cry properly. She didn't know how to distinguish rage from sorrow, or fear from grief.</p><p>All she knew was that in that moment — <em>She felt everything.</em></p><p> </p><p>"I don't know, baby sis," Eva finally said, standing so gracefully it was almost like she floated.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice, for once, was stripped of all sarcasm, all games.</p><p> </p><p>"I don’t make the rules," she whispered, stepping closer. "I don't know the limits of what we are. None of us do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips trembled with unshed rage. Eva’s eyes softened. She reached out, brushing a silver strand of hair from Rio’s damp forehead.</p><p> </p><p>"I only know what Fate told me. And I’m the only one you still listen to."</p><p> </p><p>Rio barked a bitter laugh, wiping her face roughly with the back of her hand. "Tell Dália to go fuck herself," she snapped. "Tell her to shove her '<em>fate</em>' right up her self-righteous, <em>omniscient ass</em>!"</p><p> </p><p>Her powers pulsed outward again. The vines on the floor creaked and twisted violently. The walls trembled.</p><p> </p><p>Eva sighed, folding her arms elegantly under her chest, the picture of patience. "You told Agatha yet?" she asked, voice even. "Have you shown her everything?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s whole body sagged, the fight bleeding out of her all at once. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head miserably. "No," she rasped. "She… she’s remembering it on her own."</p><p> </p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s lips curved into a slow, sad smile. "Good," she said softly. "That's better. It means she’ll see it from your side. She'll understand the truth if she finds it herself."</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward, closing the last inches between them, and pressed a hand against Rio’s trembling shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"Now breathe, little one," she murmured. "Because your emotions? They're wrecking this place."</p><p> </p><p>At first, Rio didn't understand, but when she looked — <em>really looked</em> — she saw.</p><p> </p><p>Thick, black vines bristling with jagged thorns had erupted all around the room. Snaking up the beams. Splitting the cracked windows. Creatures from ancient, forgotten worlds cowered in the shadows, hissing at her grief made manifest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped sharply. Her hands flew to her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Eva smiled faintly, almost proudly. "See?" she whispered. "You're powerful when you love. <em>Cute</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, focusing inward, gathering the shards of herself that had scattered. She inhaled deep — pulling the cold, heavy air into her burning lungs. And slowly — inch by inch — the vines withered. The black flowers curled into themselves. The angry mist thinned.</p><p>By the time Rio opened her eyes again, the house was still ruined — but no longer hostile. Only heartbreak remained, hanging in the silence like the fading echo of a scream.</p><p> </p><p>"Look, I didn’t just come here for you or Agatha," Eva said, voice dropping lower, threading through the heavy, crackling air. Her golden glow flickered faintly as she moved to lean against the battered window frame. "You know damn well I don't give a shit about who you love. I’m not here to judge you."</p><p> </p><p>She crossed her arms, one delicate brow arching sharply.</p><p> </p><p>"I’m here for Ralph, Rio," she said, firmer. "We need to find him — find his soul — before he does something <em>stupid</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed under her breath, shifting her weight, black vines still slithering uneasily under her bare feet. "I don't give a <em>fuck</em> about him," she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>You should</em>." Eva’s tone sharpened, cutting through the gloom like a blade. The room seemed to contract around them, thickening. "I know you triggered his memories," Eva continued, every word measured, "woke them all up at once — and he broke. Why you did it, I still don’t know. <em>Yet</em>. But that’s not the focus of my question right now."</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer, heels clicking with merciless precision.</p><p> </p><p>"Your time to fix this is running out."</p><p> </p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, arms folding defensively across her chest. "What are you talking about?"</p><p> </p><p>Eva's expression hardened, the glimmer in her golden eyes fading into something almost mournful. "Ralph was going to kill Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>The words hit like a slap, making Rio stiffen visibly, her mouth parting in silent shock. Eva didn’t stop. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>"The food poisoning?" she said coldly. "It wasn’t some bad chicken salad, Rio. It was an attempted poisoning. Ralph remembered everything. He wanted revenge. He wanted her dead."</p><p> </p><p>The old wood under Rio’s feet groaned as her powers flared without her permission, a low rumble vibrating through the house.</p><p> </p><p>"And I—" Eva pressed a hand to her own chest, voice breaking just slightly, "I made him disappear before he could. I had to. And because he was so... Broken, I can't find his soul anymore. All his lives, all the suffering in his soul, especially the one under Agatha's hands, broke him. Because if Agatha died in your arms..." she stepped closer, grabbing Rio's chin in a firm grip, forcing her to look up, "you would’ve broken the only rule you <em>cannot break</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Her grip was firm, her fingers cold but grounding.</p><p> </p><p>"You would've <em>killed</em> him in retaliation," Eva whispered. "And you know what happens if you kill, Rio. You don’t <em>get</em> to come back from that."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s chest heaved as her mind spun. She knew Eva wasn’t lying. She could feel the truth crawling over her skin, thick and suffocating. "I would’ve torn him apart," Rio admitted, her voice hollow.</p><p> </p><p>"You still <em>might</em>," Eva said, letting go of her roughly. "If you don't find him before it's too late."</p><p> </p><p>Eva stepped back, crossing her arms tightly, as if trying to contain her own emotions.</p><p> </p><p>"Benny — Time — he told me Ralph is slipping. His time is fracturing. His mind is almost gone.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I'm Death</em>. I'll know when his time it's close.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not if he kills himself before his time. If he falls completely, if he snaps and dies by his own hand..." She turned slowly, golden dress dragging slightly across the rotted floor. "You will be the one who takes <em>responsibility</em> for his death, Rio. Not because you killed him — but because you were meant to guard the line. <em>And you failed</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio swore under her breath, her hands clawing through her hair. Her heart slammed painfully against her ribs — a sensation she hated.</p><p> </p><p>"<strong><em>Fuck</em></strong>!" she hissed, almost spitting the word. Her silver eyes burned hot with rage and guilt and fear. "Fucking hell!"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Fuck," Eva echoed, voice cold and merciless.  She stared at Rio, her lips a grim, sharp line. "Have you found Benito's hiding place yet?" Eva demanded. "Or are you still wandering around like a lovesick mortal?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio growled low in her throat, fists clenching at her sides. "The cop..." she muttered. "Daniels."</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s smile was quick and razor-sharp. "Smart little Reaper," she said. "We planted him inside the police force. It would be easier. Less obvious."</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted, rolling her eyes despite herself. "He looks like shit blonde."</p><p> </p><p>Eva actually laughed — a short, musical sound, brittle at the edges. "Desperate times, darling. Benny hated the look too. Said he felt like a sacrificial lamb on a bad soap opera set. But we had to make sure you wouldn’t smell a trap the moment you got near."</p><p> </p><p>The humor vanished from Rio’s face instantly, replaced with a cold, broken mask. "The last time you and your fucking plans came near my family," she said, voice low and venomous, "my son was born <em>dead</em>. My wife died in <em>my arms</em>."</p><p> </p><p>The air snapped with cold. The house seemed to shudder. Eva stood silent for a long moment, her golden lashes lowering. "I know," she said, so quietly Rio barely heard it over the roar of blood in her ears. "I know. <em>I'm sorry</em>"</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time, the great, shining embodiment of Life looked... <em>old. Tired. Haunted</em>.</p><p>But neither of them said anything more.</p><p>The wounds were too deep. The storm between them too vast.</p><p> </p><p>For now, they only had one path forward: <em><u>Find Ralph. Fix what had been broken.</u></em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Before Death herself had to pay the ultimate price</strong>.</p><hr/><p>The library was hollow with silence, the kind that pressed against skin and made every breath feel like a trespass. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, but most of the room was swallowed in shadows, books lining the shelves like silent witnesses to Agatha’s desperation. The air held the weight of dust, old ink, and something colder — something ancient.</p><p>Agatha sat at one of the long oak tables, hunched forward with elbows braced against its scratched surface. Her eyes were rimmed with exhaustion, the dark circles beneath them sinking deeper with each passing night. The Ouija board in front of her was worn and smooth, its letters faded from years of hands too curious for their own good. At its center, the planchette lay still, untouched by spirit or breeze. The seven-day candle burned low, the scent of wax and lavender clinging to the air like a whisper of false calm.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re stuck with me, Rio," she muttered, voice tight and low. "So stop playing hide and seek and show yourself already."</p><p> </p><p><em>Nothing</em>. Not a flicker of air. Not a single shift in energy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw and growled, dragging her hand down her face. “<em>Where the hell are you</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Two weeks. Two entire weeks without a trace. No flowers. No teasing smirks. No hovering shadow by the door, coffee in hand and mischief in her eyes. Agatha would never say it aloud, but the silence had become unbearable. Her bones ached for Rio’s presence. Her breath was wrong without it.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her fingers to the planchette. “<em>Hello, death</em>,” she whispered. “Get out of whatever limbo you’re sulking in and come to me… <strong>Death</strong>.”</p><p> </p><p>At first, there was only stillness. But then, a drop in temperature — subtle, then sudden. Like the room itself exhaled. The warmth leeched from her fingertips. The candle flickered violently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled. <em>No. It wasn’t Rio.</em> It couldn’t be. The cold in the room wasn’t her. It was suffocating, invasive. There was no rhythm to it, no teasing edge or quiet protectiveness.</p><p> </p><p><em>Something else had come</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The hair on the back of Agatha’s neck stood on end. Her fingers went rigid around the planchette. But just as her lungs began to seize with panic—</p><p> </p><p><em>Heat</em>. Blazing, furious, familiar. The candle flared. Outside, lightning split the sky despite its clear blue canvas, thunder rumbling a second later like an ancient snarl. Agatha’s head whipped around toward the shelves behind her — and there, cloaked in shadow, Rio stood.</p><p>Her death mantle clung to her body like ink made flesh. Her skin glowed pale in the candlelight, her face half-lit, half-devoured by darkness. Her eyes were voids, so black they swallowed the space around them.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I warned you</em>,” Rio said. Her voice wasn’t angry — it was deeper than that. <em>Disappointed</em>. It cracked through the room like thunder.</p><p> </p><p>Her fist was clenched tightly, as if holding a leash, and when Agatha followed the invisible line down, her stomach lurched. At Rio’s feet, something writhed. A soul — no, a specter — contorted in hatred, snarling and lashing in silent agony. Black veins ran along its translucent form, its face twisted in pure malice. A collar of gleaming thorns was wrapped around its neck, each movement pulling them deeper into its flesh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave the leash a tug. The entity howled soundlessly. Flames erupted from the collar, swallowing the form in a plume of smoke and ash.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could barely breathe. That wasn’t Rio. <em>That was Death.</em> And Death had come for more than just a warning.</p><p> </p><p>“Many times, it won’t be me who answers, Agatha.” Her voice was calm now, level, but under it burned something feral.</p><p> </p><p>“You gave me <em>no choice</em>!” Agatha snapped, rising to her feet. Her chair scraped backward against the marble floor. “<em>You left</em>! You didn’t answer! You gave me nothing but silence and ghosts and then you think you have the right to barge in here and scold me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled slowly, her eyes never leaving her. Then, without a word, she let go of the leash. The remnants of the tortured soul fell apart like paper turning to ash. The candle’s flame flickered, then extinguished with a breath of wind that wasn’t there.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio stepped forward. With every step, the transformation began. The deathly aura receded like a tide. The black of her cloak faded into the familiar leather jacket. Her eyes shifted — from abyssal void to dark amber. Softer. Quieter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest rose and fell like she’d run miles. “Where were you?” she whispered. “Purgatory? Hell? Limbo?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk was faint but there. “<em>The Realm of Death. My home</em>,” she said casually. “I was away too long. The place was a mess. Infernal weeds. Hell-beetles. Rotting timelines. You know how it is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed the distance, their noses nearly touching now. The smell of smoke and night-blooming flowers clung to her like second skin.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t lie, my love,” she whispered. Her voice was intimate now — velvet and heat, laced with dark amusement and something more dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out, slow and deliberate, and extinguished the candle with the pads of her fingers. Smoke curled upward like breath from parted lips. And then she stepped into Agatha’s space like she belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you disappear? Why didn’t you answer me when I called?” Agatha hissed between clenched teeth, her voice low and threatening, almost feral. Her fists were tight at her sides, trembling with the urge to lunge at Rio, to shake answers out of her, to make her feel what she'd been feeling in her absence — rage, confusion, a sick, gnawing grief. Her heart beat violently against her ribs like it wanted out, like it wanted revenge.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat on the edge of the table with a slow, deliberate grace, legs slightly parted, hands braced beside her. Her dark eyes held Agatha’s with a teasing glint, head tilted in mock curiosity. The air around her was thick, still, and charged — like the silence right before a storm tears the sky in two.</p><p> </p><p>“Missed me?” she asked with a crooked smirk, her voice sultry but edged with something dangerous. She looked up at Agatha from under her lashes, her tone a seductive drawl wrapped in old wounds. “I thought you hated me. There was a time you begged never to see me again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a sharp, furious laugh that barely masked her disbelief. Her nails dug into her palms, leaving crescent-shaped wounds. <em>What game was Rio playing now? What mask was this?</em> Did she want Agatha to admit it — to admit she hated her? Wanted to hate her?</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you dare throw a life I can’t remember in my face, Rio,” she snapped, stepping closer, her boots echoing sharply on the floor. “I told you — the things I did in that past? I don’t care. They don’t matter to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes flickered, her jaw tightening almost imperceptibly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, but they do,” she said, quieter now, almost intimate, as if confessing a sin in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head slowly, her eyes narrowing. A shift rippled through her — an old, dangerous presence stirring behind her gaze. Rio recognized it instantly. It was her again — the witch from before. The one who stole power with a kiss, who bent others to her will with a glance. The look she gave now said: <em>You don't get to challenge me</em>. <em>You may be Death, but I do not fear you.</em></p><p> </p><p>“How much do they matter?” Agatha asked, voice low, venomous. “Do they matter up until the moment I found out Nick, our son, was going to die before he even took a breath? That you were going to take him? That I hated every piece of you for it?” Her voice cracked, her composure fracturing. “Is that where they start to matter, Rio? And then what — then you run?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio clenched her jaw so tight her teeth ached. Her tongue slid along the inside of her cheek as she stared at Agatha, trying to swallow the rising scream in her chest. Her fingers curled into the wood of the table, splinters stabbing under her nails, and the ancient surface cracked beneath her hand.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t thought they'd reach that memory so soon. Hadn’t prepared for this confrontation — not like this. And Agatha… she still didn’t remember everything. “Agatha…” she said carefully, her voice suddenly small.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha cut her off, stepping in until their knees nearly touched. Her breath was shaky, hot with pain. “What did you think? That only the beautiful, sweet, fucking intoxicating moments would come back to me? That I’d remember the feel of your mouth on my skin, your hands, the way you made me <em>beg</em> — but not this part? The part where you ripped my son from me?” Her voice cracked, and the fury broke into raw grief. “Because in this life, you gave me both of them — Nick, Nicole — as if that would make it okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“I <em>wasn’t trying</em> to make up for <em>anything</em>!” Rio snapped, standing now, facing her, eyes wide and wet with emotion. “You asked me for them, Agatha! You begged me for them! I didn’t just show up and shove <em>two children</em> into your life like some twisted gift!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, her breath coming fast, her chest rising and falling beneath the leather of her jacket. She was trying to hold herself together, but she was unraveling — thread by thread.</p><p> </p><p>“What happened to Nicole in that life?” she asked, voice almost a whisper. “Why didn’t I see her in that memory?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze. “I can’t tell you that,” she said, voice suddenly flat. “Because it’ll—”</p><p> </p><p>“Break me?” Agatha growled. “Tear me apart?” Her voice went shrill, choked by the sob buried in her throat. “And what the hell do you think I am <em>right now</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath caught. Her mouth opened, but no words came. Her lips trembled. A single tear slipped from her eye, and she cursed under her breath. “Shit… you hate me again, don’t you?” Her voice cracked, and her shoulders sagged as the words left her. “Fuck.<em> I lost you again</em>, fuck. <em>Goddamn it</em>!”</p><p> </p><p>Something inside her snapped. It had been dormant for centuries — this ancient, brutal ache she had sealed away. Her heart pounded like it wanted to claw through her ribcage. Her hands went cold. Her stomach twisted, a sharp cramp of panic pulsing through her entire body. She pressed a trembling hand to her chest, desperate to feel something, anything.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha. <em>Please</em>, please forgive me,” she whispered, her voice broken now, ragged with pain. “I didn’t mean to. I swear to you… I didn’t mean to.” She was hyperventilating, eyes wild, pupils blown wide like prey caught in a trap.</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time, Agatha saw it: Death, reduced to trembling panic. <em>Vulnerable. Human</em>. And utterly shattered.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha stepped forward, the heat of her fury cooling in the face of Rio’s collapse. She dropped to her knees beside her, her voice low, urgent. “Rio, honey, look at me. I'm sorry, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond. Her gaze was distant, unfocused, as if trapped in a memory she couldn’t escape.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered again, more firmly this time, her fingers reaching to cradle her face. Rio’s skin was cold. “Baby, look at me. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, finally meeting her eyes, and in them — raw agony. “He was my son too, Agatha,” she said hoarsely. “I lost him too. <em>I loved him</em>. I loved him so much.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Agatha breathed, tears spilling freely down her cheeks. “Baby, I know. I know now, okay?” She pulled her close, wrapping her arms around her, holding her like she was made of glass and fire at once. “I’m not blaming you. I just want to understand. I want us to understand this — <em>us</em> — you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio buried her face in Agatha’s neck, her body trembling with silent sobs. Her arms clung to her tightly, like she was terrified to let go again.</p><p>Agatha held her there on the floor, their bodies pressed together, two broken things trying to fuse back into something whole. The scent of Rio’s skin, earthy and electric, filled her lungs. Her grip tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not losing me again,” she whispered. “Not this time.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio collapsed into Agatha’s arms, her breath shaky, uneven, ragged like torn silk. Her body trembled, not from cold, but from the weight of a thousand memories pressing against her ribs. She buried her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, her voice cracked and desperate as she inhaled her scent — a mix of lavender, old paper, and something uniquely Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Forgive me,” she whispered, her voice muffled against skin. “<em>Please, my love</em>, don’t leave me alone again. It was dark. Cold. <em>Everything was cold</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She felt the heat of Rio’s tears seeping into her skin, the tremor in her voice twisting something deep in her chest. She tilted Rio’s face up gently, cupping her cheeks in both hands, her thumbs brushing against the wet tracks on her lover’s skin. Then she leaned in, slowly, reverently, and pressed a kiss where the last tear had fallen. Her lips lingered there like a promise.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, sweetheart,” she murmured, voice low, velvet-soft, but weighted with gravity. “There’s nothing to forgive in you. <em>Nothing</em>.” Her eyes, stormy with emotion, searched Rio’s for understanding. “I don’t remember everything yet, but that Agatha… she’s not me. Maybe she chased love through power. Maybe she thought control was the only way to be wanted. Maybe she was good at it. I don’t know. <em>But I’m not her</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers traced the edge of Rio’s jaw, firm, grounding, a silent reassurance. “I already have love now. Nicole, Nick…” her voice softened, almost breaking, “And <em>yours</em>.” At that, she held Rio’s gaze fully. Her tone deepened, no longer fragile, but commanding. “It’s your work, Rio. It’s what you were born for. To guide, to carry, to end and begin again. I should’ve never hated you for simply doing what you had to do. For being who you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked slowly, jaw tightening, emotion flickering in the clench of her throat. She looked down for a second before meeting Agatha’s eyes again, this time with guilt simmering under the surface. </p><p> </p><p>“You say that now,” she said, voice hoarse, “but there’s still so much you don’t remember. You won’t like it when you do. But you have to remember.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her grip never leaving Rio’s skin. “Okay,” she whispered. “That’s okay. You can’t tell me why?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, the movement subtle but filled with tension. “No… I can’t. Because I don’t know.” She bit her bottom lip, hard enough to leave a mark. “Fate, my sister, said only your memory returning could restore what was lost between us. That only your soul, finding its voice again, could stop it from screaming after me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. Her voice dropped, low and curious. “And what exactly is it screaming for?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio replied, more quiet now. She was trembling again, but with restraint. “It’s not my job to know that. My work is to guide souls, to let endings bloom into something new. To teach them what it means to surrender and survive. And…” she looked down, a flush blooming across her pale cheeks, “apparently… <em>to get you pregnant</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a startled, breathy laugh, head falling back for a moment. “You did a <em>damn good</em> job at that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at her through her lashes, something sly, something wicked dancing in her eyes even in the middle of heartbreak. “<em>Three times</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t brag, big boy,” Agatha purred, one brow arched as she leaned in closer. Her fingers slid through the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck, gripping just enough to tilt her head back and expose her throat. Her voice dipped into something huskier, but gentle. “That mouth of yours is gonna get you in trouble, you know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, her breath catching. “Promise?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips hovered just above hers, a faint smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth. “I don’t make promises I don’t intend to keep.”</p><p> </p><p>Their breaths mingled, heavy with grief and longing, but beneath it — an old hunger reawakened. Agatha could feel it in the way Rio’s hand gripped her waist, in the way her pulse quickened under her skin. And Rio, despite the ache still raw inside her, welcomed it. Welcomed the pull, the surrender, the invitation to be punished and forgiven all at once.</p><p> </p><p>“I missed you,” Rio murmured, her voice low and reverent like a prayer, like a confession under candlelight. “Even when you hated me… I missed this. You. Us.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice was a command wrapped in velvet. “Then prove it. <em>No more running, Rio</em>. I don’t care what’s coming. We face it together. You hear me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her lips brushing against Agatha’s. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><hr/><p>The clatter of forks against ceramic filled the university cafeteria, along with bursts of laughter from the surrounding tables. The usual scent of over-salted fries and weak coffee lingered in the air, but at the corner booth, where Agatha sat with her colleagues, the tension was palpable. She pushed at her bland salad with the tip of her fork, wishing, desperately, to become invisible.</p><p> </p><p>"Where’s that hot friend of yours?" Jen asked, her voice muffled through a mouthful of fries, ketchup glistening on her lower lip.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha winced. "First, swallow your food. We’re not scavenging in a warzone. Second, she’s not my friend, and she’s not—"</p><p> </p><p>"If you’re about to say she’s not hot," Jen interrupted, wiping her mouth lazily, "you’d be lying. We all have eyes, Aggie."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed. She kept her eyes on the lettuce, stabbing it a little harder than necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda, lounging across from her with an iced coffee in hand, cocked her head. "What’s going on between you two?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing," Agatha said quickly, too quickly. Her voice clipped, defensive. She still didn’t look up.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gave her a slow, calculating look. "You’re different this week. You’ve been... glowing. And you’ve been dressing a little more... <em>sensual</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. <em>"I am not."</em></p><p> </p><p>"You are," Lilia chimed in smoothly, swirling her spoon through her yogurt like she was stirring a cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned. "Even you, Lilia?"</p><p> </p><p>Lilia smirked. "Sweetheart, the evidence is right in front of us. I haven’t seen you this flushed since your sabbatical in Paris. And back then, you swore it was the red wine."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to deny it, the heat rising rapidly up her neck.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>We had sex</em>." The voice was smooth. Velvet-wrapped steel. Every syllable curved like smoke. And it came from right behind Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She went rigid. The sip of water she’d just taken erupted from her mouth in a violent spray, right across Jen’s shocked, open-mouthed face.</p><p> </p><p>"<em><strong>AGATHA</strong></em>!" Jen shrieked, leaping back, reaching for napkins as Lilia sputtered her drink across the table and Wanda stared in open-mouthed horror.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t need to look. She knew. And there she was. Leaning languidly against the back of Wanda’s chair, dressed in black slacks and a sleeveless button-down that showed far too much collarbone, was Rio. Her lips curled into a slow, smug smile, and her dark eyes glittered with unapologetic mischief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. "Rio."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, darling?" Rio answered, all honey and thorns.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered her voice to a hiss. "You're invisible again."</p><p> </p><p>"And still stealing the spotlight. It's a talent," Rio murmured, her voice intimate, as if they were sharing secrets under the covers instead of in a crowded cafeteria.</p><p> </p><p>Jen was fuming. "What the actual hell is going on with you, Agatha? I am soaked!"</p><p> </p><p>"She’s doing that ghost thing again," Alice muttered from beside Wanda, sipping her drink without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>"I’m not—!" Agatha snapped, pointing toward Rio. "<em>She’s right there</em>! You seriously don’t see her?"</p><p> </p><p>Wanda turned, then blinked at the empty space. "See who?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s frustration boiled over. She pushed her chair back, her whole body tense. "You can’t just show up like that!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio, unbothered, prowled closer. She circled behind Agatha like a predator teasing prey, dragging a single fingertip, cold as riverwater, down the back of Agatha’s neck. Agatha shivered violently.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s eyes widened. "Oh my god. <em>You’re blushing</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slapped her palms to her cheeks. "I am not."</p><p> </p><p>"That’s not a blush," Wanda said dryly. "That’s a post-orgasm glow."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked. "Would you all just shut the fuck up?!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned down, lips nearly brushing her ear. Her voice was lower now, molten. "They’re not wrong, love. You were glowing. <em>And loud</em>. My poor back is still recovering from the scratches."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood up so fast her chair screeched across the floor. "I need air."</p><p> </p><p>"You need a girlfriend," Jen muttered darkly, still blotting her shirt.</p><p> </p><p>"You need a muzzle," Agatha growled.</p><p> </p><p>"And you," Lilia added, lifting her glass in a mock toast, "need to get better at lying."</p><p> </p><p>Without another word, Agatha stormed out, the air crackling around her. Her hands were trembling. Her face burned. Behind her, Rio followed like a well-dressed storm, that insufferable grin carved across her face.</p><p> </p><p>"Well," she whispered, brushing imaginary dust from her shoulder, "that went better than expected.”</p><p> </p><p>The classroom was dim and quiet, lit only by the lazy spill of afternoon sunlight slanting through the tall windows. Dust motes floated in the golden beams, drifting like restless spirits. Agatha stood at her desk, her hands flat against the wood, knuckles white with pressure. Her jaw was clenched, her pulse drumming in her ears. The echo of her students' laughter from the hallway felt far away, distant, like a world she no longer belonged to.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought we had <em>resolved</em> this,” Agatha snapped, her voice low but laced with venom. Her hand slammed against the desk with a crack that echoed through the empty room. “I am not going back to being the <em>schizophrenic professor</em>, Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio appeared in a soft shimmer by the chalkboard, reclining against it like a shadow come to life. Her posture was casual, but her eyes — those amber eyes — were sharp, amused, and entirely too satisfied. “We did resolve it. Of course we did. But really, darling, what would your life be without me to stir a little chaos into your day?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a glare so sharp it could’ve flayed flesh. “I don’t know. <em>Peaceful? Predictable</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked as she prowled forward, slow and deliberate. Her boots made no sound on the floor, but her presence pressed in like thunderclouds before a summer storm. “<em>Boring</em>,” she said simply. “Utterly dull.” She reached out and tugged playfully at the edge of Agatha’s high collar, her fingers like ice, like silk. “Excellent choice of attire, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin widened as she leaned in, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear as she whispered, “Because I can spend the whole day kissing your neck while invisible, and no one will notice a thing. You’ll have to sit through your lectures with flushed cheeks and your legs clenched, trying not to <em>moan</em> like the <em>needy little thing</em> you are. All while maintaining your ‘professional’ face. If you even can.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She swallowed hard, the scent of Rio’s skin — a mix of cold stone, spice, and something darker, older — filling her lungs like a spell. Then, in a sudden flare of dominance, Agatha shoved Rio back with both hands, hard enough to make the taller woman stumble against the desk with a loud thud. Papers fluttered to the floor. Rio blinked in surprise, her expression flickering between shock and something dangerously turned on.</p><p> </p><p>“Do not forget your place,” Agatha hissed, stepping in until their bodies almost touched again. She gripped the front of Rio’s shirt and yanked her forward just enough to make her bend slightly over the desk. Agatha loomed over her now, power humming in her spine, breath warm and steady against Rio’s lips. “The same way you like teasing me, I can make you regret it. You’re invisible, sure, but I know your limits. You have rules about using your powers in front of mortals, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath caught, and for a moment, the smugness bled from her face. Her pupils dilated. “<em>How do you know about that</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped to a low purr, velvet and steel. “Somewhere… in a massive estate, in the center of Salem… on a summer night when I was fifteen… you told me. Ring any bells?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. She stiffened, blinking as that memory — that night — flooded her senses. She hadn’t realized Agatha had remembered it. Not that detail. Not that night. The look in her eyes was different now. <em>Focused. In control</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, reading her reaction. “Judging by your face… you do remember.”</p><p> </p><p>That night had been the first time Rio saw Agatha cry. Evanora had bruised her pride — and her skin. Rio had wanted to tear the woman to pieces, but Agatha had asked her to scare her instead. Just scare. No deaths. No chaos. Just... help. And Rio, despite everything, even though she is forbidden from using her powers in front of living humans, had obeyed. For Agatha. That was the night she first laid her lips on Agatha’s trembling ones. The first night she had broken the rules for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“You remember more than you admit,” Rio murmured, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>“I remember just enough,” Agatha said, voice softer now, but no less dangerous. Her lips were so close, her breath traced the edge of Rio’s mouth like a lover’s touch. “And I’m curious to remember more. Maybe if I left the kids with you tonight and went somewhere… alone… <em>to relax</em>… the rest would come back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand twitched on the desk. Her eyes darkened instantly, like a storm rolling in. “<em>Relax</em>, how?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s smirk was slow, teasing. She reached for Rio’s hand where it clutched the table edge, her touch soft but firm as she eased the growing pressure before Rio shattered the wood. “I’m a grown woman, baby. There are many ways to have fun.”</p><p> </p><p>A sharp, threatening hiss left Rio’s throat as she bared her teeth like a feral cat. Her shoulders tensed, and her other hand curled into a fist. “You’re not insane yet, Agatha,” she warned, her voice low, trembling on the edge of rage and desperation.</p><p> </p><p>“Jealousy doesn’t suit you, <em>kitten</em>,” Agatha whispered, stepping back with deliberate slowness, her eyes never leaving Rio’s. “Now make yourself visible or sit in that chair and behave. Because if you don’t… I will go out tonight. And if I do, you won’t be able to touch me or do anything if someone touches me. Because your rules won’t allow it. <em>Understood</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond at first. Her jaw was tight, her chest rising and falling too fast for someone who was supposed to be in control. Finally, she straightened, brushing imaginary dust off her shirt, and offered Agatha a thin, tight smile. “You drive me insane,” she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes gleamed. “Good. Then we’re even.”</p><hr/><p>Agatha ended the class fifteen minutes early, her voice trailing off as her mind shifted abruptly, snagged by the jarring memory of the school meeting. <strong><em>The Parent-Teacher Conference</em></strong>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Nick. Shit.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She gathered her things quickly, stuffing papers into her leather satchel with one hand and rubbing her temple with the other. A headache was starting to build at the base of her skull — stress or guilt, she wasn’t sure which. As she slipped her coat on, she could feel it — that chill that wasn’t cold. That brush of presence.</p><p> </p><p>She was being followed. <em>Again</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the air was thick with spring warmth, the scent of jasmine riding on the breeze. As Agatha approached her car, she didn’t need to turn around to know Rio was there. She felt it — like the way the room always shifted when Rio entered, as if the world itself inhaled.</p><p> </p><p>Sliding into the driver’s seat, she didn’t check the mirrors or even glance toward the passenger side. She simply exhaled, long and controlled, and said flatly, “Are you coming with me, or will you keep pretending only I can see you?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause — silent, but heavy. Then leather creaked softly under shifting weight, and when Agatha turned her head, Rio was already there. Sitting coolly in the passenger seat, she looked unbothered, legs crossed, hands in her lap. Her face was tilted toward the window, and sunlight streamed in, casting a golden halo over her skin. But it was the shadow — her shadow — that gave it away. For once, it wasn’t invisible. It curved softly across the dash and over Agatha’s arm. <em>Real. Tangible. Visible</em>.</p><p> </p><p>A muscle in Agatha’s jaw twitched. She smiled, slow and dry. “So you’re showing yourself now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Happy?” Rio asked, finally turning her head. Her voice was like velvet laced with sharp edges, and the corner of her mouth curved in a smug, satisfied smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She let her gaze drag down Rio’s form — how she sat like she owned not just the car, but gravity itself. The seat seemed to mold around her. Her presence always did that — made everything feel smaller, charged, like static before lightning struck.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Very</em>,” Agatha said finally, shifting in her seat and starting the engine. “Nick’s going to be pleased to know that the other mom of his decided to show up.” Her tone was teasing, but her eyes flicked over Rio with something heavier than humor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's smile deepened, pleased with herself. “Well… it’s not exactly the first time I’ve been there. I’ve attended a few of these little human rituals — just... invisibly.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow lifted, one hand on the gearshift. “So you were just looming in the corner while I tried to explain why our son built a trebuchet out of cafeteria trays?”</p><p> </p><p>“Technically,” Rio said, lifting a finger, “he built it out of discarded trays, chairs, and one mop handle. <em>Very resourceful</em>. You should’ve seen the trajectory.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh, biting the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. She pulled out of the parking lot, the scent of Rio’s presence — smoke, snow, and the faintest trace of iron — curling in the small space between them like a secret.</p><p> </p><p>“This time,” Agatha said, voice firmer now, “you can be there as his mother too. Officially. Just… try not to terrify the principal.”</p><p> </p><p>“I always behave,” Rio purred, dragging out the words as she leaned in closer. Her fingers danced over Agatha’s thigh with calculated slowness, the pressure feather-light but charged. “Unless you want me to misbehave. In which case…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head sharply, eyes narrowing. “Don’t you dare start.”</p><p> </p><p>“Start what?” Rio asked, the picture of innocence, though her smirk betrayed her. She leaned back with a satisfied sigh, buckling her seatbelt with exaggerated politeness. “Lead the way, mama bear.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, but her lips curled despite herself. She kept her eyes on the road, though every nerve in her body was acutely aware of the woman beside her. Every shift of fabric. Every glance. Every inhale. It wasn’t going to be a normal parent-teacher meeting. Not when Death decided to come along — visible, smug, and with the smirk of a woman who knew exactly how to unmake her with one word.</p><hr/><p>They sat side by side on the narrow bench lining the school hallway, waiting for their turn to speak with Nick’s teacher. The buzz of voices, the distant squeal of sneakers on polished linoleum, and the low murmur of casual parent chatter filled the corridor. The walls were a washed-out yellow, the fluorescent lights above flickering every few seconds like they were struggling to stay awake. A clock ticked too loudly, and the air was thick — not hot enough to sweat, but warm enough to make clothes cling where they shouldn’t.</p><p>Agatha crossed her legs, one foot bouncing with restrained impatience. She looked straight ahead, jaw tight, her fingers gripping her purse like it had insulted her. Rio, on the other hand, looked completely relaxed — one arm draped lazily behind Agatha on the back of the bench, the other twirling a chipped plastic dinosaur she'd found abandoned under a seat. Her long legs were stretched out like she owned the place, black jeans tight enough to be sinful, boots untied like always. The open buttons of her navy shirt gave an unapologetic peek of bare skin and the sharp line of her collarbone, and the edges of a tattoo, glowing softly under the hallway lights.</p><p> </p><p>Across from them sat Susan Storm, pristine as always in her pearl earrings, icy smile and form-fitting blazer that screamed "<em>perfect wife of a genius</em>". She crossed her legs delicately and didn’t even pretend not to stare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed. <em>Oh, she definitely noticed</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a slow, sharp breath through her nose, like a dragon just before the flames. Her head turned toward Rio, eyes smoldering with something between fury and desire. Her voice dropped, a low warning wrapped in velvet and steel. “Button your shirt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t even look up. “It’s fucking hot in here, Agatha,” she murmured, still distracted by the dinosaur, tapping its tiny head against her thigh with childlike amusement. She smirked to herself. She knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. Her fingers twitched. “This is a school. Not a goddamn strip club.”</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Rio looked up. Her dark eyes were half-lidded, amused, amused and predatory. She dropped the dinosaur on her thigh and tilted her head, letting her eyes lazily wander down Agatha’s body before flicking back to her face. Then she followed Agatha’s gaze toward Susan and immediately understood.</p><p> </p><p><em>Ah</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The blonde was looking at her like a wolf in a cocktail dress. That was the problem. And Agatha was simmering in it. Something wicked unfurled in Rio’s grin. The kind of grin that pulled confessions from lips and made sinners out of saints.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’ll leave it open,” she said, stretching slowly as she straightened her back, making sure the motion pulled her shirt further apart, the hint of a tattoo curling under her ribs now in full view. “It really is hot.” Her voice dropped on the last word, just enough to make Agatha’s spine stiffen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in slightly, her fingers curling tight around the strap of her bag. “Close. It. Or I will.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze slid back to her. “Mmm. You threatening me in front of PTA moms now?” Her lips barely moved, but her voice dripped with something dark, teasing, deliciously taunting. “What do you think they'll say if they see you tugging at my shirt like that, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>She bit her lower lip, just lightly, watching the storm rise behind Agatha’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“‘Cause from where I’m sitting,” she added, voice slow and honeyed, “you look very interested in what’s underneath.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, not from embarrassment, but from a heat deeper, older, more territorial. Her fingers twitched again — itching to grab, to control, to put Rio exactly where she wanted her. The tension between them was so thick it buzzed in the air like static before a lightning strike. The hallway noise seemed to fade under it, swallowed by the unspoken things vibrating between them.</p><p>Susan stood up then, brushing invisible lint from her thigh. She gave one last not-so-subtle glance at Rio’s exposed skin and clicked her heels as she walked away, probably off to seduce another married physicist.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned over, close enough that her breath brushed Rio’s ear, her tone satin-smooth but sharp as a blade. “You like making me jealous?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. “I thought it was our game now... and I love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled without warmth. Her hand drifted toward Rio’s chest, thumb just grazing the edge of the open shirt. Her voice was so quiet it could’ve been a prayer or a threat. “I’m going to make you regret it later.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s pulse jumped under Agatha’s touch. Her smile faltered for a split second. “Promise?”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could answer, the classroom door creaked open and a teacher’s voice called out, “Agatha Harkness? You can come in now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood, smoothing down her skirt with a graceful flick of her fingers. She didn’t look back.</p><p>Rio, still seated, watched her walk into the room with a dark gleam in her eyes and a wicked grin tugging at her mouth. She adjusted her shirt, finally buttoning it — <em>only because Agatha wasn’t watching.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio followed Agatha immediately, her presence gliding behind her like a shadow dressed in silk. Silent, elegant, unseen. The door to Nick’s classroom creaked faintly as she stepped inside and pushed it closed with a soft click, the sound precise and deliberate, like a secret being sealed. The room was a burst of childish joy — walls covered in crayon drawings, alphabet banners swaying slightly in the breeze from a barely functioning ceiling fan, and tiny chairs arranged like a tea party waiting to start. Everything was miniature. <em>Everything was warm. Too warm.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio stood there, momentarily disarmed. <em>Cute</em>, she thought, eyeing the toy kitchen set in the corner. Her pale fingers curled slightly around the back of one of the child-sized chairs. <em>Tiny little humans. Ridiculously adorable</em>. She smiled, just a little.</p><p> </p><p>The teacher — Miss Carter — lifted her gaze from the papers on her desk. Her eyes swept Rio up and down, taking in the dark clothing, the composed posture, the undeniable charisma curling off her like perfume. Confusion settled behind her polite expression.</p><p> </p><p>“Mrs. Harkness... It’s good to see you again. How have you been?” Miss Carter’s voice was calm, but her eyes flicked back to Rio, visibly uncertain. “And you are...?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Rio answered smoothly, stepping forward and extending her hand with a practiced grace. Her smile was slow and disarming, almost too charming for a school setting. “Nick’s other mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped around so fast it made an <em>audible crack.</em> Her eyes flared with disbelief, lips parting in a sharp breath that never fully escaped. She had expected Rio to pull something bold — but not that bold. Not that blunt. No build-up, no softening. Just straight to the point, like always. Her heartbeat stuttered once in her throat, and her cheeks flushed with a mix of irritation and something dangerously close to... <em>amusement</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Miss Carter hesitated but gestured to the chairs across from her desk, professionalism outweighing curiosity. “Alright then… please, sit. We have quite a bit to discuss.”</p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, Rio circled behind Agatha and pulled the chair out for her with a low, respectful murmur near her ear, “After you, ma’am.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her but sat anyway, spine straight. The sound of the chair’s legs dragging across the floor was oddly sharp in the room’s quiet. Rio sat beside her, brushing her fingers lightly across Agatha’s shoulder as she did. The touch was fleeting but calculated — soft pressure, just enough to feel the warmth of skin beneath fabric. Agatha turned her head slowly, suspicion tightening her jaw. <em>She knew that touch</em>. Rio was up to something. <em>She was always up to something.</em></p><p> </p><p>Miss Carter launched into her overview of Nick’s performance. Academic excellence, musical aptitude, creativity with drawings, unexpected skill in sports. Rio nodded politely, but her focus was drifting. One hand was already in her coat pocket, fingers fiddling with the tiny green plastic dinosaur. She placed it delicately on her knee, tilting it back and forth, making its stubby arms “<em>dance</em>.”</p><p>A childish grin bloomed on her lips. She looked like a grown woman pretending to be innocent. <em>Or maybe she wasn’t pretending.</em></p><p>Agatha’s irritation simmered beside her like a covered pot on a high flame. The <em>click-click</em> of the plastic against Rio’s ring echoed like a countdown in her ears. Without warning, she reached out, snatched the toy from Rio’s hand, and shoved it into her purse with a hard zip.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Ah</em>!” Rio gasped, betrayal written across her face like a child who’d just lost her ice cream.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha growled under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio leaned closer, pout full, lashes low. “I already know everything she’s saying. You forgot I’m the one doing homework patrol while you survive Nicole’s teenage angst and hormonal rage.”</p><p> </p><p>Miss Carter cleared her throat, arching a brow as she looked between them. The dynamic was... unconventional. “Ladies,” she said, tone sharp but patient. “Despite Nick’s strengths, there’s something I am concerned about.”</p><p> </p><p>She opened his file, sliding out two colorful drawings from the folder. The first showed a happy family: Agatha with Nicole, hand-in-hand with Nick, and beside him, a hooded woman dressed in green-black. The second was more unsettling — Nick alone with the same cloaked figure, her face replaced with a skull, hollow eyes and all.</p><p>Agatha’s blood ran cold. Her eyes widened, throat suddenly too dry to swallow.</p><p> </p><p><em>Holy. Shit</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Rio’s reaction was the opposite. Her eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning. “Oh! <em>That’s me!”</em> she exclaimed, delighted. She pointed proudly to the skeletal face. “<em>Damn</em>, he really nailed the jawline.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, shooting daggers so sharp they could peel skin. Miss Carter, meanwhile, blinked at Rio, then at Agatha — her face caught between concern and incredulity.</p><p> </p><p>“Your son sees you as a specter, Ms. Vidal?” Miss Carter asked delicately. “That isn’t... normal for a seven-year-old. The way a child depicts their parents says a lot about their inner world. I’ve also noticed that Nick has gradually stopped mentioning Mr. O’Connor altogether. That, too, is something we find worrying for a child who — presumably — lost his father.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at Agatha, then back to Rio, who was still admiring the drawing. “I’m not a negative influence for my son if it's what you are implying,” Rio said flatly, her smile gone, replaced with a dark edge in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened her posture and raised a hand slightly, her voice calm but assertive, cutting in before Rio could spiral. “I understand your concern, Peggy. But Nick’s fine. He’s healthy, happy, emotionally responsive. Rio...” She exhaled, choosing her words carefully. “Rio dressed up as <em>Death</em> for no reason one day, very dramatic makeup, and, well, Nick saw it. He wasn’t scared. Actually, he’s obsessed with the video Nicole took of me screaming like a banshee. It’s been on replay for two weeks now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched a brow toward Agatha, lips twitching into a smirk. <em>Liar</em>, that expression said. A familiar look. It was the face Rio made when the witch in Agatha resurfaced — smooth<em>, manipulative, unapologetically clever</em>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>God, she loved that side of her.</em>
</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">“She’s... <em>eccentric</em>,” Agatha added. “<em>Hyper, strange, a little unfiltered, <strong>yes</strong>.</em> But the kids love her. And <em>so do I.</em>” Her voice dropped slightly, turning soft at the end. “Ralph is... complicated. But let’s just say he was never the father they needed. And they know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Miss Carter gave a slow nod, though the tension in her shoulders didn’t quite ease. “Still. Last week, when Franklin Richards teased Nick, he told him he’d send his mom to haunt his dreams... and take his dog.” She turned her gaze to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, blinking twice like she didn’t see the issue. “What? I’m <em>not</em> a ghost. I don’t haunt people. And I never mess with dogs. <em>Pure souls. Sacred beings</em>. I haunt Agatha, sure — <em>but that’s consensual</em>. Nick doesn’t fully understand my powers ye—”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Agatha cut in, raising both hands quickly. “What she means is that we’ll have a conversation with Nick about not threatening his classmates with supernatural retribution only our child can claim.” She glanced sideways. “Because... <em>most mothers can not do that.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed beside her, quiet but undeniably amused, leaning in with a whisper just low enough to send a shiver up Agatha’s spine. “That went well, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a side glance filled with fire, her hand gripping Rio’s thigh under the table in warning. </p><p> </p><p>As they stepped out of the classroom, Rio collided shoulder-first into a woman rounding the corner too fast, nearly knocking the phone from her hand. It would’ve hit the floor and shattered if Rio’s inhuman reflexes hadn’t snatched it midair, catching it with two fingers like it was nothing more than a falling leaf.</p><p>Behind her, Agatha was still smiling politely at the teacher, murmuring a final thank you, but her eyes locked immediately on the scene — on Susan’s hands resting far too casually on Rio’s shoulders. The diamond ring on Susan’s finger sparkled like it had a soul of its own, catching the hallway light with arrogant brilliance. But it didn’t stop her from touching what didn’t belong to her.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to register the shift in the atmosphere behind her — or she simply chose to ignore it. Which, for Rio, <em>was entirely on brand</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm so sorry," Susan said with a practiced smile, smoothing down Rio’s shoulder like she was erasing the contact. Her fingers lingered just enough to feel the tension under the leather jacket. "I was so distracted, I didn’t even see you..."</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio replied, her tone light, handing the phone back without skipping a beat. “Here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! You have amazing reflexes... You must be really athletic. Strong. You didn’t even let me or the phone hit the floor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Has nothing to do with sports. I was <em>built</em> this way. A long time ago,” Rio said with a sly glint in her eye.</p><p> </p><p>Susan chuckled, a little confused by the phrasing, but Rio saw the flick of her gaze — to behind her. She felt the air grow colder. Agatha had stopped walking. And now, she was watching. Burning. Rio didn’t turn. She didn’t have to. Her skin prickled with it. The kind of attention that reached inside your ribs and gripped your spine. That territorial stillness before a storm.</p><p>Part of her knew she should stop. The other part — the part currently biting her inner cheek to hold back a grin — was enjoying every second of this.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, but you must work out, right? Which gym do you go to?” Susan’s fingers tightened around Rio’s upper arms now, sliding down in a slow, clearly intentional press. “There’s one close by. I go often. Never seen you there.”</p><p> </p><p>The moment Susan’s hand made the slightest movement lower — toward Rio’s back — Agatha’s fingers closed around her wrist. The grip was strong. <em>Controlled. But barely</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“She works out at home. <em>With me</em>. <em>Watching</em>,” Agatha said, her voice sharp and even, like a scalpel cutting through silk. She didn’t blink. Didn’t flinch. Her eyes locked on Susan’s like a hunter who’d just chosen her prey.</p><p> </p><p>In another life, she could’ve <em>incinerated</em> her with a thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Susan said sweetly, though her tone faltered as she tried to pull her hand back. Agatha didn’t move. Not yet. “It’s been a long time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not long enough.” Agatha stepped forward until she was in front of Rio, shielding her completely, standing so close that Rio could smell the faint vanilla-and-smoke scent she always wore.</p><p> </p><p><em>Possessive. Commanding. Delicious</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Susan smiled, sharp and sugary. But when her eyes slid to Rio again, there was hunger there. A challenge.</p><p> </p><p>“You moved on fast, huh? And upgraded, by the looks of it.” Her gaze raked over Rio like she was peeling her clothes off molecule by molecule.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could practically hear Agatha’s knuckles tightening. <em>She knew that look</em>. She’d seen what came after, too. If Agatha still had her powers, Susan would be a smear on the hallway floor.</p><p> </p><p>“How’s your husband?” Susan asked with venomous sweetness.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably doing better than yours,” Agatha answered coolly, her hand now resting on Rio’s hip like a mark of ownership. “Seeing as his ex-wife isn’t rubbing her ring on someone else's bicep in public.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio coughed, trying to swallow a laugh and not choke. <em>She adored this version of Agatha.</em> Not the composed mother. Not the reformed witch. <em>This</em>. This razor-tongued creature full of fury and pride and possessive rage.</p><p> </p><p>Susan blinked, clearly not expecting that. “Ex?” she asked, arching a brow. “Was it a divorce? Or did they finally find his body in your basement and call it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into something feral. “The second one<em>. I used his corpse to summon Death</em>. It's not working — <em>she won’t listen to me</em>.” Her nails pressed into Rio’s arm, deep enough to leave a mark, grounding herself through her. “But I guess I’ll have to summon a way to <em>educate</em> her, right? I'm gonna need another body... Want to take a wild guess at who I’m thinking of?”</p><p> </p><p>The color drained from Susan’s face. Her confident smirk evaporated. All the years of taunting, of passive-aggressive jabs — this was the first time Agatha spoke like that. <em>With that voice</em>. The one that echoed from something ancient, something dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>“It was a pleasure meeting you... even though I never caught your name.” She looked at Rio, clearly waiting for her to say something. But Rio stayed silent, feeling Agatha’s pulse thrum through her grip. <em>Agatha wasn’t playing anymore. </em>“And it’s always... a pleasure to see you, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t say the same,” Agatha said flatly. “<em>Come</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t wait for Rio to respond. She wrapped her fingers around her wrist and pulled her out of the hallway, past the gawking parents, past the staff, straight toward the car. The cold air hit them as they exited the school building, but Rio barely noticed. Her wrist was still in Agatha’s grip — <em>tight, firm, tingling. Possessive.</em></p><p> </p><p>It feels so good.</p><hr/><p>The car door slammed with more force than necessary, the echo reverberating through the parking lot like a warning shot. Agatha gripped the steering wheel with white-knuckled restraint, the leather creaking beneath her fingers. Her jaw was locked, lips a thin line, and her eyes — still lit with that cold fire — were fixed dead ahead as if driving faster would silence the fury bubbling inside her.</p><p>Rio settled into the passenger seat with a little too much comfort, tossing her hair over her shoulder and exhaling a soft, amused sigh. She crossed her legs slowly, deliberately, and leaned her head back against the seat, watching Agatha from the corner of her eye like a cat toying with prey.</p><p>The silence was sharp. Dense. Like the moment before a storm snaps open the sky. Agatha turned onto the road with a jerk of the wheel, her movements controlled but barely. The heat of her anger radiated in waves, the air in the car thick with it — spiced with the scent of her perfume, her skin, and something darker, more primal: the burn of jealousy that still simmered hot under her collar.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked. “You’re gripping that wheel like you want to strangle it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do <em>want</em> to strangle something,” Agatha muttered, her voice low and dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>“Not me, I hope.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her eyes stayed on the road, but her body was taut, her shoulders high, her breaths shallow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio bit back a grin and let her fingers trail along her thigh, slow and casual. “You know, I didn’t tell her my name.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Good</em>,” Agatha said through clenched teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you’d like that,” Rio continued, her voice syrupy and low. “You were about two seconds away from ripping her arm off. <em>Kinda hot</em>, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose. “She touched you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed, dragging out the sound like a caress. “She did. <em>All over, actually</em>. Shoulders, arms. Almost reached my back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened again on the steering wheel. “Keep talking, Vidal. See what happens.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head, leaning her temple against the window, and smiled like a devil in silk. “You started it. You brought me. Let me say I’m the other mom. And, you think I didn't notice, but <em>you kinda said that you love me too</em>… Let me dress like I belong to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You do belong to me</em>,” Agatha snapped, her voice cracking out like a whip before she could stop herself. It echoed between them, hot and raw.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk deepened. “Hhm… <em>Say that again</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re enjoying this,” Agatha hissed, glancing at her now, eyes blazing. “You love pushing me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love what comes after I push you,” Rio said softly, voice smooth like velvet dragged across bare skin.</p><p> </p><p>A sharp silence fell again. Agatha’s breathing grew heavier, more deliberate. Her eyes returned to the road, but her mind was far from it. Rio could see it — feel it. The way Agatha’s thigh flexed beneath her skirt, the twitch in her jaw, the way her hand trembled slightly now as it dropped to the gearshift.</p><p> </p><p>“Her ring,” Agatha said suddenly. “Glittering like a fucking Christmas tree and was there... Acting like she can touch you.”</p><p> </p><p>“She can’t,” Rio said, softer now, serious.</p><p> </p><p>“She tried.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t stop her because I knew you would.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head turned slowly, her lips parting like she wanted to say something and couldn’t decide if it should be a curse or a threat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached over, fingers grazing the back of Agatha’s hand, dragging slowly down her knuckles. “You know you’re sexy when you’re jealous, right? The way your voice drops. That little twitch in your eyebrow.” She paused. “Makes me want to misbehave more often.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away, resting it back on her thigh — tight, controlled, but her breath betrayed her. Faster now. Harsher. And her pulse throbbed visibly at her throat. “Touch me again while I’m driving and I swear I’ll pull this car over.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to pull it over,” Rio murmured. “Didn't you realise that?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned so suddenly onto a side road that Rio had to grab the handle by the door. Gravel crunched beneath the tires as the car jerked into park. Agatha didn’t say a word. Just stared straight ahead, her chest rising and falling with measured fury.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted slowly in her seat, twisting to face her. “You gonna punish me now? <em>Promise</em>?” Her voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, eyes dark, pupils dilated. “You think this is a fucking game?”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in close, one hand gripping the back of Rio’s neck, not pulling her in — but holding her there. Her breath was warm, mint and spice, brushing against Rio’s lips without touching. “You keep testing me like this,” she said in a voice meant for darker rooms, “and one day I won’t stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyelids fluttered half-shut. “Good. Was about fucking time.”</p><p> </p><p>The hazard lights clicked in a slow, rhythmic pulse — red flashes blinking against the darkness of the empty road. The car sat still on the shoulder, quiet except for the faint hum of the engine and the distant rustling of wind against trees. Inside, the air was thick — electric. A current of tension, of something feral lying just beneath the skin, waiting to snap. Agatha didn’t speak. Her breathing was shallow, nostrils flared, her knuckles ghost-white from the tight grip she still had in Rio’s hair. That hand wasn’t just controlling — it was claiming. And Rio... Rio was basking in it.</p><p>She sat still in her seat, barely breathing, letting her head tilt ever so slightly, baring more of her throat to Agatha’s gaze. Her eyes shimmered in the low light, lit with the kind of challenge that could burn down temples. Her voice came out soft, almost purring, brushing against Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You love me.”</p><p> </p><p>That sentence, spoken with calm certainty, made Agatha’s fingers twitch. Something sharp and old clawed its way up through her chest.</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>“And YOU love me!” </strong></em>The voice wasn’t from Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>It rang deep in Agatha’s mind, laced with pain, rage, despair. The echo of a memory — of a fight, of a past version of Rio, wild-eyed and broken.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Once. Twice. The present swam back into focus. Her breath hitched.</p><p> </p><p>“You love having me all to yourself,” Rio whispered, her lips brushing just shy of Agatha’s, the words like silk and venom. “Even knowing no other human in the universe has ever had Death like you do. You love the power of it, the thrill — yet you’re still so jealous, baby.”</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>“No one in history..." </strong></em>The voice again. Softer now. Sad. Agatha’s teeth clenched. Her jaw was trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“I like teasing you, Agatha,” Rio continued, her voice low and breathy. “You don’t know what it does to me to see your eyes burn like that. That pure rage. It’s beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>“Quiet.” The word left Agatha’s mouth barely audible, a broken snarl meant for both Rio and the voice echoing in her skull.</p><p> </p><p>“Make me,” Rio murmured, eyes dark and gleaming with something between mischief and hunger. “You almost gave that blonde more value than you ever gave me... and now you’re gripping my hair like I’m a knot that won’t come loose.”</p><p> </p><p>She jerked her head slightly, testing the hold, but Agatha’s grip only tightened, rougher, possessive.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her breath hot against Rio’s neck. With a sharp, unspoken command in her body, she tilted Rio’s head back further, exposing the pale column of her throat, vulnerable and waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you that smart mouth of yours would get you into trouble, brat.” And then she bit. Not gentle. Not sweet. Her teeth sank into Rio’s neck hard enough to leave a mark — just shy of breaking skin. The sound that tore from Rio’s lips was something between a gasp and a moan, choked and breathless, primal.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could answer with another quip, Agatha’s free hand moved with elegant precision and slid two fingers past her lips. The intrusion was sudden. <em>Commanding</em>. Rio gasped again but obeyed, her lips closing around the fingers instinctively, her tongue swirling slow, almost reverent. Her pupils wide, her body flushed with heat and tension.</p><p> </p><p>“Keep that mouth busy since you can’t seem to keep it shut,” Agatha growled, watching the way Rio sucked on her fingers, cheeks hollowing slightly with each movement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand gripped Agatha’s thigh now, hard, nails pressing through the thin fabric of her skirt. Her whole body was fire — her breath quick, her chest rising and falling like she was barely containing herself. Agatha withdrew her fingers slowly, slick and shining, and leaned in to lick the spot she’d bitten. The skin was red, swollen, an angry mark of possession. She smiled against it, the taste of Rio’s skin still on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so much prettier quiet and obedient,” she murmured against the bruise. “Why don’t you stay like that more often?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to speak, her voice thick and wrecked. “Mmm... You’d get bored.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand snapped to her chin, gripping it hard. Her eyes narrowed. “I didn’t give you permission to speak.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t tell me <em>not</em> to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha hissed, her voice cracking with something between lust and fury.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, my love,” Rio whispered, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>That was it. Agatha surged forward, her mouth crashing into Rio’s with raw, explosive hunger. She didn’t kiss — she devoured. Their teeth clashed, tongues tangling in a war of heat and dominance. Agatha climbed over the console without care, dragging Rio with her by the back of the neck. Rio responded with a desperate whimper, one hand tangling in Agatha’s hair, the other clawing at the fabric of her shirt, pulling her closer, closer, like she wanted to merge into her skin.</p><p> </p><p>They kissed like it hurt. <em>Like it healed</em>. Like it meant everything and nothing at the same time. Agatha hated that Rio was right. <em>She did love her</em>. And right now, she would rather burn than admit it. So instead, she kissed her harder. Rougher.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth devoured Rio’s with renewed hunger, fingers threading tighter into her hair as she leaned back in the seat, dragging Rio up with her — until the weight of the woman she couldn't let go pressed down into her lap. The leather of the seat groaned beneath their bodies, the shift of heat and friction making Agatha’s breath hitch, her legs parting instinctively to anchor Rio above her. She could taste the defiance on Rio’s tongue, the way it fought and submitted in equal measure.</p><p> </p><p>Her hands roamed without shame, one gripping the curve of Rio’s ass while the other slipped beneath her shirt, fingertips grazing hot skin — soft, smooth, alive.</p><p> </p><p>And then—</p><p><strong>BZZZZZ </strong>The shrill vibration of her phone jolted against the center console.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored it, biting down softly on Rio’s bottom lip, tugging, then sucking the sting away.</p><p> </p><p><strong>BZZZZZ </strong>The second call came. Agatha growled low in her throat but didn’t stop, her hand slipping higher under the fabric.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled breathlessly against her mouth, their foreheads touching, her hands gripping Agatha’s shoulders like reins. “You gonna get that, <em>Mommy</em>?” she whispered with mock innocence, her voice hoarse and wicked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved her hips in a circular motion, grinding, just to remind Agatha of what she was missing by answering her phone.</p><p> </p><p>The third vibration came. <strong>BZZZZZZZ</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cursed under her breath and reached for the phone with a jerk, swiping to answer. Her voice, when she spoke, was not composed — it was strained, still caught in the storm of lust and adrenaline.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>What</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Mom. Nick and I are going to Lilia’s,” Nicole announced with all the enthusiasm of someone dropping a bomb and walking away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “Excuse me? Why? What the hell does Lilia want with you two at seven o’clock at night?”</p><p> </p><p>“She said it’s lasagna night,” Nicole replied dryly. “She invited you, but since you’re... busy, she invited us. Nick already packed his bag.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, dragging her fingers through her hair, the taste of Rio still on her lips. She glanced down. Rio was slumped slightly against her, pupils blown wide, lips swollen, cheeks flushed. She looked gloriously ruined. Agatha’s hand brushed her thigh possessively.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me talk to her,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Nicole shuffle, some muttered complaint, then footsteps and a loud, “Here, she wants to talk to you.”</p><p> </p><p>The voice that came through was calm. Too calm. “Good evening, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t give me that ‘good evening’ shit,” Agatha snapped. “What’s your game?”</p><p> </p><p>“My game is you fixing whatever mess you’ve got going on with your little friend, <em>Death</em>.” Lilia’s tone sharpened. “You’re... off, Agatha. More than usual. The kids are staying with me tonight. You either send her back to wherever she came from, or you figure out why she’s back and let her stay. But this tug-of-war between you two? It’s driving everyone insane. You look like you’re talking to shadows. Jen thinks you need to be committed.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s nothing going on,” Agatha hissed, defensively. Her eyes cut down to Rio, who was now tracing lazy circles on Agatha’s inner thigh, clearly listening. “You're delusional!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, sweetheart,” Lilia said with acid sweetness. “The only one delusional here is you. I left you a dish of lasagna in your fridge. Eat. You looked like shit today.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, silence. Call ended. Agatha stared at the black screen. One beat. Two. Three full minutes passed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, still perched in her lap, let her fingers wander, her chin resting on Agatha’s shoulder, lips brushing her ear. “What happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice was slow, wary. “Would it be possible for Lilia to know about you? About... us?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio said softly, her tone shifting to something deeper. “But maybe, yes. She was a powerful witch once. Traveled through time in visions, read souls like children’s books. After she died in that life she shared with you, she’s been reincarnated again and again. The connection to the unseen follows her.”</p><p> </p><p>“She's taking the kids tonight,” Agatha said, still looking at the phone like it had betrayed her. Her eyes narrowed, turning to Rio. “She wants us to... resolve this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “I have an excellent way to resolve it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you now.”</p><p> </p><p>“It involves you on top of me.” She dragged her nails gently down Agatha’s chest. “No clothes. No interruptions. No phones.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t smile. Not yet. But her hands moved again, sliding up Rio’s back with deliberate slowness. “I should throw that phone out the window, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Finally a good idea.”</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes locked. Tension still wrapped tight around them, but now it smoldered. Agatha leaned in again, her lips ghosting over Rio’s. This time, slower. Hungrier. Less rage — <em>more need</em>.</p><hr/><p>The door clicked shut with a finality that echoed through the house.</p><p> </p><p><em>Silence</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The kind of silence that felt thick, almost sacred. No laughter from Nick, no clinking of plates or Nicole yelling about something trivial from upstairs. Just the creak of the wooden floor beneath Agatha’s boots and the quiet exhale that slipped past Rio’s lips as she reached behind her to lock the door.</p><p>And the moment she turned the key and let her hand fall away — Agatha struck. With a force that was more instinct than thought, she shoved Rio against the closed door, hands gripping her by the waist and shoulder, pinning her like she was afraid she’d vanish if she didn’t hold her there.</p><p> </p><p>Their mouths crashed.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a kiss — it was a claim. A devouring. Agatha’s lips were rough and desperate, dragging across Rio’s with the urgency of hours denied. Her body pressed flush against hers, hips anchoring her, thighs slotting between Rio’s as if they'd been built to fit there. One of Agatha’s hands slid up, gripping the side of Rio’s neck, thumb resting on her jaw to hold her still. Rio gasped into her mouth and Agatha swallowed the sound greedily.</p><p> </p><p>Her back hit the door hard, but she didn’t flinch — she moaned. It reverberated in Agatha’s bones, in her spine, crawling under her skin like fire. She bit Rio’s bottom lip, tugged it between her teeth, then kissed her again, deeper this time — wet, messy, tongues tangled. The house smelled of cinnamon and faint traces of lavender from the diffuser in the hall, but all Agatha could breathe was Rio. Sweat, leather, something ancient and eternal.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been driving me insane all day,” Agatha growled against her lips, her voice low and shredded with tension.</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio purred, smile breaking between kisses, her hands sliding up under Agatha’s jacket to feel her waist. “I could feel it... You practically vibrated with jealousy, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed both of Rio’s wrists and slammed them above her head against the door, pinning them there with one hand while the other slid down, slow, possessive, past her waist, to the curve of her hip.</p><p> </p><p>“Keep talking,” she hissed, her breath hot against Rio’s cheek, “and I’ll ruin you right here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shivered. Her lashes fluttered as her hips arched forward into Agatha’s thigh, her body instinctively seeking more pressure, more friction. Her chest rose and fell quickly, the air thick between them.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the idea,” Rio murmured. “I came home for that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the waistband of her jeans, tugging just enough to make Rio gasp. Her mouth hovered at Rio’s ear now, her voice like silk over steel. “You belong to me<em>. I summoned you</em>. No one else touches you. No one else gets you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that,” Rio moaned. “I want that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her again, softer now, but still searing — like a brand pressed to skin. Her lips trailed down Rio’s jaw, along the edge of her throat, her tongue flicking over the spot she had bitten earlier in the car. It was already bruising. Already hers. Rio was trembling. Her whole body burning, pliant, waiting, her hands still held above her head. She could feel Agatha’s breath on her skin, the press of her thigh between her legs, the unbearable ache that came from being so close to release and yet held just out of reach.</p><p> </p><p>“I want you on your knees next,” Agatha whispered, voice firm, rich with dominance. “But not until I say.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, baby,” Rio breathed, smiling despite herself, drunk on it — on her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand released her wrists, but Rio didn’t move. She stayed just like that. Hands against the door, lips swollen, eyes locked to Agatha’s like she was tethered to her very soul.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss softened. What had begun as teeth, hunger, and dominance dissolved into something slower — more reverent. Agatha’s hands, once gripping Rio like she might vanish if released, began to roam with purpose, with curiosity, as if memorizing her through the pads of her fingers. Her lips brushed softer now, lingering at the corner of Rio’s mouth, across her cheekbone, down the line of her jaw.</p><p>There was a sacredness in the quiet now. Just the sound of breathing — quick, shallow, warm against skin. The distant hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. The tick of the old clock in the hallway. But between them, the rest of the world faded into static.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand slid along Rio’s waist, her fingers curling around the skin just above the waistband of her jeans. Her thumb traced upward — then froze.</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, her eyes catching the lines marked into Rio’s side. The dim hallway light painted shadows along the curves of her body, making the tattoo seem to move, almost alive beneath the skin.</p><p> </p><p>She raised an eyebrow, voice low, teasing. “So... which lucky mortal had the honor of tattooing Death?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, sultry and secretive, her pupils still dark with desire. She pulled one of Agatha’s hands from her waist, brought it to her lips, kissed the knuckles, and then slipped away — just a step, just enough space to begin unbuttoning her shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“No one,” she said, her voice dipping into that ancient, velvet cadence. “I placed them here myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She watched as Rio spoke, each word peeling away another layer — of mystery, of clothing, of her.</p><p> </p><p>“They change, you know,” Rio continued, her fingers undoing the last button and shrugging the fabric off her shoulders. The shirt slid down like water, pooling at her feet. “Every day they’re different. Each leaf marks a place, a time, a reality. A place where I have to split myself. To collect. The larger the leaf, the higher the death count. If thorns appear near the vines, it means someone’s summoned me — called me before their time. When they wither...” Her voice faltered slightly. “It means that place is gone. Wiped clean. No more life. No more time.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood there in just a green lace bra, the color deep against her bronzed skin, the inked leaves curling up from her hipbone, spiraling across her waist, climbing like ivy toward her heart. They shimmered faintly. Almost metallic. Almost breathing. It wasn’t just a tattoo. It was a living map of mortality.</p><p> </p><p>“I look at them every day,” Rio said softly, “and I know exactly where I have to go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat worked around nothing. “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>She reached out. Slowly. As if afraid touching them would cause pain — or make Rio disappear.</p><p> </p><p>“I can remove them,” Rio offered gently. “If you want me to.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, breath catching, eyes wide. “Leave them... please.” Her fingers met skin, trailing reverently from the bottom curve of Rio’s waist to just beneath her ribs. “They’re beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>“You think I’m beautiful,” Rio whispered, voice laced with a grin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands moved upward, carefully tracing the lines with trembling fingertips. “Yes. But this... this is something else.” Her eyes flicked up to Rio’s. “You’re in all of these places right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m omnipresent,” Rio said, voice gentle. “Wherever there’s life, I am.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face shifted. Confusion, longing, maybe even hurt. “So you’re not really here?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, closing the gap again, her body warm and soft and very, very real. She reached for Agatha’s hand and brought it to her chest, pressing her palm flat against the curve just above her heart.</p><p> </p><p>“Feel that?” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did. A <em>heartbeat</em>. Slow. Steady. <em>Strong</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here, Agatha. <em>With you</em>. Entirely. Even if I exist in a million places, this is the part of me that chose to be… yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched, eyes flicking down to where her hand rested. The pulse beneath her palm was grounding, haunting. The living heart of something immortal. Hers, if only for now.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, voice ragged. “Don’t leave.”</p><p> </p><p>“I never did,” Rio whispered. “You just stopped looking.”</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha’s breath catch mid-throat. Her fingers instinctively curled against Rio’s skin, nails grazing her ribs with featherlight tension, as if she were afraid the contact would break the moment — shatter the illusion that Rio was truly here, truly hers.</p><p>Then, gently, reverently, Agatha leaned in, brushing a slow, lingering kiss over the space just above Rio’s heart. Her lips lingered there, soft and warm, brushing the inked vines with devotion, like she was sealing something ancient — something sacred. <em>A vow. A promise. A plea.</em></p><p>Rio’s smirk melted into something quieter, deeper — her face softening, her jaw unclenching. The playful gleam in her eyes gave way to something unguarded. Rare. She looked… exposed. Not in body, but in spirit. A quiet that made the air shift between them. She blinked slowly, her lashes heavy, then spoke in a voice Agatha had never heard from her before—low, tender, so carefully placed it could’ve shattered if spoken any louder.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me tell you something.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand reached out with deliberate slowness, as though Agatha’s touch were a holy object — something earned, not taken. Rio’s palm was cool to the touch, but it burned with memory. She guided Agatha’s hand back over her chest and held it there, pressing it down until her warmth passed into Agatha’s fingertips.</p><p> </p><p>“My heart…” she said, eyes never leaving hers, “<em>it’s black.</em> Completely black. <em>Lifeless</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Her brow furrowed, her lips parted — because beneath her hand, she felt it. The steady, rhythmic thump. Her heart. Beating.</p><p> </p><p>“But it’s—” she whispered, her voice dry, unbelieving, “—it’s beating.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet laugh — rough, low, more ache than amusement. It trembled against Agatha’s hand like an aftershock.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” she murmured, lashes dropping. “The first time it beat in millennia… was the day I saw you in the forest.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice changed, laced with memory — dark and honeyed. “You were so little. Fragile. Five years old, maybe. You should’ve been terrified. Your mother was a monster — cold and cruel. But even then, you stood tall, defiant. You looked her in the eye and said no. And I watched from the veil, and I felt something I’d never known before.” She paused, her throat working around something unspeakable. “The first beat was rusty. Loud. It hurt. Like something tearing open after being sealed shut for eons. But it made me want to protect you. Fiercely. Irrationally. Completely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, lips trembling, her fingers twitching over Rio’s skin as though trying to feel that exact beat, that exact moment.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t understand it,” Rio continued, voice thick. “I’d never known pain. Never needed to. But that day, I felt. And it didn’t stop after that. It just kept going. Day after day. Quiet. Relentless. Heavy. And… I liked it. The warmth. The ache. The pull.”</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze flicked downward to where Agatha’s hand still lay, then rose again slowly, locking eyes. Her next words were softer, reverent, thick with weight.</p><p> </p><p>“It was still black. But it <em>beat for you</em>.”</p><p> </p><p><strong><em>"Yes, I do. It's black and it beats for you." </em></strong>Agatha’s breath turned shallow, like the air around her was too thick to pull in. Her lip trembled, but she tried to pull her hand away. Rio didn’t let her. She held her there — not forcefully, just enough.</p><p> </p><p>Her skin beneath Agatha’s palm felt warmer now. <em>Alive</em>. Throbbing with that impossible rhythm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped further, soft as candlelight. “The day you died… in that other life, that other timeline… it stopped. Just like that.” She snapped her fingers, the sound like a blade in the quiet. “The pain disappeared. The beat vanished. And I thought... maybe that’s what death feels like for someone like me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her knees falter, her head spinning. Images she’d never seen flickered through her mind like old film.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought that was the end,” Rio said, quieter now. “That the ache was gone forever, and I’d be alone again. Even missing the pain, I thought that was better than hoping.” She took a step forward. Their bodies touched again, warm skin to skin, breath mingling. “But then,” she whispered, voice raw, “it beat again. Violent. Wild. It knocked me to my knees. And I knew. You were back. Alive. Somewhere in the world. But I couldn’t find you. No matter how hard I searched, you were hidden from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Her forehead pressed against Agatha’s. Their noses brushed. Their lips hovered — so close, trembling, but not yet touching.</p><p> </p><p>“My sisters tried to stop me. Fate said you deserved peace. Life begged me to let go. To not taint you again. But I couldn’t.” Her voice cracked. “I burned for you. I still burn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tears slipped down her cheeks like quiet rain. No sobs. No gasps. Just silent surrender. Rio’s hands cradled her face, brushing the tears away with a tenderness so devastating it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“And then one night,” Rio continued, her voice a sigh, “I heard a distant prayer. Small. Desperate. A wish. Not to escape pain—but to create something pure. A child. One born of love.”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes closed. “I listened. I followed. And after a few days, a heartbeat found me. Small. Alone. Unmarked. And I knew — Nicole.” Agatha trembled, hands clinging to Rio now, her nails digging slightly into her sides. “I knew then,” Rio whispered, “that the soul I belonged to… was calling me again.” Her voice broke. She exhaled a shaky breath. “You told me to stay away. You begged me. But I stayed. Because I love you. In this life. In all of them. I will always love you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face crumpled. Her body shook with the weight of it — centuries of longing, of grief, of quiet knowing finally spoken out loud.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her tear-streaked cheek, then her temple, then her lips — so soft, so gentle, it felt like worship.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to say anything, my love,” she murmured, her voice steady now — like an oath. “Just know I’m here. And I’ll stay… as long as you’ll let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once, her eyes closed, her breath uneven. And then she leaned in, pressing their foreheads together again, their lips brushing like a whisper passed in the dark. The silence between them buzzed — not empty, not cold, but charged. Sacred.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice came out cracked, but sure. A whisper. A vow “<em>Stay</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her again — softly at first, lips brushing Rio’s with the same reverence she’d kissed her heart minutes earlier. But this kiss wasn’t about memory. It wasn’t about pain or loss or time. This kiss was now. Present. Heavy with heat and urgency. Agatha’s fingers gripped Rio’s waist, firm, guiding, as she stepped them back — one step, then another — until the backs of Rio’s knees hit the edge of the couch.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed forward, letting Rio fold beneath her slowly, carefully, laying her down like something precious. The softness of the cushions met Rio’s back — and then—</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agh! Fuck</em>!” Rio hissed, arching up suddenly. Her face twisted in pain. “What the hell—?”</p><p> </p><p>She reached beneath her and pulled out a small, <em>red LEGO block</em>, sharp corner glinting in the low light like a smug little weapon.</p><p> </p><p>“The greatest weapon of the 21st century,” Rio muttered, tossing it across the room with zero remorse. “I’ve been shot. I’ve been stabbed. <em>Nothing compares</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound low and rich, and knelt over her, bracing one hand by Rio’s head while the other dragged lazily down her side. “Poor baby,” she teased, voice husky, eyes glittering with affection. “Should I kiss it better?”</p><p> </p><p>“Depends,” Rio whispered, her legs wrapping around Agatha’s waist with sudden, fluid grace, locking her in tight. “You know what’s an even bigger weapon?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, lips brushing just above the swell of Rio’s breast. “Uhm?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened with hunger, but her voice stayed teasing, sinful. “Those gorgeous lips of yours not being on mine. I swear, I think my heart’s slowing down. Might stop entirely.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha purred, lifting her head to meet Rio’s gaze, her mouth still curved in a knowing smile. “So… you're dying?”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. And it’d be a real problem if I had to guide my own soul, because you’re taking too damn long to kiss me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head, her fingers sliding up Rio’s ribs with languid intention. “Does this usually work on people? Did I fall for this crap in a past life? Did other women fall for it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you asking about your past self,” Rio grinned wickedly, “or are you jealous enough to bite my neck again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, dangerously playful now. “Why not both?”</p><p> </p><p>“Put it in that beautiful stubborn head of yours,” Rio said, tugging her down by the collar. “You are the only living thing in the history of the entire universe that can make me <em>beg for a kiss</em>. You are the only one I want, Agatha. Now, <em>please</em>, use that mouth for something useful.”</p><p> </p><p>That plea — so bold and yet so honest — tore something primal from Agatha’s chest. She growled low, her lips crashing into Rio’s, but what Rio expected to be a bruising kiss of dominance turned into something deeper — tender, slow, aching with memory.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth moved over hers like she was rediscovering familiar territory, as if her soul remembered what her mind still refused to. Her kiss spoke of ancient promises. Of having held Death in her arms before and knowing exactly what that power tasted like. Rio whimpered into her mouth, her body arching instinctively, legs tightening around Agatha’s waist like a vice. Her fingers gripped the back of Agatha’s neck, keeping her there, as if terrified she’d pull away again.</p><p>Agatha shifted, lowering her body more fully against Rio’s, and slid one thigh between hers — just to feel her. And then she felt it: Rio pressing down, instinctively grinding forward, slow and desperate.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…” Agatha whispered, voice dropping to a dark rasp. “You’re already looking for something.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, her head rolling back against the cushion, lips parted, a flush spreading across her chest. “I can’t help it,” she whispered. “You make me burn, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth trailed kisses down the curve of Rio’s neck, lingering at the bite mark she’d left earlier. Her knee pressed up, firmer now, between Rio’s thighs. And the entity moved — slow, then harder — rocking against her with a rhythm that was maddening in its need.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah! <em>Fuck</em>,” Rio breathed. Her fingers clawed at Agatha’s back, nails dragging down, grounding herself in sensation. “You make it impossible to stay composed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you composed,” Agatha said, voice low and dangerous, her lips brushing the curve of Rio’s breast. “I want you undone beneath me, like the good girl I like to believe you are for me.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio was. Her movements became more frantic, more unrestrained. She rocked forward, back, chasing friction that never fully satisfied, her breath breaking in ragged moans.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Look at me</em>,” Agatha demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Rio obeyed instantly, eyes wide, glassy, mouth trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to watch you fall apart,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>And in that moment, Rio was everything — divine and desperate. A goddess coming undone beneath the mortal woman who’d once stolen her heart. The same woman who could still command her with just a look. A kiss. A whisper.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha reveled in it.</p><p>
<em>In that power.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In that ache.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In that truth.</em>
</p><p>That she, a woman once broken by fate, had made Death herself feel alive.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hovered over her like a storm held barely at bay. Her lips were swollen from kissing, her breath heavy, dragging between her teeth as she stared down at Rio — this being, this force, this impossible paradox of death and want and worship — spread out beneath her. And still, she hadn’t touched her where it counted.</p><p>Her thigh remained between Rio’s legs, cruelly close but never pressing. Never giving. Teasing her with the suggestion of relief while denying her everything.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched, trying to grind down, but Agatha shifted — just enough to make her miss. <em>Again</em>. “Please…” Rio whispered, her voice hoarse, eyes wild with hunger. Her skin gleamed faintly in the low light, chest rising with every ragged breath. “Agatha, please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just smiled, slow, wicked, her mouth brushing Rio’s ear. “Oh no, sweetheart. You don’t get to beg your way through this so soon.”</p><p> </p><p>With elegant fingers, she slipped one hand behind Rio’s back, unclasped the bra with a flick, and slowly — excruciatingly — peeled the green lace away. She didn’t immediately touch. Didn’t lean in. Just looked.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze was fire. <em>Devouring. Worshipful</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“God, you’re fucking beautiful,” Agatha murmured, her voice low and reverent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s nipples tightened under the weight of that gaze alone. Her breath caught, hips twitching, thighs flexing with frustration. But Agatha still didn’t touch her where she ached. Instead, her fingertips ghosted over Rio’s ribs, up along her side, tracing the inked vines that curled over her skin. They burned like flame under her touch. Not literally, but deeply. Spiritually. Agatha could feel the history humming beneath her fingertips, could sense the way each leaf breathed some part of Rio’s existence into being. No scars. No bruises. No flaws. But still—this body told stories. Not in damage, but in design.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb brushed just below Rio’s breast, tracing a particularly large leaf curling toward her sternum. “What does this one mean?” she asked softly, not looking up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shuddered beneath her. “A war. A world lost to fire. Millions dead. It burned for months.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up. “And this?”</p><p> </p><p>“A plague. A reality where no one aged. Time collapsed in on itself.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in, tongue brushing the curve of a tattoo curling just under Rio’s right breast.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s back arched sharply. “Fuck, baby…”</p><p> </p><p>But still, Agatha avoided the center of her need. Her hands mapped the skin like cartography, like sacred scripture, never venturing near the waistband of her pants.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not touching me,” Rio breathed, trembling now. </p><p> </p><p>“I am,” Agatha replied, her voice a dangerous whisper. “Just not where you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re evil,” Rio moaned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, brushing her lips down the center of her chest, pausing between her breasts, her tongue flicking out for a taste. “<em>I’m patient</em>. You should try it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body pulsed with hunger. Her nipples peaked harder under Agatha’s mouth, responding to the heat of her breath, the brush of her hair, the sound of her voice. She was trembling now, thighs tensed, every nerve tuned to Agatha’s tempo.</p><p> </p><p>“You are so… stunning,” Agatha murmured. She sat back on her heels slightly, drinking her in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arms rested above her head, surrendered completely. Her skin glowed gold in the low light. She looked like a deity laid bare. But her voice dropped, low and intimate. “This isn’t my true form.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, her brow furrowing slightly. “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice softened. “It’s the form I chose… for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart stuttered.</p><p> </p><p>“You picked this?” she whispered, fingers brushing down Rio’s side with reverence. “You designed this body… for me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Rio reached up, cupping her cheek. “Every inch. Every curve. Because I knew how you looked at me. What you wanted. I gave you the only thing I could give… <em>myself</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then show me,” Agatha whispered. Her eyes were dark now, filled with the entire pupil. She was feeling high just from looking at Rio. From having her between her fingers... Or… leg. “Your real form. I want to see.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t,” Rio said gently. “Not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because your soul isn’t ready to remember it. And if I show you too soon, I might lose you again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “I trust you.” <em>More than I trust myself</em>, she didn’t say.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, soft and unguarded. She pulled Agatha’s face down and kissed her, tenderly, like gratitude incarnate. “Thank you, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her back, her mouth moving with aching slowness across Rio’s skin. And then, finally, finally — her lips closed around one of Rio’s nipples, and Rio shattered. “Fuck! Baby! Fuck!”</p><p> </p><p>Her back arched violently, mouth falling open, thighs clenching around Agatha’s hips. Her hands shot down, tangling in Agatha’s hair, pulling her closer, tighter. Agatha moaned against her, suckling gently, teasing her with her tongue, while one hand pinned her hip in place and the other splayed across her stomach — holding her still while she worshipped.</p><p>Every sound from Rio’s lips was raw poetry. Every tremble of her body was truth. And Agatha devoured it.</p><p>Rio was unraveling. Her body trembled under Agatha’s mouth, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps as her fingers fisted tighter into that dark hair. Her back arched into the touch, into the heat, but still Agatha didn’t go lower — her hands stayed on Rio’s ribs, her lips devoted only to her breasts, her tongue moving in slow, maddening circles that had Rio whimpering.</p><p> </p><p>“Please…” Rio breathed, her voice cracking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to speak, her breath hot against the damp skin of Rio’s chest. “Please what, baby?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were glazed over, pupils wide and dark. She licked her lips, her hips rolling up instinctively against Agatha’s body, still met with nothing but the hard muscle of her thigh — so close, yet not enough. Never enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Touch me,” she whispered. “Touch me where I need it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, slow and wicked, her voice dipped low, like velvet-wrapped iron. “I am touching you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” she said, her lips brushing over Rio’s other nipple now, dragging her tongue just beneath before wrapping her lips around it again. She suckled, slow and possessive, while her hands slid along Rio’s sides — up her arms, down her waist — but always deliberately avoiding the place Rio ached for most. The friction of Agatha’s thigh was maddening, and Rio couldn’t stop moving. Her hips rocked against it, chasing something just out of reach. The pressure built, wave after wave, her core pulsing, slick with need, but still — Agatha didn’t grant her release. She watched. Controlled.</p><p>Her mouth left Rio’s breast with a soft pop, and she leaned back to admire the damage — Rio’s flushed skin, lips parted in desperation, chest heaving. Her tattoos seemed to shimmer with each breath, curling and shifting ever so subtly across her golden skin. Agatha ran her fingers up the length of Rio’s torso again, tracing the vine of ink like it was a sacred path, brushing the underside of one breast, ghosting over her ribs, lingering at her stomach, then pulling away just as her fingertips neared the waistband of her pants.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio growled, her voice half-plea, half-threat. “Baby…”</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha just looked at her, drinking her in like a goddess at her altar. “You chose this body for me?” she asked again, voice low and reverent. “Every curve, every inch?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, breathing fast. “Every line. Every detail. It was always you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened — but the heat behind them didn’t dim. Her hands cupped Rio’s breasts again, thumbs brushing the sensitive peaks. “Then I’m going to enjoy every part of it. Slowly.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re killing me,” Rio whispered, but her voice broke on a moan as Agatha leaned down and sucked one nipple into her mouth again, this time harder — more demanding. Her other hand rolled the second peak between her fingers, pinching gently, and Rio cried out.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re already dead, sweetheart,” Agatha said against her skin, her voice nothing but heat and silk. “I’m just keeping you alive.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpered, her body thrashing beneath her. “I swear, if you don’t touch me…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her head, her lips wet and flushed, her eyes sparkling with mischief and command. “What will you do, mi amor? You gonna take control back from me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gritted her teeth, jaw clenched, her body so wound up it vibrated. “If I could think straight, maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha purred. “You can’t. You’re mine right now. Completely.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio, the embodiment of death, the one who walked through time untouched, nodded. “Yes,” she breathed. “Yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's hands trembled as she reached down, fingers brushing over the laces of Rio’s boots. She knelt at the foot of the couch, her palms pressed to the outside of Rio’s calves, feeling the faint vibration in her muscles — restless, aching. With careful, reverent slowness, she unzipped each boot and peeled them off, one at a time, the leather groaning in protest.</p><p>Rio watched her through half-lidded eyes, the fire in her gaze softened by tenderness. Her legs remained parted, her chest rising in quiet anticipation as Agatha slid her hands up the inside of her thighs, to the button of her pants. She popped it open. Then the zipper — slowly. Metal teeth parting like a sigh.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily as she hooked her fingers in the waistband, dragging the jeans down inch by inch, past the curve of Rio’s hips, over her thighs, down to her knees, then gone.</p><p>
<em>And then she saw it.</em>
</p><p>The green lace clung to Rio’s skin, soaked through — <em>dripping</em> — translucent in places where it should have been fabric. Her core pulsed visibly, desperate and twitching against the air. Agatha’s breath caught violently in her throat. Her knees weakened.</p><p>
<em>She had never seen anything so fucking beautiful in her life. Not even close.</em>
</p><p>She’d had Ralph. Always briefly. Mechanically. Because her mother had told her she needed to. It was an act. A performance. Cold. Forgettable.</p><p>But this… <em>This woman</em>. <em><strong>Her woman</strong></em>.</p><p>Laid out beneath her, soaking wet for her, hers — and only hers to eat out. No one had ever looked at Agatha with the kind of hunger Rio did. No one had ever offered themselves like this. Her skin flushed. Her hands shook with restraint. That moment — Rio, legs open, lips parted, waiting, wanting — it was Agatha’s first time in every way that mattered.</p><p>She leaned back slightly on her knees, her eyes devouring the sight. If she could paint, she would’ve made art out of it — immortalized it on canvas. A thousand lifetimes of worship wouldn’t be enough. Her only choice now was to look every day. For as long as Rio let her.</p><p>
<em>For as long as she lived.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her voice came out hoarse, breathless. “Oh my fucking god…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked lazily, rolling her hips just a little. “Like what you see?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer at first. Her gaze never wavered. “Yes.” She blinked hard, trying to collect herself. “If I didn’t have two children who burst into rooms like wild animals, I’d never let you get dressed again. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed softly, wicked and warm. “Uhm... You’re giving off hot nympho-masochist vibes. I like it.” She shifted, pressing her thighs together slightly — just to tease. “So... I’m wet as hell for you, baby. I could cum here just with you looking at me... Are you gonna keep staring, or...?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched into a crooked, dazed smile. “Can I take a picture?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, brows lifting. “<em>What</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“A photo,” Agatha repeated. “Don’t ask me why. Just... can I?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin widened, something wild and deeply affectionate behind it. “Well… I’m all yours. Do what you want, amor.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fumbled slightly, reaching into her jeans pocket for her phone, her fingers shaking as she opened the camera. She took a few photos — each one framed carefully, intimately, like Rio was a painting only she could capture. She didn’t rush. Her thumb hovered over the shutter like she didn’t want to miss a single angle of this holiness laid bare.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, amused. “Soooo… Our kids don’t have access to your phone, right? Because if Nick sees this, I swear—”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha cut her off, chuckling. “They don’t. No one does. <em>Just me.”</em></p><p> </p><p>She set the phone down on the table, then leaned over Rio slowly, their bodies aligning again like magnets.</p><p> </p><p>“Before I…” she whispered, her lips ghosting over Rio’s, “I should probably say — I don’t really know what I’m doing. I’ve never… with a woman…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brow lifted, but the smile she gave her was soft — gentle in a way only Rio could be when she wanted to worship instead of tease.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been doing a fucking phenomenal job so far,” she said, and then tugged Agatha down for a brief, tender kiss. “You don’t have to know. I’ll guide you. Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, forehead against Rio’s. “Okay… what do you want?” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped, thick and slow like honey over fire. “Your mouth back on mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Then her fingers slid between them, curling around Agatha’s hand, dragging it slowly downward, guiding it toward the heat between her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“And I want this fucking soaked lace gone.” She exhaled, her voice trembling with need. “Let’s start there, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>"Will you behave for once?"</p><p> </p><p>"You know that I won't. But it will be fun to watch."</p>

<p>Agatha swallowed hard, her breath shaking against Rio’s lips. The room felt impossibly hot, the air thick with anticipation, their bodies so close that every breath exchanged felt like fire shared between mouths. Rio’s fingers still rested lightly over Agatha’s hand, guiding — not forcing, never forcing — just leading her with the same grace she used to carry souls across dimensions. And she knew Agatha, knew exactly how to touch her without ever laying a finger. Words. Always words.</p><p> </p><p>“You feel how wet I am for you?” Rio murmured, her voice slow, velvet-drenched heat against Agatha’s ear. “That’s <em>all</em> you, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand hovered, trembling, fingers brushing along the top of the soaked lace. Her eyes flicked up to Rio’s, wide, uncertain, burning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled — not cocky, not teasing this time, but something deeper. Encouraging. “Don’t be scared. You’re not gonna hurt me.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hips lifted slightly, just enough to press herself more firmly into Agatha’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Start slow,” Rio whispered. “Let your fingers feel through the fabric first. Just feel me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers pressed down — tentative, testing — gliding over the sticky dampness of the lace. It clung to Rio like it didn’t want to let go, and Agatha gasped at the heat radiating through it, the wetness.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed, voice cracked and barely there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arched her back ever so slightly, her eyes fluttering shut for a moment. “Just like that... You're doing <em>so</em> good.”</p><p> </p><p>The praise made Agatha’s chest rise sharply. She leaned down and kissed Rio again, slower now, deeper, her hand still cupped between her thighs, exploring with delicate reverence.</p><p> </p><p>“Move your fingers in small circles,” Rio guided her gently, one hand slipping into Agatha’s hair, not pulling, just holding. “Keep them over the fabric, yeah... just like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha obeyed, lips never leaving Rio’s, her fingers moving in slow, uncertain patterns that grew more confident with every sound Rio made — every breathy moan, every soft gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“You feel that?” Rio whispered against her mouth. “That’s me begging for you, Agatha. That’s what you do to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips twitched at the words, a low sound vibrating in her throat. Her mouth moved to Rio’s jaw, down her neck, tasting her skin as her fingers moved faster now, rubbing firmer over the soaked lace.</p><p> </p><p>“You like when I talk like this? You always did. Turns you on, doesn't it?” Rio murmured, her voice dropping an octave, lips grazing Agatha’s temple. “You like being the one in control, hearing me fall apart under you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched hard. “Yes,” she whispered, like a confession.</p><p> </p><p>“Then keep going,” Rio said, guiding her wrist in a slow rhythm. “I want you to see what you do to me when you take your time. When you learn me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s other hand slid up Rio’s stomach, pausing at the curve of her breast. Her thumb brushed the still-hard nipple, and Rio’s hips bucked in response.</p><p> </p><p>“God, I want to give you everything,” Agatha said, her voice raw now, thick with reverence and need.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You are</em>,” Rio breathed, her lips brushing hers. “Right now, you’re giving me everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned over Rio’s skin, devouring her inch by inch as her fingers tightened around the lace stretched impossibly tight between Rio’s thighs. The fabric clung — wet, translucent, obscene in its need — and Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. <em>She needed more. She needed all of her.</em></p><p>With a sudden growl deep in her throat, she hooked both hands in the sides of the lace and pulled — a hard, hungry motion that made the delicate fabric tear audibly. The sound was sharp, sinful. The shredded piece slipped from Rio’s hips like ribbon, sticking for a moment from the slickness before snapping free.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, Agatha!” Rio cried out, her head flying back against the cushion, eyes shut tight, body arching hard.</p><p> </p><p>The air left Agatha’s lungs. Her eyes were locked now — completely transfixed — on what had been revealed.</p><p>
<em>It was too much. Too perfect. Too good.</em>
</p><p>The folds glistened with arousal, swollen and aching, glistening in the soft light like something sacred. The scent of Rio’s desire filled the air — warm, musky, dark and utterly intoxicating. Agatha swore she could taste it just from breathing. It pulled at something inside her, ancient and feral. And yet, she didn’t move. She just stared, chest heaving, lips parted, eyes wide with reverence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her eyes slowly and looked down, still breathless. “Baby... <em>touch me</em> I'm about to cry here!.”</p><p> </p><p>That snapped her out of it. Agatha's hands found Rio’s thighs, spreading them wider, guiding her legs over her shoulders without a word. She leaned in — close enough that her breath brushed the sensitive flesh but didn’t touch. <em>Not yet</em>. She let her lips hover, watching Rio writhe under the teasing warmth.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a finger,” Rio whispered, her voice rasped with need. “Start slow. One finger, gentle. Let me open for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brought her hand up, trembling just slightly, dragging her fingertips through the wetness slowly, almost cautiously. Rio gasped — body jerking — and Agatha moaned softly at the sheer heat, the wet, the slick silk of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Lower, love,” Rio whispered, hips rocking into her hand. “Ah! Yes... right there. Circle it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha obeyed, her thumb pressing lightly, drawing slow, teasing circles over the bundle of nerves at the top of Rio’s slit. She watched — <em>watched</em> — as Rio’s thighs tensed, as her stomach clenched, as her lips parted in silent pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking responsive,” Agatha murmured, awe-struck. “Every little movement... I can feel it in you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled through her moans. “Because I was <em>made</em> to respond to you.”</p><p> </p><p>That line broke something open in Agatha. Her finger slipped lower, teasing at Rio’s entrance, and the sound Rio made was raw, needy. Agatha pushed in slowly — just one finger — feeling the impossibly warm grip of Rio’s body sucking her in.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit,” Agatha breathed, eyes fluttering. “You’re... you’re perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>“Keep moving. Slow,” Rio murmured, her hips rolling. “Let me guide you... yes, just like that. Curl your finger.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did. And Rio whimpered, her body shaking. And then — it happened. Something shifted in Agatha’s eyes. Her breath changed. Her rhythm didn’t wait for instruction. She adjusted — found an angle, a depth — like her hands had done this a thousand times. Like her body remembered what her mind had never learned.</p><p>Her thumb moved to press firmer over Rio’s clit, her finger curling deeper inside, matching the exact tension in Rio’s hips. Her lips trailed back to Rio’s breasts, kissing, biting gently, her breath hot and greedy.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby… oh! Fuck!” Rio gasped, clutching at her shoulders. “How… how did you-.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, ‘cause she didn’t need to.</p><p>Her second finger slipped in beside the first, her pace adjusting, her thumb moving faster now in tight, perfect circles. She leaned down, eyes locked to Rio’s face, watching every expression, every flicker of pleasure cross those divine features.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sobbed out a breath. “You remember, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed the hollow of her throat. “I… maybe. I don't know.” And then she quickened her pace. <em>Confident. In control. Devoted</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She knew her now. She knew how Rio breathed when she was about to fall apart. She knew how her thighs tensed a moment before her moans broke. She knew the exact pressure her clit craved and the angle that made her voice crack.</p><p>And Rio — <em>God, Rio</em> — was shaking under her.</p><p><em>Undone. Unraveled. And begging</em>.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched the moment Agatha squeezed her fingers tighter. It wasn’t just the touch — it was the command laced beneath it, the tension that curled between them like smoke before fire. A shiver raced through Rio’s body, not from fear, but raw anticipation. Her thighs clenched instinctively, her body reacting faster than her thoughts. Just feeling Agatha grip her, just knowing she was about to be undone again, made her dizzy with need.</p><p>Agatha could feel it too. That subtle tremor. That sharp inhale. The way Rio’s fingers involuntarily tightened around hers. It was intoxicating. The kind of control that wasn’t begged for, but taken. She leaned down, brushed her lips against Rio’s jaw, and let her nails drag down Rio’s back through the fabric of her shirt — slow and deliberate. The sensation was enough to make Rio arch, a gasp escaping her lips that turned into something almost feral. One tear slid from the corner of Rio’s eye, trailing down her temple. It wasn’t from pain. <em>It was memory. Grief. Gratitude.</em> That single, quiet realization that after everything she had lost, she was here. <em>She had this. <strong>Agatha</strong></em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck! Baby, please," Rio moaned, the sound breaking through her chest in a shuddering plea. Her voice cracked. “Kiss me, please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She claimed Rio’s mouth with hunger, the kind that whispered of obsession and years of restraint undone in seconds. Rio melted under her, the kiss so deep it felt like it could pull her soul out through her lips. She moaned directly into Agatha’s mouth, grinding her hips down with reckless abandon, desperate for friction, for closeness. Every sound she made was like a spark against dry kindling.</p><p>Holding Rio like this, listening to her break apart in her arms, was more than victory — it was salvation. Agatha kissed her harder, her hand sliding between Rio’s thighs with slow, torturous purpose. And still, somewhere deep inside, the cold edge of her anxiety quieted. That voice that never shut up — gone. All that remained was Rio. <em>Warm. Sweaty. Writhing. Begging</em>. Her lips swollen, her mouth slick, whispering her name like a prayer.</p><p><em>God, she was fucking Death herself</em> — and she had never felt so <em>fucking alive</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Put your legs over my shoulders, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured, her voice rough and low, her lips grazing the shell of Rio’s ear. The command wasn't loud. It didn't need to be. "Can you do that?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a broken laugh, her voice thick with arousal. “I’m very flexible, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Despite the weakness in her limbs, she obeyed, lifting her legs and resting them on Agatha’s shoulders. The shift lifted her hips slightly off the bed, her entrance now tilted at the perfect angle, exposed and needy. Agatha didn't waste time. Her fingers plunged back inside without ceremony, and Rio cried out — her head lolling to the side, sweat-dark hair sticking to her cheek. Her hips bucked up to meet each thrust, chasing the high like she was starved for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold still,” Agatha growled, catching Rio’s gaze with hers, all control and heat.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t... Agatha, I—” Her voice cracked again, her body convulsing as the pressure became unbearable. Her muscles tightened. Her mouth fell open in a silent scream.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to last. <em>God, she really did</em>. But three thrusts later, the orgasm slammed into her like a truck. Her walls clamped down around Agatha’s fingers, her thighs trembling as her climax ripped through her with unforgiving force. Her legs hooked around Agatha’s neck and pulled her down, instinct guiding her movements, bringing Agatha’s lips back to her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck! <em>I’m sorry</em>! It’s just — so good!” Rio collapsed in her arms, boneless, breathless, trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“You never listen, do you?” Agatha smirked, her teeth grazing the skin near Rio’s collarbone before sinking in with a possessive bite. It wasn’t cruel — but it wasn’t gentle either. “We’re doing it again. You’ll learn to obey eventually.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a half-whimper, half-laugh, her chest still heaving. Just the promise of more had her already pulsing again. “Just... take the damn clothes off, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand rose, gripping Rio’s face between her fingers, firm and slow. She tilted her chin up, eyes dark and locked. “You don’t get to give me orders, Vidal. Open your legs, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>The way she said it — steady, husky, absolute — made Rio’s breath catch in her throat. And she opened them. <em>Of course she did</em>.</p><hr/><p>Rio was the first to wake up, <em>of course</em>. She didn’t really sleep. She didn’t need to. Not the way mortals did.</p><p>Agatha, however...</p><p>Agatha was a different story.</p><p>She didn’t even remember what time they'd finally collapsed into bed, only that every inch of her body still buzzed with a strange, delicious ache. Every nerve, every cell, every shard of her existence scattered through the multiverse seemed to hum, singing the memory of <em>Agatha's mouth, Agatha’s touch, Agatha’s love.</em></p><p>Somewhere deep inside her, something old — something broken — felt stitched back together. As a clumsy thank you, Rio had attempted something dangerous: <em>domesticity</em>.</p><p>
<u>
<em>It rarely worked out.</em>
</u>
</p><p>The kitchen had suffered before at her hands — incinerated omelets, salt in the sugar jar, a coffee so strong it nearly ended Agatha's life prematurely. But that never stopped Rio from trying.</p><p>The moment Agatha shuffled into the kitchen, still yawning, pulling her robe tight around her, she froze. Her mouth opened slightly. Her brain lagged behind her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Oh my God</em>," she croaked, surveying the battlefield that had once been her kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood in the middle of it, fists buried in a lump of stubborn dough she was aggressively punching into submission. Flour clung to her black shirt, dusted her hair and smudged her cheeks. There were unnecessary ingredients everywhere, a graveyard of eggshells, and even black flowers blooming and dying at her feet with each frustrated breath she took.</p><p>Agatha bit down hard on her lip to keep from laughing. <em>She had to be the adult here, clearly. </em><em>The responsible one.</em></p><p> </p><p>"Rio..." she started carefully, voice cracking with suppressed amusement. "What... did you <em>do</em> to my kitchen? It's 7:30 in the morning. I have to be at the college by 8."</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned around, pouting like a guilty black cat caught mid-crime. Her nose was streaked with flour, and when her golden-brown eyes met Agatha’s, so wide and sheepish, it was all over.</p><p>Agatha snorted, laughter bubbling uncontrollably from her lips.</p><p> </p><p>"I was trying to take care of you," Rio mumbled, pouting even harder. "You made me feel so good last night... I think I wore you out... So I thought I'd make you breakfast... And..." She gestured helplessly to the chaos around her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer, heart softening into something unbearably tender. She reached out, gently wiping the tip of Rio’s nose with the sleeve of her robe. Rio leaned into the touch immediately, like a starved kitten, almost purring under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest ached sweetly. "<em>This is Death</em>," she thought. "<em>The great Reaper... acting like this</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>She cupped Rio’s flour-smeared face with her fingertips. "Why didn’t you just make pancakes?" she teased lightly. "You're good at pancakes."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a small, embarrassed smile. "Because you deserve more than pancakes after giving me <em>three orgasms in a row</em>, Agatha," she said bluntly, without a hint of teasing, just as a simple truth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on a laugh and covered her mouth. <em>God help her</em>. Rio's complete innocence in saying something so filthy would kill her one day.</p><p>Rio looked at her, so open, so bright, <em>so... pure</em>. Her amber eyes gleamed under the soft morning light filtering through the dusty windows. Agatha’s heart squeezed painfully in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>"You know what I'd really love to eat right now?" Agatha said, smoothing her thumb across Rio’s cheek before kissing it tenderly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes instinctively, melting into the affection. "<em>Me</em>?" Rio asked hopefully, voice so genuine it almost hurt.</p><p> </p><p>"Tempting," Agatha murmured, "but I have exams to supervise today. I was thinking something lighter. Fresh fruit. Like those mornings... when I first started bleeding." She smiled faintly at the memory, voice growing soft. "You used to leave baskets outside my room... full of flowers, fruits, and—"</p><p> </p><p>"— Grape juice," Rio finished, a fond smile lighting her face. "Because you wanted to drink wine so badly, but you were only twelve."</p><p> </p><p>"Exactly," Agatha laughed, her chest tightening with a rush of warmth.</p><p> </p><p>"You always wanted to be so grown up," Rio said, voice full of nostalgia. "You used to steal your mother's dresses and pretend you were leading a coven."</p><p> </p><p>"And you..." Agatha tilted her head, studying Rio’s softened features, "you looked so different. You almost looked like Nicole. Messy freckles, wild hair... like some lost teenage boy who didn't know where he belonged."</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, a genuine sound. "I had to adapt to you," she said, shrugging. "It would’ve been weird if I stayed in my adult form hanging around a kid all the time."</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, with a casual wave of her hand, the disaster in the kitchen vanished. Flour, flowers, broken eggs, overturned bowls — all gone. The kitchen gleamed again as if nothing had ever happened. And there, waiting on the table, sat a perfect breakfast: fresh fruits of every color, a crystal pitcher of grape juice, and wildflowers arranged with surprising grace.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. The smile she gave Rio wasn’t forced, wasn’t measured, wasn’t cautious. It was pure, unfiltered wonder. The same look she used to give her... back when everything between them was simple and untouched by pain. Rio stared at her, eyes glowing gold and full of something too big to name. Something desperate and wild and so, <em>so in love</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha said gently, noticing how awkwardly Rio twisted the corner of the tablecloth in her fingers. "Sit down. You're acting weird."</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry..." Rio mumbled, sliding clumsily into the chair beside her. "I just... I forgot how it feels to be with you like this. No running. No fighting. Just... <em>us</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Her voice cracked on the last word. Agatha reached out without thinking, threading their fingers together. She felt Rio’s heart hammering in her palm. It made her own chest tighten painfully.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio," she breathed, voice trembling slightly, "do you want to go out with me?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. Confused. <em>Adorable</em>. "I always go out with you," she said, tilting her head like a puzzled puppy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled, squeezing her hand. <em>God, she was adorable</em>. "No, baby. I mean... a real date. Like — official. Dinner. Movie. Something stupid and cheesy."</p><p> </p><p>The silence that fell between them was heavy and sacred. Even the air seemed to shimmer. Rio’s mouth opened — and nothing came out at first.</p><p> </p><p>"I..." she stammered, eyes wide, cheeks flushing a deep, lovely pink.</p><p> </p><p><em>Death blushed</em>. Rio Vidal, <em>the fucking Reaper</em>, was blushing like a teenager asked to prom.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes," she whispered finally, voice hoarse with emotion. "<em>Yes!</em> I want that. I want that <em>so</em> much."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed — light and bright and full of something she hadn't let herself feel in a long time: hope. "Good," she said, brushing the back of Rio’s hand with her lips. "I'll plan everything. You just have to wear something comfortable. I'll take care of you."</p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezed her hand back, so tightly it almost hurt. "But Agatha," she asked shyly, "why?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, tucking a stray lock of hair behind Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>"Because, my love," she said, voice shaking but sure, "it's time we do this right. You made me a mother — <em>twice</em> — you live in my house, I have your nudes on my phone... but we never had a first date."</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, their foreheads brushing gently.</p><p> </p><p>"And judging by your face right now," Agatha whispered, smirking, "I'm guessing our first dates back then weren't very conventional, were they?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a sheepish shrug. Agatha laughed softly.</p><p> </p><p>"So let’s start properly this time," she said, voice fierce and full of quiet devotion. "No more running, Rio. <em>No more hiding</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of Agatha’s skin — the lavender soap, the faint trace of warmth and magic clinging to her. "<em>No more hiding</em>," Rio whispered back.</p><hr/><p>Rio was practically glued to Agatha’s side as they walked across campus, the morning sun casting soft halos around them. Her arm brushed against Agatha’s every few steps, her hand occasionally grazing her waist as if she simply couldn’t help it. The high-collared black sweater she wore clung to her figure, but it couldn’t hide the marks blossoming beneath — marks<em> she wore like trophies</em>. Even if she could erase them with a thought, she wanted them there. Agatha had made them. They were proof, stamped into her skin, that she was hers.</p><p> </p><p>And then there was the smile. <em>God, the smile</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio practically floated as she moved, a grin so stupidly happy it made her look drunk. Her golden-brown eyes never left Agatha for long, following her like she was the sun and Rio was some helpless, desperate moth. Agatha tried to ignore it. Tried to focus on her breakfast, on the stack of papers waiting for her in her office, on literally anything but the possessive way Rio’s gaze slid over her like a touch.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t working. <em>And her friends were noticing.</em></p><p> </p><p>At first, they exchanged silent looks, nudging each other beneath the table as they picked at their food in the campus café. But it didn’t take long before Jen, ever the blunt one, broke the dam.</p><p> </p><p>"You two <em>fucked</em>, didn’t you?" she said, loud enough that three tables turned to stare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked violently on her juice, coughing and sputtering, while Rio just tilted her head and smiled lazily, like a satisfied cat stretching in a sunbeam. She took a deliberate sip of her coffee before answering.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>No</em>!" Agatha barked, voice hoarse.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Yes</em>," Rio said at the exact same time, smirking around the rim of her mug.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s brow shot up suspiciously. She leaned forward, scrutinizing Rio like a scientist examining a new, irritating specimen. "Agatha's not gay," Wanda said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio set her cup down with theatrical care, the porcelain clicking lightly against the saucer.</p><p> </p><p>Her smile sharpened. "She was <em>pretty gay</em> last night. And I can’t lie, honey," she purred, tilting her head, the amber of her eyes gleaming mischievously. "It’s not allowed."</p><p> </p><p>The way she said it sent a chill down Agatha’s spine — and not in a good way.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda leaned back, folding her arms. "Prove it."</p><p> </p><p>"No, Rio, <em>don't prove it</em>," Agatha snapped quickly, shooting her a deadly glare.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her entirely, resting her chin in her hand and batting her lashes at Wanda. "That I can’t lie," she asked sweetly, "or that I slept with Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p>"Both," Wanda said, a wicked grin curling at the corners of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a mock sigh of defeat. "Fine." With exaggerated slowness, she reached up and tugged down the turtleneck collar of her sweater. A collective gasp rose from the table.</p><p> </p><p>Along the elegant column of her neck, angry red and purple marks bloomed — bites, kisses, the kind of bruises you couldn’t mistake for anything else.</p><p>Agatha wanted to die. <em>Right there</em>. Instant cardiac arrest. Her soul probably did leave her body for a few blessed seconds.</p><p> </p><p>"Holy shit, Harkness!" Jen choked, eyes wide as saucers. "What are you, a <em>vampire</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>"Or a fucking canibal?" Alice snorted, covering her mouth to hide her explosive laughter. "You almost ripped the girl's throat <em>out</em>, Agatha!" she howled between giggles, thumping the table.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha covered her face with both hands, groaning. "<em>I am going to strangle her</em>," she muttered behind her fingers. "<em>I am going to fucking strangle her</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiled angelically, looking way too proud of herself.</p><p> </p><p><em>"Masochist, she would probably love to be strangled."</em> Agatha thought bitterly. <em>"Fucking adorable, self-satisfied little masochist."</em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda, however, wasn’t done. She tapped her manicured nails against the table thoughtfully, eyes narrowing. "Alright," she said. "You proved you slept with her, which I have some questions… Now prove you can’t lie."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile grew sharper, hungrier. She loved a good challenge. "<em>You sure about that, Wanda</em>?" Rio asked, voice dropping just slightly, a warning hidden in the sweetness.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes," Wanda said stubbornly.</p><p> </p><p>"No," Agatha hissed across the table, shooting daggers at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes," Wanda insisted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a mock shrug, as if to say, <em>You asked for it. </em></p><p> </p><p>"Fine," she purred. "Here’s something you’ve never told anyone but yourself." She leaned forward slightly, lowering her voice to an intimate, lethal whisper. "You’re cheating on your husband... with the hot Russian ballet teacher from the Arts campus. <em>Natasha-something</em>."</p><p> </p><p>The words hit the table like a bomb. Silence. Dead, total silence. Even Alice and Jen stopped laughing, their jaws dropping. Wanda’s face went utterly blank. For a moment, Agatha thought she might flip the table. Or murder Rio right there with her bare hands.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Who</em> told you that?" Wanda asked, her voice deadly soft, her hands curling into fists against the wood.</p><p> </p><p>"No one," Rio said sweetly. "I don’t need anyone to tell me anything. I see things, honey. I hear things. I collect things." She smiled, all teeth. "And incidentally... I was there. The day you kissed her under the old oak tree. Remember the security guard that offed himself in Block A? The one between the Library and the Arts Building?"</p><p> </p><p>Wanda paled. "You were spying on us?"</p><p> </p><p>"No," Rio shrugged innocently. "I was <em>collecting</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed her hand over Rio’s mouth, cutting her off mid-sentence. "Okay! That’s enough!" she hissed, feeling her face blaze with secondhand embarrassment. "You <em>proved</em> your damn point, honey."</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curved into a smug smile against Agatha’s palm, but she allowed herself to be silenced. The rest of the table sat in stunned, horrified silence. Except for Jen and Alice, who were both struggling so hard not to collapse in hysterical laughter that their faces had turned bright red.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda just glared daggers across the table. "You," she said to Rio, voice trembling slightly, "are dangerous."</p><p> </p><p>Rio winked, utterly unbothered. Agatha didn’t know whether to laugh, cry, or throttle her on the spot. <em>Probably all three</em>. She sighed heavily, running a hand through her hair.</p><hr/><p>The heavy wooden door creaked open, and Agatha stepped into the hallway, the worn soles of her boots clicking softly against the stone floor. She tugged her deep blue overcoat tighter around her, the fabric stiff from the crisp, biting air that filtered in from the cracked windows. Underneath, her white blouse was neatly tucked into fitted purple slacks — elegant, effortless — but her shoulders sagged with exhaustion after the long class.</p><p>Wanda stood by the door, leaning casually against the opposite wall, arms crossed, mouth already twitching in mischief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, gripping the stack of books tighter against her chest. "If you're here to judge me," she warned flatly, balancing the weight of the largest textbook in her palm, "I swear to God, Maximoff, I will throw this book at your face."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda raised her hands in surrender, a smirk curving her lips. "No judgment," she promised, voice light. "Just... curiosity."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled a long, slow breath through her nose, muttering something about nosy witches under her breath, before pushing the door to her office open and stepping aside. The familiar scent of parchment, ink, and cold coffee wrapped around her as she dumped the books onto her cluttered desk. Wanda followed, shutting the door behind them with a soft click. They stood there for a moment, the silence stretching thin.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you know?" Wanda finally asked, her voice quieter now. "About me... and Natasha?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha peeled off her coat, revealing the crisp white blouse underneath, and slung it over the back of her chair with a practiced flick of her wrist. She leaned against the desk, arms folded.</p><p> </p><p>"No," she said simply. Wanda blinked, caught off guard by the bluntness. "It’s none of my business," Agatha added, voice firm but not unkind. "You’re my friend, Wanda. Not my wife. Your private life? Not my concern."</p><p> </p><p>She gave a small, dry laugh.</p><p> </p><p>"And given everything going on in my own love life right now, believe me," Agatha continued, rolling her sleeves up, "I’m in no position to judge anyone."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda visibly relaxed, tension bleeding from her posture. Her smile, small but genuine, finally returned. "Thanks," she said, voice low.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only nodded, brushing a stray curl behind her ear. But Wanda wasn’t done. She tilted her head, narrowing her eyes slightly, studying her with the precision of a surgeon.</p><p> </p><p>"And what about you?" she asked, smile turning sly. "Since when are you into women?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, her mouth twitching into something half-defensive, half-shy — an expression Wanda had never seen on her before.</p><p> </p><p>"I don’t know," Agatha admitted honestly, eyes flickering toward the window as if the answer might be written in the clouds. “What I do know is that I've never liked men. I... My mother taught me to never really like anyone, she said it wasn't necessary. That I should just get married and follow the rules. I never stopped to think about what I really liked.</p><p> </p><p>She fiddled with a pen on her desk, twirling it between her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>"It’s not like I sat down and made a decision one day. I find women attractive, I always have. But I never cared. It’s just..." She exhaled, struggling to explain the feeling clawing inside her. "It’s like being hungry. Or thirsty. Except worse. Like... if she’s not near me, I feel like I'm suffocating."</p><p> </p><p>Her voice cracked slightly, and she dropped the pen, embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>"I sound like a fucking teenager," she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda's heart softened immediately. She had never seen Agatha like this. Not with any man. <em>Not even once.</em></p><p> </p><p>She smiled warmly. "You’re adorable," Wanda said, and laughed when Agatha shot her a mortified glare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbled under her breath, grabbing the pen again and pretending to scribble something just to have something to do with her hands. But the light mood didn’t last. Wanda leaned in slightly, lowering her voice.</p><p> </p><p>"Then tell me something," she said. "If Rio was with you at the library... how did she see me and Natasha? And what exactly did she mean by... '<em>collecting</em>'?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled. The playful glint in her eyes dulled instantly, replaced by a cold, heavy seriousness that filled the room like a storm rolling in. She set the pen down carefully.</p><p> </p><p>"Whenever Rio’s with me," Agatha said quietly, "she’s almost never <em>just with me</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda frowned, shifting uncomfortably in her chair. "What does that mean?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back against the desk, crossing her arms over her chest, her expression darkening. "She's working," she said, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>"Working... how?" Wanda pressed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, weighing the words carefully on her tongue. Finally, she locked eyes with Wanda, the weight of centuries — <em>lives lived and lost</em> — pouring into her stare.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Collecting</em>," she repeated, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>"Collecting what, Agatha?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed off the desk, moving to the window. She watched the students outside for a long moment, their laughter distant, faintly echoing against the cold stone buildings.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned back to Wanda, her face pale but steady. "<strong><em>Souls</em></strong>," she said, the word falling like a blade between them.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda inhaled sharply, sitting up straighter, her heart beginning to pound against her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio..." Agatha continued, her voice dropping lower, rougher, "she’s not human. What I'm about to tell you is going to sound fucking insane, Wanda, but…"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her hands trembling slightly by her sides.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>She’s Death</em>, Wanda," she said. "The literal embodiment of Death itself." Wanda’s mouth opened slightly, but no sound came out. "And..." Agatha’s voice cracked now, thick with emotion she couldn’t — didn’t want to — suppress, "I’m falling in love with her."</p><p> </p><p>The confession hung in the air, vibrating with raw, terrible honesty. Wanda could only stare, breathless, as her friend — her strong, proud, invincible friend — looked ready to shatter into a thousand pieces.</p><p> </p><p>"Death? <em>Rio is Death</em>? The Death you kept saying you were seeing and everyone thought you were losing your mind?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded silently, a tight, almost fearful movement. She knew if she ever dared to tell Wanda the full truth — about being a witch in a past life, about Rio being bound to her through those ancient memories — Wanda would have her locked away without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>One thing at a time</em>," Agatha thought grimly. "<em>Piece by piece.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, is this some kind of foreplay between you two or... I don't know, some weird sexual fetish or...?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a low, frustrated growl. Her hand twitched at her side before she rolled her shoulders back dramatically, fingers fussing with the cuff of her crisp white button-up shirt as if preparing for a duel.</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda, what I'm about to do... <em>Please</em>, don't scream. And don't tell anyone."</p><p> </p><p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Wanda narrowed her eyes, taking an instinctive step back, like she was bracing for Agatha to leap at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled deeply, her chest rising and falling slowly. She closed her eyes, sinking into the chair with a weighted exhale, as though reaching deep into a part of herself long buried and dangerous.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice came out in a whisper, soft enough that Wanda had to read her lips to understand. "<em>Rio</em>," Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>She knew — knew with every fiber of her being — that Rio would come. Rio <em>always</em> came when Agatha called.</p><p>The room shifted. The very air warmed, thick with the scent of lavender and honey, an almost overwhelming sweetness that wrapped around them like a comforting blanket. It wasn't a grim coldness, but a tangible love — a devotion so fierce it made the heart ache. And then Rio was there. Silent as a ghost, solid as stone. She appeared behind Agatha, her hands sliding gently onto Agatha's shoulders, her touch brimming with tenderness.</p><p> </p><p>"My love?" Rio's voice was soft, almost reverent. She began massaging Agatha's tense shoulders, her entire focus locked solely on her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and locked her gaze onto Wanda. Wanda stood frozen, mouth agape, skin bleached of all color. Her hands trembled as she stumbled backward, knocking into a bookshelf with a loud thud.</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda?" Agatha called, her voice strained. "Are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Only then did Rio seem to register Wanda's presence.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Shit</em>," Rio muttered, her affectionate demeanor slipping into sharp irritation. "Agatha, can you explain why you summoned me while a <em>human</em>, utterly <em>clueless</em> about what’s happening, is here staring at me?"</p><p> </p><p>"I needed someone to tell me I'm not insane, Rio! I trust her."</p><p> </p><p>“You did a <em>terrible</em> job, honey.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda finally found her voice, though it came out strangled. "Agatha, you’re<em> out of your goddamn mind.</em>" She clutched her chest like she might faint. "I... I need water. I'm gonna be sick."</p><p> </p><p>She stumbled sideways. Agatha bolted from her chair, rushing to catch Wanda before she collapsed.</p><p> </p><p>"See? This is exactly why we don’t do this. We<em> don’t tell humans</em>," Rio said, throwing her arms up dramatically.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio, shut up!" Agatha hissed under her breath, keeping her attention on Wanda. "Oh, come on! Stop being such a drama queen! <em>You gave birth to twins behind your couch for Christ’s sake and—</em>"</p><p> </p><p>She froze mid-sentence. That memory... it wasn’t from this life. It was from before. Before everything. Panic shot through her veins. She couldn’t — <em>mustn’t</em> — say any more.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gripped Agatha’s face with both hands, frantic now. "Agatha, what the hell are you talking about?! You’re Billy's godmother! He was born in a hospital! <em>Are you crazy</em>?!"</p><p> </p><p>Tears pricked at Wanda’s eyes, her nails digging slightly into Agatha’s skin in desperate fear.</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me this is some kind of magic trick," Wanda demanded. "Tell me you didn’t summon Death herself — looking like your hot Puerto Rican girlfriend — like she’s some kind of obedient <em>lapdog</em>!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms. "Rude, not a lapdog" she said, voice low and dangerous. "I’m more like a loyal servant to my queen."</p><p> </p><p>"Rio, not helping," Agatha barked. She turned to Wanda again, heart pounding. "She’s... loyal. That's it."</p><p> </p><p>"Loyal? This has to be a joke," Wanda stammered, her hands shaking. "You’re screwing Death! You left hickeys all over Death’s neck, Agatha!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned beet red. Rio smirked with pride, tilting her head playfully. "She did an excellent job."</p><p> </p><p>"Rio!" Agatha shot her a murderous glare. "Enough with the commentary."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s knees buckled slightly as she sank back into a chair, staring at Agatha like she was a stranger. "You're dating Death," she whispered, her voice hoarse.</p><p> </p><p>"We’re not dating," Agatha snapped, the denial sharp and desperate.</p><p> </p><p>"Yet," Rio added with a lazy, wicked smile. "We have a date tonight."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda's breathing began to steady, though her body remained rigid with suspicion. "Date? Agatha, you never go on dates. Not even with Ralph. What fuck is going on?!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips into a thin line, lowering her gaze. She could feel Wanda's judgment like a physical weight. "Ralph was a mistake, Wanda. You know I never loved him. My mother pushed me into that marriage."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not <em>accusing</em> you, motherfucker!" Wanda said gently, though concern furrowed her brow as she sat heavily in the nearest chair. "But do you have any idea how all of this looks to the outside world, Aggie?" Her voice cracked slightly with worry. "He's missing. <em>Vanished</em>. And you're... you're going on dates with Death."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha winced, reaching for the bottled water Rio had retrieved from the small fridge. She knelt in front of Wanda, offering it with both hands like a peace offering.</p><p> </p><p>"No one knows she's Death except you," Agatha said softly, trying to soothe her. "Maybe Lilia suspects something, but... that's it."</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her distance, sensing Wanda's fragile state. She closed her eyes and, without a word, released a subtle wave of calming scent — a gentle blend of wildflowers and the crisp bite of fresh snow. It filled the room quietly, weaving into the atmosphere and coaxing Wanda's panic into something slower, softer.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda took a long sip of the water, her fingers trembling slightly around the plastic bottle. After a few moments, she asked, voice hoarse, "And the children? Your kids… do they know?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, chewing on her lower lip until it reddened.</p><p> </p><p>"It's complicated. They know Rio's not human. That she's... <em>something</em>. But not what she truly is." Agatha's voice cracked a little with emotion. "They — Nicky and Nick — they’re... they're biologically Rio’s too. They’re not Ralph's children. They never were. <em>They're mine and Rio's."</em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda choked on her sip of water, coughing hard. Her green eyes widened in stunned disbelief. "How, Agatha? That's impossible!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder at Rio, who bit down on her lip to keep from making some smug or mischievous comment. She knew if she opened her mouth, Agatha would not hesitate to throw the water bottle at her head.</p><p> </p><p>"Like I said," Agatha murmured, "it's complicated."</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted slightly, her fingers brushing over the edge of a nearby table absentmindedly, eyes never leaving Agatha. Her whole being ached to touch her — to reassure her — but she stayed put, unwilling to make Wanda’s recovery harder.</p><p> </p><p>"But she’s not here to hurt anyone," Agatha said firmly, squeezing Wanda’s knee for emphasis.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda set the water down with a small clunk, rubbing her face with both hands. "Then why is she here?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes softened, and her shoulders slumped as if the confession weighed more than she could bear. "Apparently... I summoned her. That day we were joking around with the Ouija board, asking about Ralph. My soul — without realizing — called her to me."</p><p> </p><p>Wanda blinked, slow and stunned. "Why?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm still figuring that out, Wanda," Agatha admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. Shame and uncertainty tangled inside her, making her stomach twist. "And... I don't even know if I want to send her away." The words escaped before she could stop them. Her cheeks flushed instantly with embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>Across the room, Rio's heart thundered against her ribs. <em>Agatha doesn't want me to leave</em>, she thought, giddy enough to nearly float. She had to grip the table harder to keep herself grounded.</p><p> </p><p>"But I promise you, Wanda," Agatha said, meeting her friend's eyes with a fierce determination, "Rio won't hurt anyone. It's not allowed."</p><hr/><p>The house had fallen into a rare, peaceful quiet — the kind that only happened when both kids were home, fed, and content. The late afternoon sunlight slanted through the windows, throwing warm golden patches across the hardwood floor. Agatha sat on the couch, twisting a strand of hair around her finger, her stomach flipping nervously. She had barely gotten the words out when Nicole’s head snapped up from her sketchbook.</p><p> </p><p>"You want my help planning a date?" Nicole blinked slowly, like she was staring at some unknown species. Then, slowly, a grin split her face. "Holy crap, who are you and what have you done with my mom?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flushed, flicking a throw pillow at her. "Don’t make me regret asking, Nicky."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole giggled, dodging the pillow easily, her dark curls bouncing. She chewed her lip for a second, thinking hard, and then her face lit up.</p><p> </p><p>"A museum," she said brightly, eyes sparkling. "Take Mama to a museum!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, surprised. "A museum?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicole nodded enthusiastically, scooting closer. Her voice dropped into a more tender tone, almost reverent. "Mama's lived through so many millennia, Mom. She knows all the stories. She used to tell them to me... when I was still in your belly."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath caught. She didn’t remember Rio ever doing that. Not physically. Not consciously. But she did remember those nights — nights when Nicole had been kicking and restless, only to suddenly calm, warmth and serenity wrapping around them both like a blanket. The memory filled her chest with something sweet and aching.</p><p> </p><p>"She would tell me stories of stars being born," Nicole continued, her voice soft and dreamy, "and of oceans carving out mountains. She would hum old songs, too. I couldn't understand the words back then, but it made me feel... safe."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed around the sudden tightness in her throat. She reached out and tucked a loose strand of hair behind Nicole's ear.</p><p> </p><p>"And for dinner," Nicole said, brightening again, "take her somewhere Mexican! Just... not too spicy. Mama's a total baby when it comes to hot peppers."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled "Seriously?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah," Nicole said with a knowing nod. "I saw her once cry trying a jalapeño popper. Total meltdown."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound bubbling out of her without permission, and Nicole grinned proudly.</p><p> </p><p>"Just," Nicole said, her voice turning serious, "don't get all weird about it. Mama loved you. Loves you more than anything."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole flopped sideways, curling into Agatha's lap like a cat, resting her head against her mother's stomach.</p><p> </p><p>"If you took her to a parking lot and gave her a sandwich and orange juice, she'd still think it was perfect."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, smoothing a hand over her daughter's hair, savoring the simple, grounding warmth of the moment.</p><p> </p><p>"One rule, though," Nicole said, her voice muffled against Agatha's sweater. "<em>Never</em> take her to a cemetery."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened slightly. Her fingers paused mid-stroke.</p><p> </p><p>"Why?" she asked, a faint edge of unease in her voice. "She’s…" Agatha cut herself off quickly. Nicole still didn't know the full truth about Rio — who, and what, <em>she truly was</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole shrugged, unconcerned. "She hates ghosts. Says they’re annoying. If you take her there, she’ll spend the <em>whole night</em> arguing with them and forget you’re even there."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head. "Okay, no cemeteries. <em>Got it</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole tilted her head up, her big, wise eyes locking onto Agatha’s with startling clarity.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm glad you're happy, Mom," she said softly. "It makes me happy too." She pointed a small finger at Agatha’s heart. "I can feel it, you know. <em>Here</em>. It's warm. Calm."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed painfully at the sincerity in her daughter's face. "You’re only twelve, baby," she said, stroking Nicole’s cheek. "What do you know about love?"</p><p> </p><p>Nicole smiled up at her, a little sadly, like she knew more than she should.</p><p> </p><p>"Mama used to tell me," she whispered. "I was born from <em>your</em> <em>love</em>. That’s why she found you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked back sudden tears.</p><p> </p><p>"She used to call me '<em>Agape</em>' when I was still inside you," Nicole said, her voice full of wonder. "It means 'love' in Greek." Nicole’s tiny fingers traced a small circle over Agatha’s heart. "She would whisper to me: <em>ftiagmeno apó agápi.</em> <strong><em>Made of love."</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Agatha bent down, pressing a kiss to Nicole’s forehead, her hand trembling slightly against her daughter's skin.</p><p> </p><p>"She wasn’t wrong, sweetheart," Agatha whispered.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The room was filled with golden light, the kind that only comes at the very end of the day, when everything feels softer, slower, almost sacred. And for the first time in a long time, Agatha allowed herself to believe that maybe — <em>just maybe</em> — there was still a future worth reaching for.</p><p>The evening of the date arrived faster than Agatha anticipated. She stood in front of her open closet, glaring at the array of clothing as if the right outfit might magically leap into her arms. The air in her bedroom was thick with the scent of lavender detergent and a faint trace of anxiety.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Agatha," she muttered to herself, flipping through hangers. "You’re not interviewing for a job. You’re not going to war. You’re going on a date. With your..." She paused, the word catching in her throat. "Your <em>maybe-future-girlfriend-who-also-happens-to-be-Death</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Her hands shook slightly as she yanked out a few options, holding them up to herself in the mirror. A black dress — too funeral. A red blouse — too aggressive. A soft cream sweater — too casual?</p><p> </p><p>Nicole peered around the doorframe, chewing on a cookie. She watched silently for a moment before giggling. "You’re being so extra, Mom."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowled playfully at her reflection. "Help me or leave me to die."</p><p> </p><p>"You’re dramatic," Nicole said, hopping onto the bed and crossing her legs. "Wear the green one. It matches your blue eyes. Mama always said you had 'eyes like spring after a storm'."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the green dress — a soft, flowing thing she rarely wore because it made her feel... vulnerable. Seen.</p><p><em>Perfect</em>.</p><p>She slipped it on carefully, smoothing the fabric over her hips, her heartbeat drumming in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Nicole gave a thumbs-up. "Beautiful."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a shaky breath, forcing a smile. She turned to grab her shoes, the room tilting slightly with nerves.</p><p> </p><p>"You’re going to be fine," Nicole said firmly, hopping off the bed to hug her from behind. "She's gonna look at you like you hung the stars."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her daughter's small hands and smiled at their reflection in the mirror. "Thanks, baby."</p><p> </p><p>She just hoped she could survive the night without making a complete fool of herself. Because somehow, deep down, Agatha knew — this night was the beginning of everything.</p><p> </p><p>While Agatha struggled upstairs, Rio was busy descending into a full-blown <em>panic attack</em> in Nick's bedroom.</p><p>Nick, perched casually on his bed, kicked his legs back and forth, sipping from a juice box, watching the chaos unfold with mild amusement. His room smelled faintly of crayons, soap, and the sweet artificial tang of apple juice.</p><p>Rio, in stark contrast, looked like a tornado trapped in human form. She snapped her fingers — <em>again</em> — and another outfit materialized on her body.</p><p> </p><p>"When I grow up, will I have cool powers like that?" Nick asked between sips, his tone completely casual.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunted, tugging at the hem of a black, sparkly dress that clung a little too desperately to her curves. "Not up to me, kiddo. I don't make the rules." She spun around dramatically, holding her arms out. "Okay. This one?"</p><p> </p><p>Nick squinted, wrinkling his nose. "Is Mom taking you to one of those places with the flashing lights and bad music?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. "A clubhouse?"</p><p> </p><p>"That's the word!" Nick snapped his fingers in triumph.</p><p> </p><p>Rio muttered a curse under her breath. Sometimes she forgot he was only seven. "Problem is," she grumbled, snapping her fingers again and changing into something even worse, "your mother didn't tell me anything."</p><p> </p><p>"Ask her."</p><p> </p><p>"It's supposed to be a surprise, <em>genius</em>." </p><p> </p><p>Nick shrugged like the fate of the universe was of absolutely no concern to him. "Then wear something simple. Pants, sneakers, polo shirt. Works for me every time."</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, tossing a hand dramatically against her forehead. "You are seven years old, Nicholas."</p><p> </p><p>"And you're almost late," he pointed out, tapping the face of his roaring dinosaur alarm clock. "It's nearly seven o'clock."</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a strangled sound — half snarl, half whimper — before throwing her arms up in defeat. "Fine! This or nothing!"</p><p> </p><p>In a snap, her final outfit settled around her: a silky black dress that hugged her body just enough to look elegant, but not desperate. The fabric fell to her knees, slightly shorter on the right thigh, with delicate straps brushing against her shoulders. It hinted at her figure without screaming for attention. A pair of modest heels completed the look — just tall enough to be graceful, but practical enough to run if necessary. A subtle shimmer of makeup flickered into place: soft eyeliner, a kiss of color on her lips, a faint glow on her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Nick gave an approving nod. "Now you look good! Less 'girl from another planet', more 'I want to marry Nick's mom,'" he said proudly, throwing both thumbs up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed despite herself, smoothing a hand over the dress. </p><p> </p><p>"She'll like it," Nick added, voice serious for a second. "Now stop freaking out and go wait for her downstairs. And take the flowers."</p><p> </p><p>Rio squinted at him. "Where the hell did you get that idea?"</p><p> </p><p>"One of Nicole's cheesy teen romance books. You should monitor what she reads, by the way."</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted, arching a brow at him. "Tattling on your sister now?"</p><p> </p><p>Nick swung his little legs and slurped the last of his juice noisily, flashing a wide, mischievous grin. "Will you raise my allowance?"</p><p> </p><p>"No."</p><p> </p><p>"Then I'm done talking. Now go before Mom dumps you for someone with actual fashion sense."</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped dramatically. "She would <em>never</em>! No one could ever compete with me."</p><p> </p><p>She strutted out of the room, shoulders squared, confidence forced but convincing. Nick watched her go, grinning to himself before flopping backward onto the bed with a soft whump.</p><p> </p><p>"So cocky," he muttered under his breath, tossing the empty juice box toward the trash can with lazy precision. "She’s lucky Mom loves her."</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Rio stood near the entrance, clutching the bouquet of flowers like a lifeline, her palms sweating slightly against the delicate wrapping. Her heart thudded painfully inside her chest, faster than any battle, any confrontation she’d ever faced. A strange, sweet anxiety coiled in her stomach, rendering her — <em>Death herself</em> — utterly useless.</p><p>When Agatha finally descended the stairs, Rio forgot how to breathe. The sight of her — that soft green dress clinging perfectly to her curves, the warm glow of her skin in the golden light — was enough to completely short-circuit Rio’s mind. She stood frozen, mouth slightly parted, black eyes wide, drinking in every inch of Agatha like a starved woman. She didn't even notice her grip tightening on the flowers until Agatha reached the last step, tilting her head with a small, knowing smile.</p><p> </p><p>"Are those for me, Rio?" Agatha purred, her voice slipping around Rio like silk. She dragged out the name deliberately, a wicked tease that sent a full-body shiver through Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, struggling to remember how speaking worked. "Ah... Yes!" she stammered, thrusting the bouquet forward awkwardly. "They’re — they’re for you. <em>Totally for you</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Her brain scrambled for a cover as she flicked a glance upwards. Nick was perched on the staircase, vigorously shaking his head, mouthing "<em>No</em>!" with exaggerated movements.</p><p> </p><p>"From Nick's..." Rio began, then faltered, catching the warning gleam in Nick’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Your idea?" Agatha asked sweetly, one brow arching, her smile growing sharper — predatory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio coughed into her fist, her cheeks burning. "Yes. <em>Mine</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in slightly, close enough that Rio could smell her — hints of jasmine, vanilla, and something unmistakably Agatha. The scent made Rio’s knees nearly buckle.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought you couldn’t lie, baby," Agatha murmured, her voice thick with amusement and command, tilting her head just enough to make Rio feel pinned in place, prey caught in the careful gaze of a queen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard, fighting the desperate urge to drop to her knees right there. "It’s not a lie," she said hoarsely, "if I say that the idea to create each flower with the exact shade, fragrance, and softness to not overpower you <em>was mine</em>."</p><p> </p><p>A slow, deliberate smile curled Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Nuances," she murmured, accepting the bouquet, letting her fingers brush over Rio’s trembling hand longer than necessary. The electric contact burned down Rio’s spine, making her pulse roar in her ears. "You know how to play with words, don't you?" Agatha teased, voice dipped in honey, but her eyes — those stormy eyes — were sharp, dominant.</p><p> </p><p>"It’s a gift," Rio whispered, unable to resist the smile tugging helplessly at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened — just a fraction — before she lowered her lashes demurely and extended her free hand, palm up. "Shall we?"</p><p> </p><p>The invitation wrapped around Rio's senses, sweet and commanding all at once. She barely managed a nod, stepping closer and slipping her hand into Agatha’s. The warmth of her skin made Rio want to fall to her knees again, to press her lips to that palm and vow herself to her forever.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, please," Rio said, voice rough, almost pleading. "Before <em>your</em> children embarrass me to death."</p><p> </p><p>“My now, hum?” Agatha chuckled low in her throat and turned her head toward the staircase. Nicole and Nick were both there, beaming like proud, mischievous conspirators.</p><p> </p><p>"Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!" Nicole called out, a wicked gleam in her eye. "Be back before 10 PM, and <em>no alcohol</em>!"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, squeezing Rio’s hand. "Nicole," she said in a dangerously sweet tone, "go to hell."</p><p> </p><p>Nicole grinned even wider, victorious. "I’ve waited my whole life to throw that line back at you, Mom. Have a great date!"</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned under her breath, letting Agatha pull her gently toward the door. "<em>Your</em> kids terrify me," Rio muttered.</p><p> </p><p>"Good," Agatha said, giving her a sidelong smile that promised far more trouble later. "They’re supposed to. <em>Because they're also yours.</em>"</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the evening air wrapped around them, soft and cool, carrying the faint scent of blooming flowers and fresh-cut grass. Rio inhaled deeply, trying to ground herself, trying not to show how badly she was already crumbling under Agatha's effortless dominance.</p><p> </p><p>Tonight wasn’t just a date. <em>It was surrender</em>.</p><hr/><p>The car slid into a parking spot just across the street from the museum, the old building lit beautifully against the velvet night sky. Agatha killed the engine and started reaching for the door handle, but a warm, trembling hand wrapped around hers, anchoring her in place.</p><p>She turned her head, her gaze falling onto Rio. Rio’s fingers were tight around Agatha's, her skin hot, almost feverish to the touch. Her eyes — those molten amber eyes — seemed to glow under the dim light of the dashboard, filled with something raw, something vulnerable.</p><p> </p><p>"You want something, honey?" Agatha asked, her voice teasing, yet soft, sensing the crackling nerves in the air between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted closer, her breath hitching.</p><p> </p><p>"Can I..." she swallowed, the words tangling in her throat. "Can I kiss you? You look <em>so</em> beautiful, Agatha. <em>So perfect</em>. It's almost sinful just sitting here, staring at you and doing nothing. Like I'm throwing a gift from God away."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's heart gave a painful, sweet squeeze. She smiled, slow and decadent, and reached up to cup Rio's face. Her thumb traced lightly along Rio’s cheekbone, feeling the subtle tremble under her skin. Rio instinctively leaned into the touch, a soft, nearly inaudible whimper escaping her. She nuzzled Agatha's palm like a starving kitten, her golden eyes fluttering closed for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>"Uhm..." Agatha hummed, her tone playful as she dragged a teasing finger over Rio's lips, feeling them part slightly under her touch. "You always lean in like such a needy little thing. Like a stray kitten who hasn't been fed."</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her eyes, heavy-lidded and filled with desperate affection.</p><p> </p><p>"But usually," Agatha continued, her smirk deepening, "the kiss comes at the end of the date."</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a low, frustrated growl in her throat, a sound so soft and broken it sent a delicious shiver down Agatha's spine.</p><p> </p><p>"I still have your lip prints and teeth marks on my neck from last night. Just because the public can't see it, it doesn't mean that is gone! So don't play coy now, Agatha Harkness," Rio muttered, her voice rough with longing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha threw her head back and laughed — a rich, glorious sound that filled the small car and made Rio's heart ache with want. Without giving herself time to think, Agatha bent down and captured Rio's mouth in a quick, hot kiss. It was a tease, a wicked promise. The moment Rio tried to deepen it, Agatha pulled away, a wicked gleam in her eye.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm a respectable woman, you know," Agatha said, voice thick with mock innocence. "You'll have to work harder if you want more tonight."</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a strangled groan, slumping against the seat as Agatha stepped out of the car with feline grace. The door slammed shut with a satisfying thud, leaving Rio reeling inside. Moments later, Agatha appeared by her door, bowing slightly in an exaggerated, elegant gesture, her hand extended like a courtly knight.</p><p> </p><p>"Milady?" she said, voice dripping with playful authority.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took her hand with a huff, rising from the seat with as much dignity as she could muster.</p><p> </p><p>"You're still the same manipulative witch," she muttered under her breath, unable to suppress the fond smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s arms slipped easily around her waist, drawing her close. "And yet," Agatha whispered against her ear, "it didn’t stop you from crossing the multiverse for me, did it?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio's breath hitched. Her hands fisted weakly in the fabric of Agatha's dress.</p><p> </p><p>"No," she admitted, voice cracking just slightly. "Nothing could."</p><p> </p><p>For a second, they just stood there, wrapped around each other in the cool New York night, the faint sounds of traffic and the rustling of distant leaves barely reaching them.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha pulled back, brushing a kiss against Rio’s temple. "Come on," she said. "I'm dying to hear your <em>stories</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Rio stiffened, panic flaring hot in her chest. <em>Stories</em>. Her mind flashed, unbidden, to Eva’s warning, to the guilt simmering inside her like a poison. For a second, she thought Agatha meant those stories — the ones soaked in blood and betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>"About what?" Rio asked sharply, panic making her voice too high.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, oblivious to her turmoil, pointed across the street to the brightly lit sign: <u><em>MUNICIPAL MUSEUM OF NEW YORK.</em></u></p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breathless laugh, her whole body sagging with relief. "<em>Oh</em>!" she gasped, her mouth forming a perfect 'O'.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised a brow, amused. "What did you think I meant?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing," Rio lied quickly, lacing their fingers together and tugging Agatha toward the entrance. "Come on! I want to introduce you to some old friends from the Jurassic."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha allowed herself to be pulled along, her smile lingering. The night had only just begun — and beneath all the laughter, all the teasing, something darker and heavier simmered, waiting. But for now, there was only this: the warmth of their joined hands, the thrum of possibility, and the sparkling lights of the museum welcoming them inside.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The museum air was crisp and faintly perfumed with old stone, varnish, and time itself. Rio dragged Agatha eagerly from one exhibit to another, her fingers laced tightly with Agatha’s as she practically vibrated with excitement. Her voice was a soft, unstoppable current in the vast halls, gushing with endless stories.</p><p> </p><p>"This," Rio said, pulling Agatha toward an ancient pottery collection, "was actually slightly different in another life. The designs were more geometric."</p><p> </p><p>She flashed Agatha a proud, dazzling smile, like a kid showing off a prized toy.</p><p> </p><p>"And this?" She pointed to a primitive map. "Total fabrication. It wasn't like that at all. Humans are so creative with what they don't know."</p><p> </p><p>Her happiness was palpable — the way she glowed, the way she barely touched the ground when she walked, how her amber eyes shimmered every time she shared a piece of herself. Agatha followed silently, her heart swelling with something too big, too warm to name.</p><p>They finally stopped in front of a meteorite display, encased in shimmering glass and bathed in soft blue light. The massive, dark stone glistened like a fallen star.</p><p>Rio released Agatha's hand and approached it revently, fingertips ghosting over the barrier.</p><p> </p><p>"This one," Rio breathed, her voice turning low and reverent, "came from a planet humans will never even imagine. A world that bloomed with creatures made of light and sound. When it shattered, those beings died screaming songs that no ear here could ever comprehend."</p><p> </p><p>Her voice cracked just slightly, emotion bleeding into every word.</p><p>Agatha didn't hear the museum's low hum or the soft murmurs of other visitors anymore. She only saw Rio — this ancient, beautiful soul pouring herself out like a prayer. She realized, in that still moment, what made her different now from the Agatha she had once been: <em>she would never again tell Rio to leave</em>.</p><p>Without thinking, without caring, Agatha closed the distance between them, grasped Rio's jaw between her hands, and crushed their mouths together. Gasps erupted from a few nearby tourists, but Agatha couldn't have cared less. She only tasted Rio — the faint bitterness of her lipstick, the salt of almost-shed tears, the trembling life of her. Rio stumbled back a step, stunned. Her lips were flushed and parted when Agatha finally, reluctantly, pulled away.</p><p> </p><p>"Ahn..." Rio murmured, her voice thick with shock and wonder. "Not that I'm complaining but—"</p><p> </p><p>"<em>I love you</em>," Agatha said, the words tumbling over each other in a rush. Her hands trembled slightly where they cradled Rio's face. "<em>Don't leave</em>. I don't care what memories come. I don't care about the pain. I want you."</p><p> </p><p>Tears welled in Rio's amber eyes, clinging to her lashes. "And what if there are things I need to tell you? Things that might hurt you? Things that might be... <em>my fault</em>?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's thumb brushed a tear before it could fall, gentle and sure.</p><p> </p><p>"What if," she whispered, tucking a strand of Rio's hair carefully behind her ear, "we live this together first... and figure the rest out after?"</p><p> </p><p>"Agatha—"</p><p> </p><p>"Rio," Agatha interrupted, her voice dipping into a dangerous, commanding softness that made Rio’s knees weaken. She leaned in close, almost purring against Rio's skin. "Do you want to end up like that herd of dinosaurs you told me about?"</p><p> </p><p>"Triceratops," Rio corrected automatically, a broken little laugh escaping her.</p><p> </p><p>"Those Triceratops," Agatha repeated, nipping lightly at Rio's earlobe, "who spent their last days worrying about the bright star in the sky and forgot to live at all."</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her chest heaving.</p><p> </p><p>"No..." she whispered, haunted by the memory of those gentle beasts dying scared and confused.</p><p> </p><p>"Then," Agatha said firmly, pressing their foreheads together, "whatever it is you're carrying, baby, you tell me later. Tonight is ours."</p><p> </p><p>"<em>You're going to send me away</em>," Rio said, her voice cracking. "Again."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha growled low in her throat — a warning, a reprimand. "<em>Enough</em>," she said, pressing her face into Rio's shoulder, breathing her in. Warmth. Salt. Life.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled back slightly, cupping Rio's chin and forcing her to meet her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>"Rio," she said, and the tone — sharp, commanding — made Rio’s spine straighten automatically. "I didn't plan this date to play 'good Christian' and only sleep with you after marriage. I planned this because it was the only way I could show you that all your talk about reincarnation, fate, and connections? <em>I believe it</em>. I believe <em>you</em>."</p><p> </p><p>She leaned closer, her breath hot against Rio's mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"I wore this dress, put on the best damn lingerie I own, and yes, I even shaved everything," she hissed, between clenched teeth, her voice low and sultry. "So don't you dare <em>mess this up</em> for me now."</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes widened slightly, her throat bobbing with a hard swallow.</p><p> </p><p>"Now," Agatha continued, her fingers tapping lightly against Rio’s lips, "you're going to be good and behave for me tonight, you’re going to shove all those intrusive thoughts deep, <em>deep down</em>, and go back to rambling like the adorable nerd you are. Talk to me about — I don't know — that turtle over there."</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked rapidly, her mouth twitching toward a smile. "It's a tortoise."</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Rio</em>," Agatha growled warningly.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, okay!" Rio laughed, light finally returning to her eyes. "Let's talk about the tortoise."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, exasperated but fond. "You're like a child sometimes!"</p><p> </p><p>"You love it," Rio teased, bumping her shoulder against Agatha's.</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time that night, Rio let herself believe that maybe — just maybe — they could have this.</p><p> </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<em>They could have everything.</em>

<span>The restaurant was a hidden gem tucked away between towering buildings, its brightly colored facade glowing warmly against the evening chill. Inside, the scent of roasted peppers, cumin, and fresh lime clung thick to the air. Strings of lights crisscrossed the ceiling, casting everything in a soft, golden haze. </span>
<span>Agatha led Rio to a cozy booth in the corner, sliding into the seat with a grace that made Rio's stomach tighten painfully. Rio followed, her hands fidgeting with the hem of her dress as she tried — and failed — to keep her eyes off Agatha. </span>
<span>The waitress appeared quickly, dropping off menus with a bright smile. Rio barely glanced at hers. Her attention was glued, helplessly, to the woman across from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's lips curled into a slow, dangerous smile. "You're staring, baby," she murmured, voice pitched low enough to make Rio's skin pebble with heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, clearing her throat. "Can't help it. You look like..." She waved a hand helplessly. "Something no one should ever be allowed to <em>touch</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand, her gaze heavy and knowing. "But you can touch." Rio's breath hitched. She gripped the edge of the table harder. "Just not here," Agatha added wickedly, dragging her tongue slowly along the edge of her bottom lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned under her breath, slumping back against the booth. "Cruel woman," she muttered. </span>
<span>Agatha merely smiled, the glint in her stormy eyes promising far worse to come.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the food arrived — tacos, enchiladas, rice, and beans — the spicy aromas made Rio's nose twitch. She eyed the bright red salsa suspiciously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha caught the look and smirked. </span>
<span>"Relax, baby. I ordered the mild one. I’d rather not watch you cry over jalapeños again."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed indignantly but picked up a taco anyway, biting into it carefully. The flavors exploded on her tongue — savory, bright, a little heat dancing at the edges — but manageable. She moaned softly in approval.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a rich, indulgent sound. "Good?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Heavenly," Rio said around another bite. "You’re not just beautiful, you're a genius."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cocked her head, feigning surprise. "Was that a compliment and an admission of my superiority in one sentence?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wiped her mouth, licking her fingers clean with slow, deliberate strokes that made Agatha's thighs press tightly together under the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Don't get cocky," Rio murmured, her eyes dark with mischief. "You’ve still got to survive dessert."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow, intrigued. "Dessert?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Mm-hmm." Rio leaned in, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I may or may not have plans for you involving something sweet, messy, and totally sinful."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth went dry. She sipped her margarita slowly, trying to hide the flush creeping up her neck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's foot brushed hers under the table, a teasing little nudge. "You okay, darling? You look a little flushed," Rio teased, her smile downright predatory now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, tapping her nails lightly against her glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Careful," she said softly, voice like velvet-wrapped steel. "If you keep teasing me, I'll make sure you regret it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's pupils dilated beautifully. "Promise?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's answering smile was pure danger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They ate slowly, savoring every bite, every glance, every brush of fingers over the table. Time seemed to stretch and slow between them, every sensation heightened — the spicy tang lingering on their tongues, the scratch of the rough napkin against their fingertips, the low hum of mariachi music swirling in the background.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Halfway through their meal, Rio wiped her mouth and leaned back, grinning. "You know," she said, "the first time I ever had tacos, it was in Mexico, obviously. But it wasn't just any tacos."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, swirling her drink lazily. "Oh? Do tell."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's grin widened. "There was this little old lady. Must’ve been at least ninety. Ran a taco stand in the middle of nowhere — one of those places you’d drive past if you blinked too long."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, intrigued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Anyway," Rio continued, laughing softly, "I showed up to... well, to collect her soul."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. "Romantic."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Very," Rio said dryly. "Only she refused. Flat out. Told me — and I quote: <em>'I'm not dying until I finish feeding all these idiots properly.'</em>"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted into her drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And she meant it," Rio said, eyes gleaming. "She kept cooking. And cooking. And glaring at me like I was the worst inconvenience of her entire existence."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Did you at least get a taco out of it?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"She threw one at me," Rio said proudly. "Hit me square in the face. Best taco I ever tasted."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, laughing. "You got assaulted with Mexican food and called it a win."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It was a spiritual experience," Rio said solemnly, placing a hand over her heart. "She finally let go three days later. But not before teaching me how to make her secret salsa."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wiped a tear from her eye, still laughing. "You’re unbelievable."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "You love it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s answering look was soft and heated all at once. "I do."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tension simmered low between them again, but it was different now — gentler, richer. Not just lust, but something warmer, something binding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When dessert arrived — a decadent plate of churros drizzled with chocolate and caramel — Rio’s eyes lit up like a child on Christmas morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh, this was worth crossing dimensions for," she said, grabbing one and taking an exaggerated bite, chocolate smearing the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip to suppress a laugh — and the sudden, overwhelming urge to devour her whole. Instead, she reached across the table slowly, wiping the smudge from Rio’s lip with her thumb. Rio caught her hand in hers and kissed the pad of her thumb, holding Agatha’s gaze with a hunger that made Agatha’s stomach flip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You're playing with fire," Agatha warned, her voice low and dangerous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled sweetly, the very picture of innocence — if innocence had molten gold for eyes. </span>
<span>"Burn me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a low, sinful sound that promised that when they left this restaurant, there would be no more holding back. No more teasing. Tonight, they were finally going to devour each other, heart, soul, and body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha waited at the counter to pay for their dinner, Rio lingered behind, rocking back and forth on her heels, her hands tucked behind her back like a mischievous child. She couldn’t stay still; the energy buzzing inside her demanded to spill out. So she did what she always did when she was nervous or too full of life: she talked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Did you know," she said to no one in particular, her voice low and playful, "that chocolate was considered the food of gods long before humans made it a dessert? I met the Mayans once — very serious about their chocolate." She chuckled under her breath. "They'd be horrified by Hershey bars."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wandered a few steps closer to Agatha, who was fishing through her purse, pretending not to listen but smiling to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And once," Rio continued, picking up a brightly colored pepper from a decorative basket near the counter, "someone challenged me to eat the hottest chili in the world. I agreed. I almost cried."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Behind her, a small noise — half cough, half chuckle — made Rio turn her head. </span>
<span>An old man stood behind them in line, no taller than Rio's shoulder. His weathered skin was lined with deep, beautiful wrinkles, and his eyes — a sharp, dancing brown — held a lifetime of stories. His gray hat was tucked under one arm, and he listened, utterly baffled, to Rio’s enthusiastic ramblings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Jóvenes," he muttered in Spanish, shaking his head as if only the folly of youth could explain such nonsense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, tilting her head mischievously toward him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"La amo, señor," she said, switching effortlessly into Spanish, her voice softening. "Tengo que contarle muchas historias. No quiero que se aburra conmigo."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The old man’s stern face cracked into a slow, knowing smile. He responded in heavily accented English, his voice rich and gravelly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"That is how I conquered Amélia, my wife. I talked. Too much." His eyes twinkled. "When I left for long trips and returned, she said I spoke even more. So..." he shrugged. "She kept me close. To make me talk less."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed warmly, crossing her arms and leaning in slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Women are ingenious, no?" she teased, one eyebrow arching dramatically. "Always planning."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Behind the counter, Agatha’s head snapped up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Rio, honey," she said warningly, her voice laced with that particular brand of command that made Rio’s stomach flip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio flashed the old man a quick smile and whispered in Spanish, "I told you so!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha finished paying with a practiced flick of her card, then grabbed Rio’s hand with a firm grip and tugged her outside into the cool night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The parking lot was mostly empty, quiet except for the distant hum of passing traffic. Rio barely had time to catch her breath before Agatha spun, pinning her between the car and herself with an easy, dominant grace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's palm braced against the metal near Rio's head, her body radiating heat and intent. "Ingenious, am I?" Agatha murmured, her voice like a silken whip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio licked her lips, heart hammering. "It was a compliment," she said defensively, pressing her back against the car like it could somehow save her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's mouth curved into a slow, dangerous smile. She leaned in, her breath brushing Rio's ear, making her shiver deliciously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It better have been, Vidal," she whispered, her fingers trailing lightly down Rio’s side, setting every nerve ablaze. "I'd hate to think I put all this effort into tonight only for you to slander me to a little old man."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed breathlessly, tilting her chin up in open defiance. She kissed the corner of Agatha’s mouth, a soft, teasing brush that left Agatha’s pulse roaring in her ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Feedback time," Rio whispered against her lips. "Five stars. Excellent choice of venue. Amazing food. Perfect company." Her smile turned wicked. "Docking one star because the end of this date hasn't had a real kiss yet."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darkened, her pupils dilating, her body humming with restrained power.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And who," Agatha murmured, trailing her fingers along Rio’s jawline, "said this is the end?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned in, her voice dropping into a growl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Get in the car, Rio. <em>Now</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The command vibrated through Rio's entire body, sharp and intoxicating. She swallowed hard, her thighs clenching instinctively. Without another word, Rio slipped around Agatha, her hands trembling slightly as she opened the passenger door and slid inside. Her chest rose and fell in quick, shallow breaths as she buckled her seatbelt with clumsy fingers, watching Agatha circle the car like a predator.</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The cabin Agatha had rented sat nestled deep in the woods, tucked away from the world, wrapped in the cool night air and the scent of damp pine. The interior glowed with soft golden light, the fireplace crackling gently, filling the space with warmth and the faint smell of burning cedar. Rio practically skipped inside, her heart racing with excitement. No neighbors. No noise complaints. No interruptions. Just them. Just Agatha. </span>
<span>She spun around in the middle of the cozy living room, arms spread wide, a gleeful grin lighting up her face. </span>
<span>But then — a flicker of worry. She stopped, turned sharply toward Agatha, who was setting down their bags by the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And our kids?" Rio asked, a furrow forming between her brows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slowly, one eyebrow arching with supreme patience.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>My God</em>, Rio. The kids are fine. Alice is with them." She crossed her arms, her hips cocking slightly in that way that made Rio’s mouth go dry. "I'm not a negligent mother."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I never said that," Rio said, lifting her hands in surrender. "I'm trying to show that I'm a responsible mother too."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, but her lips twitched, betraying her amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And a not-so-responsible <em>girlfriend</em>," she muttered, voice dripping with sarcasm. "I've been standing here for five minutes, and you were perfectly content gawking at a plant above the fireplace."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, sauntering closer, her gaze slipping languidly over Agatha's body, still wrapped deliciously in that now slightly rumpled green dress.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It's a rare species," Rio said innocently, trailing her fingers lightly along Agatha's arm, her touch feather-soft, setting goosebumps in her wake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>Rio</em>," Agatha warned, her voice low and dangerous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You called me your girlfriend," Rio teased, her arms sliding around Agatha's waist, pulling their bodies flush together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened slightly, but she didn't pull away. Her heart was hammering against her ribs so hard she was sure Rio could feel it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I did not," Agatha said through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Yes, you did," Rio sang, her breath ghosting over Agatha's jawline, her lips brushing teasingly close. "And I liked it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed a kiss just under Agatha's ear, slow and lingering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It sounds good when you say it. Say it again," Rio murmured, voice dipping low, thick with need.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No," Agatha snapped, trying to push her away, but Rio held firm, a wicked smile curling her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Agatha..." Rio’s voice turned honey-sweet, coaxing. She kissed down the slope of Agatha's neck, each touch making Agatha's knees weaken. "Repeat it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha growled deep in her throat, her control slipping by the second. "Fuck you," she spat, though the bite was half-hearted at best.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled darkly, her lips finding the sensitive skin just above Agatha's collarbone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'd much rather you fuck me," Rio whispered against her skin, her hands sliding down to squeeze Agatha's hips possessively. "But first... I'll make you say it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She kissed her way back up, slow and relentless, every movement calculated to break Agatha down, to make her melt. Agatha's breath hitched, her nails digging into Rio's arms as she fought a battle she was already losing. </span>
<span>The fire crackled louder in the silence between them. The scent of cedar and smoke curled around them, wrapping them in something primal, intimate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally let her head fall back slightly, exposing her throat in a silent surrender she hadn't even realized she was giving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled against her skin, triumphant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Soon," she whispered, voice like a promise. "You'll say it. You'll beg for it, my love."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha knew, with a dark, thrilling certainty, that she would. Tonight, she would lose herself completely — and she would love every second of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t hesitate. She surged forward, cupping Agatha’s jaw and kissing her — not gently, not sweetly, but like she was claiming what had always belonged to her. Her mouth was hot and insistent, tongue tasting, teasing, devouring. She pulled back just an inch, enough to look into Agatha’s eyes, which were already heavy-lidded and stormy with want. </span>
<span>Agatha smiled, slow and heady, and took a single step backward. Just one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all Rio needed to follow, eyes locked, a silent challenge burning between them. Rio grabbed her again, their mouths colliding in a mess of breathless moans and bruising affection. Tongues tangled, teeth scraped. It was all hunger and ache and years of restraint unraveling. Agatha stumbled back, spine hitting the wall with a muffled thud, her breath catching on a gasp. She barely had time to react before Rio's hand slammed against the wall beside her head, caging her in. The next kiss was even deeper, sloppier. A shared exhale. A collision of heat and longing. </span>
<span>When Agatha moaned into her mouth, Rio smiled against her lips, something dark and satisfied curling at the corners of her mouth. Agatha's hand trailed down the length of Rio's waist, her fingers mapping familiar territory with reverence. She slid over the curve of Rio's hip, then lower, gripping the back of her thigh and tugging it upward, curling it around her own waist. Her palm dragged up warm, golden skin as her fingers brushed under the hem of Rio's dress. The bronze of Rio's thigh was burning under her touch. She could feel the tension in the muscle, the soft tremble just beneath the surface. Perfect. Every inch of her. </span>
<span>Rio groaned low in her throat, thrusting her hips forward, the motion deliberate, designed to steal every last thought from Agatha's head. Her hand roamed up Agatha's torso, slipping over her ribs, cupping a breast through the thin fabric, then up to the hollow of her throat. She kissed Agatha again, deeper, tilting her chin to take more, take everything. Their bodies molded together, heat and friction, breathless need curling tighter with every second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Fuck," Agatha gasped when Rio bit her bottom lip, not hard enough to hurt, but with enough pressure to steal the strength from her knees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was going to fall apart. Standing there. Fully clothed. In Rio's hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dipped her head, mouth trailing down Agatha's neck — nipping, sucking, tasting. Agatha was burning, every nerve lit up, her senses overloaded. The smell of Rio — salt and warmth and summer nights — wrapped around her. Her touch. Her breath. </span>
<span>Every kiss down her throat was a confession. Every flick of tongue was a plea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whimpered, voice caught on the edge of desperation. "Honey..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused. Her lips still brushing skin. Her voice low and hoarse, saturated in desire. "What am I to you, Agatha?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to speak, but her mouth went dry the second Rio's hand slid lower and cupped her breast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I didn’t hear you," Rio whispered against her pulse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"My girlfriend..." Agatha exhaled. Her voice fractured, her mind reeling. </span>
<span>Agatha opened her eyes, saw her face — flushed, breathless, pupils blown wide. </span>
<span>"But you're more than that," Agatha whispered, her hands rising to cradle Rio's face. "You're the missing half. The reason I called you. The ache I couldn’t name. <em>I missed you so much it hurt</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, confusion washing over her features. "What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha touched her forehead to Rio's, eyes fluttering shut. "Sending you away? It broke me. But the ache stopped the second you came back. I remembered something — something about soulmates. That when you find yours, staying away becomes agony."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's breath hitched, her lips parting like she was going to speak, but no words came. "Who told you that?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I don’t remember," Agatha murmured. "I think I read it... maybe long ago. But I remembered it the night you gave yourself to me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes shimmered, the red tinge of unshed tears glowing at the edges. Then a tug in her wrist. Not pain — but a pull. She glanced down, startled, but there was nothing there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Still, she felt it.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Does it still hurt?" she asked, turning back to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. "When you’re not with me, yes."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gritted her jaw, leaning in again, forehead pressed to Agatha's. Her voice shook.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Then I’m not going anywhere. Never again.” Rio didn't wait.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She surged forward again, crashing her mouth onto Agatha's with a hunger that tasted like lifetimes of longing. Their lips met in a bruising kiss, breath colliding, teeth grazing, tongues tangling. There was no grace now — only need. Rio kissed her like she would die without the taste, like the only oxygen she understood came from Agatha's lungs. Their bodies moved together in a messy, urgent rhythm, like waves crashing against each other. Rio gripped Agatha's hips with both hands, dragging her closer until there was no space left, no thought left, no barrier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She guided Agatha backward, walking her blindly through the cabin. They bumped into a chair, stumbled into a wall. Neither cared. Agatha's back hit the bedroom door. Rio kissed her again, harder this time, grabbing a fistful of Agatha's hair to tilt her head just right. </span>
<span>Then, they fell. The bed creaked under their weight as Rio climbed on top of her, straddling her waist, her thighs tight around Agatha's hips. Her lips found Agatha's again, and her hands explored greedily — touching, squeezing, claiming every inch of skin she could reach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped as Rio kissed down her throat, the warmth of her mouth leaving a trail of fire in its wake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You're mine tonight," Rio whispered between kisses, her voice gravel and velvet. "<em>All mine</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's fingers dug into Rio's back, nails leaving crescent-shaped marks in her skin. But just as Rio moved to pin her down again, Agatha shifted beneath her. In a sudden, fluid motion, Agatha twisted their positions, flipping Rio onto her back and pinning her wrists down against the mattress. The dominance in her eyes was unmistakable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I don't want you taking control from me," she said, voice low and commanding, her breath hot against Rio's lips. Her grip tightened around Rio's wrists. "You know your place, Lady Death."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's breath caught, her pupils expanding with delight. Her body arched subtly beneath Agatha, not in defiance, but in offering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>If you want to be in control</em>..." Rio whispered, her voice suddenly soft, reverent. "<em>You can be</em>. It’s okay."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gentleness in her tone sent a shiver down Agatha's spine. A flicker of something ancient passed through her mind — a memory of cold tile, a metal table, and Rio looking down at her in a dimly lit room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked it away. "I want you to bind your wrists."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I didn’t exactly bring cuffs, Agatha," Rio said, teasing, her smile cocky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in, her nose brushing Rio's. "We both know you don’t need them. <em>The roots</em>. The ones you used that night. Around my waist. Use them now."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's smile widened slowly, the mischief in her face folding into something darker, more intimate. "Want to pick the color? Thorns? No thorns? Flowers?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her voice dipped an octave. "Tight."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"As you wish," Rio murmured, her lips brushing Agatha's cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From beneath the floorboards, the air shifted. Thick, dark vines emerged from the wooden cracks like breath summoned from the underworld. They slithered with eerie precision up the bedposts, curling up the headboard in slow, serpentine movements. </span>
<span>Agatha watched, eyes dark with hunger, as the vines reached Rio's wrists and wrapped around them like lovers claiming flesh. They twisted, coiling tighter, pulling her arms above her head. The vines made soft creaking sounds as they stretched and locked into place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, her breath hitching when the bark bit lightly into her skin. The tension on her arms was firm, immovable — but never painful. Her eyes met Agatha’s again, gleaming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Like this?" she asked, giving the roots a testing tug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, her eyes trailing over Rio’s body with a heat that scorched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Perfect, my love," she said, her voice rich, breathless. She lowered herself, hovering just inches from Rio's face. "Now," she murmured, brushing a strand of dark hair from Rio's cheek, her lips ghosting over her jaw, "let’s see how long you last like this."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's answering smile was half challenge, half worship. "Forever, if it's you above me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's eyes burned with a dark, feral hunger as she lowered herself over Rio, their bodies separated only by the thin, useless scrap of silk still clinging to Rio's frame. Slowly, agonizingly slow, Agatha slid her hands up Rio's sides, gripping the flimsy fabric of her dress. With a predatory smile, Agatha tore it. The sound of ripping fabric echoed in the quiet cabin, sharp and raw, and Rio gasped, her back arching instinctively into Agatha's touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Really?" Rio managed to mutter through her heavy breathing, a teasing glint still flickering in her molten eyes. "You always end up ripping my clothes. I'm starting to think you have a vendetta against my wardrobe."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's fingers dug into Rio's hips, hard enough to leave bruises later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>Quiet</em>," Agatha warned, her voice a low growl that vibrated against Rio's skin. The command was absolute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a wicked smirk, Agatha slid down Rio's body, her hands hot and deliberate. She hooked her fingers into the waistband of Rio's panties — the last barrier — and dragged them down in a slow, agonizing movement, exposing every glorious inch of bronzed, trembling skin. </span>
<span>The second Rio opened her mouth to make another smart remark, Agatha was ready. She balled up the delicate lace and shoved it between Rio's lips, muffling her. Rio's eyes widened slightly in shock, a muffled whimper escaping her, but she didn't spit it out. She bit down on the fabric, chest heaving with need.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, dark and feral, her hand cupping Rio's jaw to keep her still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Keep that there until I tell you otherwise, <em>understood</em>?" Agatha murmured, her voice low and thick with control.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered, nodding frantically, her thighs trembling from how close she was already.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You like this, don't you?" Agatha teased, her hand trailing down Rio's throat to her chest, barely brushing, making her shiver. "You like being controlled. You, Lady Death, all-powerful... brought to your knees because someone — because <em>I</em> put you beneath them."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moaned around the makeshift gag, writhing helplessly under Agatha's gaze. She tried — pathetically — to rub her thighs together for relief, but Agatha pinned her hips down with one strong hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No," Agatha whispered, her breath hot against Rio's ear. "Stay like this."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, drinking in the sight: Rio spread open, wrists bound above her head by writhing roots, flushed, dripping with need. Her body practically vibrated with desperation, the scent of her arousal thick in the air. </span>
<span>Agatha reached for her phone and, with a smirk, began to take pictures. Flash. Rio gasped, blinking against the light, her cheeks flaming. Flash. Another angle — lower, closer, capturing every shameful, glorious detail.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Every time I have you like this," Agatha purred, snapping another photo, "I'm going to take a picture. So when you aren't here... when I need you..." She dragged her hand lightly over Rio's trembling inner thigh, making her jolt. "I'll have something to look at. Something to <em>touch myself</em> to."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a choked, desperate sound, her eyes fluttering shut. Agatha tossed the phone aside, sliding her palms slowly up Rio's thighs, deliberately avoiding where she was soaking wet and begging for attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You like massages, don't you, baby?" Agatha cooed, her voice dripping with mock sweetness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered, her hips arching off the bed, pleading silently. Agatha laughed darkly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh, not for you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sat back slightly, pulling her dress higher up her own thighs, her hand sliding up slowly, leisurely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"This massage is for me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could only watch, helpless, panting, as Agatha touched herself — teasing, slow, savoring — while keeping Rio pinned down, bound, silenced, and dripping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You just watch, my love," Agatha whispered, her eyes burning into her. "You don't get to move. You don't get to come. Not until I say so."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio — <em>Death herself</em> — could do nothing but obey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straddled Rio with slow, deliberate grace, one knee on either side of Rio's trembling waist. The green dress clung to her in wrinkled folds, hitched high enough to reveal the creamy expanse of her thighs. Her hair was a wild, glorious mess, cascading around her flushed face like a storm. </span>
<span>One hand slid between Agatha's own legs, fingers slipping under the hem of her panties, while the other pressed firmly against the center of Rio's chest, pinning her down, feeling the frantic hammering of Rio's heart beneath her palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha began to move — small, slow circles of her hips, grinding against her own hand, a torturous rhythm that made Rio whimper brokenly around the balled-up fabric stuffed in her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span><em>She never looked away</em>. Not once. Her eyes locked on Rio's — dark, possessive, drinking in every desperate twitch, every glistening tear, every futile yank against the roots binding her wrists. </span>
<span>Rio’s hands were flushed red from pulling and tugging, veins straining against her skin. She could snap the roots. She could tear the gag from her mouth. But she didn't. She stayed. </span>
<span>Because she <em>wanted</em> this. </span>
<span>Because she <em>needed</em> this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>My wicked little witch</em>," Rio thought through the haze of need, grinding her hips up involuntarily. "<em>Some habits never die</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her head back with a soft, broken moan, her body arching beautifully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh, baby," she gasped, her voice trembling. "You feel <em>so</em> good... you make me feel so, so good. I want you so deep inside me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio choked on a cry, her body bucking helplessly underneath Agatha, desperate for friction, for touch, for anything. </span>
<span>Agatha only ground down harder, her fingers pressing firmer against herself through the soaked fabric of her panties, a dark wet spot blooming in the center. Her movements became sharper, more desperate, her breathing ragged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm so ready for you, Rio," she moaned, her voice wrecked, raw. "I'll keep those photos… my trophies for every day you’re not here. I'll scream your name so loud you’ll have no choice but to crawl back to me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a strangled whine, yanking at the roots until her muscles burned, but she still couldn’t free herself. <em>She was caught. Owned. </em></span>
<span>Agatha picked up the pace, grinding faster, rubbing herself against her own hand — every breath, every shudder spilling into Rio's skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Calm, baby," Agatha whispered, her voice breaking with the effort. "You'll get your turn… just… oh fuck… just watch…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Uhm!" Rio cried out, her eyes wide, tears slipping free from the corner of her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's body tensed, her thighs trembling around Rio's hips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Fuck! I'm coming! I'm fucking coming so hard, baby!" she cried, head thrown back, the cords of her throat standing out as she convulsed, riding the waves of her release against Rio's trapped, trembling body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sight — Agatha breaking apart above her, undone and wild — <em>was too much</em>. </span>
<span>Rio came without warning, the orgasm tearing through her like a violent storm, her body shaking so hard the bed frame rattled. She bit down on the gag, muffling a scream that would have shattered the walls. </span>
<span>The cabin filled with the sound of their gasps, the heady, musky scent of sex, the electric crackle of power slipping loose. </span>
<span>Agatha finally collapsed, her body draping bonelessly over Rio’s, their hearts pounding against each other, frantic and uncoordinated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Fuck," Agatha murmured against Rio’s shoulder, her voice slurred with exhaustion and bliss. "That was so good..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Uhm..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled weakly, pulling the soaked lace from Rio's mouth and tossing it aside carelessly. </span>
<span>She cupped Rio's flushed, tear-streaked face and kissed her — slowly, deeply — as if she could pour every unspoken word of devotion directly into her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"See, my love," Agatha whispered against Rio’s lips, "if you behave next time... maybe I’ll let you speak."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could only nod weakly, utterly broken, utterly hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air clung thick with woodsmoke and salt-slick skin, the crackle of the fireplace harmonizing with Agatha's uneven breaths. Her lungs still heaved as if the storm outside had taken residence in her chest, her gaze locked on Rio's-a collision of ember and obsidian. The tension between them hadn't softened; it throbbed like a living thing, primal and hungry, its rhythm syncing with the pulse visible at Rio's throat. </span>
<span>Agatha rose from the bed, the shift of her weight whispering through the mattress. Her fingers curled around the hem of her dress, deliberate as a blade unsheathed. Rio's lips parted, her breath hitching as the fabric slithered upward, revealing the pale slope of Agatha's thighs, the dip of her waist, the swell of her breasts bathed in firelight. The dress pooled at her feet like fallen snow, and Rio's tongue darted over her lower lip, tasting the metallic tang of desire sharp on her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span><em>God.</em> Agatha was a vision-golden light licking the sweat-damped curves of her body, shadows pooling in the hollows of her collarbone. Her hair, a wild spill of ink, framed cheeks flushed rose-pink, her mouth still bruised from earlier conquests. But it was her eyes that undid Rio: molten amber, dark with promise, the glint of a predator savoring the hunt. </span>
<span>Agatha climbed atop her, knees bracketing Rio's hips, and their skin met -a searing contrast of cool silk and fevered bronze. A shared shudder rippled through them, Agatha's exhale trembling against Rio's lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's head sank into the pillow, a ragged groan tearing from her throat. "Fuck!" Her voice frayed at the edges, hips arching instinctively. "You did research, didn't you? Christ-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A low, smoky laugh rumbled in Agatha's chest as she leaned close, her breath hot against Rio's ear. "That mouth of yours…” Her nails scraped lightly down Rio's ribs, savoring the flinch it provoked. "So disrespectful. Shall I silence it again, baby?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's throat bobbed, her wrists straining against the vines pinning her to the bed. "<em>No</em>, my love," she rasped, the plea raw. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's smirk was a blade's edge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm forty and a grown woman. Just because I haven't fucked a woman before you, that doesn't mean <em>I don't know how</em>." she murmured, rolling her hips in a slow, deliberate grind that dragged a whimper from Rio. "I've waited forty years to learn the shape of your hunger too." Her palm slid up Rio's abdomen, fingertips tracing the serpentine tattoos coiled there. "And now that I have you..." She punctuated the words with another roll, the friction drawing a broken cry from them both. "I intend to savor every inch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's back arched, her muscles taut as bowstrings. "Agathah! Please…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Hush." Agatha's command was velvet-wrapped steel. She gripped Rio's jaw, forcing their eyes to meet. "Release the roots. Wrists only. Support yourself on your elbows."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The vines slithered from the headboard, serpent-quick, coiling tighter around Rio's wrists as she obeyed. The new angle deepened the contact, and Agatha's next thrust wrenched a sob from Rio's chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"There," Agatha purred, her lips trailing fire down Rio's throat. "<em>Good girl</em>. So good for me." Her teeth grazed Rio's pulse, tongue soothing the sting. "But patience, honey. We're not racing."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's laugh came out strangled. "Says the witch with her claws in my soul."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled, her gaze narrowing playfully. "Careful." She yanked Rio's hair, baring her throat fully. "Or I'll make you beg to come until your voice cracks." Her free hand slid between them, calloused fingers brushing Rio's thigh. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? My proud Death, reduced to whimpers?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's hips jerked, her breath a shattered thing. "Fuck! Yes."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Tsk." Agatha nipped her earlobe. "Greedy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She resumed her torturous rhythm, each roll of her hips a masterstroke-slow, calculated, igniting sparks where their bodies fused.  </span>
<span>Rio's moan dissolved into a whine, her thighs trembling. The room swam with scent-sandalwood oil from Agatha's skin, the musk of sweat, the faintest hint of rosemary tangled in the sheets. Every sound amplified: the wet slide of skin, the creak of the bed, Agatha leaned down, pressing her lips to Rio's chest, trailing soft kisses before wrapping her mouth around one breast, suckling gently. Her hands roamed the bronze expanse of Rio's body, fingertips dancing over every tattoo, memorizing every line and curve. </span>
<span>She slid one hand into Rio's hair and gave a firm tug, tilting her head to expose her throat. Agatha nuzzled into the damp, hot skin, kissing down its length. She could feel every flutter of Rio's pulse. Rio bucked her hips, desperate for more, but Agatha clamped a hand on her hip to still her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Slow down, baby. Look at me," Agatha ordered, her voice fraying for the first time. When Rio obeyed, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, Agatha's resolve faltered. A softness crept into her touch, her thumb brushing Rio's cheekbone. "Be good for me, okay, big girl? Can you do that? I want to come with you, but I need just a little more.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard. "I can help. Let me use my hands. Please, I can make you come."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled against her skin. "I <em>know</em> you can. But I don’t need your hands for that." She shifted slightly, rolling her hips forward again, the contact slick and perfect. "There are other parts of your body I can use."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned deep in her chest, burying her face into Agatha's shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I’m going to move slowly. Just to build it. Don’t be clever now, Rio."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Fuck," Rio gasped, trembling. "The witch in you never dies."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled darkly, her breath ghosting over Rio's throat. "No, baby. You brought the witch back, remember?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air hung thick with the scent of salt and arousal, every breath Agatha took laced with the heady musk of Rio's skin. She moved with the precision of a predator, her hips rolling in slow, sinuous arcs that dragged a whimper from Rio's throat. The room seemed to shrink around them, the only sounds the ragged symphony of their breaths and the slick slide of skin against fevered skin. Agatha's gaze, sharp as a blade, never left Rio's face-watching, always watching, as if cataloging every twitch of her lips, every flutter of her lashes. </span>
<span>Agatha pressed downward, the heat between them a live wire. Rio's back arched off the sheets, her nails scoring crescent moons into Agatha's shoulders. The friction was exquisite, maddening-a blend of velvet and fire that left Rio's thighs trembling. Agatha could feel the way Rio's pulse raced beneath her fingertips, a wild drumbeat against the fragile cage of her ribs. She reveled in it, in the power to unravel her, to make her burn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Fuck-" Rio choked out, her voice splintering as she bit into the flesh of her forearm. The taste of copper bloomed on her tongue, a desperate anchor against the storm building in her veins. Her body quaked, every muscle coiled like a spring, toes curling into the rumpled sheets. Agatha's rhythm stuttered, just once, betraying the ache pooling low in her own stomach. But she wouldn't break. Not yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Still think I'm just a novice, baby?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha purred, her breath hot against Rio's ear. The words dripped with honeyed condescension, her lips grazing the shell of Rio's ear before nipping at her jaw. Her hand slid up Rio's side, nails skimming ribs, leaving trails of goosebumps in their wake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's laugh came out broken, half a sob. "You're a fucking evil witch!" Her hips jerked upward, seeking more, always more, but Agatha pinned her wrists to the bed, her grip iron-clad. The dominance in that touch — the unyielding certainty — sent a fresh wave of heat crashing through Rio. She strained against her, a futile rebellion that only made Agatha's smirk deepen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh?" Agatha tilted her head, feigning innocence as she ground down harder, slower, the angle deliberate. Rio's breath hitched, a shattered moan escaping her. "Then I must've been worse to deserve remembering." Her voice dropped to a velvet growl, fingers tightening possessively around Rio's jaw. "Or perhaps you simply crave the worst of me, honey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's reply dissolved into a gasp as Agatha shifted, her hips moving in sharp, punishing circles. The room swam — a blur of sweat — slicked skin and tangled sheets, the taste of salt and desperation on Rio's lips. She could smell Agatha's perfume, jasmine and smoke, clinging to her throat like a promise. Every nerve screamed, every touch a brand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Agatha!" Rio's voice cracked, her thighs clamping around Agatha's hips in a vain attempt to steady herself. "I-I can't… If you keep going, I'm going to-!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not yet." The command was a whip-crack, Agatha's free hand tangling in Rio's hair, yanking her head back to expose the fluttering pulse at her neck. Her lips hovered there, teasing the frantic beat. "Look at me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes flew open, dark and drowning. Agatha's gaze held hers — a tempest of hunger and control — and Rio felt herself fracturing under that stare. Her chest heaved, tears of frustration pricking her lashes, but she nodded. Obedient. Hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Good girl," Agatha murmured, reward and threat entwined. She slowed her movements again, a torturous glide that drew a sob from Rio's chest. "You'll take <em>what</em> I give you. When <em>I</em> give it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's whimper was music. Agatha drank it in, her own restraint fraying. She could feel the tension coiling in Rio's belly, the way her breath came in shallow, stuttering bursts. It mirrored her own, the ache between her thighs, the sweat slicking her spine, the primal need to claim, to conquer. But she held firm, her thumb brushing Rio's lower lip, smearing it with the salt of her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Please," Rio begged, the word ragged, raw. A crack in her defiance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's smile was a blade. "Now, baby. Come with me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The permission shattered them both. Rio's cry echoed off the walls, her body bowing as pleasure ripped through her, white, hot and relentless. Agatha followed, her own climax a silent scream, teeth sinking into Rio's shoulder to muffle the sound. The world blurred, a cacophony of sensation, of tangled limbs and shared breath, until all that remained was the aftershock, trembling and sweet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha collapsed beside her, their foreheads pressed together, hearts pounding in tandem. Rio's fingers traced her cheek, reverent. "Still a witch," she whispered, voice hoarse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha caught her wrist, pressing a kiss to her palm. "And you still come to find me, hum?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, taking a deep breath, calming her heart. Her body was burning, burning and... For the first time, weak, without any strength for anything. She missed feeling like this so much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you, Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you… <em>Death</em>.”</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The pale light of early morning filtered through the windows of the cabin, casting long, golden stripes across the floorboards and the tangled mess of blankets on the bed. The world was still, the air heavy with the scent of last night — sweat, skin, cedar smoke, and a lingering trace of lavender from Agatha's shampoo. Outside, birds began their quiet song, distant and unintrusive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stirred beneath the blankets, her bare skin prickling as the warmth she instinctively sought was gone. She reached out with a sleepy grumble, fingers blindly clawing at the empty space beside her, nails catching on linen as cold as river stones. Her brows furrowed, tendons in her neck tightening as she dragged her palm across the mattress in widening arcs, sheets hissing like static beneath her frantic search. Still nothing. The blankets had cooled, the spot beside her long abandoned. Slowly, she blinked her eyes open, vision adjusting to the soft morning light. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Empty.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bed. The room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Empty.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her heart slammed in her chest so hard and fast it made her breath catch. Her throat closed, and a weight settled on her ribs, sharp and cold. She sat up suddenly, the covers slithering from her body like shed skin, and scanned the room with wide, desperate eyes. Sunlight caught the sheen of sweat blooming along her collarbone as she twisted toward the door, her hair a wild halo of knots. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>Agatha</em>!” she called, her voice high, edged with panic. It cracked from the force, from the terror bubbling beneath the surface. Her hands fisted the sheets, fabric tearing faintly under her grip.  “Ag—!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The voice came from behind the slightly ajar bathroom door, followed by the sound of quick steps — bare feet slapping against pine planks — and the flutter of a towel hitting the floor. Agatha emerged, her hair damp and curling around her shoulders like ink spilled on parchment, her skin flushed pink from the scalding shower she favored. Droplets trailed down her sternum, disappearing into the towel hastily knotted at her chest.  </span>
<span>She moved without hesitation, the mattress dipping under her knees as she climbed onto the bed. Her hands — still steaming faintly from the heat of the water — framed Rio’s face, thumbs sweeping over the high curve of her cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Baby,” she murmured, her voice soft but urgent, grounding. Her breath smelled of mint, her pulse visible in the flutter beneath her jaw. “What is it? I’m here. What happened?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth quivered, a tear breaking free to carve a path down her cheek. Agatha caught it with her thumb, but another followed, then another. Rio’s lower lip jutted out in that telltale pout, her nostrils flaring as she fought for air. Her chest rose and fell in uneven hitches, ribs straining against skin as her fingers clawed at the sheets, twisting them into ropes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…” she started, her voice fraying to a whisper. She bit down on her lip hard enough to blanch the color from it, but her eyes betrayed her — pupils blown wide, lashes clumped with tears. “I thought you’d *gone*. I woke up and you weren’t here, and the bed was cold and I… I couldn’t breathe—” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, her shoulders softening as she leaned in. Her lips brushed Rio’s temple, lingering there as if sealing a vow. “Shhh,” she breathed into her skin, arms encircling Rio’s trembling frame. She pulled her close, one hand cradling the back of Rio’s head, fingers tangling in her hair. Rio collapsed into her, face burrowing into the damp hollow of Agatha’s neck, inhaling lavender and the salt of her own tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would I leave, Rio?” Agatha whispered, her voice roughening. Her palm slid down Rio’s spine, pressing firmly between her shoulder blades as if fusing their heartbeats together. “What’s scaring you like this? I told you, I’m not going anywhere. Not now. Not again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio clung tighter, arms banding around Agatha’s waist like iron. Her nails dug half-moons into the witch’s lower back, as if testing her solidity. Agatha didn’t flinch. The towel slipped, pooling around their legs, but neither moved to fix it. Sunlight gilded the water droplets on Agatha’s shoulders, turning them to liquid gold as Rio’s tears dampened her skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio finally spoke, her words were muffled, raw. “Agatha, we need to talk.” Her voice splintered, but she forged ahead, fingers flexing against Agatha’s hips. “I know you asked me to wait, but I can’t anymore. I need to tell you what I’ve been holding in. Please.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just enough to look into her face, her gaze sharpening. Her thumbs traced the wings of Rio’s eyebrows, smoothing the tension there. There was no hesitation in her eyes — only patience, and something fiercer underneath. Love. The kind of love forged in pain, in shared history, in loss and reunion. A love that had learned to hold its ground.  </span>
<span>She nodded once, a sharp dip of her chin, then shifted back. The headboard creaked as she settled against it, morning light painting her body in amber. Beads of water slid down her chest, catching in the dip of her clavicle. She patted the space between her legs, the invitation clear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come here, baby” she said softly, voice brooking no argument. Her hands opened, palms upturned — a surrender, a summons. “Sit. Talk to me. Say whatever you need. I’ll listen to all of it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her throat bobbing as she swallowed. Then she crawled forward, movements stiff with the weight of centuries. She settled between Agatha’s thighs, her back pressing into the witch’s chest, their skin sealing together. Agatha’s arms encircled her, hands clasping over Rio’s white-knuckled fists in her lap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat like that for a breath, then two. The room seemed to hold its own breath — sun motes frozen in the air, dust suspended, even the birds outside falling silent. </span>
<span>Rio rested her head on Agatha’s shoulder, her breath brushing lightly over the curve of her collarbone, grounding herself in that quiet, human rhythm. It was the safest place she knew, that space between Agatha’s neck and shoulder where her own fears seemed to evaporate. But this time, the silence around them didn’t soften the weight on her chest. It pressed harder. The echo of her sister’s words thundered through her thoughts, harsh and inescapable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>If he kills himself, the one responsible for his death will be you. </span>
</em>
<span>The words lingered like smoke, acidic in her throat. </span>
<span>She swallowed it down and began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I know I told you I couldn’t tell you everything, my love," Rio murmured, her voice quiet, measured — like stepping out onto ice she didn’t trust. “And it wasn’t a lie. I really can’t. I’m not supposed to. But the situation… it escalated. It slipped from my hands, and even my siblings, they can’t reel it back in."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt Agatha’s fingers brush gently through her hair, pulling the long dark strands over her shoulder, exposing her neck. A soft kiss was pressed against the faded bruise Agatha had left the night before, tender and possessive. Rio exhaled, but the comfort didn’t last.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Remember when I told you I couldn’t risk you remembering everything at once? That it could break you?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Yes," Agatha said simply, her voice neutral but not cold. There was an edge there, sharp and waiting. "You’ve been very clear about that."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly, her heart pounding harder with every word she tried to form. Her pulse roared in her ears, louder than it should have been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I had my reasons. And I still believe in them. But I broke those rules, Agatha. I broke them once. And I did it... for selfish reasons. For jealousy. For anger. And also... to test what would happen if I ever tried it on you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled, just for a moment. Not a flinch. Not a jerk. Just a subtle shift in breath, in presence. A tightening beneath the skin. </span>
<span>Rio turned slightly, needing to see her — needing to look directly into those eyes that always, somehow, saw too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I showed Ralph everything. All of his lives. All the deaths. But especially that one — the one where he lived alongside you when you were still a witch. When you broke his mind and made him yours."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression didn’t change much, but the temperature in the room dropped a degree.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>What</em>?" she said, and it wasn’t a demand, not quite. More like a gasp that forgot how to form a question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Please," Rio said quickly, her hand reaching for Agatha’s arm, anchoring. "Let me finish. You can decide what to do with me after. Just let me tell it first."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded once, slow, the weight of her gaze pinning Rio in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"At first, it was meant to be a trial. I couldn’t risk you losing your mind if I made you remember too much too fast, so I needed to test the reaction. And then… then he hit me. Not physically. But emotionally. The way he treated you. The way he looked at our children like they were nothing but weights around his neck. Like you were disposable. And <em>I lost it</em>. I got angry. I got mean. I didn’t filter the memory. I didn’t isolate a single thread. I dumped everything into him."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused, her throat tightening again. A small flower bloomed in the center of her palm, something wild and violet, curling under her fingers. She stared at it like it could absorb her shame.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"He broke. He absolutely shattered. And somehow, all the rage in him didn’t turn toward me, even though I’m the one who did it. He focused it all on you. He wanted revenge."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move. She hadn’t blinked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And then he... attracted something. Someone from my past. A force. You’d call her a woman in red. A seductress. But she’s not. She’s vengeance, Agatha. The Spirit of Vengeance. She doesn’t want lovers. She wants to plant the seed of hate and watch it rot everything."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice came low and strained. "So... the woman Ralph was involved with—"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Wasn’t human. She was vengeance. She fed him poison, not just of the body, but of the soul. She whispered to him in the dark. She helped him plan ways to hurt you. Eva… Life, she tracks Vengeance for this exact reason. And when she found out it was here, near you... near us... she intervened."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"The food poisoning," Agatha said, the words falling slowly from her lips like bricks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Was an attempt on your life," Rio confirmed. "He wanted to kill you. And Eva knew that if he did, I’d kill him in return."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked once, her breath catching. "You told me it was forbidden. That you can’t."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Forbidden, yes. Impossible? <em>No</em>. If someone takes you from me, Agatha, I will unmake them. I will dissolve their soul into particles and scatter it across the void. I will face whatever divine punishment comes. But I will end them."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice was no longer gentle. It was ancient, brimming with a power that didn’t belong in a mortal world. Her eyes glowed briefly, a glimmer of green beneath amber, unnatural and terrifying. </span>
<span>And then, just as fast, it passed. She looked down, ashamed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Eva made him disappear. She didn’t kill him, just... made him run. Hid him from the Vengeance and from me. Told him it was the only way to protect himself from me. And he listened."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A silence stretched between them, heavier than anything Rio had ever felt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's voice came carefully. "And now? Where is he?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her palms into her eyes and exhaled sharply before lifting her gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"We don’t know."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders slumped as if the weight of the cosmos pressed down on them. The small violet flower she’d conjured in her palm trembled like a dying star, its petals quivering under the weight of her guilt. The scent of crushed lavender — sharp and sweet — pricked the air as she clenched her fist, obliterating the bloom. A puff of iridescent pollen shimmered briefly, catching the morning light like fractured stardust before dissolving into nothing. Her fingertips lingered in the air, stained faintly gold, as though even the remnants of her magic refused to let her forget.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t care that he was gone,” Rio said, her voice raw, stripped bare. The admission tore from her throat like glass, each word laced with the metallic tang of shame. “Not until now. I didn’t think he would become a problem. Not like this.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat statue-still, her posture a study in controlled stillness. Sunlight sliced through the cabin window, gilding the fine edges of her hair into a halo of fire, but her eyes remained winter-cold, analytical. Slowly, deliberately, she reached for Rio’s wrist. Her thumb traced the ridges of the other woman’s knuckles — a touch feather-light yet searing, as if mapping the fault lines of a earthquake. When she spoke, her voice carried the crisp precision of a scalpel.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you not know where a soul ended up?” The question hung in the air, sharp as frost. “Aren’t you — aren’t all of you —s upposed to be responsible for them?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio flinched. The scent of cedar smoke from last night’s fire clung to the room, suddenly suffocating. She nodded once, the motion jerky, mechanical, as if her body resisted the truth. “We are,” she admitted, her voice fraying at the edges. “Every soul, every timeline, every transition. But when a soul is forced to absorb all of its lives at once — every memory, every desire, every trauma, every failure —” Her breath hitched, the words clotting in her throat. “— it becomes untethered. It begins to bleed between realities, between versions of itself. And when that happens, it no longer exists in one place. It’s... fragmented.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows knit together, her lips parting slightly. A strand of damp hair clung to her neck, trembling with the faint pulse beneath her skin. “Fragmented?” she echoed, the clinical edge in her voice cracking, just barely.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rubbed her forehead, the heel of her hand grinding into her temple as if to crush the truth into something smaller. Her body curled inward, knees drawn to her chest, arms locked around them like chains. The wool blanket scratched against her bare legs, abrasive and grounding. “He’s slipping through realities,” she whispered. “His soul isn’t anchored. It’s leaping from lifetime to lifetime, in his mind, but also in his essence. And the more it jumps, the harder it is to trace.” Her voice dropped, hollow. “We’ve seen it happen before. People who go too deep into past-life regression. Just one or two lifetimes unlocked can destabilize a soul. But Ralph... I showed him everything. All at once. And now...” She swallowed, the sound audible. “His soul is desperate. Lost. And his time is unraveling.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The cabin plunged into silence, thick and cloying, broken only by the creak of the bedframe as Agatha shifted. Morning light crawled across the floorboards, pooling at the edge of the bed like molten gold, yet its warmth stopped short of their tangled limbs. Agatha’s gaze dropped to the blanket, her fingers tightening imperceptibly on Rio’s wrist before she lifted her eyes.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean his time is running out?” Her voice was steady, but the vein fluttering in her neck betrayed her. “If he’s dying, you should be able to feel that, shouldn’t you? You told me before. When it’s time, you know.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated. The taste of bile rose in her throat — acrid, unforgiving. Her mouth opened, closed, then opened again, the words clawing free. “That’s the problem. I don’t feel him. I don’t sense the moment of his death because it doesn’t exist on any timeline yet. He hasn’t chosen a moment. He hasn’t died.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed her face into her knees, her hair a dark curtain shielding her from the world. The scent of Agatha’s shampoo — lavender and something earthier, like vetiver — drifted through the space between them, a cruel comfort.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Time — my brother, Benny — he told Eva that Ralph is fraying. That his timeline is breaking down, because he’s spiraling. If he keeps going like this, he’s going to kill himself. And because I’m the one who did this to him — because I broke him —” Her voice splintered. “— I’ll be the one held responsible.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t blink. But her breath quickened, shallow and uneven, as she leaned forward. Her hand rose, cool fingertips brushing Rio’s cheek to tilt her face upward. The touch was gentle, but her eyes burned with a ferocity that could melt glaciers.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And why does that scare you so much?” she murmured, her thumb swiping away a tear that hadn’t yet fallen. “Why are you this afraid of a little punishment?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s amber eyes flickered, molten and vulnerable. “Because I don’t know what it would be. None of us do. Death is not supposed to take life. Not directly. Not ever.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, raw with terror. “If I cross that line, I don’t think they’ll kill me, Agatha. I think they’ll tear me apart. Strip me down to the essence and bury me in the void, piece by piece.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A single tear escaped, carving a path down her cheek. Agatha caught it with her thumb, her own breath stuttering.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I don’t want to risk that any of those pieces are <em>you</em>.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move when Agatha reached for her, not at first. She simply let herself be pulled into the witch’s arms, her face nuzzling against Agatha’s neck as if drawn by magnetic force. The embrace wasn’t just warm — it was grounding. Agatha wrapped her arms tightly around Rio’s trembling frame and pressed a kiss to her shoulder, letting her lips linger against the skin that still carried the scent of dreams and rain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled back only enough to look into Rio’s face, brushing a dark strand behind her ear, the pad of her thumb smoothing under her eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she murmured, her voice low but certain, “Can I tell you something now? Since you’ve told me everything?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a moment. Her throat bobbed as she swallowed, anxiety flickering like a flame in her amber eyes. But she nodded. Agatha tilted her head slightly, reading every subtle movement of Rio’s expression before she spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already knew you had done something to him,” she confessed. “Even when you denied it. Even when you insisted you hadn’t touched him directly. I just... knew. It didn’t make sense, Ralph vanishing like that right after you came back into my life. And then there was how protective you became, even when it wasn’t necessary. You always told me I couldn’t send you away until I figured out the reason, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She waited, giving Rio space. </span>
<span>Rio broke eye contact, looking down as shame curled like vines around her ribcage. Her voice was small.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t about my memories,” Agatha continued. “It was about him. Wasn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, then slowly nodded. “Yes. It was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because I wanted to stay,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking around the truth. “I wanted to be near you. Every second I could have. I knew that when you found out, you’d hate me. And when you did... you'd send me away again. And I would obey. Just like <em>I did the first time</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply, her fingers stilling against Rio’s skin. Her brows pulled together as a flood of conflicting emotions swept through her — tenderness, frustration, aching grief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When you say it like that,” she said, her voice tightening, “it sounds like you <em>want</em> me to hate you again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reacted immediately, her arms locking around Agatha’s waist, burying herself in her again. Her voice cracked, almost a plea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. No, please. That’s not what I want. I just... If you hate me, it makes it easier to go. Like I’m doing something <em>good</em> by walking away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed silent for a beat. Then she gently but firmly pulled away, cupping Rio’s jaw so she had to look at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t remember exactly why that other version of me hated you, or why she pushed you away. Maybe it was because of Nick. Maybe it was something else. But what I do know — what I feel now — is that hating you doesn’t fix anything. I tried, Rio. I tried being afraid of you, mad at you, rejecting everything you are. And all it did was hurt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took Rio’s left hand, slowly lifting it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When you’re not with me, it feels like my left arm is being fucking torn off. Like something vital is being ripped away from the core of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked fast, then reached for her own wrist, fingers curling instinctively around it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said, barely a whisper. “I feel it too. That tug, that pain — it’s there every time you pull away. When I see my sister again, I’ll ask what that means.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled faintly and leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s cheek. “Okay. But for now, just stay close.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a long pause, filled only by the sound of their breathing and the wind outside rustling lightly through the trees. Rio looked down for a moment, her mood shifting, a strange smirk playing at the corner of her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There is one more thing I should probably tell you,” she said, clearly stalling for drama.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Do I want to know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned sheepishly. “You know that cop? Daniels? The blond one with the eyebrows that look like they belong to a cartoon villain?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “Yes. He's very insistent."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah… well, he’s my brother. Benny… Time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, incredulous. “That guy is <em>Time</em>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. I didn’t recognize him with that horrible bleach-blond hair until Eva told me. Honestly, it was giving me psychic damage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a bark of laughter before collapsing back onto the bed, pulling Rio down with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gods help me,” she muttered. “I’m dating Death, being hunted by Vengeance, and Time wears bad dye jobs. What is my life?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio giggled, curling against her. “Your life is with me, Agatha. Completely.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed lowly, running her hand through Rio's hair, holding her closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good. Because I’m not letting you go.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The cabin still smelled faintly of last night’s fire — embers and smoke woven into the fabric of the thick blankets. Morning light pooled gently across the floorboards, filtered through pine branches outside the windows, lending everything a golden, sleepy glow. Agatha stood barefoot in the small, rustic kitchen, her robe cinched loosely at the waist, sleeves rolled to her elbows as she quietly whisked eggs in a chipped ceramic bowl. </span>
<span>The coffee machine hummed softly behind her, and bacon sizzled in the skillet, its rich scent curling through the air, mingling with the sharp aroma of fresh herbs she’d sprinkled into the eggs. A loaf of rustic bread rested on the counter beside sliced avocado and fruit, the table already set with simple porcelain dishes and a vase that still held yesterday’s wilting flowers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, soft footsteps creaked across the wood. </span>
<span>Agatha turned slightly to find Rio still gloriously naked, hair tousled and body kissed with marks and warmth from their night together. Her skin smelled like skin, like sex, like shared heat and breathless need. Agatha blinked, her fingers pausing in the bowl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said, raising her brows. “I love you. Deeply. Wildly. But I need you to do me a favor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, amused. “Oh? And what would that be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha set the whisk down with a clink, turning to face her fully. “Put on some clothes. And take a shower. Please. I can’t think when you smell like last night and<em> look like that</em>. I have eggs to cook, and you’re distracting me on a molecular level.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, full and rich, and kissed Agatha’s cheek before disappearing into the bathroom. The sound of water running joined the kitchen symphony a moment later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio returned, her hair was slightly curled at the ends from the heat of the water, and she wore soft blue shorts and a white tank top that clung gently to her curves, her skin flushed with warmth from the bath. </span>
<span>Agatha turned just as warm arms wrapped around her waist from behind. She leaned back instinctively, her smile already forming as Rio pressed her face against her shoulder blade.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I could sacrifice my immortality for this,” Rio murmured against her skin, voice still hoarse from sleep, the clean scent of soap clinging to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled low in her throat, setting the whisk aside and placing a hand over Rio’s. “Sacrifice your immortality for breakfast?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For you,” Rio clarified, nuzzling in. “For this. The quiet. The warmth. You. <em>Us</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked and glanced over her shoulder, arching an eyebrow. “You say that now, but would you still say the same if the package deal included two very loud children? One who asks a question every five minutes and the other currently discovering the joys of mood swings, sarcasm, and slamming doors?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back just enough to turn Agatha around and meet her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can be very patient when I need to be,” she said with a small, sincere smile. “So yes. Even with the mood swings and existential questions about the universe before breakfast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha softened, her smile growing as she leaned forward to kiss Rio gently, brushing the tip of her nose afterward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would be interesting to watch,” she murmured, the affection in her tone wrapped around each word. Then she nudged her chin toward the table. “Now, go add something alive to the vase, would you? I’ve made peace with the fact that you insist on leaving plants everywhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned dramatically but moved to the table, her fingers twitching. With a slow inhale, she coaxed small, cheerful sunflowers to bloom, unfurling from thin green stems. They curled toward the morning sun as if pleased to exist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There,” she grumbled. “Nature has spoken.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, scooping the eggs into a bowl and placing everything on the table. “Eat. We’ve got to check out in an hour.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked in betrayal. “Do we </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> to leave?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her meaningfully as she poured coffee into two mugs. “You said you’d give up immortality for this. That means you’re also volunteering to take the kids off my hands this weekend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s... not what I said,” Rio muttered, but her eyes glinted with humor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer and looped her arms loosely around Rio’s neck, her tone dropping an octave, soft and wicked against the shell of her ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>You</em> placed them in me, Vidal,” she purred. “<em>You</em> claimed the title of mother. Now go be one. I want to sleep in, <em>undisturbed</em>. And maybe drink an </span>
<span>entire glass of wine at noon while you explain to Nick why he can’t build a robot that farts glitter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shivered, both at the voice and the threat. “You are the most dangerous woman I’ve ever loved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha placed a kiss on her shoulder. “And yet, here you are. Now eat your eggs, Death. You’re on duty today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned again but sat, snatching a piece of bacon and dramatically biting into it. “This better come with a nap later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you survive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cruel woman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t forget it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The drive back home was quiet but comfortable. The hum of the road, soft music on the radio, the warmth of the sun through the windows — it all felt like a continuation of something precious. Rio kept stealing glances at Agatha while she drove, fingers brushing lightly over the other woman’s hand resting on the gearshift. She didn't say much, but the weight in her chest had eased. For now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrived, the house was filled with the distant sound of cartoons and a crash that made both women freeze for half a second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was either a lamp or Nick building something illegal again,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked. “Guess it’s time to embrace motherhood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole appeared first, standing at the top of the stairs with a smug expression. She wore one of Agatha's oversized flannels and held a book in one hand like a gavel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re late. And you smell like sin,” she said, nose wrinkling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good to see you too, baby,” Rio replied, walking past her and kissing her on the cheek. “We brought breakfast leftovers."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Still not enough to excuse the trauma of hearing Mom <em>moan</em> your name through the walls last week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “Nicole!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? I have ears. <em>And trauma</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick came barreling into the hallway next, covered in glitter. </span>
<span>“Mama! I made a robot!” he shouted. “It needs a name!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He proudly held up what appeared to be a chaotic fusion of Lego bricks, pipe cleaners, and what looked suspiciously like one of Agatha’s missing measuring spoons.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that my spoon? And are those the herbs from the apothecary drawer?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick beamed. “Yes! It smells magical!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could process a response, Alice — still in yoga pants and a loose cardigan — strode into the hallway with a travel mug in one hand and an utterly exhausted look in her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you. But never again,” she said flatly to Agatha. “Your children are <em>possessed</em>. By chaos. <em>Possibly demons</em>. Definitely glitter. I’m out.” </span>
<span>She handed Rio a note with scribbled emergency contacts and bolted through the front door with the speed of someone escaping a haunting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her go and then turned slowly back to Rio. “Let me be perfectly clear,” she said, raising a hand for silence, “every single problem in this house from this moment forward is happening because I am <em>officially off duty</em>. I am on maternity leave from motherhood. All questions, complaints, emotional breakdowns and glitter-related accidents now go to <em>you</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole blinked. “That’s not how parenting works.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick started bouncing on his feet. “Mama, do robots have souls? Do you think I can build one that has one? Do we have more glitter? I need more glitter! Also, I think I might’ve fed the cat cereal with energy drink—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Whos cat?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait—” Nicole jumped in. “Also! I think I started my period but I don’t know if it’s real or if I just sat in grape juice. And also, someone used all the hot water, <em>AGAIN</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mama, I think I found a spell in that book you told me not to read—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mom, Rio, someone needs to explain boundaries to Nick. He made the robot kiss my book and said it had a crush on my fanfiction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked from one child to the next, her expression quickly dissolving into something halfway between horror and emotional whiplash. Her hands lifted like she might physically ward off the flood of information.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>Wait, wait</em>! One at a time! I don’t — there are too many words happening—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the wall, sipping her coffee with a small, satisfied smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you,” she said, eyes twinkling. “<em>Cosmic punishment</em>. And you're welcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned to her with wide eyes and muttered, “You’re evil.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blew her a kiss. “And you’re in charge.”</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The sun hung lazily in the late afternoon sky, warm and soft against the green stretch of backyard that bloomed in chaotic color under Rio’s influence. A carpet of wildflowers spread beneath the trees like nature had spilled a basket of paint. The air smelled of earth, lavender, and freshly cut grass — an unintentional perfume curated by Rio's casual flicks of magic whenever something needed calming. </span>
<span>She stood barefoot in the yard, wearing old denim shorts and a sleeveless black top, her dark hair tied back in a high ponytail. Her hands were on her hips as she watched the spectacle of chaos unfold before her with what could only be described as resigned domestic grace. </span>
<span>Nick was attempting to build a fort out of pillows, wooden planks, and what Rio suspected was half of their living room furniture. Nicole, meanwhile, lounged under the large elm tree with a sketchbook in her lap, pretending she wasn’t interested in anything happening around her, but her eyes flicked up every few seconds. Occasionally, she offered snide commentary with the dry timing of a veteran comedian. </span>
<span>Rio had spent the last hour wiping paint off Nick, calming down a minor argument about which sibling had touched the last churro, and magically redirecting a flock of sparrows that Nick had accidentally summoned with an unfinished chant. And yet, there was something about it — the noise, the motion, the sheer life of it all — that made her feel anchored in a way she hadn’t felt in centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, the thought had been looming in her mind all day. It had followed her since breakfast, like a shadow peeking between her ribs. <em>She needed to tell them</em>. She needed them to know who she really was. N</span>
<span>ot just the playful, magically-gifted mama who grew flowers with a thought or who could get paint out of denim with a single whisper. <em>The real her. The whole truth. </em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She called out softly, "Hey, come here, you two. Sit with me for a minute."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick bounded over immediately, still covered in glitter and grass stains. Nicole took longer, closing her sketchbook slowly and walking with deliberate laziness to flop beside her brother on the blanket Rio had spread out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat cross-legged, brushing a hand gently over Nick's hair and then resting it on Nicole's knee. Her heart thudded, heavy and uncertain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I want to tell you both something important. Something real," she began, her voice low, careful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick immediately perked up. "Are you sick? Is it about the time you ate that super spicy pepper and cried for twenty minutes?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No," Rio said, smiling gently. "It’s bigger than that. It’s about who I am. Not just your mama. Not just someone who loves you very, very much... But something more. Something old. Something... a little scary."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole narrowed her eyes. "Scary how? Like vampire scary? Demon scary? Tax auditor scary?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled and looked at them both. "I’m not human. Not really. I never was. I am something else.<em> I am Death. <strong>The Death</strong></em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silence followed, thick and strange. A cloud passed over the sun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio continued, her voice steady despite the fear pooling in her chest. "I was created at the beginning of existence. I walk between lives. I see everything when it ends. I carry souls from one side to the next. I don't decide who lives or dies, I just guide them when their time comes."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick's mouth dropped open. </span>
<span>"That’s so cool!" he yelled. "Like a grim reaper? But hot?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. "Um... I guess?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole, however, didn’t look shocked. She tilted her head. "I knew something was weird. You never get tired. You always smell like flowers or snow. And you talk to things that aren't there sometimes."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed. "You’re not afraid?<em> Either of you?</em>"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick scoffed. "Why would we be scared? You make pancakes shaped like dragons. You read bedtime stories with voices. And you never let me have bad dreams. You’re my mom. That’s all that matters."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole nodded slowly. "I mean, it explains the vibe. But no. I’m not afraid. Honestly? It kind of makes you even cooler."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a shaky breath, emotion rising in her throat. She leaned in, wrapping her arms around both of them, pulling them tightly against her. The sun warmed their backs. Nick giggled. Nicole let herself be hugged without complaint for once.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Thank you," Rio whispered into their hair. "You don’t know what that means to me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick looked up. "Can I tell my friends I live with Death? Like, the real one? I feel like that’ll give me street cred."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>Absolutely not</em>," Rio laughed through tears. "Let’s keep that our family secret, okay?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole rolled her eyes. "Ugh. Fine. But when I write my memoir, I’m keeping it in."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at the sky, blue and endless above them. She still didn’t know what tomorrow would bring. But in this moment, tangled in laughter and tangled limbs and unconditional love, she felt eternal in a new, unfamiliar way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not because she couldn’t die. <em>But because she finally knew what it meant to truly live.</em></span>

<p>
<span>The garden was overgrown but alive — thick with golden heather that swayed like restless spirits, their honeyed scent mingling with the silvery bite of lavender clinging to morning dew. A gentle breeze stirred the petals, carrying whispers of soil and crushed mint as a small girl ran barefoot through the grass. Her tangled brown curls bounced like unruly springs, catching sunlight in their knots. Her dress, once butter-yellow, was stained with earth and torn at the hem from climbing apple trees and hiding between thorny rose bushes. But Agatha didn’t mind. The flowers listened, their petals brushing her ankles like loyal subjects bowing to a forgotten queen.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was five. Almost six. And unlike the coven’s other children — who could summon fireflies with a blink or twist winds around their fingers like ribbons — Agatha had <em>nothing.</em> No magic sparked beneath her skin. No glow lit her fingertips. <em>Just…quiet</em>. A silence so deep it hummed. Her mother called it a disgrace. Her father, oblivious to the coven’s secrets, knelt among the roses one afternoon, dirt caking his trousers, and cupped her smudged cheeks. His hands smelled of tobacco and pine resin, rough yet warm.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"There’s something about you, <em>little star</em>," he murmured, brushing a curl from her forehead. His thumb left a streak of soil on her temple, a accidental baptism. "You make things brighter, just by being in them. That’s not nothing, Agatha. That’s rare."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Evanora never saw a <em>star</em>. Only a <em>flaw</em>. </span>
<span><em>This is what I get</em>, she often thought bitterly, her porcelain teacup trembling in her grip as she watched the child from the parlor window. <em>This is what I get for marrying a human for money and control. I should’ve crafted a daughter from blood and spell. Not…this. </em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t understand the words, but she understood the frost in her mother’s gaze. The way Evanora’s lips tightened when Agatha offered her a fistful of dandelions, their seeds scattering like lost wishes. The flowers withered in Evanora’s hand before they ever reached a vase.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>It happened on a day soaked in thunder. The air tasted metallic, charged with a storm that never broke. Two witches had come to discuss the "problem" of Agatha — their voices sharpened blades behind closed doors. Agatha wasn’t supposed to hear, but the tension prickled her skin like static. She hovered at the parlor’s threshold, her toes digging into the cold hardwood, as Evanora’s voice lashed out:  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"—a defect, not a daughter. She’ll never belong to this world."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words hooked into Agatha’s ribs. She stepped forward just as Evanora raised her hand, magic crackling at her fingertips — a violet glow meant to command silence, to punish. </span>
<span>The slap never landed. <em>Not truly</em>. </span>
<span>The moment Evanora’s palm grazed Agatha’s cheek, something snapped. A pull, deep and hungry, like a root breaking through stone. Agatha’s breath hitched as heat flooded her face — not pain, but a searing rush, as if her veins had opened to drink a river of stars. Evanora’s magic poured into her, dark and sweet as blackberry wine, staining her skin with swirling patterns that glowed faintly before fading.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Ah!" Agatha screamed, stumbling back. Her small hands clawed at her face, smearing tears and dirt. It wasn’t triumph. It was terror. Her mother’s power burned, foreign and alive, squirming beneath her skin like a trapped thing.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora recoiled, clutching her wrist as if it’d been branded. The color drained from her face, her once-flawless composure fracturing. "What…what was that?"  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The visiting witch stared, her teacup slipping from her fingers. It shattered on the floor, shards skittering toward Agatha’s bare feet. "She’s a <em>sipho</em>n…Evanora. She took your power. She's a abomination."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The silence that followed was brittle, sharp enough to cut. </span>
<span>Agatha’s chest heaved. Her tears dried mid-fall, salted tracks stiff on her cheeks. Slowly, she straightened, her palms still trembling, but her chin lifted. Her eyes — wide, wet, yet blazing — locked onto her mother’s. Not with apology. Not with fear. </span>
<span><em>With fire</em>.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora’s throat bobbed. For the first time, she looked at her daughter not as a failure, but as a threat. Her voice wavered, barely audible: "What are you?"  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She didn’t know. But the fear in her mother’s eyes — the respect — sent a strange thrill through her. A seedling of pride took root in her chest, stubborn and wild.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, hidden among the garden’s trembling branches, something watched. </span>
<span>It had no true shape — a shadow clinging to the oak’s bark, a ripple in the dappled light. <em>Not yet real. Not yet whole</em>. But as Agatha’s stolen magic flickered beneath her skin, the shadow’s form shuddered. Its hand (or the suggestion of one) lifted to its chest.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time in its eternal existence —  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Thump.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span><em>A heartbeat.</em> </span>
<span>Weak. Irregular. </span>
<span>But there.  </span>
</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Damn it, damn it, damn it!"</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A ten-year-old Agatha Harkness scrambled up the stairs, nearly tripping over her own feet. Her heart pounded against her ribs like a war drum, adrenaline flooding her small limbs as she rushed toward danger — not the kind most children feared, but the very real possibility of her mother being burned alive in Salem’s town square if the new maid found what she wasn’t supposed to. In her haste, Agatha had left the door to her mother’s spell room ajar. </span>
<span>She could practically feel her stomach flip with the weight of that mistake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>Miss</em>!" Agatha shouted, breathless, voice cracking as she reached the top of the stairs. "Miss!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman paused just outside the partially open door, hand already raised toward the handle. She turned, surprised, her face soft with patience and unfamiliar kindness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Yes, Miss Agatha?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha skidded to a halt, red-cheeked and wild-haired, gasping to catch her breath. Her curls frizzed out in every direction, and her wide blue eyes darted from the woman to the cracked door. </span>
<span>"You... You’re new."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The maid smiled gently. "Yes, ma’am. Just started this morning. Dandara, at your service. Can I help you with something?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked quickly, mind racing. Then her eyes lit with something clever. </span>
<span>"I— could you look for my doll? I lost her. I want to play in the garden, but I think my mom hid her in my room as punishment."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dandara’s expression softened further, maternal almost. "Of course, dear. Which one is your room?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"The lilac door. With flowers. My dad painted them for me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Very sweet of him. Wait for me on the veranda, sweetheart. It’s safer than the slippery floor."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a nod, and as soon as Dandara turned away, she slipped beside the spell room and pressed her palm against the wood. Soft purple light glimmered beneath her skin and the lock clicked shut with a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only when she was back downstairs, seated in the creaking wooden rocker on the porch, did she allow herself a sigh of relief. The cool breeze tousled her curls as her eyes scanned the yard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she saw it. <em>Someone</em> — small, hunched — crouched near her azaleas. </span>
<em>
<span>Her azaleas.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rage flared behind her eyes. "HEY! <em>You</em>! <em>Filthy street brat</em>! Get away from my azaleas!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leapt from the rocker, storming forward with her small fists clenched and sparking with a dim, indignant violet glow. Her powers, untrained and unsanctioned, still flickered at her fingertips. She wasn’t allowed to use them — Evanora had banned it — but Agatha had been sneaking in practice. Enough to scare off some dirty little trespasser.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Get away from my plants, you little beggar!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The child turned around slowly, brushing dirt off their knees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Wow. You’re really rude for a cute <em>chubby</em> kid in ribbons," the figure said, voice calm, even amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, cheeks flaming. "What did you just call me?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Should be thanking me," the girl said, rising to her feet. She was taller than Agatha, her skin sun-warmed and freckled, dark hair in a messy bob just grazing her shoulders. Her eyes were wide and golden-brown, the color of maple leaves in autumn. </span>
<span>She wiped her dirty hands on the tattered shorts she wore and gestured toward the garden. </span>
<span>"There’s a white beetle infestation. I was killing them for you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And what do <em>you</em> know about flowers?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Everything, sweetie," the girl replied. She stepped closer. </span>
<span>Despite her ragged clothes and mud-streaked face, there was something oddly graceful about her. And her scent — Agatha caught it only faintly — was strange, unfamiliar yet pleasant. Like fresh petals beneath snow. </span>
<span>"I created them," the girl added with a little smile. "But let’s not get bogged down in facts."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached out a hand, as if to introduce herself, then suddenly froze and pulled back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Your name?" Agatha asked, wary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Uh... just call me <em>Rio</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Rio? That’s a name? What does it mean?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"River."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, scrutinizing the girl. "I’m Agatha Harkness. Do you have a family name, or are you just Rio?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The girl hesitated. Then smiled a little too knowingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"My family isn’t from around here. But you can say Rio Vidal. <em>River of life</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. There was something strange about this Rio. Something ancient. But her curiosity sparked brighter than her suspicion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You’re weird," she said at last.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So are you," Rio replied, grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And just beyond them, beneath the cool shadow of the elder tree, the darkness that had once watched Agatha’s first spark of power flickered again. Silent. Observing. Waiting.</span>
</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was well past dusk when the soft hum of Salem’s wind swept through the curtains of Agatha’s bedroom, carrying the scent of fresh grass, apple blossoms, and distant smoke from coven fires she wasn’t allowed to join. The moon hung impossibly full over the trees, pale and brilliant like the eye of a god watching the earth below. She sat curled in the alcove of her balcony, her knees hugged to her chest, the scratchy wool of her nightdress doing little to block the chill of the evening air. Her eyes followed the flicker of firelight from the distant fields, where others danced, laughed, summoned, celebrated. But not her. <em>Never her</em>. </span>
<span>At fifteen, Agatha had grown tall, sharp-eyed, and sharp-tongued, but the loneliness that nested in her chest had only deepened. Her mother’s words had cut deeper with each passing year, burrowing into the soft, still-healing places that childhood pain had left behind. And tonight, like every full moon before it, Evanora reminded her of the one thing she was forbidden to forget: <em>that she did not belong.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>The wooden floor behind her creaked softly, and Agatha didn’t turn. She already knew who it was. The scent alone gave it away — a strange but comforting blend of rain on warm stone, wildflowers blooming beneath snow, and something darker that lingered at the edge of recognition.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re sad,” Rio said simply, stepping forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond at first. Her voice, when it came, was distant. “Perspective, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat beside her without invitation, their shoulders brushing. She handed Agatha a piece of fruit, plucked and ripened by her own magic. It was firm, red, and vibrantly sweet, still cool from the shade where it had grown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You didn’t eat,” Rio murmured. “Your stomach sounds like it’s about to curse someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a soft, broken laugh as she took the offering and bit into it. It grounded her for a moment — the texture, the cold juice against her tongue, the physical presence of someone who saw her even when she tried to disappear. Her father was kind, always was, but he was human and oblivious to the war unfolding within his own household. Her mother, powerful and cruel, carried more fear in her eyes now than disdain. But Rio — Rio was the only one who looked at her and saw someone worthy of love. <em>Of worth. Of defense.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until Rio tilted her head and caught the gleam of tears on Agatha’s lashes that something tightened visibly in her jaw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did she say this time?” she asked, voice low, controlled. Dangerous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She savored the fruit a little longer, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, then finally spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She said I’m an <em>abomination</em>,” she whispered. “That I’ll never have a coven. That the full moon isn’t for... creatures like me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached forward and cupped Agatha’s face with both hands, her touch impossibly warm. She tilted Agatha’s chin upward, forcing her to meet her gaze. The glow of moonlight danced across Agatha’s cheekbones, highlighting the curve of her mouth, the red puffiness around her eyes, the bravery she wore like armor despite how cracked it had become.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll do whatever you want,” Rio said. “Anything. Just... you’re <em>leaking</em> again and it’s — it’s uncomfortable. It hurts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Leaking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t like it. It makes my chest tight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You really don’t know what crying is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, curls swaying. “No. I’ve never done it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she hadn’t. Not yet. <em>But she would</em>. The day Rio first cried, it would be out of joy, pure and unfiltered. The second time would come like thunder, and <em>it would break</em> her. But that was still far away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you fix me?” Agatha asked suddenly. “Can you make me normal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s nothing broken in you, <em>mi princesa</em>,” Rio whispered. “You’re perfect. Just as you are. But if you want something from me... tell me. Anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. The wind shifted, blowing strands of hair across her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Could you... scare her?” she asked, voice small. “My mother. Make her stay away from me for a while?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tensed. “I’m not allowed to show my power to mortals before their time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you showed it to me,” Agatha replied, eyes searching her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>Yes</em>. And the fact that nothing happened to me for that still terrifies me.” Rio looked away, uncomfortable. “Your mother is different. I don’t know what the consequences would be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So you can’t?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then it happened: </span>
<span><em>That look</em>. That subtle shift of the lip. The soft tremble of the mouth that accompanied the large, glistening eyes. <em>The pout</em>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared like she’d been slapped. </span>
<span>It wasn’t magic. It wasn’t a spell. It was something far <em>worse</em>. </span>
<em>
<span>Emotional manipulation. </span>
</em>
<span>And it worked. Rio’s spine straightened. She blinked rapidly, scrambling to hold on to her logic, but it slipped through her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t say I can’t,” she began, already defeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled — a real one, bright and clever and wicked — and before Rio could find the rest of her thoughts, Agatha leaned in. Her hand came up, fingers curling around the back of Rio’s neck, and then their lips met. </span>
<span><em>It was soft</em>. Warm. Sweet and new. Rio didn’t breathe. She didn’t move. Everything in her stilled, including time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had guided souls across galaxies. Had watched suns die, and children be born, and stars collapse into dust. But none of it compared to the way Agatha’s lips felt on hers. None of it prepared her for the fluttering chaos rising from the pit of her stomach to her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had no idea what to do with her hands. Or her lips. Or the entire world, now that this had happened. But she didn’t need to understand it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It was Agatha. And with Agatha, everything always felt like it made sense... eventually.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes opened slowly to the soft warmth of morning light streaming through the bedroom curtains. At first, everything was still steeped in the rich, golden haze of the dream — the scent of rain-damp earth and old magic still clinging to the edge of her senses. For a moment, it wasn’t clear what was real and what had been memory or illusion. She could still feel the press of young lips against hers, the taste of fruit, the sting of isolation and power barely understood. She lay there, the linen sheets tangled around her legs, the imprint of the dream lingering like the warmth of a phantom sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then came the sound — laughter, muffled through floorboards. Familiar. <em>Alive</em>. </span>
<span>The thump of small feet running down the hallway. A soft yelp. Something clattered in the kitchen. Then, Rio’s voice, bright and animated, drifting upward through the open bedroom door. Agatha sat up, pushing her hair back from her face. Her heart beat faster for reasons she couldn’t explain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The dream wasn’t real. Not in this life. And yet she could feel every thread of it. </span>
<span>Three distinct memories had unraveled behind her closed eyes — fragments not of fantasy but of something long buried. She felt it in her bones: <em>the garden, the first spark of power, the accidental death, the kiss.</em> <strong>Echoes</strong>. Pieces of someone she once was, bleeding into someone she was becoming again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, like a forgotten melody returning to her lips, a song whispered through her thoughts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Down, down, down the road, down the witches’ road.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The melody spun gently through her chest as she slipped from the bed and padded across the floor, her bare feet making no sound against the wood. She entered the bathroom, humming to herself while she undressed, letting the water warm her skin and carry away the remnants of sleep. She tried to ignore how the tune haunted her, familiar and yet unreachable. </span>
<span>By the time she was dressed for work — simple black slacks, a forest-green blouse, her favorite boots — the music still hadn’t left her head. It hung behind her thoughts like a shadow waiting for light to shift. She descended the stairs, fastening her watch, the smell of fresh coffee and toasted bread growing stronger with every step.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Rio, honey!" she called, grabbing her bag and keys. "Can you take the kids to school for me? I’m late, and I swear Nick’s probably still not wearing pants."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Yes! I’m in the kitchen!" came the immediate reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned the corner into the kitchen and paused. </span>
<span>Nicole stood near the table with a tray in hand, carefully placing utensils beside folded napkins. Rio was finishing with the fruit bowl, hair twisted up into a messy bun, still in a loose T-shirt and sleep shorts, cheeks slightly pink from the morning heat. Nick sat cross-legged in his usual chair, grinning up at his mother. His cheeks were dusted with cinnamon and mischief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Morning, Mommy!" he called, leaping from the chair and wrapping his arms around her waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned down and kissed the top of his head, brushing aside the long hair that kept falling into his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You need a trim, mister."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Noooo," he groaned, clutching her tighter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Mom, sit down. Mama Rio made breakfast," Nicole announced proudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow and looked up at Rio. </span>
<span>"You cooked?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Okay," Rio admitted, sheepish. "Nicole helped. But I did the bacon. And the toast. And I arranged the strawberries into a smiley face.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stepped forward and kissed Agatha lightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Good morning, Cariño."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morning, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha set her bag down by the door and went to retrieve her favorite mug. She resumed humming the melody under her breath as she poured coffee into it, the notes dancing just at the edge of memory. </span>
<em>
<span>“Down, down, down the road, down the witches’ road.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, in the middle of bringing the orange juice to the table, froze. Her body locked up, and she nearly dropped the glass. One hand gripped the edge of the counter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>Where</em>... where did you hear that?" she asked, her voice brittle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, blinking. "What? The song? I don’t know. It just popped into my head this morning. I’ve been humming it since I woke up."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression shifted, all warmth draining from her face. "You don’t remember anything?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused. Her heart stuttered. "Depends. Remember what, Rio?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth, hesitated. She wanted to lie. She couldn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"If you’re remembering that song... <em>you’re close</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, stepping closer, trying to read the worry in Rio’s eyes. "Close to what, baby?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But before Rio could answer, a sharp yelp cracked the moment in two.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Moooooom! Nick threw cereal in my hair!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and looked toward the chaos blooming in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It was an accident!" Nick shouted defensively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced back at Rio, who still hadn’t moved, her fingers white-knuckling the juice glass. She wanted to stay in that moment, demand the truth, push for more. But instead, she stepped forward and gently cupped Rio’s cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"We’ll talk later, okay?" Rio nodded mutely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha turned, ready to once again become the responsible mother, the professor, the woman managing a life full of small, wild fires. </span>
<span>But the song still echoed in her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Down the witches’ road.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And something inside her knew: <em>She was getting closer to something</em>.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The morning was thick with static, as if the air hadn’t yet made peace with the passing of the dream. Agatha walked the halls of the university like a ghost in her own skin. Her boots echoed on the marble floors, the cold press of autumn wind trailing in through the glass doors behind her. The scent of old paper, ink, and too much coffee clung to the building like ritual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She adjusted the leather strap of her bag on her shoulder, but her fingers twitched with restlessness. Her mind was still echoing with fragments. The feel of stone beneath her bare feet. The salt of a tear she hadn’t cried in years. The exact pressure of lips that didn’t belong to this timeline. She wasn’t sure how she made it to her classroom. One moment she was watching the leaves twist like dying dancers beyond the windows, and the next she stood in front of twenty sets of expectant eyes. Her lecture slides were ready. Her notes were neatly stacked. Her coffee, untouched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Okay," she said, flipping open her folder, clearing her throat, trying to summon the version of herself that used to exist on autopilot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The professor. The mother. The woman who had control.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tapped the touchscreen, the projector casting images of medieval grimoires across the whiteboard. “Today we’re discussing the development of pagan rites and their misrepresentation in post-Inquisition literature. Open to page 204. And yes, you should be taking notes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But even as she spoke, her voice calm and clear, the tune swirled at the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Down, down, down the road, down the witches' road.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It twined through her thoughts like smoke. Slipping through cracks. Coiling around the edges of her sentences. She turned to write on the board — chalk scraping in sharp, white lines — but her breath caught mid-motion as another verse surfaced, uninvited, in her head:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span><em>“I hold Death’s hands in mine.”</em> Her fingers froze. T</span>
<span>he words weren’t just music. They were memory. They tasted like that fruit from the dream. They smelled like Rio’s skin, wind-touched and ancient. They trembled against her ribcage like a secret trying to dig its way out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A girl in the third row raised her hand awkwardly. “Uh... Professor Harkness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked and looked down, realizing she’d been holding the chalk in the same place for too long. It had snapped. A thin line of dust covered her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She exhaled and gave the student a tight smile. "Yes, sorry. My head’s a bit... elsewhere this morning."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The class chuckled lightly, some heads nodding in sympathy. One boy muttered something about midterms. She nodded, grateful for the easy out. She moved back toward her desk, brushing her hands off absently. Her chest still ached with something unsaid. Her pulse had risen just slightly. She could feel it — tucked beneath her collarbone, like a spell that hadn’t yet been cast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her fingers grazed the edge of her mug as she sat down. </span>
<span><em>“I hold Death’s hands in mine.”</em> It wasn’t just poetic. <strong><em>It was true.</em></strong></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the longer she sat there, the more she began to realize that the dream wasn’t just a dream.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a door. And it had opened again. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The office was quiet, too quiet for a university afternoon. The muted hum of the faculty wing outside her door barely reached through the thick wooden frame, and the soft ticking of the clock above Agatha’s desk seemed far louder than it should have. Sunlight streaked across the floor in dusty beams, warming the stone tiles but doing little to thaw the knot in her chest. Agatha had barely touched her second cup of coffee. Her notes were scattered across the desk in their usual tidy chaos, but her mind refused to latch onto any of them. Not when the song was still dancing at the edge of her consciousness. Not when the pressure of something ancient and half-remembered sat heavy in her bones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A knock rapped softly on the glass pane of her door. </span>
<span>She looked up, grateful for the distraction. "Come in."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door opened, and a woman stepped inside with the kind of grace that didn’t belong in a hallway lined with corkboards and budget cutbacks. She looked composed, poised — dressed in a long, pearl-colored coat and a silk blouse that caught the light like water. Her hair, a golden cascade styled into soft waves, framed a face both ethereal and achingly symmetrical. For a second, Agatha thought she recognized her — an echo, a flicker at the edge of recognition — but it vanished just as quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Professor Harkness,” the woman said, her voice smooth as honeyed tea, bright with artificial warmth. “It’s a pleasure. I’m the mother of one of your future students. Orion. He’ll be joining next semester. He’s quite taken with history, and I thought perhaps... you might become the lie he tells people about why he loves it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked slowly, her thoughts still tangled. She gestured vaguely to the chair across from her desk. "Please, have a seat."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman’s smile widened, and she glided into the chair with elegance that was just a touch too fluid. Not forced. Just... calculated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha murmured, adjusting her posture. “I’m a little out of sorts today. Head’s a mess. But I can write down his name, keep an eye out next semester, and make sure he finds a seat. I usually remember the curious ones."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would be wonderful,” the woman replied. She extended a perfectly manicured hand across the desk. "Eve. <em>Eve Efil</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her hand slowly, her palm folding over Eve’s in a firm, practiced grip. The moment their skin touched, Agatha felt it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A thread. A push. </span>
</em>
<span>There was magic there. Not the chaotic, warm magic of nature or fire or memory. This was colder. More focused. <em>Suggestive</em>. And sharp. </span>
<span>Eve held her hand a second too long, her smile never faltering. Her pale blue eyes — unnaturally pale, Agatha realized — were too focused. Too precise. </span>
<span>And yet, n</span>
<span>othing happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t feel woozy. Or fogged. Or manipulated. Instead, she felt the pressure of something pressing against her — then slipping. </span>
<span>Like water off stone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eve blinked. Her fingers tensed slightly before letting go, and for the briefest of moments, her smile faltered. Just a crack. Just a flicker. But it was enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her hand back slowly, never breaking eye contact. </span>
<span>“What are you doing, Ms. Efil?” she asked, her voice low. Calculated. The warmth had gone out of her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eve blinked, then tilted her head with just the right amount of confusion. "I beg your pardon?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair, folding her hands in her lap. "Touching people <em>like that</em>... it’s not usually protocol."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Eve said smoothly, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “I come from a very tactile family. We believe in warmth. It’s cultural, I suppose."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The lie was perfect. </span>
</em>
<span>But Agatha was a mother. Once a witch. A woman who had lived too many lives in too many shades of fear. And she knew manipulation when she felt it. Her children tried to trick her. Her students tried to outwit her. Even Rio, in her own gentle way, tried to sidestep truths now and then. But this woman? </span>
<span><em>She was trying to break in</em>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. </span>
<span>“You look familiar,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eve offered a polite, expectant smile. “I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not just your face,” Agatha continued slowly. “There’s something else. Something... old.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eve didn’t blink. She didn’t speak. She simply smiled. </span>
<span>Agatha sat forward slightly, her fingertips brushing the edge of her desk. A prickle danced at the back of her neck, the same shiver she’d felt when she saw the firelight in her dreams. She could feel the weight of something ancient pressing against her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, very softly — barely above a whisper — she said: </span>
<em>
<span>"Death."</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Not Rio, </span>
</em>
<span>n</span>
<span>ot the woman she kissed goodnight. </span>
<span>The name she called now was older. Sharper. <em>The title</em>, not the lover. </span>
<span>The air in the room shifted. <em>It wasn’t dramatic. No thunderclaps. No flames</em>. But something in Eve’s spine straightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her closely. </span>
<span>Eve’s lips curved ever so slightly, and her eyes — those pale, glacial things — sparked with something new.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well,” she said, voice lower now. Slower. “That’s a curious thing to say, Professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair, one brow raised. </span>
<span>The office had gone still. <em>Too still</em>. The shadows along the corners deepened by degrees, as if the light itself had grown wary. The faint hum of the overhead lights now sounded oppressive, as though each flicker was trying to warn her. Agatha’s breath slowed, but her heart drummed a battle hymn in her chest, slow and rhythmic, like the warbeat of an older self she wasn’t supposed to remember. </span>
<span>Eve Efil — no, not Eve — smiled across the desk. Her posture hadn’t shifted, but the air around her felt denser now, like it was folding in around her in silent reverence. Her fingertips still rested lightly against the oak wood of Agatha’s desk, and the longer she sat there, the more Agatha felt like she was watching something that didn’t belong in the shape of a woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You’re still very sharp, aren’t you, Agatha?" Eve’s voice was velvet now, rich and slow, the syllables drawn out as though savoring them. Her eyes shimmered faintly, and for a second, they weren’t just blue — they were golden, starlit, ancient. Eyes that had watched civilizations rise and collapse. Eyes that had wept oceans and smiled through wars. <em>Eyes that knew her.</em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then came the voice. From the shadows behind the bookshelf, quiet, sharp, and trembling with control barely held: </span>
<span>"I told you to stay away from my family, Life."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move, but the pressure inside her grew. She didn’t need her magic to tell her the truth. Her bones knew. Her breath knew. Her magic, quietly humming under her skin, recoiled like a cat cornered. <em>Life</em>. The embodiment of it. Wearing a coat and a practiced expression. </span>
<span>The words were not shouted. They were breathed, hissed through clenched teeth, and yet they echoed like thunder beneath the skin. Agatha turned her head slightly and saw Rio stepping into the room, her boots silent on the floor, her eyes glowing faintly amber — not soft like honey, but blazing like wildfire. </span>
<span>Her presence was immediate. <em>Tangible</em>. The scent of lavender and something colder — like snow falling over dying leaves — coiled through the room as she entered, and with it came gravity. The shadows seemed to part around her. The air bent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva didn’t flinch. Her smile grew softer. </span>
<span>"Hello, little sis," she said, not looking at Rio but still very aware of her. Her gaze remained on Agatha. "It’s nice to see my sister-in-law once again."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could barely breathe. The tension between the two entities — it was palpable. <em>Electric</em>. Her skin prickled with the weight of their opposing energies. One felt like sunlight bottled in glass, deceptive and bright. The other like the moon — distant, knowing, and anciently protective.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stepped forward, her expression unreadable but her voice sharper now. "You don’t belong here."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I do," Eve said gently. "She called me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse thudded louder in her ears. "<em>You're a fucking liar</em>! I didn’t—"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva finally looked at Rio, her smile still in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"She’s waking up, Rio. Bit by bit. You didn’t tell her, but the world is whispering. The song, the dreams... I don't know if it's good or not, but we need to find him!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tensed. Her hands balled at her sides, the faint tremor in her fingertips betraying her calm. "You manipulated her. <em>You touched her</em>. The last time you visited my family, you took them from me! <em>Don't you dare!</em>"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I did." Eva tilted her head slightly, and Agatha thought she saw something flicker behind her eyes — pity? Sadness? Triumph? It was gone before she could be sure. "But it didn’t work. The manipulation. She is strong. That’s the problem. It never doesn’t work."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed her chair back slowly, standing between them. She didn’t know what she was, not fully. But she knew this: <em>she would not be spoken around like she wasn’t in the room.</em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"What do you want from me?" she asked, voice steady, cold. "No riddles. No metaphors. I'm <em>done</em> with the fucking cosmic poem!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva looked at her then — not with deception, not even with warmth, but with something closer to grief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"To keep you alive." </span>
<span>That stopped the air in Agatha’s lungs. Even Rio froze, the fire in her posture dimming with confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"What do you mean?" Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva stood slowly. She smoothed her coat with graceful fingers and let out a long breath, as though the performance had grown heavy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You’re the center of something that can’t be stopped now. The balance is off. <em>Death is too close to you.</em> I don't know if you noticed, but <em>YOU</em>, Agatha..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva laughed softly, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p>  </p><p>
<span>"I don’t know how, but you were born with the half of a soul my sister was missing. You are Death’s soulmate... Shit, that should be impossible, and yet it isn’t. And I have to protect you, whether I like it or not. If you die at the hands of someone like Vengeance, Death will collapse, she will kill someone, and then the balance of the universe will shatter into a thousand pieces."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You’re lying," Rio said. "That’s impossible. <em>I don’t have a soul</em>. How can she be half of something that doesn’t exist?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I wish I were," Eva replied. She turned to Agatha. Her expression softened. "Fate knows more than I do. I only got a glimpse—she blocked the rest of my influence."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. "What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva smiled faintly. "I broke a rule for you, Agatha. For you and Rio. I used my powers on one of our siblings. I needed answers... You two... You’re one soul, split in two across millennia and eras and lives. You were never supposed to meet, because —"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Because of a mistake," Rio’s voice cut in, low and rough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva nodded. "<em>Yes</em>. I don’t know whose mistake. I couldn’t see that far. But I know this: <em>you need to find Ralph</em>. I need to erase the memory of his soul and send Vengeance back to whatever pit spawned her before this spins even further out of control." </span>
<span>She stood, dusted off her sleeves, and added, with a quiet authority, "Find him. Quickly."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And just like that, she left — her footsteps soft, deliberate, like an echo fading behind the weight of everything she’d said — leaving them in silence, and each other’s orbit. </span>
<span>The silence Eva left behind was thunderous. It rang in Agatha's ears like aftershocks, echoing louder than any slam of a door could have. Her breathing was shallow, almost forced, as if her lungs couldn’t quite decide if they belonged to her. The office was warm but her skin had gone cold. Her hands trembled slightly at her sides, curled and stiff, like she didn’t trust them to move.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood still, as if turned to stone. Amber eyes dimmed but alert, lips parted like she wanted to speak, but no sound came out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her slowly. The weight in her gaze was crushing. <em>Anger. Confusion. Pain.</em> All boiling quietly under the surface, restrained only by the force of will Agatha had spent a lifetime perfecting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You knew."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio flinched, just a little. "Agatha, I swear to you, I didn’t. <em>Not this</em>. Not what she said. I was told the rules, the boundaries, the expectations. I don’t remember anything from before I... woke up. My purpose was handed to me, and <em>I never questioned it</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So you never thought to ask what you were made of? What you were missing?" Her voice was sharp, slicing through the air like a knife. "That means it isn’t love, Rio. Not really. I’m just a fucking cosmic magnet. The other half of your puzzle. Something broken that made you feel whole."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head and took a shaky step back, her voice wobbling with the weight of what she tried not to feel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So that’s why you looked at me like that since the first moment. That’s why you couldn't leave even when I told you to. Not because you loved me. <em>Because something inside you was screaming to take back what was yours</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her lips trembled. The tears brimmed now, swimming against the fury in her stare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So all this time, all this life we built... it’s not even a choice to you. <em>It’s a gravitational pull.</em>"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"<em>No</em>!" Rio took her face in both hands, desperate, fierce. "No, Agatha. You think I don’t know the difference? I’ve held your broken body in the past life. I’ve watched you die. I’ve guided your soul home. I know what I feel. I’d trade everything — everything I am, everything I was created to be — just to keep waking up next to you. <em>I love you</em>, not because I need to. But because I fucking want to."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn't answer. She only stared at her, and in that silence, Rio began to move away, her hands trembling as she released Agatha's face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"If this is too much," Rio whispered, her voice nearly breaking, "I understand. I can go. I just... I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned. </span>
<span>Agatha grabbed her wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span><em>Hard</em>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Don’t you dare walk out on me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned, startled. Agatha pulled her into a crushing hug, burying her face in Rio’s shoulder, breathing in her scent like it would ground her. Lavender and frost. Familiar. Steadying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Stay here, you idiot. I'm just losing my shit, okay? <em>I'm still human. Still hormonal.</em> Still under-caffeinated."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a broken laugh against her temple. "That’s something I wouldn’t trade my immortality for."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, her lips brushing Rio’s neck. She pulled back just enough to press a kiss to the skin below her jaw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Come on," she muttered. "I need food. And I have something to tell you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flickered with worry. She studied Agatha’s face, gauging every flicker of muscle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You’re not pregnant again, are you? Because if you are, we’re getting me some <em>cosmic birth control</em> and maybe putting a hex on my own damn fingers."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh my God, Rio!" Agatha shoved her, mortified. Her face turned bright red. "Shut the hell up!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, warm and loud and full of life. Agatha rolled her eyes, but the weight in her chest loosened just a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were still worlds to burn. Truths to face. Ralph to find. But for now, they had each other. <em>And lunch.</em></span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t realized just how ravenous she was until the scent of roasted herbs and garlic butter hit her as they stepped into the quiet restaurant tucked away on a cobbled corner. The place was all warm wood and golden light, the air thick with the scent of sizzling fat, fresh bread, and sweet wine. Her stomach growled like an ancient beast, and she didn’t even hesitate to order everything: starters, mains, dessert — the works. Now, she was slumped back in her chair, spooning strawberry shortcake into her mouth like it was a divine offering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her with both amusement and mild horror. Her brow furrowed as she tilted her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In what celestial cage were you locked up?” she asked dryly, watching Rio demolish the dessert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without missing a beat, Rio lifted the hem of her shirt slightly and revealed the thin tattooed vines curling along her ribs. One of the tiny etched leaves had turned brittle gray and was already flaking at the edge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One reality is dying as we speak,” she said matter-of-factly, her voice tinged with fatigue. “It’s exhausting. Even for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smirk faded as she leaned in, eyes tracing the fading mark. “Oh,” she breathed, the sound more an ache than a word. She watched the leaf crumple inward, like time had crushed it. Then Rio dropped the hem and picked her spoon back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can wait to talk,” Agatha offered softly, but Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, my love,” she said, dabbing sugar from her lips with the corner of her napkin. “I’m yours. I’m listening.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, then exhaled. “I remembered something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze. Her spoon clattered to the plate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“White beetles,” Agatha said, trying to sound casual but failing. “Ring any bells?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding. “Oh, you mean the time you called me a<em> filthy street boy</em>?” she laughed. “Truly romantic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. “And our first kiss. You froze like a damn statue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m sorry,” Rio said, rolling her eyes. “It’s not like the Creators offered French kissing classes to cosmic entities.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “You’ve lived for eons and knew nothing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would I?” Rio gestured, exasperated. “I’m not human. Where in my eternal, soul-reaping journey would I ever need to kiss a mortal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, eyes glinting. “Everything I know, you taught me. Every detail. And judging by the way your body reacts when I touch you, I’d say you’re a damn good teacher.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed violently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of the two of us,” Rio added with a playful smirk, “you’ve always been the more creative one. I can’t wait until you remember our first time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sputtered, nearly choking on her water. </span>
<span>“Stop saying things like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio feigned innocence. “I was pure. Practically a saint.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, a <em>hollow</em> saint,” Agatha grumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, clearly entertained. She took another bite of her dessert, then licked her spoon with deliberately slow satisfaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But,” she said, her voice softening, “I do have a question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If it’s about what I taught you, I swear to—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not,” Rio laughed, lifting her hands. “You taught me plenty. I wanted to ask… When you sang that song this morning — did it bring anything back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, gaze drifting. “Is there something I’m supposed to remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s always something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was quiet a beat too long. Then, softly: “No. Just the song. Playing over and over. Does that mean something bad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated. Her fork lowered slightly. </span>
<span>“The song itself? No. But the last time you sang it... maybe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha met her gaze. “Did I die afterward?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The silence between them said enough. </span>
<span>Agatha reached across the table, placing her fingers over Rio’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not afraid to die, Rio,” she said softly. “Because I know who will be waiting at the end. Whatever happened before, it doesn’t matter. I’m alive now. And I'm here with you.” </span>
</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>
<span>The bathroom lights buzzed faintly overhead, humming in sync with the low rumble of the restaurant just beyond the door. Agatha stood at the large mirror, fingers deftly reapplying a swipe of berry-toned lipstick, her expression mildly annoyed as she mumbled to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I still have to prep the next class. And I swear, if one more of those insufferable first-years tries to mansplain the Cold War to me..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her muttering was cut short by the soft sound of boots on tile. She barely had time to glance up before familiar arms slid around her waist from behind. Rio’s scent hit her immediately—earthy and wild, like night rain falling over stone and smoke. The sensation of her body pressing close, warm and fluid against Agatha's back, made her breath hitch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Rio," Agatha warned, trying to sound stern, but her voice betrayed her with that slight lilt of amusement and arousal. "<em>Stop</em>. One of us has to work."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Why?" Rio murmured into her neck, voice low and almost sing-song. "I can afford you, the kids, and all your impulsive candle hoarding."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She raised a hand and with a slow, casual flick, manifested a crisp $100 bill between her fingers like sleight-of-hand magic. Agatha’s eyes darted to the note, narrowing despite the smirk tugging at her lips. </span>
<span>Rio’s fingers were warm as she tucked the bill gently between Agatha’s breasts, slipping it down through the opening in her blouse with deliberate slowness. Agatha’s breath caught. Not from surprise — Rio pulled stunts like this often — but from the intentional intimacy behind the act.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Buy something nice for yourself, <em>sugar lips</em>," Rio whispered, her tone playfully husky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though her cheeks flushed with color. "You are impossible."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"And you are insanely hot." Rio’s mouth found her ear, teeth grazing it gently, and Agatha felt the goosebumps ripple down her spine. "And I just want to remind you that everything I know... every delicious, filthy thing I do to you... was taught by you. Down to the last exquisite detail."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped softly when Rio’s hand palmed her ass and squeezed. The gesture was bold, possessive, and somehow still reverent. The lipstick in Agatha’s hand trembled, forgotten. Her knuckles went white around it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Rio," she growled under her breath, voice ragged, but not angry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Hmm?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not here."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Where then?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"At home. <em>Tonight</em>."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"That’s so far away," Rio murmured with mock despair. "Just a kiss, then. You wouldn’t deny me that, would you, honey?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked up into the mirror, meeting Agatha’s eyes with a pleading expression so dramatic it made her look like a starlet in a tragic play. Agatha tried—truly tried—not to react. But the flush in her neck betrayed her, the soft rise and fall of her chest giving away just how much Rio still got under her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I know you, love," Agatha said softly. "If I kiss you, you'll melt. And if you melt, we’re not making it out of here without at least one broken sink."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned then, slow and deliberate, until they were face to face. She grabbed the lapels of Rio’s jacket and tugged her down into a kiss that silenced every excuse she’d just made. It started soft, but deepened quickly — hungry, full of tension neither of them could name. </span>
<span>Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s hips, grounding them both. Her fingers didn’t roam further, though Agatha knew she wanted to. She could feel the restraint in every muscle pressed against her, the way Rio groaned softly against her mouth but didn’t push.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled apart, breathless and flushed, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You know I’ll make you pay for this tonight, right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, that wicked glint back in her eyes. "That’s the goal, baby."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, laughing under her breath, before turning back to the mirror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Now go wait outside before I give in and destroy my career."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"With pleasure," Rio purred, sauntering to the door with a sway that was entirely intentional.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, alone again in the soft buzz of bathroom light, pressed a hand to her chest where the money still sat, then sighed, the corners of her mouth curving in surrender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Damn her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>
<span>It whispered against the wide windows of the living room like a secret trying to get in. The fire crackled low in the hearth, shadows dancing over bookshelves and the dark wood floor. Agatha stood barefoot on the rug, still wearing her work trousers and blouse, though she’d long since undone the top two buttons. Her sleeves were rolled to her elbows, a pen still tucked behind her ear — an unintentional symbol of how hard she tried to stay grounded in this life. </span>
<span>Rio, on the other hand, was sprawled on the couch like a woman born of silk and storms. She wore nothing but one of Agatha’s black button-downs, too large and far too sinful on her long limbs. Her damp curls spilled over the pillow as she scrolled lazily through a book of poetry she clearly wasn’t reading. Her gaze, half-lidded and amber, had been following Agatha for minutes now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can feel you watching me,” Agatha murmured without looking, still focused on the papers in her hand. “You’re practically breathing down my spine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You love when I do that,” Rio replied, her voice thick with satisfaction. “You go tense every time. Like a bowstring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched despite herself. “Some of us have self-control.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And some of us know exactly how to undo it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rustle of pages stilled in her hands as Rio stood. </span>
<span>Agatha heard her approach — not the sound of feet, but the shift in pressure. The heat of her body like a warm shadow curling toward her. Fingers brushed her hip first, featherlight, then curled possessively at her waist. Agatha exhaled slowly as Rio pressed against her back, slipping an arm around her torso and dragging her knuckles across the exposed skin at the base of her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You're not working anymore," Rio murmured against her ear, her lips grazing the edge of it. "You're winding yourself too tight again, querida."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have a lecture to finish for tomorrow,” Agatha replied, but her voice had softened. She tilted her head slightly, betraying herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t care about your lecture,” Rio said, tongue brushing the shell of her ear before she tugged lightly on the lobe with her teeth. “I care about how your pulse is racing. I care that your body is begging to be touched and you keep denying it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed. Her pen fell from behind her ear without her noticing. </span>
<span>Rio’s hand moved slowly — dangerously — up her stomach beneath the blouse, the back of her fingers trailing up the skin until they brushed just below her bra. <em>She didn’t push. She didn’t grab. She waited.</em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched. </span>
<span>"<em>Rio</em>..." Her voice was a warning. <em>A plea</em>. A threat wrapped in want.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmm. <em>There it is</em>,” Rio purred. “That edge. Right between giving in and keeping control. I live for that in you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed a kiss just behind Agatha’s jaw, hot and open-mouthed, while her other hand slid between Agatha’s thighs from behind—still over the fabric, but enough to make her gasp and tense forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me take care of you, <em>baby girl</em>,” she whispered. “Let me make you forget why you needed to be strong tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned in her arms then, finally facing her, eyes burning with that mix of defiance and need that always undid them both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t get to call me that right now,” she breathed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked and leaned in, brushing her lips over Agatha’s but not kissing her. “Then stop acting like one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand shot up, gripping Rio’s jaw with the same force she used when wielding magic—firm, commanding, electric. But her kiss when it came was slow. Hungry. A surrender that felt like a threat. She devoured Rio’s smirk, swallowed her arrogance, and pulled her in tighter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m still in control,” Agatha hissed against her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled against her mouth, eyes glinting. “Of course you are, baby.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>
<em>But neither of them believed that.</em>
</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest rose and fell in a deliberate, strained rhythm, her breath heavy with a mix of restraint and surrender as Rio leaned in closer. The fire behind them had burned down to glowing embers, casting low amber light across the room, shadows stretching long like the reach of something primal. The silence was thick, broken only by the soft patter of rain against the windows, a steady, intimate sound that made everything inside feel more secret, more charged. </span>
<span>She still had her hand on Rio’s jaw — <em>assertive, stubborn</em> — but her grip was slipping. Not from weakness, but from the war inside her. Her fingers trembled, not in fear, but in anticipation, in the quiet ache of knowing she wanted to let go and not knowing what it would cost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed the corner of her mouth again, letting her lips linger without claiming more. <em>She didn’t need to. Not yet.</em> Agatha’s silence was permission enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled softly. “Where are the kids?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t step back. She nuzzled down, grazing her lips along Agatha’s chin, then kissing the hollow beneath her ear — her voice low and sultry, like velvet pulled slow across bare skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>Exhausted</em>,” she murmured. “I took them to the park for hours. Ran them like wolves. Swings, trees, hide and seek. Let Nick bury me in leaves. Nicole lectured me on structural integrity. We came home soaked and muddy. I fed them, bathed them, tucked them in. They’re out cold, Agatha. <em>I planned this</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She said it like a confession — dark, sweet, deliberate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I need you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands tightened on Rio’s shoulders, fingers curling into her shirt like claws trying not to drag her closer. <em>There was guilt</em>. Of course there was guilt. <em>She was a mother</em>. But it warred with desire so sharp her teeth clenched. Her jaw ached with restraint. Her thighs pressed together reflexively. </span>
<span>Rio sensed it — she always did — and bit down gently on Agatha’s earlobe, tugging just enough to derail the train of maternal worry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“<em>They’re safe</em>. Dreaming. Warm in their beds,” Rio whispered against her skin. “I wanted to make time for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard. Her throat bobbed, tight with the weight of control slipping. Rio’s voice wound down her spine like silk soaked in heat, and her magic — gods, her magic — stirred beneath her skin, wild, eager, humming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And if I say no?” she asked, pushing, testing, needing to know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stepped in, their bodies fully aligned now. The firmness of her palm flattened against Agatha’s stomach, just beneath the soft curve of her ribcage. Her breath brushed hot over Agatha’s neck where her pulse betrayed her, frantic and pleading.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then I’ll say goodnight, mi reina. <em>A no is a no</em>” Rio murmured. She dragged her nose along the line of Agatha’s jaw, her hands unmoving now — just heat and weight and promise. “I never take what you don’t offer. I’m not here to own you. <em>I’m here to serve you</em>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s knees  threatened to give. That wasn’t seduction — it was devotion. And it scared her, maybe more than anything ever had. <em>Because it was real.</em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled back just enough to meet Rio’s gaze, her voice shaky. “You wore them out… just to have me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, soft curls brushing Agatha’s collarbone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not just to have you. To make room for you. <em>For us</em>. You’re tired, baby. End of semester, Nick begging for vacation, the whole damn situation with Ralph tightening around your throat. You’re burning out and I can see it. I just wanted to be the one who holds you through it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. Not with words. </span>
<span>The rain deepened outside, drumming a lazy lullaby against the glass. The fire crackled low behind them, casting flickers of orange across Rio’s cheekbones, across Agatha’s trembling hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, softly — barely a breath — Agatha whispered, “Take me upstairs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something shifted in Rio. </span>
<span>Her body straightened, energy surging through her frame like lightning finding its charge. That smirk reappeared, slow and hungry, all wolf and worship. She slid her hands under Agatha’s thighs and lifted her, cradling her like something sacred. Agatha gasped quietly, arms looping around her neck, their mouths <em>so close now, so warm, so aching</em>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move yet. She needed to hear it again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Say it,” she whispered, her voice like velvet steel. “again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lashes fluttered. Her body trembled against Rio’s, tension and need coiled like a storm inside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take me upstairs, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, deep and guttural, and then kissed her — hard and slow and claiming. It was a kiss that said mine without apology. She didn’t ask for surrender. She took it, because Agatha had given it willingly. </span>
<span>Then she turned, carried her toward the stairs, one step at a time, their bodies molded together—heat, history, and hunger. </span>
<span>Behind them, the house was quiet. The fire burned low. The storm began to scream against the windows. But they heard nothing but each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The stairs creaked softly under Rio’s boots, but her hold on Agatha was unwavering — firm, possessive, but gentle. As if she were carrying a flame too precious to risk dimming. Agatha clung to her with one hand curled behind Rio’s neck, the other tangled in the fabric at her shoulder, fingers bunching reflexively as the heat between them deepened. Her breath brushed against Rio’s cheek, uneven and hot. </span>
<span>The upstairs hallway was dimly lit by the wall sconces — flickering gold light playing over old framed photographs, shadows slanting across the wood panels. But Rio didn’t pause. Her steps were slow, measured, intentional. Like she was savoring each footfall. Each second closer to where she could finally let go. </span>
<span>When they reached the bedroom, Rio nudged the door open with her hip. The room greeted them with silence and softness. The bed was neatly made, the covers a pale gray, the lamps casting soft pools of amber over the sheets. Rain tapped steadily on the windows. The storm had not let up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t speak as she crossed the room. She placed Agatha on the bed like she was glass — not fragile, but <em>sacred</em>. She hovered there for a moment, standing over her, eyes trailing down Agatha’s body with reverence and heat. </span>
<span>Agatha looked up, chest rising, flushed and silent. Her hair spilled over the pillows, and her lips were parted just slightly. She was still dressed, but barely holding onto her composure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down, brushing her knuckles along Agatha’s jaw. "Take off your blouse for me, my love. <em>Slowly</em>. I want to watch you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes searching Rio’s for a beat — and what she found there undid her. </span>
<span>She sat up, unbuttoning one clasp at a time. The fabric slipped from her shoulders, revealing the swell of her collarbones, the curve of her chest in black lace. Rio’s eyes darkened as she knelt onto the bed, kneeling between Agatha’s thighs, fingers tracing her hips, reverent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You taught me everything," she whispered, voice ragged with awe. "So tonight, I’m going to prove how well I learned."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but Rio caught it in a kiss — deep and dragging, like she meant to taste every word Agatha didn’t say. Her tongue was slow, dominant, coaxing. Her hands roamed without hesitation. </span>
<span>One gripped Agatha’s thigh, pulling her closer by the waist, the other slipped into her hair and tugged lightly until Agatha gasped. That sound — raw, surprised — was Rio’s favorite symphony.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha broke the kiss only to whisper, voice hoarse: "You’re being greedy."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, her lips brushing Agatha’s collarbone as she spoke. "Of course I am. You’re mine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She kissed down her chest, slow and possessive, biting lightly just above the curve of her breast. </span>
<span>Agatha arched into her, moaning low. Her hands finally let go, clutching Rio’s back now instead of resisting. The edge of control was gone. Only surrender remained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio? She worshipped. </span>
<span>With hands, with lips, with every whispered praise against fevered skin. She stripped Agatha of doubt before she stripped her of anything else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Let go," she murmured. "Tonight, you don’t carry anything but me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And Agatha obeyed.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room held a reverent silence, broken only by the quiet sigh of the rain brushing the windows. Rio set Agatha down gently on the edge of the bed, her hands warm and steady as they skimmed down her sides, grounding her — not just in the moment, but in the body that trembled slightly under her touch. </span>
<span>Agatha leaned back on her elbows, breath shallow, her blouse hanging loosely over her frame, collarbone exposed and glowing softly in the firelight. Her eyes searched Rio’s face—not with fear, but with a growing ache she couldn't suppress any longer. An ache that had built over lifetimes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knelt between her thighs. </span>
<span>It was an act done without flourish or fanfare, but there was something sacred in the movement. <em>A reverence</em>. Her hands found Agatha’s knees and gently parted them, thumbs pressing softly into the sensitive skin of her inner thighs, coaxing, never demanding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re sure?” Rio asked, voice low and velvet-rich, brushing like a hush across Agatha’s skin. Her breath, warm and steady, ghosted over the hem of the sleep shorts, and Agatha’s stomach fluttered in response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly, her lips parting but no words forming just yet. Her breath caught when Rio leaned in and pressed a single kiss against the inside of her knee, like a vow. Then another — closer. <em>Then another</em>. </span>
<span>Rio’s fingers slipped beneath the waistband of the shorts, her touch slow, unhurried. She wasn’t tearing anything away. She was unveiling something precious. Her eyes flicked upward, locking with Agatha’s, asking again in silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take them off,” Agatha whispered, her voice hoarse, eyes glassy with both desire and trust. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a breath she didn’t realize she was holding, then gently tugged the fabric down, inch by inch, as if the moment demanded patience. The shorts slid away easily, and then, just as delicately, Rio traced her thumbs along the curve of Agatha’s hips, hooking the edge of her underwear with barely-there pressure. </span>
<span>Agatha’s hands found the bedsheets, gripping them as her breath shivered out of her. Not from fear. <em>From anticipation. From being seen. </em></span>
<span>As the last fabric slipped away, Rio didn’t immediately touch her. She simply looked—drinking her in with an expression soft with awe, yet laced with something darker and deeper. Worship. Possession. Hunger carefully leashed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re unreal,” Rio murmured, voice thick. “Every time I see you like this, I think maybe I imagined it all. That no one could be this beautiful. This powerful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a quiet laugh, shaky and breathless. “I’m sweaty and tired, Rio. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio said, rising slightly to press a kiss to the hollow just below her navel, her hands still warm on Agatha’s thighs. “You’re perfect. My beautiful woman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's legs tensed gently around her waist at that, breath catching. Rio looked up, sensing the shift — the slight tilt of Agatha’s chin, the widening of her pupils, the quick flutter in her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Control. Challenge. Need.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Say it again,” Agatha said, her voice no longer breathless — it was low. <em> </em></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile curved slow and reverent. She pressed her lips just above Agatha’s hipbone and whispered against her skin:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“My beautiful woman.” </span>
</em>
<span>And the look in Agatha’s eyes when their gazes met again — dark, burning, already undone — was all the permission Rio needed to worship her like a goddess born from flame.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The chalk scraped softly across the blackboard, each stroke deliberate as Agatha wrote a date above the phrase “<em> Ritual Symbolism in Early European Settlements </em>.” Her voice had been calm and steady just moments before, carrying the same confidence she always did when talking history. But something inside her had shifted — so subtly at first she thought it was just exhaustion. A flicker. A hum. A pressure rising at the back of her skull like storm clouds gathering.</p><p>The heat in the room changed. A sudden wave surged through her — violent, unseen. Like being pulled underwater mid-breath. The piece of chalk slipped from her fingers, hit the board with a clack, and shattered. She staggered back, her chest heaving, vision going sideways. Books slipped from her arm and scattered across the floor with a thud that echoed in the quiet room.</p><p>A gasp left her lips.</p><p>Rio, seated beside the desk — legs crossed, spinning a pen between her fingers and barely pretending to take notes — snapped to attention. The pen dropped from her hand. She was moving before she even knew why, fast and fluid like smoke pulled by instinct. In two strides, she was kneeling beside Agatha, her fingers already cradling her face.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, hey, love, look at me," she murmured, her voice a careful blend of alarm and calm. Her thumb brushed over Agatha’s cheek. “<em> Agatha </em>. You’re okay. You’re safe.”</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha’s gaze was distant, unfocused, as if staring through dimensions only she could see. Her lips parted, breath shallow. Sweat gleamed at her hairline.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, mi amor,” Rio said again, firmer now, both palms cupping her cheeks. “Stay with me. Look at me, <em> please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked rapidly, confusion etched across her expression. Her pupils were dilated, her lips trembling.</p><p> </p><p>“Where... where am I?” she whispered, eyes darting around as if expecting to see someone — or something — else. “Where’s... where’s the <em> road </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stiffened. “What road, baby? You’re in your classroom. You’re with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“A classroom?” Agatha looked down at herself, then around at the students who now stared in awkward silence, shifting uneasily in their seats.</p><p> </p><p>A red-haired girl raised a tentative hand. “Professor Harkness…?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She turned her head over her shoulder, her voice like velvet wrapped around steel. “Class dismissed. <em> Now </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>There was no protest. Chairs scraped back, bags slung over shoulders. The students filed out quickly, heads low, whispering as they passed. A door clicked shut behind them, leaving only the hum of the overhead lights and Agatha’s rapid breaths.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around herself as if suddenly cold. “Rio... it’s coming back too fast. Flashes. Fire. You — your eyes glowing green. My magic bursting. There was... a path. A long one. And five people. I couldn’t see their faces, but I knew them. I knew them like I knew my own blood.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed her forehead to Agatha’s and closed her eyes, her own heart thudding against her ribs. She hated this — hated not knowing, not being able to shield her.</p><p> </p><p>“I can stop it. Just breathe, okay? Stay with me,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Then she kissed her forehead softly, reverently, and murmured something ancient and sacred in Latin — <em> Oblivio levare. Dolorem quietare. Memoriam domare. </em></p><p>Agatha gasped, her back arching slightly, and then the sharp current within her dulled. The storm passed. She slumped into Rio’s arms with a sigh that sounded like surrender and relief all at once.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand trembled uncontrollably as she reached for Rio’s arm. “What’s happening to me, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her tighter, as though she could physically bind her together. “I don’t know. And I hate not knowing. But I <em> swear </em> to you — I will find out. I’ll fix this. I’ll burn down every law of time and soul and god if I have to. But no one’s touching you again, not while I’m breathing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded weakly, the effort making her head spin. “Don’t leave me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t even if the universe begged me to,” Rio whispered fiercely, brushing damp strands from her lover’s forehead. “I'll call someone to be with you. You want Lilia? Or Wanda?”</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia…” Agatha mumbled. “Wanda asks <em> too many </em> questions.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, kissed her temple. “Smart choice.”</p><p> </p><p>She helped her up slowly, guiding her gently to sit in the chair behind her desk. The grip of Agatha’s fingers around Rio’s hand didn’t weaken, and Rio didn’t try to pull away.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll call her. I’ll take care of everything. You just rest, minha sombra.” Rio cupped Agatha’s jaw one more time and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. “Whatever this is… I’ve got you, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>And as she turned to call Lilia, her mind was already running — through spells, protections, archives, and names buried deep in time. Whatever had been set into motion… she would break it before it took Agatha from her again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The hallway outside the classroom was dim, lit only by the soft, flickering glow of the old overhead fixtures. The quiet tick of a distant clock echoed like a heartbeat in the hush between them. Lilia stood near the window, arms folded, her shawl slipping slightly off one shoulder like it always did, but she never seemed to mind. Her silver-streaked hair was pinned with care, but her eyes — sharp, dark, knowing — were wholly unamused. Rio leaned against the wall opposite her, arms crossed in imitation, though the restlessness in her stance betrayed her stillness. She looked like she belonged to another world entirely — because she did. Her shirt sleeves were rolled just above her wrists, revealing the faint glint of the tattooed leaves running along her forearm. One of them was curling at the edge — fading. Decaying. She didn’t bother hiding it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re avoiding the real conversation,” Lilia said, finally breaking the silence with the kind of measured calm only a woman who’s raised both children and spirits could wield. Her gaze didn’t waver. “You keep circling, but you’re not saying what you need to say.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched, but it wasn’t quite a smile. “I don’t need your insight tonight, Lilia.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not offering it. I’m <em> demanding </em> honesty.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed off the wall, walking a slow, deliberate line closer. The air around her seemed to ripple with something old — weightless, but impossible to ignore. She wasn’t trying to intimidate. <em> She didn’t need to. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You know more than you’re pretending to hide, <em> witch </em>,” Rio said, stopping just close enough for the chill she carried to clash with Lilia’s warmth.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow, unshaken. “You’re the one talking in circles, <em> Death </em>. Not me.”</p><p> </p><p>The word landed between them like a blade — not sharp, but heavy. Certain. Undeniable.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “She knows.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, her mask slipping just a hair. But Lilia didn’t gloat. She simply looked at her the way mothers do when they catch a child lying — not with anger, but with tired affection. Disappointment layered under knowing.</p><p> </p><p>“You knew?” Rio asked, the question low and quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve always known,” Lilia replied. “The way you watch her. The way the shadows shift when you breathe. The way time stills around you, even when you try to look human.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard and looked away for a moment, jaw tight. “Then why didn’t you say anything?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because it wasn’t my place,” Lilia said. “But you are running out of time to keep pretending you’re not part of this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s throat worked, her pulse ticking visibly at her neck. <em> She hated this </em>. She hated not having answers, hated even more being the source of pain she couldn’t control. Her voice softened when she finally spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t come here to play at being human. I came to protect her.” She looked up, locking eyes with Lilia now. “I’ve failed before. But not this time.”</p><p> </p><p>There was something raw in her voice — stripped down and real. Not divine. Not eternal. Just... <em> Rio </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s features eased, though her arms didn’t uncross. “Have you hurt her?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio’s answer was immediate. “I wouldn’t. Not even by accident.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Lilia replied. “Because if you had... I’d find a way to make even you regret it.”</p><p> </p><p>There was no malice in her tone — <em> only love </em>. Fierce, protective, maternal. And Rio nodded like she respected it.</p><p> </p><p>“Just stay with her,” she said softly. “She trusts you. She needs a voice that won’t lie. And if something changes... if she gets worse... call me first.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia studied her for a long moment, then let her arms fall to her sides. “You know I will. But this mess — this storm building around her — it has your signature on it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She only said, with a tremble barely audible under her words, “Just take care of her for me. I swear, this time I’ll fix everything. I won’t lose her again.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stepped closer, reaching out to gently touch Rio’s arm — not for comfort, but to ground her. “Then stop trying to fix the <em> past </em> ,” she said. “And be here when she needs you in the <em> present </em>. You got a big knew chance, Rio, don't waste it”</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes. And for a moment, Death let herself feel fear.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The classroom was hollow. <em> Silent. Lifeless </em>. The walls that once echoed laughter and questions now stood heavy with dread. The overhead lights had gone out, leaving only the cold gleam of moonlight filtering through the windows in fractured slants. Dust floated in the air, catching the silver glow like ghosts suspended mid-breath.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen in place, her chest rising in panicked stutters. Her books were still scattered across the floor where she had fallen. The silence cracked.</p><p> </p><p>And then — <em> Laughter </em> . Low at first. <em> Male </em> . Sharp. Then higher — <em> feminine </em>, cruel, like wind catching broken glass and twisting it into something that sounded almost like Evanora. But it wasn’t. She knew it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, Agatha, Agatha,” the voice sang mockingly through the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Ralph emerged from the back of the room, strolling between the student desks like a serpent weaving through tall grass. His footsteps echoed too loud, his palms clapping slowly and deliberately with each step. That mocking grin — too wide, too calm — split his face as though it had been carved into him.</p><p> </p><p>“Finally alone,” he murmured, tilting his head to watch her. “Uncomfortable, isn’t it? <em> The voices. The fragments. </em> The memories crawling under your skin. You look just like she did, you know. Right before she left you.”</p><p> </p><p>His voice was venomous, but it wasn’t just his. Agatha’s eyes snapped downward — to the floor where the light of the moon tried to catch his shadow. <em> But it wasn’t his. </em> Ralph’s body moved freely, but the shape trailing him, mimicking his movements, was taller, more angular. <em> Feminine </em>. With a cruel tilt to the shoulders and hair too stiff to be real. A shadow with her mother’s figure — Evanora’s — yet Agatha could feel, down to her marrow, that whatever it was… it was worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Ralph…” she breathed, her voice trembling, barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to move. To run. To scream. But her legs wouldn’t obey. Her fingers wouldn’t unclench. Her heartbeat was thundering in her ears, drowning out all rational thought.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio — <em> where was Rio? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “<em> Death </em> ,” she called out. “ <em> Rio </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>Ralph grinned wider. “Ah, no. She won’t be hearing you today, wife.”</p><p> </p><p>He took another step forward, arms spread like a stage actor. The sick glee on his face made her stomach churn.</p><p> </p><p>“She can’t feel you right now. My friend — <em> Vengeance </em> — she’s playing with her senses. Like a harp. And she’s very good with strings.”</p><p> </p><p>His hand went to his waist, drawing something that gleamed under the dim moonlight. <em> A gun. </em> No spell. No curse. Just a weapon. Brutal. <em> Human </em>. Real.</p><p> </p><p>“I begged to die! I begged for her to come when you tore my mind apart,” he hissed. “When you pulled myself from me like skin. <em> But she didn’t </em> . She let me rot. So now she’ll watch you die. And after you — your <em> children </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, a sob catching in her throat. Her knees almost gave, but her will stiffened, fueled by rage and fear.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Rio </em> !” she shouted again, stumbling toward the door, hand outstretched. Her voice cracked under the strain. “ <em> Please </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No answer. Just silence. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And Ralph’s breath — shallow and fast, like an addict near euphoria. He followed her with a slow pace, the barrel of the gun casually swinging by his side.</p><p> </p><p>“She let you die, Agatha. Did she tell you that? The way it <em> really </em> happened?” His voice began to shift — warping — until it wasn’t his anymore. The edges frayed and softened into something honeyed and cruelly sweet.</p><p> </p><p>The voice of her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“You died in her arms,” it said. “<em> Begging </em>. Stealing her power with your mouth on hers. And she let you finish. Let you fade. Like every man and woman in your cursed life — she abandoned you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled, her back pressing against the cold wood of the classroom door. “<em> You’re lying </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no,” the voice answered in that mock-Evanora lilt. “I was your mother. I know you. I saw it in your eyes the first time you realized <em> no one would love you </em> the way you loved them. Especially her.”</p><p> </p><p>The air had grown colder. Her breath fogged faintly, but the fire in her limbs burned now with raw panic.</p><p> </p><p>“Where is your son?” the voice cooed. “Where’s Nicholas, Agatha? Oh, that’s right. She took ‘im. She keeps him in her world. Her realm. Where you don’t belong.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Enough </em> !” Agatha snapped, her voice breaking. “ <em> Enough </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>She clutched at her wrist — her left wrist — where the connection always buzzed when Rio was near. It wasn’t buzzing. <em> Not yet. </em>But Agatha had never needed it more. She dug her fingers into her own skin, squeezing until she could feel her pulse racing beneath her thumb. She closed her eyes, trembling, trying to focus.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio… baby, <em> please </em> . <em> I need you </em>.” A sob escaped her. And for a second, just a second, the air shifted. Only slightly. Barely enough to feel.</p><p> </p><p>“She <em> can’t </em> hear you,” Ralph sneered. “And when she does come… it’ll be too late. Because she can’t kill me. And if she doesn’t… I’ll tear you apart piece by piece until she breaks.”</p><p> </p><p>He aimed the gun now, arm steady. The silver barrel caught the moonlight like a blade.</p><p> </p><p>“But maybe I’ll let her watch.” Agatha didn’t answer. She looked him straight in the eye, even as tears slipped down her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> She’s coming </em> ,” she whispered. Her voice shook, but it was resolute. “She’s <em> always </em> come for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, through her clenched teeth — soft but sharp like a blade beneath silk — Agatha spoke the words that cut through dimensions:</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Death </em> , come to me, <em> my love.” </em></p><p> </p><p>The classroom was no longer just a classroom. The air felt warped — thicker, heavy with something ancient and foul. The shadows had deepened unnaturally, bleeding down the walls like ink in water. Agatha’s heartbeat thrummed behind her ears, loud and erratic. Each breath she took was shallow, sharp, burning against her lungs.</p><p>Ralph was advancing slowly. But it wasn’t really Ralph anymore. His gait was stiffer, head cocked at a wrong, puppet-like angle, as though the bones underneath didn’t belong to the flesh. And behind him, that shadow — her mother’s outline — twitched unnaturally, like smoke caught in a wind Agatha couldn’t feel.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to touch you,” Ralph’s voice rasped, or rather, her voice through him. “Just a finger to your mind, dear Agatha. Just one caress, and you’ll forget all about her. <em> You’ll be mine </em>. Ours. Forever.”</p><p> </p><p>His hand rose — slow, almost tender — as if to bless, not to hurt. But Agatha felt the dread rise in her like a tsunami. Her whole body screamed no. If that thing touched her,<em> it would break something. Twist something. Something she wouldn’t be able to come back from. </em></p><p> </p><p>“No!” she choked, stumbling backward, knocking into the edge of a desk, her palm scraping against the metal as she shoved it between them. She kept moving, faster now, darting toward the tall windows at the side of the classroom. “<em> Rio </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>But nothing. Only the sound of her own breath and his footsteps. <em> Tap. Tap. Tap. </em> Outside, it was night. <em> How had it become night so quickly? </em> The world beyond the window was painted in deep blue and bruised black, the sky thick with clouds that looked like they were holding their breath.</p><p> </p><p>Ralph’s face twisted into a grin too wide for his skull. “I want to see her fall to her knees for you, Agatha,” he hissed. “<em> Begging. Screaming </em>. Because when she breaks her sacred rule, when she kills me in this form… she becomes mine.”</p><p> </p><p>The female voice — the thing wearing her mother’s cadence — echoed around the room like wind through a crypt.</p><p> </p><p>“She will burn the rules for you. Burn the order. And when she does, <em> I will take her </em>. Every inch. Every shard of her broken loyalty. Vengeance will own her, and the stars will bleed for it.”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Agatha gasped.</p><p> </p><p><em> She didn’t want Rio to come now. Not like this. </em> Not when she was cornered and scared and outmatched. Not when breaking that rule might twist her beloved into something else. Something monstrous. Something lost.</p><p>She turned — just in time to see Ralph raise the gun again, the metal glinting under the classroom’s artificial lights like the grin of a beast that had waited too long for blood.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry,” he purred, his voice dripping with venomous calm. “Just a little wound, darling. Just enough to make you <em> stay still </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a flash of steel, a sound that cracked time in two. The shot fired.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her chest. Her body reacted before her mind could. Her knees buckled. She shut her eyes tight, bracing for the impact — sharp, burning, the kind of pain that came with the certainty of ending.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But nothing came. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No pain. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No fire. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No darkness swallowing her whole. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Just… silence. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A silence too still. <em> Too wrong </em>. It was the kind of silence that felt like the air had turned solid. That something ancient had awoken and everything around it had instinctively stopped to kneel.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes slowly, unsure if she was dead. Expecting, maybe, the sterile white of some imagined afterlife or the crimson haze of bleeding out. But what she saw froze every cell in her body.</p><p>There, standing between her and Ralph, was a figure that did not belong to the human world.</p><p>Tall. Impossibly still. Cloaked in shadow and presence so dense it seemed to eat the light around it. The air rippled around her like heat rising off black stone, though the cold that emanated from her made Agatha’s skin break out in goosebumps. Even without seeing her face, Agatha knew — <em> knew </em> — that this wasn’t the Rio she kissed before sleep. This wasn’t the Rio who whispered soft things against her throat in the morning or kissed her fingertips while cooking.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This… was Death. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The gunshot’s echo had long since died, and yet the world hadn’t moved forward. Everything remained frozen — held in suspense as if creation itself waited to see what this being would do. And then Agatha saw it. <em> The bullet. </em>It hovered mid-air like an afterthought, suspended as if even gravity didn’t dare interfere. Rio reached out — slow, graceful, sovereign — and took it between two fingers, inspecting it with cold detachment. The bullet seemed to resist at first, trembling in her grip, but then she squeezed, and it crumpled like paper between her fingers. The sound of its collapse was deafening, a crack of finality that echoed through Agatha’s bones.</p><p>She couldn’t move. Her legs had gone weak, her arms hung at her sides. Her heart pounded against her ribcage with the force of a caged thing. She should’ve felt safe. But instead, she felt everything. <em> Awe. Terror. Grief. Love. Reverence. </em> All of it tangled and burning just beneath her skin.</p><p>Her gaze lifted — slowly — scanning the figure’s silhouette. A long coat, dark as space, wrapped around a body that defied reason. Part armor, part shadow, part bone. Leather wrapped around her midsection like armor, stretched over a ribcage that shimmered between flesh and nothing. Her shoulders broad, inhuman. Her presence overwhelming. The place where her face should be was… almost familiar. <em> Almost hers </em>. Almost Rio.</p><p> </p><p><em> Except it wasn’t </em>.</p><p> </p><p>And yet when Agatha found the eyes — those brilliant, golden, mournful eyes — her heart clenched so tight she could barely breathe. Because they were Rio’s. <em> Undeniably </em> . And despite the monstrous silhouette, despite the darkness clinging to her like smoke, those eyes looked at her with the same quiet desperation Agatha had seen every time Rio had whispered <em> please be safe </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled, her throat tightening, her voice a breath barely audible: “…Rio?”</p><p> </p><p><em> She wasn’t sure which was worse — witnessing the raw embodiment of Death or knowing that it still loved her. </em>Her outline pulsed with wrongness. The shadows bent toward her like gravity. The air grew heavier with every second, filled with the scent of ash, iron, and something ancient — something final.  Ralph faltered. So did the shadow. Whatever controlled him, it didn’t understand how Rio had broken through the enchantment, how she had found Agatha inside a layered illusion of fear and silence.</p><p>Rio exhaled, her voice not coming from her lips but from inside her — echoing like thunder through the marrow.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> I-I sssmelled veerminn </em>.”, Rio's voice echoed not through her mouth, but throughout her body. Like the voice of God. A metallic, cold voice.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward slowly, graceful, menacing, like a predator indulging in the final moment before the kill. Her head tilted toward Ralph, eyes glowing brighter now.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “W-whichh of youu cockroachess iss ssniffing around… around what belongss to-to mmee?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Rio </em>,” Agatha breathed, frozen at the window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, not fully — just enough for one eye to catch her in profile. It was the only soft motion she allowed herself.</p><p>Agatha saw it. <em> Saw her </em>. Saw Rio’s truest self — and it stole the air from her lungs. Angled face, lips gone, jaw more bone than skin. And yet her gaze… those eyes held everything that mattered. Everything that had ever been gentle, fierce, and hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, my love…”</p><p> </p><p><em> “I-I’m ssorry I-I wass late,” </em> the voice echoed softly, rippling the shadows like a tide. <em> “B-But thank youu forr believing I-I’d come… come… </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She turned away from Ralph.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped forward hesitantly, chest rising and falling in shallow bursts. Her heart screamed both terror and relief. And when she reached for Rio’s hand, her fingers hesitated for only a moment. Rio’s hand was cold. Not like winter. <em> Like death. </em> Rigid, unmoving, more bone than flesh, and yet — <em> Agatha held it. Held her. </em>And the weight of it was undeniable. For the first time, Agatha felt what Rio truly was — not just her lover. Not just her protector. Not just the one who kissed her into peace.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She was Death. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked. “My love…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her face further away, trying to shield her, as if ashamed. <em> “D-don’t lookk at me… me, baby. Not… not like this.” </em></p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let go. She curled her fingers tighter around Rio’s palm, her other hand lifting gently to touch the edge of her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>“You came for me,” Agatha whispered, tears burning in her eyes. “That’s all I see. I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>The classroom felt like it had been uprooted from time itself. The walls pulsed faintly as if echoing a deeper heartbeat that did not belong to the earth. The shadows no longer clung to the corners — they moved. <em> Whispered. Watched. </em>And at the center of it all, between Agatha and the horror in Ralph’s form, stood Rio — shoulders squared, her back like a shield. She hadn’t moved since stopping the bullet, but her energy had shifted, and the air around her thickened with something raw and ancient.</p><p>Then came the voice. That feminine voice curled around them like smoke, slipping between cracks in the world.</p><p> </p><p>“The only way to make me stop… is to kill me, Death.”</p><p> </p><p>It echoed like a dare.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands remained clenched at her sides. Her entire form radiated tension, fury coiled tight beneath the surface. But it wasn’t just rage. <em> There was restraint too. Discipline. Love, heavy as armor. </em></p><p>Behind her, Agatha stepped closer, her breath uneven, her fingers trembling as they reached for Rio’s hand again. Cold, rigid, inhuman — and wrapped her smaller fingers around it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Why is she using his body?” Agatha whispered, her voice thick with fear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t turn. <em> Couldn’t </em>.</p><p> </p><p><em> “B-becausse Vengeancee hass no form of-of her own… own,” </em> she said, her voice echoing from within the bones of her chest. “ <em> S-she caan only possessss t-those consssumed by-by hatred. Ralph… Ralph… was broken. Hollowed out-out. Easy to infect. And she’s always wanted my-my body, because it’s the only one-one that could house her completely. B-but ssshe can’t have it unless I-I let her in through rage…rage.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her hand squeezed Agatha’s gently, almost apologetically.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “T-that’s why ssshe’s aafter you… you. S-she knows I-I’d lose myself if I-I lost you again… again. S-she can’t kill you herself — b-but Ralph can… caan” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The words were cold, but Agatha could feel the desperation laced between every syllable. She swallowed hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Then how do we stop this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s silence was heavy.</p><p> </p><p><em> “I-I need Eva,” </em> she said finally. <em> “S-she created the ward around this space… space — kept usss out. I-I only got through becaussse you’re my-my soulmatch. I-I felt your pull. You sssummoned me, A-agatha… withhh your pain… pain. With your need… Need” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to,” Agatha whispered. “I don't know how…”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I-It doesn’t matter… matter, love. Y-You did. B-but to-to bring Eva in… you’d have to-to summon her the same way.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t… I don’t know how.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped lower. Softer.<em> “N-neither do I-I. That’s why I-I’m going to protect you with everything I-I have until we figure it-it out… out.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes brimmed with tears. She lifted Rio’s hand to her lips and kissed the stiff, cold skin gently, her breath warm against her knuckles. The chill didn’t scare her. The bone didn’t scare her. The only thing that terrified her was the thought of losing this.</p><p>Rio watched the motion — silent, stunned. That someone could kiss this hand and still look at her with devotion. Still whisper her name with affection. <em> Still love her </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her soul ached.</p><p> </p><p><em> “She’s not afraid of me,” </em> she thought. <em> “Even now… even like this.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispered, her voice uneven, urgent. “Please, look at me, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Swallowing deeply, Rio turned to Agatha. Her heart, black as it was, beat beneath her ribs. If it was a contest of fear, Rio was winning.</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, still too afraid to show her full face, but Agatha caught a glimpse of the sharp bone beneath, the ancient shadows that stitched her together. <em> She was terrifying. Agatha didn’t care. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You're <em> beautiful </em> . So <em> powerful </em> and… <em> mine </em>. I can believe for even one second that I have you as my soulmate. Promise me that you won't hide yourself from me again, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes filled with tears, but none fell. She just closed her eyelids and held back the tears.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I-I swear it-it. But I-I need something from you too… too.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Y-you cannot let her words-words re-reach you. Y-you can’t let the visions in…in. Don’t let hate grow in you, Agatha… Agatha. I-if ssshe to-touches you, I-I don’t know what ssshe’ll do, but it will be bad… bad. S-she wants to turn you-you into a-a weapon. Or a key… a key.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, wiping her tears. “And if I fail?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Y-you won’t,” Rio said firmly. “Thi-think of the kids. Think of our-our home. Think of-of how I-I sound when-when I-I say your name… name. Use that to-to hold her out… out. Promise me… me.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly began to pull away, readying herself, her form tightening with the quiet rage of a divine sentinel. But Agatha tugged on her hand again.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” she said, her voice shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “I love every version of you. <em> The woman. The shadow. The Death. </em> I love all of it. <em> All of you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Finally, Rio turned, letting her face be seen completely by a lighting that broke outside. Her expression wasn’t fully human anymore — but her eyes were. They shone with that familiar warmth, with unbearable grief and need.</p><p> </p><p><em> “I-I love y-you too, A-agatha Harknessss,” </em> she said, her voice a reverent tremble. <em> “I-in every life-life you’ve ever lived… lived. I-in every one-one you will… will” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her hand slid out of Agatha’s. Then she stepped forward. Facing Ralph — and the thing inside him. The classroom darkened further, as if Rio’s presence demanded the light to kneel.</p><p> </p><p><em> “I-i ssmelled a roachh e-earlier,” </em> Rio said coolly, her voice now heavier, carrying the weight of death and dominion. <em> “Now-Now, againn, whichh one of-of you filthy creatures is-is creeping around what’s mine… mine?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Vengeance hissed through Ralph’s mouth, his lips curling into a snarl. “You’re too late. She’s already cracking. <em> She’s already afraid. </em> Soon, she’ll be <em> mine </em> — and when she is, you’ll break. And when you break… <em> I’ll wear you.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin was sharp. <em> “Try it. Try it.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Then the ground beneath them shuddered as the battle began. The storm inside the classroom had taken form. The walls shivered with a magic that didn’t belong to the mortal realm, and Rio stood at its eye — dark, tall, cloaked in her true form, eyes lit like golden fire behind the skeletal angles of her face. Her voice echoed from deep inside her, reverberating through bone, brick, and blood.</p><p>Across from her stood Vengeance, still anchored inside Ralph’s body, though the thing wearing his skin was grotesquely stretched now, its shadow bubbling and twisting with limbs that didn’t exist. Behind Rio, Agatha trembled, crouched near a row of overturned desks, sweat slicking her brow as her breath came shallow and erratic. Her eyes darted wildly, tracking every movement with terrified clarity.</p><p> </p><p>Then came the voice — not Ralph’s, but Evanora’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at you,” the shadow cooed, stepping forward, taking the precise shape of Agatha’s mother. “<em> Frail. Pathetic. </em> Just like always. Not even a witch anymore. You’re nothing without me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched as if struck. Her chest rose in short, fast breaths. The scent of old perfume — Evanora’s signature — filled the air, thick as rot. Her voice was like ice under the skin. <em> Familiar. Cutting. Designed to shatter her. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Stop…” Agatha whispered, eyes filling with tears. “You’re not her. You’re not my mother.”</p><p> </p><p>But the creature stepped closer, a twisted smile curling on her stolen face. “She never loved you. Not truly. You were an inconvenience. And now even Death pities you.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> No </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The shadow lunged to touch Agatha’s forehead, but her hand snapped up just in time, blocking the strike. Her fingers shook violently. Her mind reeled, teetering on a cliff. Pain bloomed behind her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And then — Agatha remembered.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered Rio’s mouth against hers the first time. The hesitant, unsure press of lips in a dark hallway. That first kiss wasn’t fireworks — it was curiosity. <em> Fear. Hope. It was good. Familiar. Like coming home. </em>She remembered Rio running down the museum aisles, pointing out ancient artifacts with childlike wonder, her laughter bouncing off marble walls.</p><p>She remembered Nick’s first breath, her little hands holding her face in the hospital. His little eyes opened and revealed the greenish coloration, thick brown and tangled strands. Nick looked so much like Rio, even as a baby. </p><p>She remembered Nicole's first birthday. How happy she was about the huge green cake.Her laughter echoing through the house and her clapping her hands when singing happy birthday.</p><p> </p><p><em> Her family. Her loves. This was real. This was hers and no one would take it away. </em>Clinging to those memories, Agatha pushed the vision of Evanora away.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not yours,” she hissed, standing fully now. “I was never yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Across the room, Rio and Vengeance collided.</p><p> </p><p>“You are nothing!” Vengeance spat, voice fracturing the air. “A ghost. A failed god. One day, she will die, Death. And then what will you be?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood her ground, unmoving. Her spine was steel. Her aura wrapped around Agatha like a shield, every breath she took laced with protective rage.</p><p> </p><p><em> “W-when that day comes… comes,” </em> Rio’s voice vibrated, low and dangerous, <em> “I-I will guide her myself… my-self. A-and I’ll find her again… again. I-in the next li-life. And the ne-next. Because sshe is-is mine… mine. And I-I am hers… her. Y-you’ll never understand that… that. Be-because you don’t exist unless you-you infect someone. You-you have no form, no-no love, no soul… soul. You are rot… rot.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I’ll possess her,” Vengeance promised, her voice turning sickeningly sweet. “And I’ll be gentle.”</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>“You won’t touch her.”,</em> </b> This time Rio's voice came out clearly, accompanied by the thunder that exploded outside, shaking the window. Loud, strong, and vibrant.</p><p> </p><p>Then came Agatha’s scream.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spun just in time to see her collapse to the floor, her limbs twisting in pain. Rage lit her body like a flare. With a single motion, she reached out, gripped the false Evanora by the throat — her hand glowing white-hot — and hurled the shadow creature across the room, smashing it into rows of chairs. Sparks flew. The walls cracked.</p><p>Vengeance reeled in Ralph’s body, unbalanced. Rio didn’t hesitate. She turned, and with the full force of her fury, drove Ralph’s possessed frame into the chalkboard. The wall exploded in a burst of plaster and splinters. Ralph hit the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The world rippled. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Light returned. The windows flashed with afternoon sun again. The smell of chalk, dust, and old books replaced the stench of rage and rot. <em> The illusion shattered </em> . The classroom was whole again. Outside, distant chatter of students carried through the open hall. Only one thing was wrong. Ralph lay unconscious on the floor. <em> And Agatha wasn’t moving. </em></p><p> </p><p>“<em> Agatha </em> ! My love!” Rio’s voice cracked as she dropped to her knees beside her. Her dark form shifted, collapsing back into her human shape. Her jaw trembled as she cradled Agatha in her arms. “Baby… talk to me, please. <em> Please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked slowly. Her head fell against Rio’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>“That… <em> was really hot… </em>” she mumbled weakly. “Can you throw me against a wall one day?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breath between a sob and a laugh. “You're okay… thank all the fucking gods.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think so. My head just… it’s pounding.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand cupped her cheek, gently tilting her face. “Did she touch you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha whispered. “But the memories… they’re flooding back. Too fast. It hurts, Rio. It really hurts.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face softened with unbearable sorrow. “Shh, I’ve got you now. I’ve got you.” She kissed Agatha’s temple. “Let me take you home. We’ll fix this. Together.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded weakly. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood, lifting Agatha into her arms like she weighed nothing. As she carried her from the room, Ralph’s body lay still on the floor behind them. <em> Forgotten. Unconscious. Powerless. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> For now. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The bathroom was dim, lit only by the low amber glow of a salt lamp in the corner. Steam curled lazily into the air, carrying the soft scent of lavender and eucalyptus oil. The gentle slosh of water echoed against the tiled walls, broken only by the faint hum of Rio’s voice — singing something slow, wordless, and ancient. Her voice wasn’t perfect. It was raw, low in her throat, vibrating softly against Agatha’s spine where she knelt behind her in the tub. Agatha sat curled forward in the hot water, knees drawn to her chest, her forehead resting on her arms folded over the edge of the porcelain. Her soaked hair clung to her neck and shoulders. Her skin was flushed from heat and grief. Rio’s hands moved with care, not to seduce, not to provoke — just to hold. <em> To remind </em>. Her palms glided gently over Agatha’s back in slow, grounding circles, her thumbs pressing into the tense muscles beneath the skin. She felt every flinch. Every tremble. She whispered nonsense between the verses of her song — soft comforts like “I’ve got you,” and “you’re safe.”</p><p> </p><p>"I sent my brother to take Ralph to the station," she said softly, breaking the song for a moment. "Maybe... maybe Life can undo the lock she placed. Maybe this can stop."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her eyes were fixed on a spot on the wall. She wasn’t crying. But her stillness said everything.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha? Cariño... are you hearing me?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice was barely audible. “Lilia died…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered. “<em> No, no, baby. </em> She’s fine. She’s downstairs making something Italian and swearing in three languages because I brought her into all this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head slowly. “Not that Lilia. The other one. <em> The witch </em>. She fell. It was slow… she screamed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands stilled.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a memory, love. Just a memory.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her face slightly, resting her cheek on her arms. Her voice broke. “I don’t want them, Rio.<em> I don’t feel right. </em> I don’t know what’s real. I don’t know if the memory of Nick’s birth is ours… or hers. I don’t know which life this is. And Nicole — she never appears. Not once. Where is she, Rio?” Her breath hitched, and the tears finally fell. “ <em> Please </em>. Make it stop, my love. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed her forehead gently to Agatha’s shoulder. She wanted to be calm, but the ache in her chest was thunderous. The desperation in Agatha’s voice clawed at her ribs. Her skin felt too tight. Her own form trembled faintly now — not from exhaustion, but from helplessness.</p><p> </p><p>“I… Eva might be able to do it. But I…” Her voice faltered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hand from the water and found Rio’s, guiding it to her lips. Her kiss was warm, trembling. “<em> Please </em> ,” she whispered. “If it means losing all of them, I don’t care. Just don’t let her take you from me. Don’t let her bury you in all the noise. <em> You’re the only thing that makes sense. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her. Really looked at her. Her Agatha. Shivering in hot water. Haunted by lifetimes. Fragile and <em> still choosing her </em>. She knew the risk. Tampering with memories was more than dangerous — it could reset everything. Erase the present. Reboot a life that had taken years to rebuild. Agatha might forget her completely.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio also knew that watching Agatha break was no longer an option. "Okay," she whispered, her voice raw. “We’ll fix this. Together.”</p><p> </p><p>“Promise me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her temple, brushing wet strands behind her ear with trembling fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try to make sure the last thing you forget is my smile,” she murmured. “But if you do… I’ll make you fall for me again. I swear it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned, slowly, fragile in every movement. Her eyes were glassy, pupils blown wide. Her hand cupped Rio’s jaw.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t run away this time,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Never again, my queen,” she said, kissing her softly. “Even if you forget me… I’ll be right here, waiting to be remembered.”</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>The bedroom was quiet, the sound of the rain having softened into a gentle rhythm against the windowpane. Warm light spilled from the lamp on the nightstand, wrapping the room in golden calm. The steam from the bath still clung to Agatha’s skin, trailing in invisible wisps along her shoulders and collarbone.</p><p>Rio stood behind her, slowly brushing through the strands of Agatha’s damp hair with practiced care. Each stroke of the brush was a ritual — gentle, reverent. She had already dried Agatha’s back with a towel, wrapped her in a silk robe, and was now focused entirely on this task, as if detangling hair might somehow help untangle memories too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, her back straight, her breathing even but shallow. Her eyes were distant again, focused on nothing, until they weren’t. Until something flared behind them. <em> Suddenly, she turned </em>. Her fingers tangled into Rio’s hair with a kind of desperation that wasn’t panicked — it was primal. She yanked Rio down to her level, their faces crashing close, and sealed their lips together in a kiss that was more declaration than comfort.</p><p> </p><p>It caught Rio completely off guard. Her hands froze midair, still holding the brush. For a second, she didn’t breathe. Agatha’s lips were hot and commanding, and the force behind the kiss made Rio’s knees weaken. She dropped the brush with a soft clatter on the floor and slid her arms tightly around Agatha’s waist, pulling her in, molding their bodies together as if she could anchor them both in the now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just a breath, lips brushing against Rio’s, eyes dark and shining.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay, sweetheart?” Rio asked, her voice a little hoarse, as though the air had been knocked from her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved into something wicked. “Make no mistake — I will never forget you.” Her fingers tugged gently on Rio’s hair, enough to draw a soft, involuntary sound from her. Then she bit Rio’s bottom lip and whispered against it, “I’d hate to lose these reactions of yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, the sensation still lingering on her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Reminds me of the day I sank the Titanic for you,” Agatha continued, her voice velvety and amused. “You were so shocked by the deaths. Your face, Rio… priceless. You don’t remember it, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, then let out a stunned laugh, breathless and filled with disbelief. “You’re a sadist.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked and leaned in again, catching her lips in a deeper kiss. “And you love it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her harder this time, all restraint abandoned. Her hands slid under the silk robe, fingers splaying against the small of Agatha’s back. She didn’t push. She simply held her there, tasting every emotion Agatha was pouring into the kiss — anger, fear, want, love, all of it wrapped in heat and memory.</p><p> </p><p>When they pulled apart, foreheads pressed together, both of them breathing like they’d run through fire, Rio whispered, “Gods help me, I really do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand brushed down her chest slowly, palm open. “Then don’t leave. No matter what memory they take.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Rio said, her voice low and trembling with truth. “If I have to follow you through lifetimes again, I will<em> . I already have </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The bedroom was a sanctuary of sin — warm, dim, and thick with the scent of lavender oil and rising desire. The air itself seemed to pulse, heavy with the musk of sweat and something darker, something hungry. Agatha’s silk robe, once draped over her shoulders like a promise, now lay discarded beneath her knees, a pool of crushed fabric forgotten in the heat of the moment.</p><p>She straddled Rio’s waist, her thighs bracketing the other woman’s hips with possessive intent. Her mouth was a brand against Rio’s throat — sucking, biting, leaving behind a trail of blooming bruises that would linger for days. Teeth grazed the delicate skin just above Rio’s collarbone, and a sharp gasp escaped, followed by a breathless whimper that sent a thrill straight down Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers were knotted in the sheets, her grip so tight the fabric threatened to tear. Her head was thrown back, lips parted in surrender, her breath coming in ragged pants. The sound of her voice — low, wrecked, dripping with submission — made Agatha’s blood burn.</p><p> </p><p>"Gods, Aggs..." Rio groaned, her voice rough with pleasure. "You’re going to kill me before Vengeance ever gets the chance."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned against her throat, her lips slick with spit and the faint metallic tang of skin breaking under teeth. "<em> Good </em>," she purred, her voice a velvet threat. "That’s the plan."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to breathe against her skin, voice laced with that familiar danger.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m making sure your soul remembers me. In case Eva wipes your brain next.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the <em> one </em> losing memories,” Rio smirked through her sharp inhale, nails digging in slightly as Agatha rolled her hips.</p><p> </p><p>“But you're mine,” Agatha whispered, sinking her teeth again. “You need reminders.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to respond — something cocky, something sinful — but the air snapped. A sudden burst of golden light cracked in the corner of the room.</p><p> </p><p><em> Ahem. </em> The sound was deliberate. <em> Loud. Judgmental </em>. Agatha froze. Rio’s eyes snapped open, wide with dawning horror.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her mouth was still latched onto Rio’s neck, her teeth barely grazing the fresh mark she’d been in the middle of claiming. A thin string of saliva connected them, glistening in the dim light.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed. "Oh no."</p><p> </p><p>Slowly — agonizingly — Agatha lifted her head. Standing near the dresser, arms crossed, one perfectly manicured eyebrow arched in a look that could curdle milk, was Eva.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>OH FOR THE LOVE OF</em>—” The voice hit them like a thunderclap. Agatha froze mid-movement. Rio didn’t even turn her head, just closed her eyes with a sigh that came from the deepest, most exhausted part of her soul.</p><p> </p><p>Dressed in an immaculate white blouse and golden trousers that shimmered with celestial embroidery, she looked like she’d stepped straight out of a divine board meeting — only to walk in on something profoundly unholy.</p><p>Her gaze traveled from Agatha’s disheveled robe (barely clinging to her shoulders, her chest still heaving) to the rapidly darkening bruise on Rio’s neck. Then, with the slow, deliberate horror of someone who had seen too much, she blinked.</p><p> </p><p>"Well," Eva said, her voice drier than the Sahara. "<em> That </em> explains why no one answered the summoning."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brain short-circuited. "You couldn’t have knocked?"</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s expression flattened. "I’m a cosmic being, Agatha, not your <em> delivery driver </em> ." Then she turned her withering stare to her sister. "Rio. You’re not even wearing pants. <em> Again </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva stood at the edge of the room, hands on her hips, her expression a blend of scandalized horror and ancient disappointment — like she’d just walked in on two immortals breaking every celestial conduct code in the book.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you two have no boundaries? Is there some eternal law that says I must always be scarred by <em> your mating rituals </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“We are not mating…” Rio said defending herself. “<em> Yet </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, still on top of Rio, blinked once. Then again. “…She teleported. Into the bedroom,” she muttered in disbelief. “This can’t be real.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted one arm lazily and waved it toward Eva like she was swatting a fly. “We’re bonding. <em> Leave </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bonding?!” Eva barked. “You’re half-naked and she’s biting you like a starving wolf! You’re supposed to be protecting the mortal timeline, not —” she motioned vaguely to the bed, “— testing its endurance!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slowly reached for the sheets, dragging them up with royal dignity, even as she refused to move from Rio’s lap. “You’re the one who decided to pop in uninvited. This could’ve waited.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva dropped her hands, exasperated. “Ralph is awake again. And I need you both dressed, functional.” Rio raised an eyebrow. “Define ‘functional’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Agatha elbowed her, biting back a laugh as she felt the tremble of Rio’s body shaking with quiet laughter beneath her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, still sprawled beneath Agatha, had the audacity to smirk. "In my defense, you didn’t give me time."</p><p> </p><p><em> "I gave you weeks," </em> Eva snapped. "And instead of fixing the unraveling fabric of reality, you’re here letting Agatha turn you into her <em> personal chew toy </em>?"</p><p> </p><p>"I’ll have you know," she drawled, "she was doing a <em> fantastic job </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, trying — and failing — to pull her robe closed while still perched on Rio’s lap. The silk slipped, revealing far more than she intended, and she ended up clutching it to her chest like a half-hearted shield. </p><p> </p><p>"For the record," she muttered, "I was doing memory exercises. <em> Sensory </em>. Very effective."</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s glare could have melted steel. "Rio, shut up."</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "She’s stressed. I’m stress relief." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I said shut up!”</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s eye twitched. She looked skyward, mouthing what was either a prayer or a curse, before pinching the bridge of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>"This is the literal definition of <em> ‘not the time </em> .’ One of you is breaking from reality, the other’s being hunted by Vengeance, and you’re in here trying to turn her neck into a <em> constellation of hickeys </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Eva pinched the bridge of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>“Five minutes. And if I hear even one more moan from this dimension—”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll what?” Rio challenged, smirking as she tilted her head, fangs barely peeking through now that her power was stirring again.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll banish you to the Realm of Perpetual Abstinence.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped. “That’s a real place?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally climbed off Rio, adjusting her robe with as much dignity as she could muster.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, okay, I get it. Serious. Emergency. Doomsday. We’re back in goddess mode. <em> Happy </em>?"</p><p> </p><p>Eva exhaled like she was counting to ten in her head. Then, without another word, she turned toward the window, muttering something in a language that made the air hum with divine irritation.</p><p> </p><p>"Next time," she snapped over her shoulder, "I’ll manifest in the kitchen. At least then I won’t get PTSD from your sex life."</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted. Agatha threw a pillow at her. Eva vanished with a sound like the universe sighing in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>And then, <em> silence </em>. Agatha stared at the spot where Eva had been. Then, slowly, she turned back to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at Rio. “We’re never living this down.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned up at her. “Wanna make it worth it?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the worst.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you love it.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The air in the room was heavy, pulsing with something too big for the walls to hold — an invisible pressure that sat on all their shoulders. The window was cracked open, letting in a breeze that carried the smell of rain-soaked soil, but even that couldn’t cool the heat rising between them.</p><p>Eva stood near the armchair, her long coat still damp from the outside. Her arms were crossed, jaw tense, and eyes glowing faintly gold in the dim light of the room. She looked less like a divine being and more like an exhausted diplomat on the verge of breaking protocol just to get things done.</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t gone to the station yet,” she said flatly, eyes shifting between Agatha and Rio. “The humans are swarming around Ralph like moths to flame, trying to make sense of what he’s been saying. Talking about purple magic, you, Death, your relationship, his memory loss. <em> It’s chaos </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the couch, wrapped in a robe, still visibly shaken. Her wet hair clung to her neck and temples, a towel forgotten on her lap. She stared at Eva with quiet exhaustion, her fingers twitching slightly — restless, alert.</p><p> </p><p>“And Benny?” Rio asked, voice low, sitting close beside Agatha with one protective hand resting gently on her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Disguised as Officer Daniels,” Eva replied. “He’s watching Ralph. Making sure the bitch doesn’t crawl back into him. For now, Vengeance is circling, not feeding.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows drew together, her voice hoarse. “Can’t you just sneak in and wipe his mind like... like <em> clearing a hard drive </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Eva scoffed, a sharp, tired sound. “Oh sure, and then what? Everyone who saw him raving about witches and cosmic romance will just magically forget? The security footage? The phones? You people put cameras in your refrigerators now.”</p><p> </p><p>She ran a hand through her hair. “I’ll play devil’s advocate. Get him declared unstable, committed. Once he’s inside, I’ll erase everything — all his lives, all his pasts. Once he’s a ghost in his own skull, no one will care what he used to be.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence dropped like a stone. Agatha blinked. Her eyes flicked to Rio’s hand on her leg. Then slowly, they lifted to meet Eva’s. And then she stood. <b>Fast</b>.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> No </em> ,” she said. Her voice was clear, shaking — but sharp like a blade unsheathed. “Wait — no. <em> No fucking way </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha —” Rio started, already rising with her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha backed away, hands trembling. “Is that what you’re going to do to me?” Her voice broke into something more raw, more human. “Erase <em> everything </em> ? Just… rip me out of <em> myself </em> ? Because I won’t let you. I won’t become some blank thing that doesn’t remember my kids, or <em> you </em>—” she pointed at Rio, her voice cracking, “—or who I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, no one said —” Eva began, but Agatha cut her off.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> DON’T </em> !” she shouted. “Don’t talk like I’m not here. Like I’m some magical mess to fix. This is my mind. <em> My life </em>. You’ll have to kill me first!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for her. “Agatha — please —”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t <em> ‘Agatha’ </em> me, <em> Rio Vidal </em>!” she snapped, snatching her arm away. “Don’t touch me if you’re thinking of turning me into a goddamn vegetable.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped back like she’d been slapped, her throat bobbing as she swallowed something heavy. Her hands hovered in front of her like she didn’t know whether to reach again or let her go.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not like that,” Rio said, her voice lower now, full of ache. “It’s not what I want. But I —” Her words faltered. “I don’t want to lose <em> you </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, <em> congratulations </em>,” Agatha breathed, tears clinging to her lashes. “You’re almost there.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face crumbled. She turned sharply to Eva, eyes glowing in the dim light. “<em> Don’t touch her. </em> Don’t even think about touching her memories. I swear to you, if you do — I will walk away.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva froze. Rio stepped forward, each word a knife dragged across the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“I will walk away from the job. From the duty. From all of it. I will let the veil rot and the cycle shatter. <em> No more souls. No more guidance </em>. I will burn the line between realms to ash.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t do that,” Eva whispered, stunned. “You know you can’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will,” Rio snarled. “Let them try to stop me. Let them try to punish me. What will they do, Eva? <em> Kill me?” </em> She laughed, hollow and cruel. “Good fucking luck.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s mouth opened — then closed. She looked away, pained. “You think I want this? You think I enjoy being the one that has to say it out loud?”</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer, her voice softer, strained. “Her memories are merging, Rio. <em> Too fast </em> . The lives are colliding — both full of grief, love, trauma. If they don’t stabilize, one life could consume the other. <em> She could become someone else. </em> Someone who doesn’t know you. Or worse — someone who remembers everything and hates you for it. She could break. <em> Both of you could </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was shaking, chest rising and falling hard.</p><p> </p><p>"Revenge could take advantage of this hatred and possess Agatha. Then, you know what she wants, to possess <em> YOU </em>, Rio. She wants your body and she knows that by taking Agatha away from you, she can achieve that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll kill Vengeance,” she said through gritted teeth. “Before she touches her. I don’t care if she’s a concept. I’ll shatter her.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t kill a spirit,” Eva reminded quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t kill the <em> living </em> ,” Rio corrected, eyes glowing brighter now. “No one ever said anything about <em> cosmic parasites </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Another silence. Agatha stood between them, trembling, her hand at her chest like she was trying to keep something inside from cracking. Then, quietly, she whispered:</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re going to do it... make me forget the other life. <em> All of it </em>. But don’t you dare erase this one. Don’t you take Rio from me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to her, stricken. “Agatha—”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice trembled. “I don’t need to remember how we started to know that I love you. And if Eva takes that away, I’ll spend every life finding my way back to you. But I’d rather die than forget what we have now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio crossed the room in two strides and wrapped Agatha in her arms. The silence was full of breath and salt and the weight of the impossible.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t let them take you,” Rio whispered against her hair. “Even if I have to burn down every rule the gods ever made.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And for a moment, nothing moved but their hearts. Beating in defiance. Together. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chin rested on Rio’s shoulder, her tears soaking into the skin just above the collarbone. Her body trembled, more from exhaustion than emotion now, her breath warm and uneven. The scent of lavender soap from Rio’s skin, the salt of Agatha’s tears, the faint warmth of the fire crackling in the distance — all of it mixed into a moment suspended in time, like the fragile hush before a storm breaks open.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes you forget,” Agatha said, voice low and raw, “that I can do things too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head just enough to glance at her. “No one said otherwise, love.” She cupped Agatha’s cheek gently, her thumb grazing the tear-streaked skin like it was sacred.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a short, bitter laugh — dry as sand. She stepped back a little, but not out of anger this time. Just out of need to breathe her own air again.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> You gods. You beings. You immortal cosmic whatever-the-fucks. </em> You crash into <em> my </em> life like tidal waves and think you can just take over because you know the last leaf that fell on the ground and the first baby that cried at dawn.” She ran a hand through her tangled hair, her voice sharpening with every word. “I might not know those things. But I still survive <em> so much </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice rose, stronger now, her frustration boiling into something beautifully defiant.</p><p> </p><p>“Which one of you has pushed <em> out a baby </em> ? Three goddamn times because of your <em> fucking cosmic fingers </em> , Rio. <em> Alone </em> ?” she hissed, her hand gesturing sharply toward her stomach. “Which one of you bleeds <em> every month </em> and still wakes up at 6 a.m. to pack lunches, dress two hyper children with the energy of small lightning storms, put on heels, and go teach a classroom full of idiotic, hormonal teens who think TikTok is a source of wisdom?”</p><p> </p><p>Her hands clenched at her sides, and her eyes burned — not just with tears now, but fire.</p><p> </p><p>“It might not seem like a lot to you,” she said, spitting the word like venom. “<em> But to a human </em> , that is a hell of a lot. <em> I get tired </em> . But I’m <em> not weak </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Eva stood frozen in place. For once, even divinity looked startled. Humbled.</p><p> </p><p>“I can take so much more than you think I can. And if you erase my memories, that won’t save me from breaking. <em> That’ll break me </em> , just in a way where <em> I won’t know why I’m broken </em>. And I refuse to live like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lowered her eyes. And for once, the immortal — who had witnessed plagues, collapses, extinctions — <em> cried </em> . The tears slid down her face like raindrops against a window she couldn’t close. Ever since she learned what it was to weep, <em> she hated it </em> . <em> Every time. Especially now. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice softened, barely above a whisper, but full of resolve. “Eva… erase <em> everything </em> from that other life. I don’t want to know how I died. I don’t care why Rio took Nick too early, or who Lilia was to me, or what Wanda meant back then. I don’t need to remember being some all-powerful witch who sank the goddamn Titanic for the love of her life.”</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Rio now, directly, her expression carved from something ancient and tender. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need that life to know I love you. And if taking it from me dulls that feeling... then maybe I didn’t love you enough. And you, Rio, will just have to make me fall in love with you again. But if you run this time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped forward, lifted Rio’s chin with two fingers, and gently wiped away a tear from her cheek. Her touch was soft, but her gaze was brutal in its honesty.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll find you. <em> I’ll drag you back </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a soft, strangled breath. She looked like something divine and broken all at once. Like Death finally realized what life tasted like and couldn’t bear the thought of losing it again.</p><p> </p><p>“Or,” Agatha added, turning to Eva, “you slow the pace. Let the memories come in their own time. Let me decide one day which version of me I want to keep. But don’t you dare erase me. Not one part. Because if I do remember... and I find out you took even a single second of my truth from me... I swear to every deity who ever dared breathe —<em> I will find a way to kill every last one of you cosmic bitches.” </em></p><p> </p><p>She took another step closer. Her voice dropped like a curse wrapped in velvet.</p><p> </p><p>“And I won’t need Vengeance’s help to do it.”</p><p> </p><p>For a heartbeat, the silence was absolute. Even the wind outside seemed to pause. Eva and Rio both stared at Agatha like she had suddenly turned into something far bigger than mortal flesh. Her eyes gleamed with an eerie, familiar violet glow. It was only for a second — but it was enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear me?” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, <em> my love,” </em> Rio said, immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, <em> ma’am,” </em> Eva echoed, her voice quieter than usual.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned on her heel with a theatrical huff, her robe swishing like a queen’s cloak. “<em> Good </em> . Now let’s eat. Lilia made dinner. The kids are upstairs waiting. And <em> I’m starving </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>She disappeared around the corner, leaving both entities rooted in place, stunned.</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s jaw dropped slightly. Her mouth moved before her brain caught up. “I understand now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “Understand what?”</p><p> </p><p>Eva turned slowly to face her, her expression a strange mix of awe and exasperation.</p><p> </p><p>“What you see in <em> that woman </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled softly, a little crooked and full of heat. “I love her.”</p><p> </p><p>Eva’s mouth twisted into a smirk. “You’re so fucked.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back on the sofa, eyes on the doorway Agatha had vanished through. “<em> I know. Isn’t it perfect? </em>”</p>

<span>The dining room was too warm. Not from the fire burning steadily in the hearth or the candles flickering softly across the table, but from the pressure — the kind of dense, invisible weight that settled when multiple cosmic beings tried to act civilized over something as deceptively innocent as a pasta dinner. The air felt too thick, the kind that wrapped around your shoulders like an overly affectionate relative, refusing to let you breathe without reminding you of everything you were trying to forget.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat at the head of the table, her posture immaculate, as if perfect posture could somehow anchor her to the present. Her fingers trembled slightly against her glass of water, catching the light like it might be the only thing holding her together. She hadn’t really touched the food — not beyond a few vague stabs at rigatoni that ended with pasta being pushed in lazy arcs across her plate. Her eyes wandered often, closing between words and blinking as if trying to force reality to stay in one place. Her jaw clenched, then loosened, then clenched again. A rhythm of resistance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because every time she blinked too long, something came.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>A scream — guttural and inhuman. The explosion of violet fire bursting from her own hands. A witch on her knees, chanting an ancient dialect until her mouth dissolved to ash.<br/><br/></span>
</em>
<span>Agatha blinked herself back to the present and lifted the glass. The water was blessedly cold against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her right sat Rio — half-leaning, half-hovering, like her soul couldn’t decide if it wanted to watch or interfere. She hadn’t touched her plate. The chair wasn’t even pulled properly to the table; she’d sat down without care for formality, elbows planted, chin resting in one hand, gaze locked on Agatha like she might miss the moment the woman unraveled. Her expression was unreadable to most, but to Agatha, it was a mosaic of fear, love, and relentless devotion. Her other hand rested between them, palm up, an open invitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hadn’t reached for it yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the other end of the table sat Eva, looking like the smug poster child of a divine fashion house. Dressed in white silk with golden embroidery that caught every flicker of candlelight, she twirled her fork through fettuccine with celestial grace and moaned — </span>
<em>
<span>loudly </span>
</em>
<span>— after taking a bite.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My gods,” Eva sighed with scandalous satisfaction, “Lilia, did you enchant this? No human should be able to cook like this. What is this sauce?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From the archway of the kitchen, Lilia rolled her eyes so hard it might’ve counted as a minor seismic event. She wiped her hands on a floral towel and replied without looking, “Tomato. Basilico. And the tears of my patience. Eat. </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t talk</span>
</em>
<span>. You talk too much. Like your sister. All tongue, no filter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth twitched dangerously close to a smirk, the kind she only allowed when Lilia was around — because even the personification of Death knew better than to test the woman who made the lasagna. </span>
<span>Lilia passed behind Agatha and, with terrifying precision, used a pair of tongs to drop an aggressive heap of green beans onto her plate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and didn't look up. “I don’t want beans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’re not for wanting,” Lilia snapped. “They’re for not dying.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and dropped her forehead onto the table. "I hate all of you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You love us," Rio corrected, sliding her hand up Agatha's spine gently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia, completely unfazed, walked around the table and smacked a napkin into Agatha's hand. "No face on the wood. I polished it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her head just enough to glare at her. "You didn't even </span>
<em>
<span>ask </span>
</em>
<span>how I'm feeling."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia shrugged. "You didn’t eat your beans. I assumed you were dying."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, mouth full of garlic bread, giggled. “Lilia’s scary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole didn’t laugh. She was staring at Eva, head tilted, lips pursed like she was trying to calculate something with her eyes. “</span>
<em>
<span>She</span>
</em>
<span>’s scary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva grinned, undeterred. “That’s not very polite, Nicky. I’m your aunt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My </span>
<em>
<span>what </span>
</em>
<span>now?” Nicole asked, incredulous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aunt. Sort of. Cosmic aunt. We kinda share the same cosmic DNA or whatever… I helped you moms create you. ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole blinked. She looked at Rio. Then Agatha. Then back to Eva. Her frown was surgical.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not how babies are made.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick piped in from his side of the table. “Like with the stork, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and pinched the bridge of her nose. “No birds at dinner. None. Once you start with it'll never end until you reach the penguins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Nicole was still watching Eva with the eyes of someone who didn’t yet have the language for what she felt — but felt it all the same. A low, steady awareness. Gravity, pulled toward something she didn’t yet understand.</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick, on the other hand, had already decided this was the best dinner of his entire life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t even know pasta could look like this,” he said through a mouthful, gesturing toward the layered lasagna slice on his plate with awe. “This is like... anime food. You know? Like, Studio Ghibli level.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia, apron dusted with flour and expression of long-suffering patience, walked past and dropped a few extra green beans onto Nicole’s plate. “Eat. All of it. You need iron. And don’t talk with your mouth full, Nico.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick swallowed dramatically. “Yes, Grandma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not your grandma,” Lilia muttered, but she didn't mean to correct him. “I’m too young and too beautiful.” But her voice softened on the last word, her hand brushing his curls before she turned her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, voice low and meant for Agatha’s ears alone. “You’re not breathing again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha startled as if dragged from underwater. She blinked fast and gave a shaky, embarrassed smile. “Sorry, baby. I just—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p><em><span>White tile painted in blood. Screams echoing off stone. Her name screamed in desperation as a spell cracked reality. Violet light bleeding through the walls.</span></em> <em><span>Rio. Her hands glowing. Her mouth whispering something ancient. A kiss to her wrist. The beginning of everything.</span></em></p><p> </p><p>
<span>“— I’m fine,” Agatha finished lamely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raised a brow, unimpressed. “You’re full of shit. And your hand is shaking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s just what happens when your sister dresses like the pope’s concubine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>heard </span>
</em>
<span>that,” Eva chimed, mouth full of pasta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You were </span>
<em>
<span>meant </span>
</em>
<span>to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia circled again, refilling glasses with the kind of energy that could end wars or start them. She poured more wine into Agatha’s and patted her cheek. “</span>
<em>
<span>Eat</span>
</em>
<span>. Or I feed you with a funnel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick nearly inhaled a breadstick laughing. “Do it, Granny!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva leaned toward Nicole again and stage-whispered, “Your family is so violent. I’m obsessed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t laugh. Her eyes closed again. Just for a second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Power exploding from her chest. Witches falling to their knees. Smoke. Screaming. A battlefield turned to glass.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath caught in her throat. She gripped the edge of the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood in one smooth motion, her chair screeching backward. “Enough. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s not okay</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha’s hand reached out, wrapping around Rio’s wrist. Her touch was firm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sit,” she said, quietly but firmly. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t sit right away. She hovered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva licked a smear of sauce off her thumb and said in a lazy drawl, “You’re all so dramatic. This is why I don’t do family dinners.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her eyes again. They were wet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eva,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “What happens if I stop remembering?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva tilted her head like a curious owl. “Do you want honesty?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha whispered. “But I need it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then you stop being </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. The her you were. The her you are. You become someone else. Maybe that’s not the worst thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s throat worked like she was swallowing broken glass. No words came.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then a small, warm hand covered her forearm. Nicole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re still my mom, right?” she asked, her voice very small.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her daughter — and she smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, baby,” she whispered. “I’m still your mom. </span>
<em>
<span>Always</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But somewhere deep inside her chest, something was splintering apart like ice under too much weight. And Rio felt it like thunder cracking through bone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let the moment settle — let the laughter hang like faint perfume in the air — before she moved again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a soft sigh, she looked toward the children, her voice dropping into that gentle but firm register that every parent developed over time. "Alright, you two," she said, tapping the table with two fingers. "</span>
<em>
<span>Time for bed</span>
</em>
<span>. Grown-ups need to have a very boring, very adult conversation."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole narrowed her eyes in suspicion immediately. "Why do adults always say it’s boring when it’s obviously top-secret and stressful?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, ever the agreeable chaos child, jumped out of his seat. "Top-secret? Cool! Night!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole didn’t budge. Her gaze flicked from Agatha’s pale face to Rio’s rigid shoulders, then to Eva — who was now delicately licking tomato sauce off her thumb with the smug calm of someone who knew too much and gave too few damns.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"</span>

<span>Nicole</span>
</em>
<span>," Rio said again, and this time her tone was edged with something protective. Not harsh. Not commanding. Just... final.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole groaned, dramatically rolling her eyes. "Fine. But I want a full debrief in the morning. None of that 'you’re too young' nonsense. I’m basically a godling, you know."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. "What did you just say?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole shrugged as she stood up. "I don’t know. It felt right."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick darted over to Agatha, pressing a loud, messy kiss to her cheek. "Night, Mom! You smell like soap and burnt toast."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Thanks, sweetheart. I think," Agatha murmured, trying — and failing — to smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia rose from her seat and placed her napkin down with care. She walked over to Agatha first, cupping her face between warm hands. Her touch was motherly, grounding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You don’t need to explain anything to me, cara mia," she said gently, her accent thicker with emotion. "Just get better. And don’t be stubborn."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. Her throat tightened again. But she managed a nod.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Lilia turned to Rio, and the sharp Italian matron returned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You take care of her, or I swear I’ll drag you back from the underworld by your ear. Capisce?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bowed her head slightly, one hand to her chest. "I swear it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Satisfied — though muttering something that sounded suspiciously like a curse against all divine beings — Lilia snapped her fingers. "Kids. Upstairs. Now. I’ll tell you the story about the haunted pasta pot."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick gasped. Nicole squinted. "That better not be a metaphor."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And with that, Lilia ushered them out, the warm murmur of their voices trailing away like a fading song.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed the door behind them. The silence that followed was heavier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders dropped. Her fingers trembled slightly again, and she looked down at the table like it had betrayed her somehow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eva, still twirling pasta, said nothing. Just waited.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then, finally, Rio moved. She slid her hand over Agatha’s again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Alright," she said softly. "Let’s talk about what’s breaking you before it breaks everything else."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The silence that followed the children’s exit was louder than anything that had come before it. Their laughter and the scuffle of feet up the stairs faded into muffled echoes, swallowed by the thick, expectant stillness in the room. The kind of silence that weighed heavy behind the ribs. The kind that demanded truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat with her back straighter than before, the skin around her eyes tight, her jaw locked with decision. Rio never left her side. One arm behind her chair, one hand on the table, fingers brushing the back of Agatha’s. The contact was grounding. She didn’t speak — only watched, waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want it gone,” Agatha finally said, voice low but steady. “The other life. </span>
<em>
<span>All of it.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught. “Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. Listen.” She turned to Eva now, locking eyes with her. “Erase </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>life, Eva. Every flicker of it. I don’t need to know how I died or who I was or what I did. I don’t want to carry that weight anymore. I’ve got enough in this life already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva leaned forward slowly, the smirk she usually wore replaced with something calmer, quieter. “You’re sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure of this,” Agatha whispered. She took Rio’s hand fully now, laced their fingers together. “Everything I need is here. In this life. </span>
<em>
<span>In her</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A silence passed like wind through a graveyard — cold, stirring, but not unwelcome.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva’s eyes narrowed a bit. “There are consequences.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha said, though the tremor in her hand betrayed the weight of what she was accepting. “I’ll feel hollow. I’ll dream things that don’t make sense.I might be afraid all the time. That my brain might reach for something I won’t understand and scream at me in my sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened around hers, but Agatha kept going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said if I ever tried to find it again, it could kill me. Or worse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva nodded. “Yes. If your soul tries to reawaken those memories — if something triggers them — you could collapse mentally. Or </span>
<em>
<span>mutate</span>
</em>
<span>. Your essence could shift into something else. Something not... human.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Define ‘</span>
<em>
<span>not human</span>
</em>
<span>.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva leaned back, folding her arms. “Hitler.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a dry, startled laugh. “Seriously? She’s not that asshole, Eva. You’re overreacting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just an example,” Eva said with a shrug. “We tried to help him, Rio. Rebirth, redirection, redemption... but he kept going back to the wrong memories. Refused to change course. And he became what we call a Nexus — untouchable, unmoldable. Chaos with a heartbeat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, wow.” Agatha blinked. “That’s... wildly unhelpful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Worked with Madonna too. Same process. Not </span>
<em>
<span>as</span>
</em>
<span> destructive, but just as persistent. I think Lilia still hasn’t forgiven her from some past lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She hasn’t,” Rio muttered under her breath. “She still doesn't listen to her music.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva leaned forward. “You’re not either of them, Agatha. But I have to say it. Just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled. Her voice cracked slightly. “You’ve seen my kids. You’ve seen what they mean to me. Don’t take them away from me too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t,” Eva said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t touch this life,” Agatha continued. “Not my kids. Not my job. Not what I feel when I look at Rio. If you wipe that too, I’ll know. I </span>
<em>
<span>will</span>
</em>
<span> know. There will be a hole too loud to ignore. And I’ll chase you to the gates of hell because of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, her other hand cradling Agatha’s jaw now, thumb stroking beneath her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” she murmured, voice shaking with the intensity she’d buried for so long. “Even if it’s gone, </span>
<em>
<span>I’ll stay</span>
</em>
<span>. I’ll remind you. I’ll love you again from the beginning if I have to. I’ll burn the world to keep you close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into the touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva cleared her throat. “There’s one more thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course there is,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I erase the connection from that life, the thing that originally brought Rio to you — your soul’s echo of recognition — it might shift how you see her. You might not understand </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> you love her, or what she is. You might </span>
<em>
<span>fear</span>
</em>
<span> her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “But I already know what she is. She’s Death. She’s here. I know why.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Eva said, shaking her head slowly. “You </span>
<em>
<span>think</span>
</em>
<span> you know. But you only understand it now because your past self paved the road. Every time she touched you, every intimate moment, every time you dreamed of her — those unlocked what you remembered. What you </span>
<em>
<span>were</span>
</em>
<span>. I can keep the moments. But I’ll have to change the context. She’ll be someone you met by chance. Not someone whose existence vibrated through time to find you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused. Her throat moved with the effort of swallowing. “And then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then Rio will have to tell you again. </span>
<em>
<span>Gently. Carefully. Slowly</span>
</em>
<span>. Not like the freight train she was last time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Subtlety is not her strong suit,” Agatha said, half-smiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned softly. “I </span>
<em>
<span>tried</span>
</em>
<span>. But you kissed me before I could lie properly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. Just a little. Then it faded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I don’t believe her this time?” she asked. “What if I don’t love her the same way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will,” Rio whispered. “Maybe differently. Maybe slower. But it’s you and me. Always has been.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes glistened again. “Okay,” she whispered. “Do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned back to Eva.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But promise me — don’t touch the kids. Don’t touch Rio. And don’t take the part of me that </span>
<em>
<span>knows</span>
</em>
<span> how to fight for what I love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva studied her for a long moment, then nodded once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll forget how she entered your life. Not why she stayed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The room had gone quiet again, not from fear this time — but reverence. The silence was thick and full of meaning, like the moments before a storm or a ceremony. Eva took her time crossing the space between them, the emerald velvet of her robes whispering against the old wooden floor. She sank gracefully into the chair across from Agatha, the velvet groaning in protest, as if even furniture could sense the weight of what was about to happen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio remained behind Agatha’s chair, unmoving, her presence a steady anchor in a sea of unknowns. She didn’t speak, but her hands did — fingertips brushing soft, grounding circles into Agatha’s shoulders. The touch was deliberate, slow, sacred. Her thumbs lingered over the bones of Agatha’s clavicle as if to memorize their warmth, as if already mourning what was about to change. Eva leaned forward then, hands folding gently, almost maternally, on either side of Agatha’s head. Her fingers were warm. Brighter than skin should be. The glow of something ancient pulsed beneath her nails, and her white eyes softened to something close to grief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re sure, Agatha?” she asked, her voice quiet but threaded with steel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, just for a second. Then she nodded once. “Yes. In at least one life… I think I deserve to be </span>
<em>
<span>happy</span>
</em>
<span>. Just don’t…” Her voice cracked — barely audible — but the fear beneath it was a scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva’s smile, though faint, was genuine. “Take what makes your heart beat. Got it.” She tilted her head with mock dramatics. “You humans are such romantics. It’s charming. And very inconvenient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “You’re not inspiring confidence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, please.” Eva rolled her eyes. “I’m an entity, not your barista. Confidence is implied. Now close your eyes, honey. Picture Nicholas. Nicole. And Rio. Lock them in your mind. Their faces. The sound of their voices. That will help me isolate the right pieces.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. “Wait — can you mess this up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t make mistakes,” Eva replied smugly. Then she shrugged. “But… better to be sure. Unless you want to end up the next Hitler. Or worse, the next Madonna. Do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> make me reroute your soul into a pop star. I won’t survive it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you, Eva,” Agatha groaned. “Start already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned slightly and met Rio’s gaze. Her voice dropped to something more fragile, almost reverent. “Te veo?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, brushing her lips softly against Agatha’s temple. “Te veo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, everything changed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world fell away like paper peeling from old walls. Warmth surged through Agatha’s skull first — golden, humming heat that wasn’t painful but wasn’t comfortable either. It was light made liquid, poured directly into the corridors of her consciousness. She gasped softly but didn’t pull away, because she wasn’t afraid. Not of the magic. Not of the pain. Only of forgetting what mattered. She felt her mind opening — not metaphorically, but tangibly. It was like watching herself unfold, layer by layer, until even the air inside her lungs had a memory.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A forest of thorns. Her feet bare and bloody. A circle of witches chanting in Old Greek. Her voice rose above theirs. Her hand outstretched. One by one, the witches fell. Their bodies convulsed. Their magic ripped from their chests and swallowed by the violet crown pulsing above her head.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her body slowly falling into darkness, and with each new memory that surfaced, she no longer remembered what had happened in the one before. Only the emptiness in her chest remained, pressing against her like a sharpened blade at her throat. She could feel her soul fighting against every memory being stripped away — every loss she had endured in that other life, every pain, every spell cast being reset to zero.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She apologized to that first Agatha — the witch, the mother, the </span>
<em>
<span>wife of Death</span>
</em>
<span>. It wasn’t her fault, the choices she had been forced to make. It wasn’t her or Rio’s fault for what had happened to Nick. She was deeply sorry to have to live this new life without the essence of what that other Agatha had gone through. But it was for the good of both of them, because in the end, they were the same soul — just carrying different wounds.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Stone corridors. The scent of mold and blood. A mother’s voice screaming in fear — her own mother, Evanora. A child — herself — hidden behind a column, teeth clenched, watching her future burn beneath torches of those she would one day command.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The basement. Runes that flickered with Wanda’s breath. Her own laughter, unhinged and shaking as the walls crumbled. She was the predator in that scene. Wanda had been right to fear her.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A mirror, cracked. Her own face splintered into dozens. Each reflected a different life: ruler, murderer, lover, savior, monster.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio’s face. Lips parted in a whisper. Her thumb brushing Agatha’s cheek as Agatha’s skin turned cold. Their last kiss in another life. Violet light blooming between their mouths like a farewell spell. A goodbye not meant to be final.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“So that’s how I died… I gave myself to Death. My Death.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like pages ripped from a book. Like doors slammed shut. Each memory yanked from her, each one leaving behind the ghost of a heartbeat. Agatha cried out softly — but not from pain. From </span>
<em>
<span>absence</span>
</em>
<span>. A thousand memories vanishing into white nothingness, like trying to remember a dream seconds after waking.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Silence.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Eva slowly drew her hands back, the glow fading from her skin. Her fingers trembled slightly as she settled them into her lap. Agatha opened her eyes just for a second — wide, hazy, unfocused — locking onto Eva like she knew her, like something inside her still screamed: </span>
<em>
<span>“You! You did this!”</span>
</em>
<span> For a fleeting second, Eva thought Agatha might be able to resist the memory block — the way her eyes seemed to glow with purple and control. But the thought didn’t finish forming. Agatha’s voice never had the chance to leave her lips as they parted to speak. Agatha’s eyes rolled back, and her body went completely limp — out of exhaustion, weakness, and because that was one of the effects Eva embedded in every living being whose mind needed to be reset. Her body swayed, and before gravity could claim her, Rio was already there. She caught her gently, like she was the only thing that had ever mattered. Agatha’s head rested against Rio’s chest, her breath shallow but present. Rio pressed her lips to her forehead, her tears falling silently into Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s stronger than most,” Eva murmured, her voice low and tight. She blinked rapidly, realizing — too late — that she’d started </span>
<em>
<span>crying</span>
</em>
<span>. “Most people don’t come back looking at me like </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>. Daring me, challenging me. She almost made me stop in the middle of everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, brushing Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “That’s Agatha. She always was impossible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva smiled weakly. “When she wakes, she won’t know me as Life anymore. Just... Eva.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll remind her that she made you cry, you know? She’ll love that.” Rio turned, ready to carry Agatha upstairs — but Eva’s voice stopped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One more thing.” She stepped forward, serious now. “I’d erase the truth from her friends. Everyone who knows what you are. All it takes is one joke, one off-hand comment, and everything could come back. I didn’t erase her past like I normally do — it would’ve broken her beyond repair. You would lose her again. So I sealed it. Locked it in a place her mind can’t access. But the door still exists. Triggers can still reach it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tightened her hold on Agatha, like shielding her physically might help. “I’ll do it. I’ll take care of everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good.” Eva exhaled, watching her sister cradle the woman they both knew had changed everything. “And Rio…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re my favorite. And I am proud to see you happy and… human. But don’t let it go to your head.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, smiling faintly as she turned toward the stairs. “Too late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The curtains stirred with the early morning breeze, casting a soft golden shimmer across the bedspread like sunlight straining through a memory. The room had been still for two days. Not quiet — still. The kind of stillness that makes every tick of the clock feel like it’s holding its breath. The kind of stillness that clings to grief before it’s born.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t left the chair beside the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body was there — arms resting on her knees, chin occasionally cradled in her palm — but her soul hovered somewhere closer to the mattress, closer to Agatha. She hadn’t slept. She hadn’t eaten. She didn’t dare blink too long in case she missed something. Anything. The flick of a finger. The flutter of a lash. A sound that might mean </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha was coming back</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>For forty-eight hours, Rio had lived in quiet desperation. Covering tracks. Scrubbing traces of herself from memories that no longer belonged to her — except for Wanda and Lilia. She couldn’t risk explaining everything again from scratch if something went wrong. They were her anchors, should the worst resurface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The children were left untouched. Rio wouldn’t violate what they knew. Nicole had needed a full hour of sarcasm, stubborn silence, and one accidental tear before she promised not to say too much. Nick — Nick was </span>
<em>
<span>easy</span>
</em>
<span>. His world was cartoons and cereal and the vague understanding that his family was weird in ways he didn’t fully care to question. For now, that was enough. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>To everyone else, Rio had rewritten herself into something soft. An intern. A student. A shadow at Agatha’s side who had slowly, shyly, earned her love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now… A breath. It broke the air like a ripple through still water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat upright, frozen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers twitched. Her eyes blinked once, slowly, then again, as if adjusting to a brightness she hadn’t known in years. When her gaze finally found Rio, something cracked — soft and silent — in Rio’s chest. Recognition bloomed instantly. </span>
<em>
<span>But not fully. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha looked at her with warmth, familiarity, and something else — something like confusion wrapped in certainty. Her gaze was full of Rio, but missing the edges of how and why. Like reading a poem she once memorized, now only half-recalled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried to sit up. Her limbs didn’t obey. Her body felt like it belonged to someone else, and that someone hadn’t used it in years. Rio was already at her side, slipping an arm around her back, gently lifting her, guiding her until she could sit against the headboard. A glass of water pressed into her palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here. Go slow,” Rio said, her voice trembling beneath the softness. “You’ve been out for two days. Your body’s still catching up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took the glass, sipped, then looked at her. Her brows pulled together, and her lips parted with hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something’s different,” she murmured, her voice like gravel and silk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched. Her hands froze where they hovered beside the blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course she noticed.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it me?” Rio asked, trying to sound casual — but the fear bled through. The kind of fear only soulmates knew. The fear of being forgotten by the one who made you whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s expression softened. She smiled, and though her face was pale and tired, her smile held truth. “No, my love... it’s not you. It’s never you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weight in Rio’s chest broke, collapsing inward with relief. Her hand found Agatha’s again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just...” Agatha’s voice faltered. “Teach me some things again, okay? How to love. How to forgive. Some of it feels... wrong. </span>
<em>
<span>Disconnected</span>
</em>
<span>. Like I know it, but the shape changed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will,” Rio promised, leaning forward. “Anything you want to learn, I’ll tell you. This time, I’ll tell you everything slow. </span>
<em>
<span>Gentle</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scanned the room, the traces of light, the familiarity that felt ever so slightly... reconstructed. “Where are the kids?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In the kitchen. Having breakfast. I was going to take them to school. They’ll be thrilled you’re awake.” Rio smiled, brushing Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Nicole’s been spiraling. Nick cried every hour. It was... a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “Why? Why did I sleep so long?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her thumb trailing down Agatha’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Side effect,” she said, almost playfully. “Comes with dating Death, baby. You should’ve stuck to Tinder. Maybe found a nice yoga instructor. Or a florist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How boring” Agatha exhaled a laugh — weak, but real. “And give up the title of the woman who brings Death to her knees every night? </span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>. My ego wouldn’t survive the loss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed with her, but her heart had started pounding again. Something about the way Agatha spoke... </span>
<em>
<span>too clear. Too composed.</span>
</em>
<span> Her tone had changed. And then Agatha tilted her face toward the touch of Rio’s hand. Her lips parted slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s good to be back in </span>
<em>
<span>control of my body and mind</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said, almost too calmly. “I’d been feeling... </span>
<em>
<span>trapped</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand froze mid-stroke. Her eyes narrowed. </span>
<em>
<span>Trapped?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That was a word Agatha shouldn’t have remembered. A sensation that should’ve been gone. Buried with the sealed memories. Compartmentalized and unreachable.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And yet…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her and Agatha met her gaze. Her smile lingered —</span>
<em>
<span> too long, too sure</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<b>
<em>Too Agatha.</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>It tilted. Shifted. That smirk — playful, teasing, dark with something beneath it — spread like ink in water. Slowly. </span>
<em>
<span>Carefully</span>
</em>
<span>. Then her eyes changed. Just a flicker of </span>
<em>
<span>Purple</span>
</em>
<span>. Vivid. Alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped back, a hand pressing instinctively to her chest. Not in fear.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>In awe.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha...?” Her voice was paper-thin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, a mockery of innocence in the angle. Then her voice slipped out in a whisper that was both hers and not just. “Miss me, my love?”</span>
</p><p>

<p>
<span>Rio hadn’t moved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood frozen, like a broken marionette, hands half-raised, chest barely rising with breath, her entire being short-circuiting beneath the weight of what she was seeing. It was Agatha — Agatha's voice, her face, her scent — but the way her mouth curled into a smirk, the way her eyes shimmered like dusk over a battlefield, was something else entirely. It wasn’t just familiarity. It was familiarity dressed in something dangerous. Something ancient. Something Rio had felt only once before —</span>
<em>
<span> on the day she watched that woman die in her arms.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span>—” Rio’s voice cracked, stuttered, then broke entirely. Her lips parted but no words came. She blinked, shook her head as if it might clear the surreal fog curling around her mind. “You… I mean… You—</span>
<em>
<span>how</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stretched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her arms rose above her head with feline laziness, her back arched just slightly beneath the blanket, a sigh slipping from her lips like a woman who had just been handed back her throne. The movement was languid, calculated, every inch of it a silent performance — the kind meant to be watched. Her body remembered the luxury of command. Her fingers twitched in the air, muscle memory recalling spells she no longer had access to, but still loved the feeling of casting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>sweet merciful Death</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha murmured with exaggerated relief, rolling her neck until it popped. “Lying in that bed was murder for my spine. If I have to be human again, I at least expect silk sheets and a foot massage.” She glanced at Rio through thick lashes and gave a wicked smile. “You still give those, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her, mouth slightly agape, visibly trying to reboot her entire understanding of reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You—” she tried again, her voice barely holding form, “You can’t expect me to </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> freak out right now! Agatha, what you just did — what you </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>— it’s not supposed to be possible! You manipulated Eva’s power! </span>
<em>
<span>Life</span>
</em>
<span>! You rewired reality like it’s your private little puppet show! You should be—</span>
<em>
<span>dead</span>
</em>
<span>. Gone. Or worse—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha interrupted her by grabbing Rio’s face between both palms, her hands warm, unbothered, almost amused by the way Death herself looked ready to collapse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” she said gently, mockingly. “Another five seconds and you’re going to burst a blood vessel in that pretty head of yours, my love. And I would </span>
<em>
<span>hate </span>
</em>
<span>to ruin this masterpiece that is your face.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to pull away, but Agatha’s grip held her just firmly enough to keep her in place — not in control, not dominating, but anchoring. She looked into Rio’s eyes, and though her expression was playful, her gaze was sharp enough to carve stone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Listen</span>
</em>
<span>, I know this is... shocking,” Agatha said slowly, like she was explaining math to a child. “I wasn’t exactly </span>
<em>
<span>planning</span>
</em>
<span> on coming back with all my parts intact, you know. The PTA mom and the nightmare witch all in one tidy, sarcastic little package.” She let go of Rio’s face with a sigh, letting her hands drop dramatically into her lap. “But I figured since the universe was already screwing with me, I might as well screw it back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio staggered a step back, visibly thrown, fingers curling into fists at her sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You’re insane</span>
</em>
<span>,” she breathed. “You are completely, impossibly, </span>
<em>
<span>insane</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her chin, brushing her hair over her shoulder in one practiced, theatrical flick. She smiled like a villain at the top of the tower, completely unbothered by the rising storm below.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said sweetly. “But I’m </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> insane.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared and Agatha stared back. Then she </span>
<em>
<span>laughed</span>
</em>
<span>. A soft, throaty laugh that escalated into something warmer and more genuine — until her hand lifted again, fingers swirling like she was conjuring the memory of old spells, even though she </span>
<em>
<span>knew </span>
</em>
<span>they wouldn’t come. But the gesture felt too good to resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, it’s </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> good to be back,” she sighed with an indulgent grin. “Don’t you think? All this—” she gestured around the room with a flourish “—this domestic bliss and celestial drama. It’s like a soap opera where God got drunk in the writers’ room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still didn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, cariño, you’re looking at me like a kicked puppy,” Agatha said, tone dipping into something resembling affection. “Don’t be </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>heartbroken. I’m still me. Just… </span>
<em>
<span>upgraded</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was quieter now, colored with disbelief and the ghost of grief. “How much do you remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes gleamed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Enough</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough to </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha? Enough to destroy the balance of the timeline? To unravel yourself? To die again? To —”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>To love you again</span>
</em>
<span>. And again. And again,” Agatha cut in sharply, her voice suddenly tender. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees, hands folded under her chin as she looked up at Rio. “I didn’t survive </span>
<em>
<span>two </span>
</em>
<span>lives to forget the only thing that ever made either of them worth living.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked hard, her jaw tightening, her breath shaking with the pressure of everything she wanted to say but couldn’t yet name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to see the kids,” Agatha said lightly, straightening with the same grace she always carried. “We’ll discuss the full ‘</span>
<em>
<span>I defied the will of the universe</span>
</em>
<span>’ speech later, okay? I’m starving and I’d like to not die again from low blood sugar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winked. “You’re adorable when you glitch. Like a broken technology…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to </span>
<em>
<span>kill </span>
</em>
<span>you,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You tried</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha grinned. “Didn’t stick, right?.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes. “Gods, I </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, voice a purr. “And yet... you </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio, still disoriented, still reeling, still gripping onto the fraying edges of logic, couldn’t deny it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she did. </span>
<em>
<span>More than anything.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Even now.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of toasted bread and warm honey lingered in the kitchen, golden light slanting across the tiled floor in long, quiet stripes. The world outside was mundane — birds chirping, a car humming by, the faint rattle of the wind against the windows. But inside, everything felt like glass.</span>
<em>
<span> Fragile</span>
</em>
<span>. Holding its breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped into the kitchen as though the very air might break her. She paused at the threshold, her bare feet brushing the cool floor, her eyes locking on the two forms at the table. Nicole sat with one knee pulled to her chest, picking lazily at a bowl of cereal while scrolling something on her tablet. Nick was halfway through his second piece of toast, kicking the leg of the table with small, unfocused movements, humming a tune under his breath.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>They were just... there. Whole. Alive.</span>
</em>
<span> And Agatha — despite the memories of this life that still floated in her mind like dust caught in light — felt as if she hadn’t seen them in a thousand years. In another life, she had lost them. Nicole didn’t even get the chance of living. And Nick… he… In another life, they were memories she carried like wounds. Her heart clenched painfully, the phantom grief of that loss rising like a wave she could barely breathe through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicole looked up first. Her brown eyes — sharp, always watching — locked onto Agatha’s instantly. And for a moment, something in her face tightened. Not fear. Not joy. Just a flicker of... </span>
<em>
<span>awareness</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Something was off</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Something was different</span>
</em>
<span>. She knew her mother — better than most. And that version of her standing in the doorway had a weight behind her gaze that didn’t quite match the woman she kissed goodnight two days ago. But when Nicole saw Rio, just behind Agatha in the hallway, shake her head once — calm, subtle — she understood. </span>
<em>
<span>Not everything needed to be said right away.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>"You’re awake," Nicole said instead, pushing her chair back and walking toward her. “I thought you were going to sleep forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. Her hands were halfway raised, then lowered, then raised again. She didn’t know if she deserved to hold them — her babies, from this life. Her babies from </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> life. But Nicole didn’t wait. She stepped in and wrapped her arms tight around Agatha’s waist, her cheek pressed to her mother’s chest. Agatha exhaled shakily and melted into the embrace, her arms wrapping around her daughter with a trembling grip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mama didn’t tell us everything," Nicole continued against her, "about what happened with you and Aunt Eva. But I figured... something </span>
<em>
<span>big</span>
</em>
<span>. I just didn’t know it would make you disappear like that."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips to the top of Nicole’s head and closed her eyes. Her throat felt too tight to speak. "She did the right thing," she whispered eventually. "I’ll tell you both everything. When the time is right. I promise, sweetheart."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick had come up behind them now, uncertain, clutching a half-eaten toast in one hand. He looked up at his mother, his expression pinched with worry that didn’t quite fit on his little face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay, Mom?” he asked in a small voice, watching her as if she might disappear again at any second. “You look sad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned and dropped to her knees in front of him, gathering him into her arms without hesitation this time. She held him tight, her fingers buried in his hair, her lips pressed to his temple. Then again. And again. Like she had to keep confirming he was real. That </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” she whispered hoarsely. “</span>
<em>
<span>So much</span>
</em>
<span>, my darling. Both of you. I missed you both more than I can say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick blinked, confused. “But… we’re right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just enough to look at him, cupping his cheeks. Her smile trembled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are now,” she murmured. “Exactly where you’ve always belonged.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The silence that followed was full — not uncomfortable, but thick with things unspoken. Rio stood just a few steps away, watching the scene with eyes that shimmered too brightly for comfort. She knew Agatha was holding onto more than just the children — she was holding onto every thread of pain and love from both lives. And she was doing it </span>
<em>
<span>well</span>
</em>
<span>. Too well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the cracks would come. Rio cleared her throat gently, breaking the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” she said softly. “Would you mind grabbing the e-bike and taking your brother to school today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicole turned with a groan. “</span>
<em>
<span>Seriously</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to stay with your mom this morning,” she explained, her voice carefully even. “She </span>
<em>
<span>needs </span>
</em>
<span>me here. I promise we’ll sit down later and talk. Everything you’re wondering about — we’ll talk. But not right now. Right now, she just needs to be... here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick nodded solemnly. “Okay. I can take him. Let’s go, little demon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood again and turned to the kitchen counter, where two carefully packed lunchboxes waited. She picked them up, paused, and then bent to kiss the tops of both their heads.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, my loves,” she said. “I’ll be right here when you get back. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicole looked at her a second longer, then took her brother’s hand and headed for the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed a hand gently on Agatha’s back, guiding her toward the table. “You okay?” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer at first. Her eyes stayed on the door where her children had just left, her fingers still gripping the edge of the table as if steadying herself. Then, slowly, she exhaled and looked over her shoulder at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be,” she said. “Eventually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the way her voice dipped — low and distant — told Rio that part of Agatha still wasn’t in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not yet.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen had quieted again. The laughter of the children outside was replaced with a low, ticking silence that pulsed between them like an invisible heartbeat. Agatha leaned against the counter, her arms crossed tight beneath her chest, fingers digging into the sleeves of her robe as if clinging to something solid. Rio stood a few feet away, watching her like one might watch the sea right before a storm — trying to predict where the next wave might hit.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha wasn’t speaking.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She kept her eyes low, staring at nothing, as though afraid that if she looked at Rio too long she might say too much. Her silence wasn’t passive — it was electric, a fuse waiting to burn out. Rio’s patience cracked. Her hands slapped the table with a dull thud and she took a step forward, her voice rising — not in fury, but in sheer exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your other self was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much easier to deal with,” she snapped, gesturing with both hands. “Gods, Agatha, we are </span>
<em>
<span>past</span>
</em>
<span> this. Come on. You’ve got </span>
<em>
<span>two</span>
</em>
<span> versions of yourself swirling in there — pick one and </span>
<em>
<span>talk</span>
</em>
<span> to me. Damn it, </span>
<em>
<span>it’s me.</span>
</em>
<span> I’m right here. Stop shutting me out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flinched, barely, but enough. Her head turned, lips parted, and for a second Rio thought she was going to say something cruel. Something sharp and sarcastic to deflect like she always did. But instead, her voice came out too thin. Brittle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know!” she burst out, voice shaking. “It’s not that easy, okay? Everything inside of me is still... </span>
<em>
<span>sorting itself out</span>
</em>
<span>. I don’t remember </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span>, I don’t understand all of it. It’s like... I’m flipping through a book where half the pages are missing, and the ones that are left are out of order. I’m trying, Rio. I’m trying to </span>
<em>
<span>breathe</span>
</em>
<span> in this new skin. I’m… scared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tensed, her chest rising with the weight of her breath. “What are you scared of?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at her. </span>
<em>
<span>Once. Twice.</span>
</em>
<span> Then slowly, her lips trembled, and the dam cracked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m scared that what I did is going to cost me everything,” she said, voice so quiet it was almost swallowed by the room. “</span>
<em>
<span>You. Our children. Our lives.</span>
</em>
<span> I rewrote the rules, Rio. I danced with power I didn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>understand</span>
</em>
<span>. What if the price isn’t memory or pain — what if it’s losing you? Losing them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply and let out a sound between a laugh and a growl. “You can sleep like a baby, Agatha. Fuck the balance of the universe. Let it all burn. So long as </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> are alive and breathing, that’s all I care about.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked rapidly, as if trying to keep tears from falling. She failed. Her chin dipped slightly, her shoulders curled inward. A breathy, humorless laugh escaped her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you even love me?” she asked, voice breaking under the weight of self-loathing she’d buried so deeply in both lifetimes. “I’m manipulative, I’m bossy, I fake confidence better than I actually have it... and apparently I’m willing to override the will of fucking </span>
<em>
<span>Life</span>
</em>
<span> just because I refuse to go to therapy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's lips curled upward despite herself. She stepped closer, her gaze softening, arms now crossed in mock judgment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” she said with a faint grin. “That’s my girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffled, swiping under her eyes like it offended her to cry in front of anyone—even Rio. Then, true to form, she straightened her spine, tossed her hair over her shoulder with theatrical grace, and raised a single eyebrow as if delivering a monologue on stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well. Glad to know I still do it for you. Even when I’m slightly unstable and reborn through cosmic cheating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft, real laugh this time, then stepped in and wrapped her arms around Agatha, slow and firm, pulling her close until their bodies aligned like puzzle pieces. She felt the moment Agatha gave in — the way her muscles relaxed, the way her forehead pressed into Rio’s shoulder, the way her breath finally settled into rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You always do it for me,” Rio whispered against her hair. “Even when I want to strangle you. Especially then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and let herself be held. Her entire body sagged into the embrace, as though for the first time in days she could finally stop fighting gravity. The weight of two lives, of two women, collapsed against the one person she had always returned to. And as Rio held her in that quiet kitchen, the scent of toast and jam fading around them, Agatha clung to her like she was the only anchor left in a world that wouldn’t stop shifting.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio backed away slightly from where she’d been leaning against the table, her arms folded, expression sharp. Her voice was low, but there was that deadly kind of calm — the kind that came before a storm with bones in its mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right,” she said, already turning toward the kettle on the stove. “Here’s what we’re going to do. I’ll make that strawberry tea you like so much, and while I do, you’re going to tell me exactly when you started </span>
<em>
<span>rooting</span>
</em>
<span> yourself into this timeline. Into this life.” She shot Agatha a look over her shoulder. “And don’t even think about lying to me, Agatha. I may have been blind before, but I know now  —manipulation like this takes </span>
<em>
<span>years</span>
</em>
<span> of adaptation. You didn’t just seize the opportunity when Eva was stitching your soul back together. You were already </span>
<em>
<span>in</span>
</em>
<span>. Now tell me how the fuck did you do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, Agatha rolled her eyes so hard it might’ve qualified as a ritual in itself. She gave a theatrical shrug and flounced into the nearest kitchen chair like she was settling into a throne.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine. If </span>
<em>
<span>that’s</span>
</em>
<span> what you want. But it’s going to kill the romance. I mean, really — wouldn’t it have been nicer to believe our souls were simply two halves desperate to reunite across galaxies, woven by fate into a perfect, cosmic love story? I had a title in mind, by the way. </span>
<em>
<span>Starbound Hearts</span>
</em>
<span>. Very marketable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agathaaaa,” Rio snapped, turning just enough to give her a warning glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay.” Agatha waved a hand and then brought it to her heart in mock solemnity. “Here we go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio busied herself with the tea, boiling water, steeping the herbs. She needed the task to focus, to not lose her mind as Agatha opened her mouth with that familiar cadence — half confession, half performance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was five,” Agatha began, twirling a spoon between her fingers, “when I first started dreaming. Violet light. Power humming under my skin. Witches kneeling. But I thought I was just an imaginative kid. Evanora always said that. ‘</span>
<em>
<span>You’re not a witch, Agatha, you’re just a dramatic little girl.’</span>
</em>
<span>” She snorted softly, almost fondly. “But I always felt it — like something was missing. A part of me was stuck somewhere. I used to think... maybe I was just lonely. Maybe it was depression, trauma, whatever the fuck a human feels. But then you came into my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, tapping the spoon against the edge of her cup. Her expression didn’t change, but her voice lowered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every night, I dreamed... </span>
<em>
<span>watched</span>
</em>
<span>, really. I saw myself, the </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> me — the poor powerless human — being touched by him, that repulsive pig. Him trying to plant his legacy in me like I was just another investment. </span>
<em>
<span>Actually</span>
</em>
<span>, Ralph was not really the whole problem, y’know? When you learn how it feels to be loved, to be touched by someone that matters your whole life and then… </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>? It felt like </span>
<em>
<span>torture</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>I wanted you back</span>
</em>
<span>. I couldn’t move. </span>
<em>
<span>Couldn’t scream</span>
</em>
<span>. I saw </span>
<em>
<span>everything </span>
</em>
<span>through the eyes of that small, confused human version of me. It was... cruel.” Her throat tightened. “</span>
<em>
<span>I begged you</span>
</em>
<span>. Every night. I didn’t even know </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span>, but I </span>
<em>
<span>begged</span>
</em>
<span> you to come </span>
<em>
<span>home</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand froze mid-motion, fingers clenched around the teapot. Something in her chest cracked at the realization. So </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>was the voice. That was the whisper she had heard echoing across realms, a desperate pull that spanned timelines — it hadn’t been fate alone. It had been </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha all along</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Calling her</span>
</em>
<span>. Subconsciously, silently, breaking through galaxies with nothing but pain and will.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved again, but softer this time when she sees the realisation reaches Rio’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat slowly. Carefully. Her hands trembled once before curling around her own mug of tea. “That’s why I heard you,” she murmured. “I thought it was your </span>
<em>
<span>soul </span>
</em>
<span>calling me. But it wasn't just it… it was you. </span>
<em>
<span>Actually</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, sipping her tea. “When Nicole was born, it got easier, y’ know? I could feel you more. Not </span>
<em>
<span>see </span>
</em>
<span>you — not yet — but I knew you were close. The way Nicole slept? I knew Death was near. </span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> were near. She was always calm. So I started asking for more.” She looked at Rio over the rim of the cup. “I wanted Nick back. I cried for him. </span>
<em>
<span>Begged</span>
</em>
<span>. I told myself it was selfish  —stealing from myself. But I wanted our family again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio covered her mouth with her fingers, eyes glassy.</span>
</p><p><span>“And then,” Agatha continued, tapping the side of her cup with a single fingernail, “I started searching. In my dreams, in my sleep. While the other Agatha — that poor woman — slept, I explored. Dug through scraps of ancient rituals. Built a summoning. </span><em><span>Built my way bay to you.</span></em><span> That night with my friends? The stupid little ritual we did for fun?” She leaned in, voice dropping. “</span><em><span>I made it real</span></em><span>. The Latin that left my mouth wasn’t from this life or a fuckin’ stupid mortal history book. It was from </span><em><span>me.</span></em> <em><span>The witch</span></em><span>. The woman who never forgot how to command things bigger than herself… Like Death.”</span></p><p>
<span>Rio gaped at her, utterly dumbfounded. “You’re kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a theatrical shrug, tossing her hair over one shoulder. “Wouldn’t you like to believe that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You manipulated the powers of my </span>
<em>
<span>sister</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Life</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha. You messed with </span>
<em>
<span>Life</span>
</em>
<span>.” Rio, still standing there with wide eyes and a forgotten cup of tea in her hand, finally let out a stunned breath. “I don’t know if I’m impressed or terrified.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned and tilted her head, fingers toying with the rim of her cup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whichever one gets you hotter at night for me, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked like </span>
<em>
<span>she was glitching</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, absolutely delighted with herself. “Oh, and Ralph? That part was deliciously accidental. Delicious, perfect timing you showing up and messing with his head while I was messing with mine. We are definitely soulmates, my love, aren’t we? Well, but everything else? That was all me. Pushing little memories into myself. Letting the current Agatha believe it was just your influence.”<br/></span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She took another sip, then reached over and gently poured more tea into her cup. Her fingers didn’t shake once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You woke things in me, sure. But most of the work? </span>
<em>
<span>That. was. me</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span> it was me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio set the teacup down. </span>
<em>
<span>Hard</span>
</em>
<span>. Her mouth opened like she wanted to say something, but the only thing that came out was a strangled half-syllable. She didn’t speak, just watched her. Watched the way Agatha sipped the tea without hesitation, savoring it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You manipulated the will of Life herself,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio said flatly, eyes wide with disbelief. “Do you have </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> idea what that means?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” Agatha shrugged one shoulder and took another sip of tea. “It means I’m </span>
<em>
<span>exceptional</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran a hand down her face, exasperated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes twinkled with mischief, but the next part of her story sobered her features.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s more, honey… Things got messy when Ralph and that parasite did whatever they did. It shattered the wall. All my memories poured in at once. I couldn’t stop it. So that’s why I convinced </span>
<em>
<span>myself </span>
</em>
<span>that the idea of erasing everything wasn’t so bad, because, deep down, it wouldn't And then... Eva stepped in. She thought she was sewing it shut. Resetting me. But she didn’t realize </span>
<em>
<span>I was already... awake</span>
</em>
<span>. Not just a person with memories, but </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>, fully formed. </span>
<em>
<span>You can’t reset what’s awake</span>
</em>
<span>. So I watched. Every memory, every scar, every spell — </span>
<em>
<span>as the witch</span>
</em>
<span>. Not the mother, not the teacher. </span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span>. And I didn’t lose them. Because to me, they weren’t memories. They were </span>
<em>
<span>my life</span>
</em>
<span>. That’s the loophole.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just stared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used the coma,” Agatha went on, swirling her tea slowly, letting the aroma rise, “to rest. To align. I talked to her — the other me. We agreed. Merged. One soul. One story. And now? I remember both lives. As if I’d never died. As if I just... kept living.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move at first. She sat frozen, her spine straight, hands limp on the edge of the table as if every tendon had suddenly forgotten how to function. Her face was a picture of scrambled calculation — brows drawn tight, eyes squinting with disbelief, lips parted slightly like she was stuck halfway between shouting and sobbing. One could almost hear the whirring of her mind trying to reboot itself, like a machine fed too many conflicting commands at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s words echoed through the air like the last note of a spell still buzzing through the room. The way she spoke, unbothered and smug, sipping her tea like she hadn’t just casually admitted to breaking fundamental cosmic laws, made it worse. Infinitely worse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Then she blinked.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Twice</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, elbows planted on the table, hands slowly dragging down her face. It wasn’t just shock anymore. It was </span>
<em>
<span>shock</span>
</em>
<span> with a side of existential dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re telling </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>, THE DEATH,” she said, voice hoarse, “that </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>gaslit </span>
<em>
<span>Life</span>
</em>
<span> herself. Watched her do the surgery and then walked away with your soul upgraded like it was a damned iOS patch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even blink. She stirred her tea slowly, her expression somewhere between saint and sinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s one way to put it. I prefer to think of it as... </span>
<em>
<span>creative resilience</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her chair back with a screech and stood up abruptly, pacing behind Agatha like a woman trying to outrun her own nerves. One hand was gripping her jaw, the other pulling at her own ponytail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not serious. You can’t be serious. You </span>
<em>
<span>can’t</span>
</em>
<span> be serious,” she muttered, like saying it three times would make it untrue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head and offered an annoyingly calm smile. “Is this about the coma part or the part where I fused two lives into one coherent timeline without destabilizing the entire mortal plane?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>YES!</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio snapped, gesturing wildly at everything and nothing. “All of it! You — you can’t just </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> that!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey, clearly I can. </span>
<em>
<span>Did.</span>
</em>
<span> Past tense.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and let herself fall forward until her forehead hit the table with a soft, defeated thud. She stayed like that, unmoving, as Agatha leisurely reached across the table and gently patted her head as if calming a frazzled pet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, baby,” Agatha cooed. “It’s a lot to take in. Would you like me to write it down in a little poem? Something with rhymes and footnotes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a muffled, pained noise against the table. Then she turned her head just enough to peer up at Agatha with one eye, like she was about to accuse her of witchcraft — </span>
<em>
<span>which, of course, she was</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re dating a cosmic loophole wrapped in a </span>
<em>
<span>hot body</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha reminded her, voice low and smug as she reached again for her tea. “You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted her head just enough to groan again, more like a growl this time. Her whole face was flushed — part disbelief, part irritation, and just a little bit of reluctant </span>
<em>
<span>admiration</span>
</em>
<span>. She dragged her hands through her hair, then stood up again with too much force, stepping away from the table as if space might help her understand this woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But even as she paced, one truth was undeniable and throbbed like a heartbeat in her skull: </span>
<em>
<span>It was Agatha all along.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio groaned and let her head fall forward onto the table. Agatha smiled sweetly and reached over to pat her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tea’s good, by the way. Really hits the ‘I just broke the rules of reality’ spot.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t stopped moving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was an orbiting storm, pacing so fiercely that even the kitchen walls seemed to lean back from her fury. Her bare feet slapped the floor with controlled chaos, her hands cutting the air in sharp, frustrated gestures as she ranted — not to Agatha, but to the universe, to herself, to whatever gods were brave enough to listen. Spanish, English, celestial murmurs, ancient curses — all swirled out of her in rapid-fire rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Manipulative. Arrogant. Fearsome. </span>
<em>
<span>Bruja completamente insana,</span>
</em>
<span>” she snapped, turning again with the grace of a blade unsheathed. “You </span>
<em>
<span>gaslit</span>
</em>
<span> Life! </span>
<em>
<span>A la propia Vida</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha! You stitched two timelines together with fucking glitter glue and sarcasm and just—just—</span>
<em>
<span>¿qué carajo pasa por tu cabeza, mujer?!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, lounging with unbothered poise in her chair, watched this cosmic meltdown with growing satisfaction. Every furious pass, every dramatic exclamation, only made her smile widen. She stirred her tea with the elegance of a queen and tilted her head slightly every time Rio spun past, like she was enjoying a theatrical performance she’d bought front-row seats for. Eventually, she sighed, long and exaggerated, and set the teacup down with a soft </span>
<em>
<span>clink.</span>
</em>
<span> Then she stood. </span>
<em>
<span>Slowly. Precisely.</span>
</em>
<span> Her robe shifted around her with the movement, tied just loose enough to suggest intention. She walked with a grace that was too purposeful to be casual, straight into Rio’s warpath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t notice until it was too late. She stopped mid-sentence, mid-gesture, when Agatha stepped directly in front of her and — without warning — grasped both lapels of her robe…</span>
</p><p>
<span>…</span>
<em>
<span>and opened it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio short-circuited. Her whole body froze, rigid as stone. The air punched from her lungs in a single, broken gasp. Her eyes went wide, unblinking, completely overwhelmed by the sight in front of her. Her cheeks darkened instantly, heat rising like a flush of divine panic. She looked like a goddess struck dumb. A divine being sucker-punched by flesh and nerve and beauty. Her lips parted but no sound came out. She was officially broken.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. Slow. Wicked.</span>
<em>
<span> Victorious</span>
</em>
<span>. She let it linger — let Rio </span>
<em>
<span>look.</span>
</em>
<span> Let the moment burn its shape into her. Then, with a teasing flick of her wrist, she closed the robe again and stepped closer, pleased beyond words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>There</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said with velvet smoothness, brushing an invisible speck of dust from Rio’s chest. “I always wanted to try that. You never listen when I talk, but now? Look at you. Not a single word.</span>
<em>
<span> Like magic.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked hard. Still mute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grin curled sharper. “You look like a puppy who just got yelled at by God. </span>
<em>
<span>Your face...</span>
</em>
<span> Pathetic. Adorable. Very </span>
<em>
<span>mine.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally found her voice — barely. “Agatha, eso no se hace,” she grumbled, her tone small and petulant, bottom lip pushing out in a dramatic pout.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, delighted. “Oh, mi amor… if I had known it’d take </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> to shut you up, I’d have flashed you years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She took another step, until she was toe-to-toe with her stunned goddess, then slowly reached up to cradle Rio’s face in both hands. Her fingers curled tenderly along the sharp line of Rio’s jaw, thumbs brushing the warm skin of her cheeks. The expression on her face changed — gone was the mischief, the showmanship. What remained was something quieter. </span>
<em>
<span>Heavier. Real. </span>
</em>
<span>She studied Rio like someone seeing her for the first time and the last time, all at once. Her gaze dropped to Rio’s lips, and then slowly, reverently, she leaned in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss wasn’t fast.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It wasn’t rushed or desperate.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It was </span>
<em>
<span>intentional.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her like a vow.</span>
<em>
<span> Like an apology. Like a resurrection.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was a mirror of the last kiss they had shared — when Agatha, dying and mad with borrowed power, had pressed her lips to Death’s and crumbled in her arms. This kiss wasn’t just passion.</span>
<em>
<span> It was memory</span>
</em>
<span>. A call and an answer. A declaration that stretched across time and rebirth. She kissed Rio like she was whispering, </span>
<em>
<span>I’m here. I’m here again. I came back for you. </span>
</em>
<span>And Rio — speechless, wide-eyed, trembling — could only kiss her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands finally moved, sliding up Agatha’s sides, pulling her in tight. She didn’t need to ask for anything. Everything was already there, sealed between them in the space of that single, shattering kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally parted, just barely, Agatha’s breath ghosted over her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, “for the chaos. For the cheating. For the drama. But for you, for us, I would have done it again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t speak. </span>
<em>
<span>Couldn’t</span>
</em>
<span>. She just stared, dazed and undone, until a single, shell-shocked thought echoed through her soul like a song she'd forgotten how much she loved. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The kiss deepened the way fire catches dry wood — inevitable, greedy, slow only for a second before it devours. Agatha let her hands slide up the sides of Rio’s face, fingers threading through the midnight strands at her nape, pulling her closer as her mouth claimed what had been hers across lifetimes. Her body moved like memory — fluid, certain, like every step was already choreographed in the blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn't resist. She couldn’t have if she tried. Her hands fell to Agatha’s waist, then lower, gripping her thighs just as Agatha nudged between them. With a soft gasp and no real resistance, Rio let herself be guided back against the edge of the kitchen counter. Agatha’s hips pressed forward, urging her up, and Rio obliged — lifting herself with practiced grace onto the countertop, legs parting, wrapping around Agatha’s waist with possessive instinct.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, flushed and breathless, grinned against her mouth. Her hands roamed freely, boldly, mapping familiar skin beneath the robe like it was a sacred relic she’d nearly lost. “God, I missed this,” she whispered between kisses, “Missed </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span> Missed this </span>
<em>
<span>body.</span>
</em>
<span> Missed everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clutched at her like she could keep her tethered there, right there, between her thighs, in that moment of suspended time. “You’re really here,” she murmured back, forehead pressing against Agatha’s. “Mi amor. You’re really here, all of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then —</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¡Mierda!</span>
</em>
<span>” The voice snapped through the room like a crack of lightning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Both women froze. Agatha’s lips hovered a breath from Rio’s, eyes wide with disbelief and irritation, while Rio’s head whipped toward the source of the voice.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Benny stood in the doorway, jaw slack, expression twisted between horror and secondhand embarrassment, dressed in full Officer Daniels disguise — right down to the overly neat haircut that made him look like a failed soap opera extra.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blinked once, muttered something in very fast Spanish that even Rio didn’t entirely catch, and looked </span>
<em>
<span>directly</span>
</em>
<span> at Agatha’s very exposed back. Rio’s instinct kicked in instantly. With a sharp tug, she yanked the robe up, covering Agatha’s bare skin. One arm looped tightly around Agatha’s waist in a motion both protective and territorial. Her voice dropped into a low, warning murmur right into Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say a word. Just pretend you remember </span>
<em>
<span>nothing.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, furious at being interrupted mid-reunion, but nodded once, tight-lipped. “Okay,” she whispered back, though her whole body screamed murder. The temptation to vaporize Benny’s cheap wig and false mustache was </span>
<em>
<span>tangible.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Because if this turned into another celestial intervention, another trial for bending the fabric of existence, she'd have more than just her own soul to worry about now. She had two children. She had Rio. Still — she was </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>. And she didn’t do fear. But she did do calculation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Benny cleared his throat and tried to make his eyes look at </span>
<em>
<span>literally anything else.</span>
</em>
<span> “</span>
<em>
<span>Rio, en serio?</span>
</em>
<span> Don’t you two have a bedroom?” His tone was part judgment, part older brother disgust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and let out a groan, still shielding Agatha behind her.“When Eva showed up out of nowhere, we were in our bedroom, you idiot. Que haces aqui?” She looked him up and down, frowning. “And that ridiculous hair?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Es un disfraz,</span>
</em>
<span>” he said defensively, running a hand through the stiff, too-short hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A shitty disguise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here to take Agatha in for questioning.” He adjusted the belt around his fake uniform. “I might be your brother, but I’m still a cop. </span>
<em>
<span>Ralph’s back</span>
</em>
<span>. He was found again — in </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>classroom. And this time, he’s not just raving. He’s </span>
<em>
<span>gone</span>
</em>
<span>. Chief wants a full statement. He wants to know </span>
<em>
<span>what the hell is going on</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression darkened in a way that made the air feel colder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He tried to kill her,” she said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then she can say </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>. In court if that is what it takes. But right now, she’s still legally married to him and cheating on him with you And she’s a primary witness. We can’t just ignore this because it’s messy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice dropped to something that barely resembled human sound. “I can get a death certificate if necessary.” Her hand tightened at Agatha’s hip, eyes glowing faintly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, clearly entertained by the rising tension, and kissed Rio’s cheek slowly, deliberately. “Jealous, my love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned and buried her face in Agatha’s neck like she was praying for strength.</span>
</p><p><span>Benny didn’t even flinch. “I’ll be outside. Get dressed. For the love of all gods, both old and new, </span><em><span>put some pants on.</span></em><span>” He stormed off muttering curses, the door swinging behind him.</span><span><br/></span> <span><br/></span><span>The silence left behind wasn’t awkward.</span><em><span> It was charged</span></em><span>.</span></p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and stepped back, smoothing her robe again. “Well. I was </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> close to letting you take me on the counter, and now we have to go play legal drama.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran her hands down her face. “We’re going to kill him one day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, absolutely,” Agatha said sweetly, already walking toward the stairs. “But for now? We put on pants. We answer some questions. And then... </span>
<em>
<span>you owe me a counter scene, Death.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The walls of the interrogation room felt closer than antes. They weren’t, of course — it was just the way Agatha crossed one leg over the other, arms folded, expression a perfect mask of disdain. The fluorescent light made her skin look colder, like porcelain, but her gaze could cut glass. She looked more like a client suing the department for emotional damage than someone being questioned about a deranged ex-husband.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A uniformed officer peeked inside. “Uh—her lawyer's here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, not even glancing toward the door. “Sorry, sweetheart. I don’t have a lawyer. I know how to defend myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then— Black heels. Crisp lines. A dark blazer that molded perfectly over narrow shoulders. That bun so tight it could hold secrets. And in her hand, a leather briefcase so slim Agatha instantly distrusted it. Rio entered the room like a storm in slow motion. Controlled. Timed. </span>
<em>
<span>Devastating</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked once, lips parting.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Well. She is deliciously overdressed for this kind of scene.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Jesus,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha muttered under her breath. “She even brought a prop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn't look at her. Not yet. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“Mrs. O’Connor, who’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s attention zeroed in on the woman across the table — the detective — who’d just made the mistake of calling her client </span>
<em>
<span>Mrs. O’Connor.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“First,” Rio began with razor-coated silk, “her name is </span>
<em>
<span>Harkness.</span>
</em>
<span> O’Connor means </span>
<em>
<span>nothing </span>
</em>
<span>to her. Now.” She turned slowly, locking eyes with the detective. “Who gave you the right to question my client without my presence?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The detective, a short-haired woman in her thirties with a tired badge and an expression of constant doubt, hesitated. “I didn’t know she had legal representation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither did I,” Agatha added under her breath, smirking — until Rio shot her a look that could freeze oceans. Agatha bit her lip. Not in guilt. In amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My name is Rio Vidal,” she continued coolly. “I’m here on behalf of Ms. Harkness as her legal representative. Now tell me — how much suspicion have you already dumped on my client? Are you honestly entertaining the story of an unmedicated schizophrenic ex-husband rambling about witches, reincarnation, and alternate lives?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The detective opened her mouth, but Rio didn’t give her time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My client,” she continued, tone now laced with sarcasm, “can’t make herbal tea without setting off the smoke alarm. In the Inquisition, she’d have been dismissed as </span>
<em>
<span>too useless to even burn.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was rude,” Agatha muttered behind her hand, pretending to be offended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally turned toward her and took the seat beside her, placing the slim briefcase on the table with a loud </span>
<em>
<span>click.</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha eyed it like it might bite. Rio opened it slowly, revealing exactly what Agatha expected: </span>
<em>
<span>absolutely nothing useful</span>
</em>
<span>. Just two crumpled comic books — Nick’s favorites — and what looked like an empty folder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear to everything,” Agatha whispered, “if there's a Pokémon card in there, I’m walking out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ignored her. She slid the folder open, laid out a few seemingly mundane documents. But beneath the surface, the subtle enchantments she’d placed were already shifting perception. Where the detective saw hospital forms, bank reports, bruising records, restraining orders — none of it was real. Yet under the influence of Rio’s quiet invasion of her mind, it </span>
<em>
<span>felt</span>
</em>
<span> real. Unquestionably real.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She didn’t force it. That wasn’t how mental suggestion worked. </span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>. She simply made it... </span>
<em>
<span>easy.</span>
</em>
<span> Easy to believe that Ralph was unstable. That Agatha had been a victim. That all this talk of magic and other lives was just trauma-induced projection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice softened, soothing and casual, the kind of calm that people wanted to agree with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not here to make trouble, detective. We just want what’s fair. A woman came to work and found her unstable ex-husband raving in her classroom. That’s not mythology. That’s domestic violence. He’s clearly not well. You’ve seen the reports, haven’t you?” She tapped the papers gently. “Wouldn’t a psychiatric facility be more appropriate than a jail cell? For his safety. And hers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The detective was blinking slower now. Her pen stilled over the page. “I... I’ll pass the information forward, Dr. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Good</span>
</em>
<span>.” Rio smiled. Not smug. Not threatening. Just </span>
<em>
<span>satisfied.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched a brow. “Doctor now? You’re just stacking titles today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” Rio murmured out of the side of her mouth. “</span>
<em>
<span>Let me work</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms. “You just brainwashed a cop with a comic book and a suggestion spell, but </span>
<em>
<span>I’m</span>
</em>
<span> the problem?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said sweetly, not missing a beat. “Because </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t almost hex the receptionist on the way in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was rude.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was breathing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled, and for a brief second, Rio saw the tension drain from her shoulders. She reached under the table and gave Agatha’s hand a brief squeeze — firm, grounding, wordless.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The detective gathered the ‘evidence’ together and rose slowly. “I’ll see to it Mr. O’Connor is transferred to St. Jareth’s psych facility by the end of the week. Pending approval.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded once, already knowing the approval had happened the moment she’d stepped through the door. And just like that, the spell was sealed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walked out, Agatha leaned close, brushing her shoulder against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Next time you cosplay my lawyer, maybe tell me first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I tried,” Rio murmured, “but you were too busy trying to seduce me with your robe again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No regrets,” Agatha purred, already plotting their next rule break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And behind them, the mortal world spun — blissfully unaware of how close it had come to collapsing around a comic book, a smirk, and the soft whisper of a very persuasive Death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The glass doors of the station hissed shut behind them, muting the fluorescent hum of bureaucracy and the dull chatter of mortal messes. Outside, the air was sharp and bright, the sun high but somehow gentler than it had any right to be — like the universe itself was holding its breath to see what Agatha would do next. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio walked ahead, silent, hands in her pockets, tension vibrating through her shoulders like a tight wire. She hadn’t spoken since they left the interrogation room. That should’ve worried Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It didn’t</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not when Rio looked like </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>in a blazer. Not when Agatha had just watched her bend reality and law with nothing but a voice, a smirk, and an enchanted copy of </span>
<em>
<span>The Amazing Spider-Man</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed at a comfortable pace, heels clicking like punctuation marks behind Rio’s every step. She caught up just as they reached the black car parked half a block away — definitely not regulation, definitely something Rio had commandeered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the passenger door before Rio could open it, arms crossed, lips tugging into a smug little curve. “You know,” she said, voice low, “if you ever get tired of playing Death, you’d make an </span>
<em>
<span>excellent</span>
</em>
<span> corrupt lawyer. All that power and barely any soul.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unlocked the car with a sharp beep and gave her a look. “Get in the car, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not until you admit it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Admit </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That I looked hot being interrogated. Come on. I was </span>
<em>
<span>glowing</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and opened the driver’s side, sliding in with military precision. “You were glowing because you were this close to combusting the table with rage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slipped into the passenger seat, smoothing her skirt like she hadn’t just traumatized a government official. “Still counts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The doors shut. The moment quieted. For a beat, neither of them spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Rio gripped the wheel, head dropping briefly to rest against the leather. “You’re going to be the death of me,” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned closer. “That’s literally your job, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head slowly, giving Agatha a long, measured look. “You are so lucky I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> lucky,” Agatha said softly, for once without sarcasm. “Lucky that I got you back. Lucky that we all came back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That rare sincerity lingered a second too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then —</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A knock </span>
</em>
<span>on Rio’s window. Rio jumped. Agatha groaned, dragging her hands through her hair like she wanted to rip it out by the roots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got to be </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> kidding me!” she muttered through clenched teeth. “Do your stupid latinos siblings ever let us </span>
<em>
<span>fuck in peace</span>
</em>
<span>?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, standing with her arms crossed and all the divine elegance of someone who could make angels cry just by blinking, was Eva. Immaculate ivory blazer. Perfect heels. Hair pulled into a no-nonsense twist. Expression that said they were both grounded until the end of time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled down the window with an exasperated sigh. “Let me guess. You felt a disturbance in the fuckin’—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slapped a hand gently over her mouth before she could say anything incriminating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva arched her brow. “You had five minutes of peace and immediately started fusing timelines, seducing Death on government property, and enchanting official records with magical manga.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughed into her fist. Agatha looked entirely unbothered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically,” Agatha said, lips curling, “the seduction started </span>
<em>
<span>waaaay</span>
</em>
<span> before the station. But I will say — the acoustics in that interrogation room? </span>
<em>
<span>Immaculate.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva closed her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose like she was personally holding the multiverse together through sheer irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only came to say your part’s done. The rest is on me and Benny now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could </span>
<em>
<span>see</span>
</em>
<span> it. The exact second Agatha was about to brag about manipulating Eva’s magic with a single damn sentence. She grabbed her hand before the words left her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does this mean you and Benny will </span>
<em>
<span>stop </span>
</em>
<span>breaking into our house at inappropriate times?” Rio asked instead, voice sharp but calm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For now, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s finger hovered over the button to roll up the window, but Eva spoke again — this time gently. Her gaze lingered on Agatha, then turned to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s okay?” she asked. “Did it work, hermana?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The way Eva asked made lying impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, just long enough to feel it in her chest. “She’s Agatha,” she said finally. “She’s okay. In her own way.” The window closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started the engine. “It’s incredible you have</span>
<em>
<span> zero sense </span>
</em>
<span>of self-preservation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I?” Agatha said, stretching back in the passenger seat. “I have </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span> Now... about that suit of yours — I’d very much like you to charge me and prosecute me as a wicked witch while wearing it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a laugh. “That was </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> cheesy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “I’ve got four hundred and some years stacked across two lifetimes. Sue me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, fighting a smile as she shifted the car into drive, her heart steadying — finally, finally steadying — because even when the world burned and the sky cracked and reality turned on itself…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha was still Agatha. And she was still hers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The moment the front door clicked shut behind them, the tension snapped like a bowstring. Agatha didn’t even wait for Rio to drop her keys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved fast — faster than she had any right to in heels — grabbing Rio by the collar of that sinfully tight blazer and slamming her back against the wall with a satisfying thud. The house held its breath as Rio let out a surprised gasp, laughter still caught on her lips as Agatha’s mouth crashed into hers. It wasn’t a kiss of gratitude. </span>
<em>
<span>It was possession.</span>
</em>
<span> Hunger. A collision of teeth and longing that had waited through two lives and one too-long interrogation. Agatha kissed her like she meant to brand her name on Death’s lips. Her hands tangled roughly in Rio’s hair, pulling her head back just enough to expose the soft column of her throat. Agatha bit down on the skin there — not hard enough to hurt, but firm enough to remind her who was touching her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned, low and breathy, gripping Agatha’s waist as if it was the only thing keeping her upright. “Someone missed me,” she breathed, eyes fluttering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked against her jaw. “I missed </span>
<em>
<span>owning</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, something in her shifted. A twitch in her fingers. A flicker in her mind.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<em>
<span>Instinct. </span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>Old muscle memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled back slightly, lifting her hand and twisting her wrist in a motion that had once, across battlefields and blood rituals, summoned magic strong enough to collapse cities. Her eyes glowed a deep violet. The air around them seemed to pause — crackle — like it remembered her too. But nothing happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. And then laughed. A slow, sultry chuckle that made Agatha’s nostrils flare in annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Really</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio said, biting her lip, arms crossed under her chest as she leaned back into the wall without fear. “You tried to </span>
<em>
<span>spell-bind</span>
</em>
<span> me? That little hand flick? You really thought you could stick me to the wall like some cursed black widow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snarled — an actual, guttural sound of frustration — and lowered her hand.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio stepped forward, hands slipping around Agatha’s waist as she leaned in, voice a murmur of mock pity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t </span>
<em>
<span>do </span>
</em>
<span>that anymore. Your eyes might shift to that delicious violet, yeah. It’s part of </span>
<em>
<span>who you are</span>
</em>
<span>. A trace of what you </span>
<em>
<span>used to be</span>
</em>
<span>. But conjure? Trap me with spells? No, my love. </span>
<em>
<span>Not here</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She brushed her lips along Agatha’s cheekbone before whispering.</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span> “This world never had magic. You know that better than anyone. You teach it, after all. </span>
<em>
<span>Historically</span>
</em>
<span>, witches didn’t conjure fire — they healed. They helped. And they burned for it. Midwives, nurses... women with too much knowledge and not enough protection.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders trembled, not from defeat, but from the rage she swallowed down. It sat hot in her chest. She </span>
<em>
<span>remembered</span>
</em>
<span> what it felt like. Power blooming beneath her skin like a living thing. </span>
<em>
<span>Now it was gone</span>
</em>
<span>. And it left her teeth aching for something to bite.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled sharply, then grinned — slow, dark, deadly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got to understand something, baby,” she said, pressing her body flush against Rio’s again, one hand sliding down her spine. “I don’t </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> powers to put you in your place.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice dropped low, dangerous. Then she leaned in and bit the lobe of Rio’s ear, slow and intentional.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>On your knees, Death.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched. Agatha pulled back, watching her reaction like a predator watching a heartbeat. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>And just like that — powers or not — she had Rio exactly where she wanted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands moved with the reverence of a ritual. The button at Agatha’s skirt gave under her fingers, and the fabric slid slowly down her legs, pooling silently at her feet. The kiss she pressed to Agatha’s stomach wasn’t playful. It wasn’t teasing.</span>
<em>
<span> It was reverent.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She knelt there, before Agatha, as if grounding herself — hands steady on her hips, breath brushing against bare skin. Her lips found the small scar just below Agatha’s navel. It was faint, refined by careful surgery, but still present. Still a mark of what had been endured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her mouth to it and let her eyes close. Nick had been hard to bring into this world. In every version of their lives.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Too big. Too late. Too silent</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In their past life, the trauma had ended in grief. In this one, there had been machines, wires, brilliant doctors that Rio made sure to bless all their days on earth for helping her wife and her baby. And Rio had been there — not as Death, but as something else. </span>
<em>
<span>Something helpless</span>
</em>
<span>. She had watched through the hospital window, unable to cross the veil between the living and her realm. </span>
<em>
<span>Just watching. So powerful, so wonderful and… nothing. </span>
</em>
<span>She had watched Agatha scream. </span>
<em>
<span>Bleed. Break</span>
</em>
<span>. And she had watched their son slip into this world with a breath so shallow, she’d thought for a moment she was losing him again.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha never saw her there. She never knew.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed the scar again like it was holy. “Thank you… for carrying </span>
<em>
<span>our</span>
</em>
<span> children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed lower, then paused just at the line of Agatha’s underwear, both hands moving to the sides. Her voice dropped, smoky with intent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t mind raising another. Maybe we will go with Nikolai this time. Or </span>
<em>
<span>Nick Minaj</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, half-laughing, half-growling, fingers tightening in Rio’s hair. “Shut your damn mouth and use it for something useful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bossy,” Rio murmured, clearly enjoying it. She let her lips hover over Agatha’s skin just high enough to drive her insane, just low enough to </span>
<em>
<span>promise</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned as she felt Rio's lips lightly brush over her clit. Like a light tease.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words came slower, more weighted. “But I’m not joking about having another. This time I’ll be present. I’ll be the kind of parent I wanted to be before fate and magic tore everything apart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers curled deeper into Rio’s hair. Her breath hitched, her body instinctively leaning into the warmth. The promises. The way Rio spoke as if he was entering her mind little by little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to carry it this time?” Agatha’s voice was hoarse, eyes heavy-lidded. “You know what pregnancy is like, right? Looks cute in photos, but it’s a nine-month long demonic possession where everyone thinks you’re glowing instead of </span>
<em>
<span>dying slowly</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled against her skin. But her voice, when it returned, had shifted again — deeper. </span>
<em>
<span>More vulnerable</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if my heart beats… I’m still dead inside,” she whispered. “I can’t carry life. But I can create it… inside someone else. </span>
<em>
<span>Inside you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha nearly said yes. </span>
<em>
<span>Again.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Because she remembered. She remembered a night — one filled with trembling hands and aching love — where Rio had once whispered, “</span>
<em>
<span>I wish I could show you how much I love you</span>
</em>
<span>.” And she had answered without thinking, “</span>
<em>
<span>Then show me. I trust you.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That trust had become Nick</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back then, even Rio hadn’t known it was possible. For weeks after, when Agatha grew sick, tired, dizzy with morning nausea, Rio had panicked. She thought she’d cursed her. Thought that whatever god governed her powers had turned her love into punishment. But then came the heartbeat. </span>
<em>
<span>Then came Nick.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her now, and everything in her chest tightened. “Rio,” she said with half a laugh, half a sob, “I just fused my whole soul back together and you already want to knock me up again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, God forgive a woman for trying to follow biblical commandments,” Rio said, smirking up at her. “</span>
<em>
<span>‘Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it’</span>
</em>
<span>… yadda yadda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barked a laugh and immediately pulled Rio’s hair, enough to make her hiss. “When exactly did you read the Bible?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio grinned through clenched teeth. “I was there when it got its first edits.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You talk too much,” Agatha whispered, voice suddenly breathy and charged. “Use your mouth for something worthwhile… and maybe, </span>
<em>
<span>just maybe</span>
</em>
<span>, I’ll consider carrying another one of your little imortal gremlins again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin was wicked now. “Fuck, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward again, lips pressing right where Agatha wanted them. Her fingers gripped Rio’s shoulders, pulling her in with unmistakable hunger. And above them, the house was quiet. The world was quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>For once, time obeyed them.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's head fell back against the wall with a dull thud, her breath catching in her throat as Rio's mouth moved lower, more purposeful now, more certain. The tile behind her felt cool, grounding, but nothing compared to the heat building steadily at her center. She closed her eyes, letting go, letting herself feel everything. This wasn’t like before. Not like the other lives. She wasn’t watching this moment through the eyes of someone else. She wasn’t a whisper behind the curtain of another soul. </span>
<em>
<span>She was here. Whole. Herself. Finally</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was there — kneeling before her like an anchor,</span>
<em>
<span> like a prayer</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha's hands tightened in Rio's hair, nails grazing lightly over her scalp as her hips shifted forward, needing more, silently demanding it. Her breath escaped in broken syllables, quiet gasps that trembled at the edge of her lips.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>I'm yours</span>
</em>
<span>," Agatha whispered, barely louder than a breath, but Rio heard it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She responded not with words, but with a low sound — half growl, half reverence — that vibrated against Agatha’s skin, pulling a gasp from her chest. The sensation was enough to make Agatha's knees threaten to buckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"</span>
<em>
<span>I love you</span>
</em>
<span>," she added, voice cracking from somewhere deep. And this time, it wasn’t a declaration. </span>
<em>
<span>It was a confession, a surrender.</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>A sudden flare of pain sparked at her wrist. Sharp, hot — like a brand being pressed against her skin. She flinched but didn’t move. Didn’t pull away. The burn wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>cruel</span>
</em>
<span>. But it was painful. It was… something else. </span>
<em>
<span>Something right.</span>
</em>
<span> Her eyes fluttered open, a single tear escaping before she could stop it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She chose not to stop it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the shift. She slowed her pace just enough to lift her face, her lips slick, her breath heavy, her voice unshaken. “I love you too,” she whispered. “So much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she saw </span>
<em>
<span>it</span>
</em>
<span>. On her own wrist, a thin red line shimmered into existence like a wire of molten metal pulled tight across her skin. It pulsed once — alive — and then wrapped itself around her wrist like thread drawn through flesh.</span>
<em>
<span> A seam. A bond. A stitch. Uneven. Fresh. Real. </span>
</em>
<span>Her breath hitched. The sight was enough to make her tremble.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>For eons, since her creation, Rio had walked as a fragment. Eternal, yes. But never whole. Not until </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>. Something ancient in her chest cracked open. She didn’t know what it meant — not fully. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>But she knew what it was: She looked up at Agatha, and for a second, saw not just her love, her partner, her chaos — but the piece of herself that had always been missing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mine,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she kissed her again. Right </span>
<em>
<span>there</span>
</em>
<span>. Like she needed to reclaim the space. Like the words had carved something open between them. Agatha’s head hit the wall again with a soft gasp, her body moving instinctively toward Rio’s touch. Her hips rolled, guided by memory and hunger and something deeper — something stitched into the very fabric of who they now were.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She moaned low, the sound raw and rich with everything that had been lost and found again. And Rio kept her hands firm on Agatha’s thighs, her body still grounded, her pulse no longer cold, but blazing. That red seam on her wrist pulsed again, glowing faintly — like a promise.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>They weren’t just lovers anymore. </span>
<em>
<span>They were bound. Stitched. Fused.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The golden wash of late morning bled into early afternoon, illuminating the living room in gentle warmth. Agatha was pinned against the wall, breathless, knees weak, hands clutched in Rio’s hair like a woman clinging to life itself. Rio knelt between her legs, right there on the floor, with reverence and hunger in equal measure. Her mouth worked relentlessly, expertly, savoring every tremble that rippled through Agatha’s body like aftershocks of a divine quake. Agatha's head fell back with a dull thud against the wall, eyes rolling shut as her legs parted further, as if her very soul needed more of Rio. Her body shuddered as release overtook her, a sharp gasp tearing from her lips before she stifled it with a bitten moan. Her thighs trembled around Rio’s shoulders, and her core pulsed with the kind of satisfaction only this woman — this impossibly powerful creature — could draw from her. The wetness on Rio’s face glistened in the filtered light as she finally stood, the confidence in her movements unshaken, her gaze predatory. She didn’t wipe her face. </span>
<em>
<span>She didn’t need to</span>
</em>
<span>. That slick shine was a mark of </span>
<em>
<span>pride</span>
</em>
<span>. She pressed Agatha hard against the wall again, letting their mouths collide in a kiss that tasted like power and surrender, sweet and wicked and entirely theirs.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha barely had time to breathe before Rio hoisted her into the air, carrying her effortlessly. Her arms instinctively looped around Rio’s neck, her legs wrapped tight around her waist as their lips stayed fused together, kissing slowly, dragging hunger as Rio ascended the stairs without so much as a grunt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then— </span>
<em>
<span>Thunk. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio stumbled, nearly losing her balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha burst into laughter, her head lolling back as she peeked downward. “I think you deserved that,” she said, voice thick with mirth and satisfaction. “I’ve always told you to make him pick them up one by one. </span>
<em>
<span>Every single time</span>
</em>
<span> we’re in the middle of something, you get attacked by a Lego or…” she glanced at the plastic figure below them, still in Rio’s arms, “a dinosaur.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even look down. “It’s an Ankylosaurus,” she corrected, her tone matter-of-fact, like a paleontologist at a children’s museum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, lips twitching into a sly grin. “</span>
<em>
<span>Whatever, Rio</span>
</em>
<span>. Are you going to fuck me or give me a lesson on your long-dead prehistoric friends?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s very insensitive of you, Agatha,” Rio said, not hiding the offended drawl in her voice as she turned the corner toward the bedroom. “They were quite charming, actually. There was a T-Rex who would’ve made an excellent friend of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head smugly. “She had my personality?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused at the threshold, eyes narrowing. “No. She was </span>
<em>
<span>far too unstable</span>
</em>
<span> for that. But she could’ve put your ego in its place with a single roar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a slow, warning smile. “You done insulting me, or are you going to take your damn clothes off? Just so you know — I’m still debating whether I’ll ever let another one of your little monsters grow inside me again. </span>
<em>
<span>Don’t screw this up</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. She just smirked — sharp and self-satisfied — before tossing Agatha onto the bed like a ragdoll made of silk and sin. Agatha landed with a thud and a gasp, her dark hair fanned across the pillows, eyes blazing with challenge and hunger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it’s time,” Rio said, voice low and decadent, “for you to shut that mouth and evaluate in silence. What do you say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugged out of her crumpled blazer, letting it fall to the floor in a heap. Agatha’s hands, impatient and greedy, flew to the buttons of Rio’s white shirt — the one still damp, clinging in places from the aftermath of Agatha’s earlier climax. Her fingers fumbled, frustrated, cursing every stubborn button until she growled and gave up altogether. With a vicious yank, she tore the shirt open, buttons scattering like sharp whispers across the wooden floor. Her eyes flashed — literally. That purple glow burst to life for just a moment, a flash of forgotten magic flickering behind her irises like a ghost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched a brow. “That was my favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You’re Death</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha countered, voice breathless, taunting. “In your line of work, white button-downs should be the </span>
<em>
<span>last</span>
</em>
<span> thing on your fashion list.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a slow, exaggerated sigh. “Still… it was my favorite.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck off</span>
</em>
<span>. I’ll buy you ten more. Just use your damned hand and take this—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could finish, Rio’s hand lifted, fingers flicking with graceful power. A large, glimmering leaf materialized mid-air, buzzing with magic, and pressed itself over Agatha’s lips. The moment it touched skin, her voice vanished — sealed in a breathless hum of surprise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled down at her, cruelly fond. “</span>
<em>
<span>Ah</span>
</em>
<span>. Much better. You silent is poetry, </span>
<em>
<span>my love one</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s muffled protest was fierce — likely laced with expletives — but her eyes didn’t lie. They were molten, half-lidded, hungry.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio leaned in, her lips brushing down along Agatha’s neck with a slow, deliberate path. Her breath was warm, her tongue cool, the contrast maddening. Agatha arched under her, hands clenching around the now-ruined shirt that still clung to Rio’s torso. Just as Rio bit softly into the curve where neck met shoulder, she caught a muffled phrase against the lea — a dark little threat barely audible, but unmistakable:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m going to kill you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, low and dangerous, her teeth grazing skin again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she whispered. “But you’ll beg me first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she kept going. Rio didn’t give Agatha the chance to catch her breath. She slid down the length of her body, hands bracing firmly on either side of her, caging her in. The bed creaked beneath them as she hovered, her face just inches above Agatha’s, the magical leaf still pressed to those plush, tempting lips. Agatha glared — eyes sharp, violet, threatening — but her body betrayed her. Her back arched. Her legs shifted wider. The tension in her arms trembled from the restraint of not being able to speak, to bite back, to claw her dominance back from Rio’s grasp. But Rio saw it for what it was: a silent surrender dressed in defiance. </span>
<em>
<span>She licked it up like honey.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You look</span>
<em>
<span> beautiful</span>
</em>
<span> when you’re furious,” Rio whispered against her jaw, kissing a path to her ear. “But even more beautiful when you’re wrecked and quiet under me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squirmed, hips shifting restlessly as Rio’s thigh pressed between her legs. The heat of her was palpable. Still sensitive from earlier, yet insatiable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dragged her teeth along the shell of Agatha’s ear and whispered, “Tell me with your body, baby. That’s the only voice I want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand slid up Agatha’s thigh, under the edge of her blouse — now wrinkled, damp at the center. She took her time. Her fingers danced up Agatha’s ribs, teasing every inch before gripping the front and yanking it over her head, exposing the flushed skin beneath. Agatha groaned against the enchanted leaf, eyes fluttering shut when Rio’s mouth followed her hand. She kissed over her sternum, slow and reverent, then bit just above her left breast — hard enough to leave a mark. She watched Agatha writhe beneath her, every breath shallow, her fists tightening in the sheets.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Still too many layers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat back on her knees, straddling Agatha’s hips, and finally peeled the ruined shirt from her own frame. Her skin shimmered slightly in the afternoon light — cool-toned, moon-pale, with a faint shimmer of something ancient that no one else could see. But Agatha felt it. The presence. The weight of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want this, open your legs wider.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. A beat. Then her knees parted without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s my girl,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned down again, fingers trailing over her inner thigh with maddening patience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You still evaluating if I deserve to give you another little monster?” she asked, voice taunting, lips ghosting just over Agatha’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. Her eyes were fire. She was still gagged, but her body was shouting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “Then I’ll make my case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She buried herself between Agatha’s legs again, and this time she didn’t hold back. She devoured her like the gods had made her just for this moment — slow strokes of her tongue, fingers gripping thighs that shook in her grasp, mouth insistent and thorough. Agatha’s body twisted in pleasure, breath coming out in panicked gasps muffled by the enchanted seal. Her hands flew to Rio’s hair again, anchoring herself there, trying to pull her closer, deeper. But Rio kept her pace, not rushing, not letting her reach the peak too fast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” she murmured against her, the vibration drawing a sob from Agatha’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to speak, but the leaf still clung to her mouth like a silencing oath. Her eyes pleaded now, sharpness turned to desperation. Rio didn’t need words to understand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beg with your body, honey,” she whispered, sliding two fingers inside her, curling them just right. “You’re doing so well…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t take long. Agatha shattered again, the second climax ripping through her harder than the first, her back bowing so sharply it was like her body was offering itself up. Rio kissed her through it, drinking her in, hands never leaving her skin. When the tremors slowed, Rio reached up and plucked the enchanted leaf away from her lips, tossing it to the floor without ceremony. Agatha gasped, air finally rushing into her lungs. Her voice came back as a low, growled whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I hate you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, kissed her softly this time. “No, you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine. I want to kill you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s better.” Rio smiled against her lips. “But first, you’ll come again.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha barely had time to catch her breath before Rio moved again — this time with none of the earlier patience. She flipped Agatha onto her stomach with a firm, effortless motion. The mattress dipped under them, sheets twisting beneath her as she gasped, still flushed from the last climax.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not done making my case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, breathless and flushed, gave the smallest laugh. “Then you better make it unforgettable, Death.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I intend to.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Without a word, Rio positioned herself behind her, spreading Agatha’s thighs and pulling her hips up. There was a raw reverence in her touch, but the restraint was gone. This was no longer about teasing. It was about claiming. Two fingers plunged into Agatha without warning — deep, relentless, slick from the wetness already soaking her. Agatha let out a sharp moan, muffled into the sheets as her hands fisted them. Rio’s other hand tangled into her dark hair and yanked her head back, exposing the long line of her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look at you,” Rio whispered, voice low and ravenous, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin. </span>
<em>
<span>“Fucking perfect.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She bit down just beneath Agatha’s jaw, hard enough to leave a bruise, then soothed the mark with her tongue. All the while, her fingers moved faster, deeper, twisting and curling with the precision of someone who knew every inch of Agatha’s body like sacred scripture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t hold back,” Rio growled into her ear, her hand still tight in Agatha’s hair. “Give it to me. All of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned, broken and breathless, her hips rocking back into Rio’s thrusts, her body beginning to quake again. And then — between one sharp gasp and the next — she said it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she whimpered. “Baby… do that thing I always wanted… The one I couldn’t have before — when I still had my siphon powers. Use </span>
<em>
<span>yours</span>
</em>
<span> on me. </span>
<em>
<span>Inside me.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stilled. For just a second, the whole world held its breath. Her fingers paused, buried deep. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Don’t stop</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha gasped. “Do the opposite. </span>
<em>
<span>Do it.</span>
</em>
<span> I want to feel it. I want </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> in me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, breath caught in her throat as realization hit her. Her eyes widened. A gleam of wicked wonder lit them from within — like a child handed a forbidden gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said, voice trembling with anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembered it well — how Agatha had once used her magic inside Rio, how the orgasm it gave her had nearly unraveled her very essence. She had always dreamed of giving that back, of returning that kind of overwhelming bliss — but Agatha had been too powerful, too dangerous. If she lost control and siphoned from Death itself, she could’ve killed herself without even realizing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But now… </span>
<em>
<span>now she was just human.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio's hands trembled slightly as she shifted her position. She pulled Agatha back until she was seated in Rio’s lap, her ass pressed against Rio’s thigh, her back flush against Rio’s chest. One hand held her tightly by the waist, and the other — slick and determined — slid between her legs, fingers gliding deep again, this time from the front. Agatha’s head lolled back onto her shoulder, exposing her throat once more, her chest heaving with shallow, eager breaths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” Rio whispered, her voice raw, reverent, almost afraid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha breathed. “I trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was all she needed. Rio closed her eyes and exhaled slowly, drawing on something older than the earth, something sacred. She reached inward, past sinew and skin, into the endless, fathomless well where</span>
<em>
<span> Death herself rested</span>
</em>
<span> — the power she</span>
<em>
<span> rarely touched, never used</span>
</em>
<span> for anything soft. But this wasn’t destruction. This wasn’t about taking life.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It was about giving.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Not too much, not too fast. She filtered it through emotion — through love, through restraint — letting only a single ripple emerge. A shimmer. A taste. A whisper of her true essence. A golden pulse ignited at her fingertips, glowing faintly like starlight under water. It hummed down her forearm with the rhythm of a heartbeat, wrapping her hand in a warm current of magic that felt nothing like death. </span>
<em>
<span>It was soothing and wild.</span>
</em>
<span> Ancient and tender. </span>
<em>
<span>Alive</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>The energy traveled through her knuckles, then into Agatha’s trembling, slick core. Agatha gasped — loud, unguarded, her entire body jolting in Rio’s lap like she’d been struck by divine lightning. Her back bowed against Rio’s chest, her mouth falling open in a silent scream, her hands reaching blindly for something to ground her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t hurt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t burn.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It bloomed.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>It was like silk spun from electricity, like pleasure woven from starlight and midnight thunder. It threaded through her bones, her muscles, her nerves, until it felt like every cell of her body had been rewired to </span>
<em>
<span>feel </span>
</em>
<span>— not just pleasure, but something deeper. Something transcendent. Her thighs shook violently around Rio’s hand. Her toes curled. Her stomach clenched as another wave of pleasure rushed through her, hotter than fire, deeper than touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha mouthed, her voice nothing but air and need. It came out ragged and broken, like her lungs had forgotten how to breathe. Her nails dug into the meat of Rio’s thigh, searching for something to hold onto as her body spiraled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then —</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It hit. </span>
</em>
<span>The orgasm tore through her like a tidal wave — violent, all-consuming, and utterly devastating. Her entire frame seized, her mouth open in a strangled moan that never fully formed, her body quaking in Rio’s lap. Her release gushed in a sudden, uncontrollable burst, soaking Rio’s hand, spilling onto the sheets below in warm, slick waves. Her legs twitched. Her abdomen spasmed. Her throat made a choked, helpless sound as the pleasure refused to stop, dragging on far beyond anything natural, held in place by Rio’s steady fingers and the hum of divine power still flickering inside her. She collapsed backward with a guttural exhale, her weight slumping into Rio like she’d been struck unconscious. Her chest heaved in aftershocks, skin flushed, lashes fluttering as her eyes rolled half-closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was undone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Boneless.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wrecked.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>But safe — held in the </span>
<em>
<span>arms of Death</span>
</em>
<span>, who was still whispering her name like a prayer against her temple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared down at her, stunned. Her fingers were drenched, hand slick and glistening with Agatha’s release. The sheets beneath them were soaked, the air thick with heat, musk, and the sweet scent of magic mingled with sweat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck. OH, Fuck,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio murmured under her breath, almost reverently. Her own body ached now, her core pulsing, her underwear damp with arousal just from </span>
<em>
<span>watching </span>
</em>
<span>— from </span>
<em>
<span>feeling</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha come apart like that in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart ached with how much she loved this woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” she whispered again, her voice hoarse, lips brushing against the crown of Agatha’s head. “It’s okay, my love. You did so well... </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> well for me. You were incredible. I’m so fucking proud of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer — her lips parted slightly, her breath shallow. All she could manage was a soft, barely audible murmur that didn’t form words. Her hands, once grasping and clawing, now rested limply against Rio’s thighs. Her pulse beat strong but erratic under Rio’s hand, proof that she was there, that she was alive — but completely, </span>
<em>
<span>beautifully ruined</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wrapped both arms around her, pressing her close, grounding her in silence and warmth. Agatha trembled against her, her body still overwhelmed, her skin hot to the touch. But even in her dazed state, she didn’t pull away. She didn’t have to say it. Rio </span>
<em>
<span>felt</span>
</em>
<span> it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she held her tighter, whispering into her skin like a vow: “You’ll never have to be afraid of what you want again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wrapped the blanket around both of them, pulling her close, tucking her in. She stayed there — one hand on Agatha’s belly, the other resting over her heart — feeling the steady thrum of life, and holding her like she never planned to let go.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The living room was too quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The kind of quiet that swallowed sound, the kind that wrapped itself around people like fog — thick, unmoving, suffocating. Sunlight filtered weakly through the windows, casting pale shadows across the soft beige carpet. The fireplace was off. The clock on the wall ticked, intrusive and unforgiving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole and Nick sat side by side on the couch, small forms swallowed in cushions that suddenly felt far too large.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick clutched his Ankylosaurus like it was a shield, his knuckles white from the pressure. He held it against his chest, his shoulders hunched protectively as if bracing for a storm. Nicole sat straighter but was no less tense — her lip pinched between her teeth so harshly it was on the verge of splitting. Her fingers curled into the hem of her sleeve, twisting the fabric in small, nervous movements.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Across from them, Agatha sat on the edge of the armchair, leaning forward, elbows on her knees, hands clasped tightly as if trying to ground herself. Beside her, Rio was motionless, one hand resting on Agatha’s back, the other fidgeting with the seam of her pants. Her jaw was clenched. She’d never felt more exposed — </span>
<em>
<span>more uncertain</span>
</em>
<span> — than she did now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I know it’s a lot to take in," Agatha finally said, her voice soft but unwavering, the weight of truth coating every syllable. “</span>
<em>
<span>It’s a lot</span>
</em>
<span>… even for us. But we promised you we’d always be honest. </span>
<em>
<span>No more secrets</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silence followed. A thick, choking kind of silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole didn’t blink. Nick didn’t even breathe for a second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, who had faced gods and watched stars collapse into themselves, suddenly found herself the most nervous she’d ever been. Her palms were damp. Her chest tight. She didn’t dare move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For her, explaining things to Nicole should’ve been </span>
<em>
<span>easier</span>
</em>
<span> — Nicole already knew, in a way. She’d </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> felt it. That she was something more. That her mothers weren’t like the others. But hearing it. </span>
<em>
<span>In detail</span>
</em>
<span>. No more metaphors or soft bedtime stories. Just truth laid bare on the table like bones under a forensic lamp… </span>
<em>
<span>that was different</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole’s lip trembled, and finally — finally — her voice emerged, so small it almost didn’t make it past her teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” she murmured, eyes fixed on the floor, “does that mean I’m not even real?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught like glass in her throat. She surged forward, hands reaching instinctively before catching herself, afraid to overwhelm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” she said instantly, her voice trembling now, urgent and fierce. “Nicole, </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>, sweetheart. You </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> real. You’re </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> real.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I wasn’t even there,” Nicole whispered, her voice cracking. “</span>
<em>
<span>I wasn’t even born</span>
</em>
<span>. I didn’t exist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You are everything,” Agatha said, crawling from her chair to the floor, kneeling now, heart open and exposed. “You were made from something stronger than magic. You were made from love. That doesn’t make you less real — it makes you more.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole’s eyes shimmered with tears she refused to let fall. Her lip finally split, a thin line of red sliding downward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved with a gentleness that contradicted everything she was. She leaned forward slowly, carefully, and dabbed the blood away with a soft tissue she conjured from her pocket. Her fingers were precise and delicate, brushing Nicole’s chin like she was made of porcelain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve always been real, sweetheart,” Rio said quietly, her voice hoarse but strong. “You are the </span>
<em>
<span>most real thing</span>
</em>
<span> I’ve ever known. You’re the purest thing in this world. The fruit of the love of Death — a being that was never supposed to feel love — and a witch without a coven who everyone believed was unlovable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole blinked rapidly, breath hitching. She took the tissue from Rio’s hand and pressed it to her mouth, her eyes falling closed as she nodded. She didn’t speak again. But she didn’t bite her lip anymore, either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That alone was an answer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Nick hadn’t moved. Agatha turned her attention to him, swallowing hard against the ache forming behind her ribs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nick?” she asked gently, her voice dipped in honey and fear. “Baby?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His grip tightened on the dinosaur. His eyes didn’t lift. His lower lip quivered, and then he shook his head — hard, like he could shake the entire truth away with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He clutched the dinosaur tighter. His small fingers twitched. His lip wobbled, and he shook his head, hard. “I don’t wanna talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Four little words</span>
</em>
<span>. Four devastating little words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest cracked in half. Not because he was angry — she could hold him through a thousand storms of fury. But because of how he said it: soft, small, like he was trying not to break. Her mouth opened, but no sound came out. She could handle anger, yelling, anything. But this — this soft, quiet retreat — this broke her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t stay still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slid off the edge of the couch and knelt on the floor in front of him, tucking her hands on her thighs so she wouldn’t touch him too quickly. Her posture was open, vulnerable. She looked up at him, even though it tore her apart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nick,” she said softly, “you’re allowed to feel whatever you’re feeling. You can be mad. You can cry. You can yell if you want. I just want you to know that nothing — </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> — changes how much</span>
<em>
<span> I love you</span>
</em>
<span>. Nothing. </span>
<em>
<span>Ever</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick finally looked at her, and that look shattered her. His lashes were damp. His eyes were huge, glassy, a sea of emotion barely held back. His chest rose and fell too fast. His jaw trembled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick swallowed. His eyes flicked to her face for the first time, and they were glassy, lashes wet, wide with something Rio didn’t want to name — fear. </span>
<em>
<span>Confusion. Betrayal</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re Death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look away. </span>
<em>
<span>She took it</span>
</em>
<span>. She absorbed every ounce of the weight in his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said after a beat. “I am, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His chin quivered. His voice cracked. “Does that mean you’ll take me one day? Like you did before? Leave Mommy alone again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a broken sob and immediately covered her mouth, as if trying to shove it back in. Tears slipped down her face in silence. Her shoulders shook. Her grief was quiet, but it scorched everything in its path.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because that was the thing she hadn’t even let herself say aloud: </span>
<em>
<span>that Rio had taken him once</span>
</em>
<span>. That Nick wasn’t supposed to live. That Agatha had been left alone. Utterly. For a lifetime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice cracked. She leaned in closer, her hands still on her thighs. “</span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>. No, baby. That is not how it works. I’m sorry... I don’t get to choose </span>
<em>
<span>who</span>
</em>
<span> goes.</span>
<em>
<span> I never have</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached out slowly, deliberately, placing her hand on the dinosaur instead of him, as if asking permission to touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I swear to you,” she said, trembling, “I will </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> let anything happen to you. </span>
<em>
<span>Never</span>
</em>
<span>. I won’t let anything take you. And I’ll never let your mom be alone again. Ever. Not while I </span>
<em>
<span>breathe</span>
</em>
<span>. Not while I </span>
<em>
<span>exist</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick looked down at the toy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, slowly, painfully, he leaned forward. Not much — just a few inches — but enough to rest his forehead against the top of Rio’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath caught. She closed her eyes and let her hands rise, gently, to cradle his back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m scared,” he whispered, voice shaking, as if the words alone might fall apart in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio kissed his hair, lips pressing against the crown of his head like a silent vow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know,” she whispered. “</span>
<em>
<span>Me too</span>
</em>
<span>. But you’re not alone. Not ever.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached forward, wrapping her arms around both of them, holding her world together with the fragile strength only a mother could summon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And for a moment — just one quiet, aching moment — there was nothing but warmth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the beginning of healing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen felt too big for the four of them at first — </span>
<em>
<span>too wide, too quiet</span>
</em>
<span>, like a stage waiting for actors unsure of their lines. It wasn’t the space itself, but the absence of something unspoken — ease, perhaps, or innocence. The kind of warmth that usually danced between them in flour-dusted jokes and stolen spoonfuls of sauce now hung back, uncertain, reluctant to return too soon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Outside, the sun was slipping behind the hills, spilling amber light across the countertops and casting long shadows that stretched like fingers over the tiled floor. It should’ve been comforting. </span>
<em>
<span>Familiar</span>
</em>
<span>. But the hush in the room made everything louder. The creak of a drawer felt like a crack of thunder. The click of silverware against ceramic seemed far too sharp. Even the gentle hum of the refrigerator carried a kind of pressure, as if daring someone to speak first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood at the far end of the counter, posture straight, but her shoulders a little too stiff. Her sleeves were rolled to the elbows, and her hair was tied up in a loose knot, a few stray strands already falling into her eyes. She cut vegetables with the kind of precision one might use disarming a bomb — meticulous, mechanical, and far too quiet. Every slice was identical. </span>
<em>
<span>Too perfect.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole hovered near the sink, rinsing tomatoes with small, precise movements, her face half-turned away as if pretending she wasn’t watching everyone. She stood on the balls of her feet, shifting slightly every few seconds, trying to stay grounded in a moment that still didn’t feel quite real.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, standing on the old wooden stool near the center island, had both arms plunged into a mountain of flour-dusted dough. His fingers worked diligently, clumsily, pressing and folding, pressing and folding — but the dough was stubborn, and so was he. It stuck to him like a second skin. He didn’t complain, but every now and then, he let out a sharp sigh, like he wanted to, and just didn’t know how.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio drifted between them like a shadow, her movements measured, almost reverent. She lit the stove, pulled out a pan, grabbed a bottle of olive oil, all in silence. She didn’t want to be the one to break whatever fragile thing had formed between them. She could feel it stretching — this wordless tension — like a glass thread, delicate and invisible, pulling tight between each of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t anger that hung in the air. Not quite sadness, either. It was the </span>
<em>
<span>weight of knowing too much.</span>
</em>
<span> Of trying to act normal in a space where the truth still echoed in the corners. Like walking barefoot across shards of memory, unsure which one would cut deepest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t look at one another for long. </span>
<em>
<span>Just small glances.</span>
</em>
<span> The kind that spoke of questions left unasked. Of wounds still stitching themselves closed. No one said it aloud, but they all felt it: </span>
<em>
<span>this dinner was an act of hope</span>
</em>
<span>. Of effort. A soft, trembling attempt at holding something together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And despite the silence, despite the heaviness… They were here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Together. </span>
</em>
<span>And that, maybe, was enough to begin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But slowly — so slowly it was almost imperceptible — something shifted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a grand gesture. No one said the right words. No one forced a smile. It began in the small things, like how a garden starts to grow again after a long frost: </span>
<em>
<span>silently, tenderly, stubbornly.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole reached across the counter and handed Agatha a plump, ripe tomato — not because she was </span>
<em>
<span>asked</span>
</em>
<span>, but because she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> she’d need it next. Her fingers brushed Agatha’s wrist as she passed it, and for a split second, their eyes met. No words. </span>
<em>
<span>Just a nod. Just enough</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick, still elbow-deep in flour, nudged the mixing bowl toward Rio with a gentle push of his knuckles. He didn’t look up when he did it, but the motion was intentional. A quiet offering. Like saying,</span>
<em>
<span> I see you. I’m trying.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And when the sauce began to bubble too violently on the back burner, Agatha reached over on instinct to lower the flame — only to find Rio’s hand already there, already turning the knob. Their fingers touched. A brief overlap. </span>
<em>
<span>Warm. Familiar.</span>
</em>
<span> Their gazes locked, just for a breath. Neither said a thing. Neither needed to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were no instructions. No commands barked across the counter. Just the fluid motion of four people orbiting each other, their movements synced by something deeper than habit — something woven between them like thread. </span>
<em>
<span>Trust. Muscle memory. The need to be together, even if no one said it aloud.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>It became a dance.</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole stirred the simmering sauce with slow, deliberate circles, her brows furrowed in focus as the scent of tomatoes and garlic deepened in the pan. Nick shaped misshapen dough circles, humming under his breath now, his concentration broken only by the occasional giggle when the dough stuck to his palm and flopped over like a creature trying to escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sprinkled herbs over the sauce with her usual flair, fingers elegant, wrists turning with grace that felt innate. She didn’t need to look — she knew the amounts, the rhythm. Her body remembered what her mind was still healing from.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio — steady, silent, always watching — rolled out the pasta with practiced strokes, her forearms dusted in flour, sleeves pushed high. She looked up between each press of the pin, her gaze sweeping the room — not because she was checking on anyone, but because </span>
<em>
<span>she couldn’t stop looking</span>
</em>
<span>. Because for the first time in too long, this didn’t feel like penance. </span>
<em>
<span>It felt like life.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The scent of rosemary began to rise as Agatha dropped a few sprigs into the bubbling sauce, mingling with garlic and olive oil, and the sweet warmth of the dough Nick had finally started getting the hang of. The heat of the stove bathed the room in something more than temperature. It gave off comfort. </span>
<em>
<span>Security</span>
</em>
<span>. A kind of hope you could smell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the silence, once so loud it had filled every corner of the room like fog, began to hum with something else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Something lighter.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Something human.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Something healing.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not joy — not yet — but the first step toward it. The kind of softness that comes only after the storm has passed and you’re still learning how to breathe again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>They didn’t need to say they loved each other.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was in the way Nicole passed a spoon without being asked. In how Nick leaned his shoulder into Agatha’s hip as she passed behind him. In the way Rio set a clean towel beside the counter for whoever needed it, without a word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were learning how to be again. How to exist not as four fractured pieces… but as one whole, </span>
<em>
<span>imperfect, messy, loving thing</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>A family.</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then... Rio broke it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t mean to. Or maybe she did. Just a little. With Rio, it was always hard to tell — where </span>
<em>
<span>accident</span>
</em>
<span> ended and </span>
<em>
<span>mischief</span>
</em>
<span> began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached for the wooden spoon to taste the tomato sauce, the one she’d been carefully tending for the last fifteen minutes, and as she turned, the edge of her hip brushed against Agatha’s. A small jolt of connection — bare skin meeting apron — before Rio’s elbow tilted too far. The spoon tipped, and with a soft but unmistakable </span>
<em>
<span>plop</span>
</em>
<span>, a dollop of red sauce flew from the spoon and splashed directly onto Agatha’s cheek, landing just beneath her left eye in a glistening smear of crimson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The world stopped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole froze mid-stir, the spoon hovering above the pot like she was afraid to move it. Her wide eyes tracked between the two women like a cat caught between two fighting wolves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nick’s gasp was sharp, loud, scandalized. He clutched his dough like a lifeline, his mouth falling open as if someone had smacked him with cold air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even the sauce on the stove bubbled less enthusiastically, as if it too had suddenly realized it was in danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes widened, horror blooming across her face. “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh no</span>
</em>
<span>,” she muttered, already reaching forward with a napkin she’d grabbed by reflex. “Ags, I didn’t mean to—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha turned. </span>
<em>
<span>Slowly</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Precisely</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Like a glacier about to split the sea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her expression was unreadable, carved in frost. Her eyes narrowed into a slit of dangerous calm, and her cheek — painted with that bright streak of red — looked like war paint.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you just...” she began, voice as soft as falling snow, “</span>
<em>
<span>throw</span>
</em>
<span> sauce on my face?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze mid-reach, napkin in hand, suddenly unsure if she was facing judgment or execution.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>throw it</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said carefully. “</span>
<em>
<span>It splashed</span>
</em>
<span>. There’s a difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole gripped her spoon tighter, eyes darting. Her knuckles went pale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, still watching with the intensity of a child who’d seen this movie before, whispered, “She’s gonna explode…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole gave him a sharp elbow to the ribs without even glancing away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Rio. Her fingers came up, slow and deliberate, and she wiped the smear of sauce with the tip of her finger. She studied the red on her skin like it was a personal betrayal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she looked up again. “You ruined my face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's mouth twitched. She tried, tried to hold it in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not possible, you're too beautiful” she murmured, the smile slipping free despite her better judgment. “I mean, I know you think your face is divine, but it survived worse than a tomato ambush.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darkened — dramatically, intentionally. She took a single, measured step forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio instinctively took a step back. “Okay, okay, I’ll get a napk—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it was too late.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In one fluid movement, Agatha turned, dipped her fingers gracefully into the large bowl of flour Nick had left on the counter, scooped up a handful, and spun back with purpose. She stepped into Rio’s space, raised her arm, and with terrifying elegance, smeared a thick, white cloud of flour right across Rio’s face — cheek to cheek, nose to temple, like she was christening her with vengeance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room went silent again — but this time, it vibrated with anticipation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood there, blinking slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flour clung to her lashes, to her lips, to her dark eyebrows now turned powder-white. A puff of the stuff hovered in the air around her like mist, settling into the curls of her hair. She looked </span>
<em>
<span>less like Death</span>
</em>
<span> and </span>
<em>
<span>more like a spectral baker</span>
</em>
<span> who’d wandered into the wrong afterlife.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The moment stretched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole’s mouth dropped open. Nick made a strangled sound that might have been a laugh, or might have been him trying not to laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared at Agatha. Blinked. Licked her lips, the flour coating her tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole burst into laughter first — a bubbling, breathless sound that spilled from her like soda fizzing over the top. She doubled over the counter, gasping, shoulders shaking. Nick joined instantly, his body bouncing with every giggle, his sticky hands smearing dough across the counter as he tried to hold himself upright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled — finally — and even she couldn’t suppress the twitch of amusement tugging at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her whole face still dusted in flour, and crossed her arms in challenge. “You’re lucky you’re hot,” she muttered, and Nick let out a high-pitched shriek of laughter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t laugh — not at first. She kept a stern expression, lips pursed, eyes narrowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You call that revenge?” she asked slowly, reaching for a pinch of flour herself. “Because I think I can top that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “</span>
<em>
<span>Try it</span>
</em>
<span>, and I’ll make you eat raw pasta.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio flicked a bit of flour at her shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped. “How </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too late now, </span>
<em>
<span>Lady Harkness</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The flour war began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole squealed and ducked behind the counter with her spoon, covering her mouth as she laughed. Nick didn’t even pretend to hide — he flung a tiny ball of dough that landed with a plop against the fridge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time that day, they weren’t thinking about who they were. </span>
<em>
<span>About Death</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>About past lives or the weight of truth.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were just four people in a too-warm kitchen, laughing. Flour flying. Sauce bubbling. Laughter overlapping with breathless gasps and empty threats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the chaos settled, they were all dusted in white and speckled in sauce. Rio’s hair was a mess. Agatha’s apron was stained. Nick had somehow gotten flour on his eyebrows. Nicole had tears of laughter streaking down her cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around, shaking her head in mock despair. “This is </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> fault,” she muttered to Rio, barely able to suppress her grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Guilty,” Rio said, leaning in and stealing a kiss from her cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” Nick groaned. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole laughed again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And for the first time in what felt like forever… it felt like home.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dinner was served in a glorious, chaotic mess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The four of them sat around the wooden table in the dining nook, the room still steeped in the lingering aroma of rosemary, garlic, and baked dough. A warm golden light from the kitchen pendant lamp cast a soft glow over their flour-splattered clothes, tomato-stained aprons, and tangled hair. The table itself was no better — speckled with smudges of sauce, crumbles of crust, and a lonely basil leaf stuck to the salt shaker.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>They hadn’t even bothered to change</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick had dried streaks of dough on his elbow and flour crusted under his fingernails. Nicole’s cheek still bore a pale smudge she hadn’t noticed, and her curls were wild from all the laughter. Rio sat comfortably slouched in her chair, a line of red on her neck from earlier splashing and a faint streak of flour down her jawline like war paint. And Agatha... Agatha had a hardened chunk of dough curled in her hair near her temple like a secret battle scar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first bite into their imperfect, slightly burned, slightly beautiful homemade pizza brought a strange quiet — not uncomfortable, but sacred. That quiet you get when food fills the room with something older than words. Something safe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back and chewed slowly, inspecting the thin crust she held in one hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This pizza is </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> thin,” she observed with dramatic seriousness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look over her glass of water, one brow raised as she twirled a stiff lock of hair around her finger. “It </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> be thicker if you hadn’t thrown half the dough into my hair, </span>
<em>
<span>Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick snorted into his slice, trying to muffle the sound but failing. A muffled </span>
<em>
<span>hffft</span>
</em>
<span>! escaped him, followed by a strangled hiccup of laughter. Nicole, ever more composed, fought her smile by stuffing a hot slice into her mouth with unnecessary speed, cheeks puffed out like a squirrel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned around another bite. “It gave you character,” she said, smirking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That wick hasn’t moved </span>
<em>
<span>in an hour</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha muttered, poking the cemented curl like it personally offended her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole swallowed quickly, eyes gleaming. “By the way, </span>
<em>
<span>I filmed everything</span>
</em>
<span>. It’s all going on my Instagram feed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha froze mid-chew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her gaze snapped to Nicole like a death glare channeled through a kitchen witch. “You didn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I did.” Nicky smiled like a villain in a cartoon. “It’s already </span>
<em>
<span>uploading</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Agatha groaned, slumping dramatically in her chair like she'd just been sentenced. “Please, I’m begging you. </span>
<em>
<span>Delete it.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick giggled behind his napkin, and Nicole just leaned her chin on her palm, smirking like a cat who’d just dropped a mouse at the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she said sweetly. “No videos.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled in relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But…” Nicole added innocently, “there are pictures. And two Boomerangs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her daughter with betrayal dripping from every blink. “You little snake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole beamed. “You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nearly choked on her bite of pizza, laughing as she patted her chest with her napkin. “Oh, it’s going to be </span>
<em>
<span>delightful</span>
</em>
<span> tomorrow. Imagine it — Professor Harkness, terrifying, flawless, untouchable… covered in flour and tomato sauce.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I will </span>
<em>
<span>hex</span>
</em>
<span> you,” Agatha growled, grabbing her napkin and flinging it at Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It landed squarely on her chest, sticking briefly before fluttering to her lap. Rio raised her hands in surrender, still laughing. “</span>
<em>
<span>Abuse</span>
</em>
<span>! Domestic abuse!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you,” Agatha pointed at her, lips twitching as she tried to maintain her dignity, “shut your mouth. Insolent woman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick was giggling so hard now he had tears in his eyes. “Mommy called Death </span>
<em>
<span>insolent</span>
</em>
<span>,” he wheezed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mommy does </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> fear the reaper,” Rio declared dramatically, holding up her pizza like a sword. “How terrifying I am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes at Rio's drama.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole lifted her cup. “To the flour war of 6PM.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick lifted his too. “To pizza that survived the apocalypse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, lips twitching. “To future therapy bills.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They clinked their glasses and cups together with a little too much energy, water sloshing over the edges, and no one cared. The sound of it — glass against glass, laughter, warm chewing, napkins rustling — filled the space with something they all needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not just joy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>But belonging</em>
</b>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The university café was buzzing as always — students milling about with half-full mugs of burnt coffee, the smell of toasted bread and paper-thin anxiety in the air. Agatha entered like a storm disguised in boots and tailored black slacks, her stride clipped, her expression somewhere between exhausted and exasperated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her friends were already seated at their usual table near the windows, sipping their drinks, half-watching her approach with matching smirks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, well,” Jen said, stirring her coffee with a slow elegance that meant trouble. “I see someone changed her hairstyle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused mid-step, instantly suspicious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen’s grin widened. “That crispy dough streak </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> did suit you, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes so hard it looked like an exorcism. “Shut up, Cynthia Erivo,” she muttered, before flopping dramatically into the chair beside them, tossing her sunglasses onto the table like a woman returning from war.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Behind her, Rio walked with the grace of someone who had not only not gone through a domestic flour war the night before — but had emerged from it smugly victorious. She was balancing Agatha’s tote bag on one arm, her lecture notes and a thermos in the other, looking more like Agatha’s personal assistant than her lover. She placed everything on the table with careful, practiced ease and took the seat next to Agatha with a small, devastating smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, ladies,” she greeted smoothly, crossing her legs and looking entirely unbothered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia raised a brow behind her tinted reading glasses. “Looks like you two managed to patch things up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her coffee cup in a lazy toast. “</span>
<em>
<span>We’re trying</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, it shows,” Alice muttered into her drink, not bothering to hide the bite in her tone. “For a second, I really thought the intern had finally done what we all secretly wanted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Kiss me, you Asian gremlin?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Slit your throat, you dramatic butch,” Alice replied sweetly, her voice utterly devoid of malice. “That tomato sauce on your face looked like blood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Much less flavorful, I assure you,” Agatha deadpanned, reaching for the sugar with a flourish. “Would’ve been a better scene if I’d screamed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly, who woke her up from that coma?” Wanda asked with a sigh, leaning back in her chair like she needed divine intervention. “Go back to sleep, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Believe me,</span>
<em>
<span> I tried</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha muttered, sipping her coffee. “But then someone”— she gestured vaguely at Rio without looking —“decided to go full Italian horror movie on me in the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, smiling innocently. “You’re still alive, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Barely.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And prettier than ever,” Rio added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not how trauma works, darling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The table burst into laughter, a mix of groans and chuckles bouncing between them. Even Alice cracked a smile behind her cup. The tension from the last few days seemed lighter now — like it had finally exhaled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For just a moment, it was easy to forget that one of them had once brought people back from the dead, and the other was Death in a leather jacket.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Just women. Coffee. Sass. Secrets.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And a very public Instagram post Nicole had uploaded for the entire world to enjoy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The bathroom tiles were cold against Agatha’s knees — unforgiving, bone-deep cold that seeped straight through her skin and into her joints, grounding her in the worst possible way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her fingers curled over the porcelain rim of the toilet, knuckles pale, muscles tight, as another violent wave of nausea climbed up her spine and clawed at her throat. She barely had time to brace herself before her body convulsed again, expelling whatever remained in her stomach with a broken, guttural heave. Her hair stuck to her cheeks, sweat and strands tangled together, and her knees pressed harder into the tile as she leaned over the bowl, shaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the worst of it passed, she stayed there — draped over the toilet like a woman half-exorcised — gasping through parted lips, her chest rising and falling with shallow, exhausted breaths. The sharp tang of stomach acid stung the back of her throat, mingling with the bitter taste of old mint toothpaste and the faint lemon scent of bathroom cleaner. It was nauseating, dizzying. The kind of mix that made her want to vomit again just by existing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wiped her mouth lazily with the back of her hand, then grimaced at herself. </span>
<em>
<span>Classy</span>
</em>
<span>. She slumped back against the wall, neck tilted, eyes half-lidded and burning at the corners, her breathing finally beginning to steady.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the hell did I eat?” Her voice was hoarse, barely audible, like it was afraid of being overheard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let her head thunk lightly against the wall and closed her eyes, trying to piece the last few days together like a forensic puzzle. Pasta. Grilled salmon. A suspicious yogurt Rio swore was "</span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span>" even though it was two days past expiration. Half a chocolate bar Nick had hidden under the couch cushion and </span>
<em>
<span>forgotten about</span>
</em>
<span>. It had a little lint on the side, sure, but it still tasted decent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Nothing</span>
</em>
<span>. Nothing worthy of this kind of betrayal. This wasn’t food poisoning. This wasn’t a random virus. This wasn’t even one of those week-long work of stress nausea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This felt… familiar. </span>
<em>
<span>Too familiar.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mind didn’t want to go there, </span>
<em>
<span>but it did</span>
</em>
<span> — slipping back, uninvited, to a certain night a few weeks ago. The night when Rio had looked at her like she was both altar and flame, when Agatha had whispered </span>
<em>
<span>I trust you</span>
</em>
<span> against her lover’s mouth as magic surged between their bodies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she'd meant it. </span>
<em>
<span>She always meant it</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She remembered the way Rio's fingers had glowed with that soft, ancient power as they moved inside her. How their soulmate marks — those thin red threads etched into their wrists — had pulsed in unison, hot and </span>
<em>
<span>alive</span>
</em>
<span>. She remembered the high, the fullness, the surrender. And she remembered how every time she surrendered </span>
<em>
<span>like that</span>
</em>
<span> — fully, without shields or sarcasm — she ended up with one of Rio’s cosmic spawn growing inside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ache that had settled in her bones after. The way her body had trembled for </span>
<em>
<span>hours</span>
</em>
<span>, limbs boneless from Rio’s magic and touch. Her skin had hummed for days afterward, as if Death herself had left fingerprints beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And she had</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>Again.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and dropped her head back against the wall with a dull </span>
<em>
<span>thunk</span>
</em>
<span>, eyes wide and distant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She remembered exactly what Rio said right before taking her apart — slowly, thoroughly. Whispering </span>
<em>
<span>promises of another child</span>
</em>
<span>, of not stopping until </span>
<em>
<span>you’re mine again.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I trust you,” Agatha had whispered back. And the memory echoed in her mind again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just like she always did. </span>
<em>
<span>Every damn time</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>every damn time</span>
</em>
<span>… she ended up with one of Rio’s little soldiers growing inside her just to grow up and look the same as Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Bloody fucking hell</span>
</em>
<span>,” she muttered, pressing a hand to her stomach like it might give her answers. Or at least </span>
<em>
<span>deny</span>
</em>
<span> the truth. But it didn’t. It was warm. Soft. Tender. And the nausea twisting inside her wasn’t just physical — it was familiar. Terrifyingly familiar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her shaky hand over her stomach was not because she expected to feel anything yet, but because it was instinct. Her palm rested against the still-flat plane of her belly, and the realization curled low in her chest like a flicker of heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course the cravings, the morning nausea, the offhand tears during a cereal commercial, the irrational </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> to physically throw Rio out the window (even more than usual) — it was all there. </span>
<em>
<span>All the signs</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly and dragged herself upright, using the sink for support. Her reflection in the mirror looked… like someone who’d been steamrolled by divine irony. Her hair was wild. Her eyes rimmed in pink. She was pale and radiant in that faintly cursed, slightly glowing way she always got during the early stages.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Great</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She'd been through this before. She'd survived this before. But something about this time made her chest tighten. Not with panic. </span>
<em>
<span>Not yet</span>
</em>
<span>. With... anticipation. Dread. Hope. All tangled into a single knot that sat beneath her ribs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t </span>
<em>
<span>believe</span>
</em>
<span> I let her </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> this </span>
<em>
<span>again</span>
</em>
<span>,” she muttered aloud, eyes flicking to the ceiling like the tiles might answer for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet… she’d known. She’d known what Rio wanted. She remembered the glint in Rio’s eyes. The way her hands trembled with hunger and reverence. The low growl of her voice when she said </span>
<em>
<span>Let me have you like that again</span>
</em>
<span>. And Agatha had opened herself to it. </span>
<em>
<span>To her</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Again</span>
</em>
<span>. For the fourth time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She brushed a palm down her abdomen again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, Agatha,” she murmured, grounding herself in the sound of her own voice. “You’ve done this before. It’s not new. It’s just a soul-bound pregnancy orchestrated by the cosmic personification of death. Totally normal… Right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let out a short, dry laugh that broke at the end. Her throat felt tight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She wants this too,” she whispered. “It’ll be okay this time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So why did her hands tremble? Why did her chest feel like it was folding in on itself?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She flushed the toilet, the sound loud and final in the too-still room, like the end of a conversation she wasn’t ready to have. Then she reached for her toothbrush, moving with the detached precision of someone trying to pretend they were just getting ready for class, not unraveling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She scrubbed her teeth. Once. Twice. A third time. She scraped at her tongue like she could erase the bitter taste of panic from the back of her throat. The toothpaste burned. </span>
<em>
<span>Good</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she looked up, her reflection in the mirror stared back, pale and sweat-damp, with strands of hair plastered to her temple. Her eyes were wide and rimmed in pink, but dry — like even her tears were holding their breath. She looked furious. And terrified. And utterly betrayed by her own body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a sharp exhale, she splashed cold water on her face, hoping it might shock the spiral out of her system. </span>
<em>
<span>It didn’t</span>
</em>
<span>. But it made her feel </span>
<em>
<span>cleaner</span>
</em>
<span>. Less like someone who might cry in a pharmacy aisle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She patted her skin dry with the towel, grabbed her coat from the hook, and swung her bag over her shoulder in one sharp motion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pharmacy first,” she muttered, voice low and brittle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, after a pause, she added —</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Panic later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And walked out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The fluorescent lights of the pharmacy were unforgiving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They buzzed faintly overhead, casting a pale, sterile glow that made everything look more exposed — </span>
<em>
<span>more real</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha stepped through the sliding glass doors with her head lowered and her sunglasses still on, despite the cloudy sky outside and the fact that she was, without question, indoors. Her long black coat was buttoned to the top, swallowing her frame, and her posture was stiff, deliberate. She moved through the aisles with the grace of a woman on a covert mission — one she prayed no one would notice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She passed the cold medicine without slowing. Pretended to examine a bottle of multivitamins with great interest. Took a sharp left at the foot creams like she knew exactly where she was going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she reached the aisle. </span>
<em>
<span>The</span>
</em>
<span> aisle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It stared her down without mercy. Discreet packaging in shades of pink, blue, and beige. Feminine branding that tried to be subtle and failed miserably. Soft fonts, pastel smiles, words like early result and clear answer and peace of mind, all screaming the </span>
<em>
<span>same thing</span>
</em>
<span> in slightly different accents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hovered in front of the options, frozen. One hand curled over the strap of her purse, the other hesitant in mid-air, torn between a digital test and the kind that looked like a cursed thermometer from the 90s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was just reaching toward the shelf when a voice rang out behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, well... if it isn’t Miss </span>
<em>
<span>‘I’m Fine, I Don’t Need Help, Stop Asking Me Things.’</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s entire spine locked. She didn’t even have to turn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” she sighed, already regretting every decision she’d made since waking up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda Maximoff appeared beside her like a vision in red, arms crossed, one brow lifted in devastating, theatrical judgment. She wore an oversized sweater, leggings, and that annoyingly effortless bun that made her look like a magazine ad for magical moms who do yoga and control chaos with ease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes flicked from Agatha’s sunglasses to the shelf of pregnancy tests, then back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha remained silent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For once in her life, Agatha Harkness had absolutely nothing to say. And </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> was the most worrying sign of all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda stepped closer, her voice saccharine. “Looking for vitamins? UTI test? Ooh — checking your ovulation window for funsies?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head slowly, glaring through her sunglasses like they were a weapon. “I swear to every cosmic law, if you </span>
<em>
<span>breathe</span>
</em>
<span> a word—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda lifted both hands in mock surrender, her tone softening. “Relax. I’m not judging you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re </span>
<em>
<span>absolutely</span>
</em>
<span> judging me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Wanda said, plucking a box off the shelf and tossing it into Agatha’s basket. Then another. And a third. All different brands. “I’m validating your questionable life choices and timing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She added one more test box. “Here, backup confirmation. </span>
<em>
<span>Just in case</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, despite herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled, sly. “Your husband was just committed for schizophrenia. Or so I heard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re an </span>
<em>
<span>awful person</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re </span>
<em>
<span>pregnant</span>
</em>
<span>,” Wanda murmured, not even phrased as a question. Her gaze softened then, the sarcasm draining just a little. “Is it Rio’s?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her, lifting her sunglasses halfway down her nose just to glare properly. “</span>
<em>
<span>Who else</span>
</em>
<span> do you think it could be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda blinked. “Right. Dumb question. Although... she is a woman, technically, no very dumb question… unless she has, you know —” Wanda gestured vaguely in front of her pelvis in a motion that might’ve been trying to mimic a penis.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Stop talking</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stood in silence. A weird, aisle-five kind of silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha whispered, “I’m not even sure yet. It’s just a theory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda looked at her flatly. “You’re in this aisle. That already says enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, thumb brushing the edge of the cardboard box in her hand. “</span>
<em>
<span>She wants this</span>
</em>
<span>. She’s wanted this for a long time. She says she wants to be present. She wants to do it right. Since... I didn’t really let her be close before. Not the other times.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned against the shelf, nudging Agatha’s arm gently. “You’re always scared before something wonderful happens. You’re like... emotionally allergic to joy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s not true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You tried to dismantle a wedding cake at the Stark wedding because it looked ‘too optimistic.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> suspiciously tall.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda chuckled and stepped away, brushing invisible dust from her sweater. “Go home, Aggie. Take the test. Then tell her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow. “Why </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because she’s Rio, and if I find out before she does, I’ll tease you into the afterlife. But if </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> finds out </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> knew before she did?” Wanda paused, deadpan. “I’ll probably wake up dead tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, quietly resigned. “Fair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She adjusted her sunglasses, lifted the basket like she was preparing for battle, and marched toward the checkout with her chin high.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Behind her, Wanda called softly, “Hey, Aggie—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t stop walking. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ll be a great mom again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She didn’t look back. But her fingers curled protectively around the edge of the basket.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And somewhere, beneath the steel armor she wore like a second skin… Her heart fluttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Positive.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Positive.</b>
</p><p>
<b>Positive...</b>
</p><p>
<b>Positive.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Four different boxes. Four different brands. All the </span>
<em>
<span>same</span>
</em>
<span> result.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The only thing remotely </span>
<em>
<span>negative</span>
</em>
<span> in the room was Agatha herself — sitting on the edge of the bathtub, head in her hands, stomach threatening another revolt. She was surrounded by empty boxes, wet sticks on a towel, and several now-unlabeled plastic cups that had once held orange juice, potion ingredients, or Nick’s sidewalk chalk rinse water.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had ignored Rio the entire afternoon. Dodged questions, avoided eye contact, muttered things like </span>
<em>
<span>I’m fine</span>
</em>
<span> and </span>
<em>
<span>just tired</span>
</em>
<span> while practically speed-walking through their house. But now she was locked in the bathroom, caught red-handed and… literally pants-down, peeing into various containers to “</span>
<em>
<span>test a theory</span>
</em>
<span>” she had already confirmed four times over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So why was she freaking out?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’d been pregnant before. </span>
<em>
<span>Three times</span>
</em>
<span>. She’d raised two chaotic demigods who were probably inventing time travel in the living room as she spiraled in here. She had done this before. Survived it. Even found joy in it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this time — this time felt different. Too quiet. Too real. </span>
<em>
<span>Too possible</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The baby was Rio’s. Her soulmate. The love of her life. The woman for whom she had rewritten the rules of existence, bent fate backward just to be with. So why did it feel like her lungs were trying to close?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ágata?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her name came softly through the door, laced with that thick, unguarded Spanish accent Rio only had when she was relaxed… or distracted. It was how she said it when she wasn’t paying attention to her mouth — just her heart. Which meant Rio wasn’t worried about being careful. But she </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ags, you’re acting weird. Are you okay? I can hear your heart going a thousand beats a minute. Like there’s </span>
<em>
<span>two</span>
</em>
<span> in there. It’s been like that for days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, the words hitting too close. </span>
<em>
<span>Too accurate</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gentleness in Rio’s voice seeped through the crack in the door like warm honey. “Do I need to call a doctor? Because you know, it’s normal, right? You’re human now. You don’t have spells to fix you anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha thought bitterly.</span>
<em>
<span> I know</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No magic to numb this. No spell to undo it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her gaze flicked to the tests again, still laid out like little soldiers of truth. Her heart slammed harder. What was she supposed to do?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if Rio had only said she wanted this in the heat of the moment? A whisper in the dark, during that night when their soulmate marks burned like wildfire and Rio’s magic had driven her to the edge of the universe and back. What if this child wasn’t the beginning of something, but the beginning of the end?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if — when — something went wrong, it was Rio who had to take the baby away? To guide it into death’s arms again?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> her for it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And that was it.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That’s where the fear was coming from. It wasn’t rejection. It wasn’t doubt</span>
<em>
<span>. It was terror</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not of having the baby.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But of losing it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of losing Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Of living through that silence again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed her hands to her mouth, trying to keep in the cry that clawed up her throat. Her chest trembled. A small sob escaped anyway, cracking through her like glass under pressure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice sharpened with urgency. “Open the door. </span>
<em>
<span>Please</span>
</em>
<span>. Let me in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled, then slowly rose to her feet. The world swayed under her for a second, nausea giving her one last cruel tug. She looked down at the tests in her hand — then at the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no hiding this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even if Rio hadn’t figured it out with her absurd ability to hear her heartbeat from across a room, she </span>
<em>
<span>would’ve</span>
</em>
<span> known. She always knew. She </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> Death — she could feel when a new soul entered the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And now… there was another. A soul made of starlight and heat and trust. A piece of both of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio could speak, before she could even see the tests, Agatha dropped everything and threw herself into her arms — burying her face into Rio’s chest, her fingers clawing into the soft cotton “Happy Not-Mother’s Day” shirt Nick and Nicole had painted with messy little hearts and stick figures.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held her instantly, her arms folding around Agatha’s trembling frame with the kind of instinctual love that didn’t need to ask questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey…” she whispered, brushing her hand up and down Agatha’s back. “You’ve been so emotional lately, you know that? Are you on your period again? Are these... human hormone things?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out something between a laugh and a sob into her shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed the top of her head and pulled back just enough to cradle her face. Her thumb traced a tear down Agatha’s cheek, gently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was just opening her mouth to ask what was going on when her eyes dropped — instinctively, unerringly — to Agatha’s hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pregnancy tests dangled limply from Agatha’s fingers, suspended at her sides like little flags of truth. </span>
<em>
<span>Four of them</span>
</em>
<span>. All undeniably, glaringly positive. Agatha hadn’t even realized she was still holding them. She stood in the doorway, barely breathing, as if her body had gone numb under the weight of knowing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the tests.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Three.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Each second stretched like an eternity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then her eyes snapped up to meet Agatha’s. Softly, disbelievingly, she murmured, “Oh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another pause. Then the weight of the realization hit her fully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>!” Her voice rose slightly with surprise, her eyes widening. She blinked, as though seeing something new within Agatha — something glowing. “There really is another heartbeat,” she whispered, wonder dripping from every syllable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a teary laugh, sharp and choked, as she wiped her cheek with the back of her wrist. Rio’s face — so open, so unguarded in that moment — made her chest ache. She looked like someone who had just stumbled into a miracle.</span>
<em>
<span> Innocent. Lost. Radiant</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said, her voice cracking around the word. “Apparently so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached out and carefully took the tests from Agatha’s hands, like they were sacred objects she didn’t want to disturb. She examined each one like she didn’t quite believe her senses — even though she could </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> the heartbeat, even though her very nature </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> another life had joined the world. Still, she needed the proof. She needed the physical affirmation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m going to be a mom?” Rio whispered. “</span>
<em>
<span>Again</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice trembled, and before Agatha could answer, Rio’s eyes shimmered. They filled instantly, without hesitation, with tears that spilled down the moment she blinked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was when Agatha knew — without any room for doubt — that Rio wasn’t scared. She wasn’t overwhelmed or conflicted or uncertain. </span>
<em>
<span>She was happy</span>
</em>
<span>. So purely, deeply </span>
<em>
<span>happy</span>
</em>
<span> that it radiated off of her like sunlight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All the fear in Agatha’s chest — the weight of it, the what-ifs, the shadowy possibilities of loss — sputtered and cracked under the warmth of that joy. She suddenly felt a little foolish for being so afraid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, sweetheart,” Agatha murmured, finally letting herself smile fully through her tears. “You’re going to be a mom again. A very good mom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, the tears that came weren’t heavy. </span>
<em>
<span>They were light</span>
</em>
<span>. Cleansing. Grateful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio set the tests gently down on the counter, then knelt in front of Agatha, her hands rising with reverence to touch her stomach. There was no shape yet, no visible sign. Just skin, soft warmth, and something more — something only Rio could feel.</span>
<em>
<span> A presence. A pulse.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes and rested her palm there, and her lips parted like she was listening to music no one else could hear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then her voice, hushed and trembling with emotion: “Do you want this too, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even in her joy, even in her awe, Rio made space for her. Because she knew joy didn’t erase fear. Because </span>
<em>
<span>the choice would always belong to Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>. She wouldn't have joy if Agatha didn't want it, if Agatha wasn't happy with her. </span>
<em>
<span>Joy isn't joy when it's one-sided</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at the warm hand on her stomach, fingers so careful, so steady. A new wave of emotion swelled in her chest. The doubt crept in again — those quiet questions, the old ache of what if, the lingering ghosts of everything they’d already lost.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then she looked into Rio’s eyes and all she saw was </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span>. Real, unshakable, I’d-die-for-you love. That was enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More than anything,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes and exhaled slowly — like a prayer had been answered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time that day, Agatha didn’t feel afraid. She felt ready. Maybe not ready for the chaos or the sleepless nights or the weird cravings. But ready for this life. Ready to do it </span>
<em>
<span>together</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>

<p>
<span>The nausea came with a vengeance. </span>
<span>Morning, noon, midnight — </span>
<em>
<span>didn’t matter</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha could be doing something entirely mundane, like brushing her teeth or simply existing near the smell of toast, and suddenly she’d be bolting toward the nearest sink like her soul had decided to evacuate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio followed behind her every time, a quiet guardian armed with ponytail holders, a cool damp cloth, and the occasional grim commentary like, “If you die throwing up, I swear I’ll resurrect you just to yell at you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re Death,” Agatha once hissed between dry heaves, “</span>
<em>
<span>just take me</span>
</em>
<span>. End my suffering.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I could, </span>
<em>
<span>but I won’t</span>
</em>
<span>. You made me watch </span>
<em>
<span>Bridgerton</span>
</em>
<span> season three. This is fair retribution.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The cravings came next.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not just food — but absurd, strangely poetic combinations that made Rio question the laws of chemistry and common decency. </span>
<span>Pickled strawberries. Garlic ice cream. Seaweed with strawberry jam, which Agatha insisted — very seriously — helped with her migraines. At one point, she claimed she could taste colors and asked Rio to help her hunt down “the blue version of cinnamon.” Rio still didn’t know what that meant.</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>One particularly cursed night, at 2:36 a.m., Agatha shook Rio awake, her face an eerie combination of desperation and command. Her voice was hushed, deadly serious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I would </span>
<em>
<span>literally</span>
</em>
<span> trade your immortality,” she whispered, “for a bowl of lemon risotto… with marshmallows.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked at her. Twice. “Are you possessed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “</span>
<em>
<span>Do I look like I’m joking?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She didn’t</span>
</em>
<span>. She looked like a woman on the edge of stabbing Death with a salad fork.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, Rio got up and made it. </span>
<em>
<span>Twice</span>
</em>
<span>. Because the first time, the rice was “too confident,” and the marshmallows were “emotionally flat.” Rio didn’t argue. She just sighed, muttered something about “suffering for love,” and started over. </span>
<span>But even with the 3 a.m. cravings, the tears over commercials, the mid-conversation bathroom runs, and the ongoing war between Agatha and her suddenly super-sensitive nose (RIP Rio’s lavender shampoo), none of it outweighed the joy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because this time, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio was there.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Really there. Not lurking in the periphery, not fading in and out of planes, not inventing errands in the underworld to avoid the ache of attachment. She wasn’t hiding behind ancient grief or pretending to be untouchable. </span>
<span>She was present. Emotionally. Physically. Constantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every step. Every breath. Every flutter of panic. Every hormonal meltdown. Every bizarre craving. She was there, hand on Agatha’s back when she threw up. Hand in hers at every appointment. Hand around her hip at night when sleep refused to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha noticed. She noticed the way Rio’s eyes softened whenever she looked at her. The way she absentmindedly traced patterns on her belly while reading out loud — ancient poetry or children's books, depending on the day. She noticed the way Rio pressed soft, reverent kisses to her skin just below her navel each morning, whispering </span>
<em>
<span>Hey, baby</span>
</em>
<span> like it was a secret between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She noticed how Rio breathed differently now. Like every breath was fuller, steadier, anchored in a life she never thought she’d get to live. </span>
<span>Agatha had been through this before. But never </span>
<em>
<span>like this</span>
</em>
<span>. Never with Rio’s full presence. Her laughter. Her tenderness. Her awe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And somehow, in between the chaos of mismatched meals and late-night existential spirals, Agatha found herself falling in love all over again. Not just with Rio. But with the life they were building.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>One absurd, beautiful craving at a time.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first ultrasound had been scheduled for a cloudy Tuesday morning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sky was gray and moody, casting soft light through the windows, the kind that made everything feel a little slower, a little quieter — as if the world itself was holding its breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had been up before dawn, pacing the kitchen barefoot in mismatched socks and clutching her fifth cup of black coffee like it might steady the nervous buzz under her skin. She’d already refolded the same dish towel three times. Her phone was plugged in and fully charged, just in case the baby decided to start breakdancing mid-scan and she needed photographic proof.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At 6:00 a.m., she checked the time again. At 6:02, she did it again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha finally emerged from the hallway in her oversized hoodie, hair barely tamed, one hand supporting her lower back, and the other pointed directly at the cat who had been staring at her belly like it might hatch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If he touches me again, I will turn him into a decorative pillow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s just curious,” Rio said, hiding her grin behind the coffee mug. “Maybe he feels the divine chaos growing inside you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grunted and waddled to the chair with the flair of a pregnant goddess on a warpath. “He’ll feel my boot if he keeps looking at me like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That's right, a cat. Because somewhere in the first few weeks, Rio thought it would be an excellent idea to bring in a stray cat from the street to be the new Harkness-Vidal. Agatha was still adjusting to the presence of the new member who seemed to judge her all the time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By 7:30 a.m., they arrived at the clinic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By 7:45, Nick had already spilled juice down the front of his hoodie and was now poking his own stomach to see if he, too, had a baby in there. Nicole sat beside him with crossed legs and closed eyes, claiming to be “centering her energy” for the new life about to be revealed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Children,” Agatha whispered under her breath, rubbing her temple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Chaos goblins,” Rio corrected, sipping from her now-cold coffee cup.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the technician finally called their names, the four of them stood as one. Agatha moved slowly, Rio steadying her with a hand on her back. Nick clutched the end of her coat like a security blanket. Nicole adjusted her headband with a business-like calm and marched in first, as if she had personally scheduled the appointment herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room was dim and hushed, the air thick with anticipation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t let go of Agatha’s hand, not even for a second. Her other hand hovered nervously in the air, unsure where to go. Nick sat on the small bench beside Agatha, chewing his lower lip, sneakers swinging gently. Nicole stood upright beside him, eyes trained on the machine like a royal guard at a sacred ritual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then the screen lit up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And there it was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Tiny. Perfect. Fluttering.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A flicker of movement, a pulsing rhythm, steady and impossibly small.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A heartbeat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped — softly, a sharp intake that caught in her throat. Her grip tightened around Rio’s fingers. Unlike Rio who could hear the baby's heartbeat since the day his heart was formed, Agatha couldn't. This was the first time she had actually heard the baby's heartbeat. Her baby. She understood why she often woke up at night with Rio resting on her belly and saying "</span>
<em>
<span>shh, I'm listening</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t breathe. Her entire world narrowed down to that single, blinking speck of light. Her heart stuttered. Her lips parted, but no words came.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick leaned forward, eyes wide and glowing. “Is </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole, never missing a beat, nodded slowly. “That’s our future sibling. I can tell. Has the same </span>
<em>
<span>‘please help me’</span>
</em>
<span> energy as the rest of us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a laugh — but it broke halfway through, collapsing into a quiet, surprised sob. The kind that sneaks up on you, soft and sudden. Her shoulders shook. Tears slipped down her cheeks, uninvited but welcomed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to her, already crying a little herself. “You’re a mess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m so happy,” Rio whispered, her voice barely above breath. “This feels… </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and leaned her head back slightly, brushing her temple against Rio’s. “It </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> real,” she murmured. “And if this kid is anything like the rest of you, it’s already plotting to steal my bed and all of my favorite mugs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick raised his hand. “Can we name it T-Rex if it kicks really hard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>,” said both mothers in perfect sync.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole, who had come prepared, pulled a tiny floral notebook from her backpack and began writing. “I’m making a list. We’ll vote democratically.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That means Rio’s definitely going to lose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, brushing a kiss against her temple. “As long as I don’t lose this, I’ll survive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She placed her hand gently on Agatha’s stomach, where the flicker of life still pulsed, strong and steady.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no shape yet. </span>
<em>
<span>No face. No name</span>
</em>
<span>. But there was a heartbeat. And for the first time in a long, long time, everything felt right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The nausea was gone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank God</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But what came in its place was arguably more dangerous: Agatha's wrath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>She had reached a stage of pregnancy where every hormone in her body apparently conspired to make her a paradox of emotions. She </span><em><span>wanted</span></em> <em><span>affection</span></em><span>. But she didn’t want to be </span><em><span>touched</span></em><span>. She </span><em><span>needed</span></em><span> Rio’s presence — her scent, her warmth, her voice — but if Rio breathed too </span><em><span>loudly</span></em><span> near her for more than ten seconds, she would throw a pillow with surprising precision.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you looking at me like </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha snapped one morning as Rio entered the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t even open my eyes yet, my love” Rio mumbled, clutching her coffee like a shield.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, try </span>
<em>
<span>blinking more silently</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick had learned to walk through the house with caution. Nicole had started referring to her mother’s mood as “the Storm Phase.” Rio kept a pre-packed bag by the door in case she needed to flee to another dimension for a few hours.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, somehow, there was love.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And a baby room to build.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It started one Saturday with a hammer, a cursed IKEA instruction manual, and three very determined people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, we’re going for lilac and green,” Rio explained, holding up two paint swatches like they were holy artifacts. “Agatha doesn’t want to know the gender yet, and frankly, she might </span>
<em>
<span>curse</span>
</em>
<span> me if I try to tell her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick sat cross-legged on the floor, covered in paint specks and betrayal. “Why am I </span>
<em>
<span>even</span>
</em>
<span> here? I’m just lifting things and getting judged for my brush strokes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole, without looking up from the paint tray, said calmly, “Because this is what siblings do. We build. We protect. We </span>
<em>
<span>choose aesthetic</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick blinked. “That’s </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> job. I’m the comic relief.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re also tall enough to reach the top of the bookshelf,” Rio added, passing him a roller. “So suck it up, </span>
<em>
<span>comic relief</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The walls soon became a soft lilac with leafy green vines stenciled across the lower half. There were glow-in-the-dark stars hidden in the corners — Nick’s idea. Nicole picked curtains with subtle constellation patterns. Rio painted a wooden shelf by hand with calming runes Agatha used to mutter during thunderstorms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha poked her head in once, took one look at the chaos, and muttered, “If a single piece of glitter ends up in my tea, I will burn this room down with my mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she waddled off to go scream at a cereal box for not closing correctly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio did know the baby’s gender. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course she did. She was Death.</span>
</em>
<span> Life didn’t exactly hide its secrets from her. But she kept her mouth shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not because she didn’t want to tell Agatha — but because Agatha deserved to choose when to know. And because deep down, Rio kind of loved the mystery. The potential. The name debates at 2:00 a.m., the guessing games, the bets with Nick (who insisted the baby was a dragon) and the quiet certainty in Nicole’s eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Nicole </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t say it out loud. Not really. But one night, as Rio stood in the almost-finished nursery, she felt a presence behind her and turned to find Nicole watching her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know too, don’t you?” Rio asked softly, amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole nodded once. “It’s not that hard. I’m made from both of you. The baby feels like… light. Not loud. </span>
<em>
<span>Like balance</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. “You’re not going to tell your mom, are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole gave her a look. “I want to survive this trimester, thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both turned back to the glowing walls, comfortable in their cosmic silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Agatha stormed through the house one afternoon, glaring at the shelves Rio had built in the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“These shelves are crooked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’re </span>
<em>
<span>literally</span>
</em>
<span> level,” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They feel crooked </span>
<em>
<span>emotionally</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth. Closed it. Then just said, “Okay, honey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick stood nearby, slowly placing a cup of tea on the table like he was delivering food to a wild animal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What</span>
<em>
<span> is</span>
</em>
<span> that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Chamomile?” he answered cautiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> chamomile,” she snapped. Then paused. “...Thank you, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick blinked. “...You’re welcome?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio watched the exchange with the patience of someone who had once argued with a dragon and lost.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, Agatha curled up in bed, sobbing because her sandwich had “too much bread energy,” while Rio spooned her gently and whispered, “It’s okay. I’ll go talk to the bread.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hiccuped. “Kill it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite everything — the tears, the mood swings, the deep need to cry at perfume commercials — there was a rhythm settling in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A quiet. The nursery was finished. Lilac and green. Stars and vines. Chaos and calm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick still thought the baby might be born with wings. Nicole had already written three poems and chosen a theme song. Rio still hadn’t told Agatha the gender, and Agatha still threatened to stab her daily with a butter knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when she fell asleep each night, her hand on her belly and her back pressed against Rio’s chest, the house went still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And for a moment, even Death knew peace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The last trimester was brutal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha was over it.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her belly had taken on a gravitational pull of its own. None of her clothes fit the way she liked. Her once-favorite dresses now clung in the wrong places or rode up in the back, and every attempt to put on shoes turned into a small war that left her cursing gravity, shoe laces, and the concept of toes. Her ankles were swollen, her skin stretched tight, and her balance… well, she hadn’t seen her own feet in weeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And underneath it all, that quiet, creeping voice had started to whisper again. The one that echoed in the silence of her own thoughts. The one that made her doubt whether Rio still looked at her the same way. Whether she still felt beautiful. Whether she was still herself under all this flesh, sweat, and stretch marks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t say it out loud. Not directly. She just got quieter. Tired-er. Snapped a little more. Laughed a little less.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio noticed. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course she did.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>One evening, after a long day of trying to feel normal and failing, Agatha shuffled into the bedroom and started undressing with slow, frustrated movements. Her body ached. Her spine hurt. Her stomach felt impossibly heavy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t notice Rio until a pair of cool hands gently pulled her arms back and helped her out of her shirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you—?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let her. Too tired to argue. Too curious to fight it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio guided her — nude now, belly full and glowing — toward the large standing mirror in the corner of their room. The curtains were drawn, the light dim. The silence in the room was soft, humming. A space held just for them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Look,” Rio said, voice barely above a breath. She stood behind Agatha, her body flush against her back, one arm curling slowly around her front.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha averted her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I look like a walking melon,” she muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio whispered. She gently bent her knees and brought her hands under Agatha’s belly, sliding beneath the weight of it with reverent care. Then she lifted — slowly, carefully — supporting the full curve of it in her palms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha inhaled sharply. It was the first time in weeks she hadn’t felt the pressure pressing down on her pelvis. The first time her back stopped aching. The weight, the gravity of it, was suddenly... shared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Agatha whispered, eyes widening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve got you,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed her cheek against Agatha’s shoulder, her lips brushing the curve of her neck. Her arms remained under her belly, holding her up — not just in gesture, but with all the steadiness of someone who had held dying stars and broken souls, and now held her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stared into the mirror together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha saw herself. Really saw. The curve of her hips. The swell of her stomach. The fullness of her breasts. The softness in her arms. The strength in her stance. She looked like something ancient. Sacred. Like earth and flame and love all tangled into one trembling, living thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You are carrying the most precious thing in the universe,” Rio whispered, eyes locked with hers in the reflection. “And I don’t just mean our baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re </span>
<em>
<span>powerful</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio continued. “Not in magic. Not in spells. Just </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>. You’re creation. You’re courage. You’re every heartbeat and breath and tear and laugh that brought us here. You’re the most </span>
<em>
<span>beautiful thing</span>
</em>
<span> I’ve ever seen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chin trembled. “You’re just saying that because you want sex later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled against her shoulder. “I </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> want sex later. But that doesn’t make it less true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed — wet and cracked and raw. Her hands came up to cover Rio’s, still holding the weight of their unborn child.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stood like that for minutes, unmoving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just two women. One holding life. The other holding her. And for that brief, sacred stretch of time, the weight wasn’t so heavy anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It started with pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A deep, sudden ache that wrapped around Agatha’s abdomen like an iron band. It pulled her from sleep in a rush of heat and pressure, making her bolt upright in bed, hands instinctively flying to her belly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She couldn’t breathe for a second. She just sat there, hunched forward, legs dangling off the edge of the bed, her fingers digging into the skin of her own stomach like she could somehow hold the pain in place with sheer will.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The clock read 4:23 a.m.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath came in shaky gasps.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Beside her, Rio stirred, then jolted awake with a startled gasp, nearly falling off the bed in her scramble to sit up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” she rasped, disoriented, hair tangled, voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond immediately — her face was scrunched with pain, her lips parted in a half-growl, half-breath. But when Rio leaned closer, what caught her attention more than the pain was what she saw behind Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fear</span>
</em>
<span>. Raw. Clear. Sharp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio said quickly, already climbing out of bed, heart in her throat. “Okay, okay, I’m going to get the bags and wake the kids. You stay here, sit back, </span>
<em>
<span>breathe</span>
</em>
<span>. Like that exercise we practiced — the breathing thing with the hands. In, out. </span>
<em>
<span>Easy</span>
</em>
<span>. Just breathe, amor, and I’ll—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Vidal, I </span>
<em>
<span>swear to every entity in your stupid dominion</span>
</em>
<span> if you say breathe one more time I will — AHHH, FUCK!” Agatha doubled forward, gripping her belly with both hands as the contraction hit hard, stealing every bit of oxygen from her lungs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spun on her heel and sprinted like the house was on fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook Nick awake, shouted something about bags and towels, gently pulled Nicole out of a meditation nap (“I knew it was today,” she said groggily), and dragged everything they’d packed weeks ago from the hallway closet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time she came flying back into the bedroom with two bags and a half-dressed Nick behind her, Agatha was still in the same spot — but now she was sweating. Her hair clung to her forehead, her breathing uneven. But it was the way she held her belly that stopped Rio cold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not just in pain. </span>
<em>
<span>In defense</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Arms wrapped protectively, possessively, around her bump. Like she was ready to fight off the universe if it came too close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio understood. Agatha wasn’t just in labor. </span>
<em>
<span>She was scared. </span>
</em>
<span>She was remembering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The last time she’d carried a child into the world… Rio had taken him away. Her job had taken him away. And that memory — that ancient, silent wound — was carved into every tense muscle in Agatha’s body now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio dropped the bags.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stepped closer, voice quiet and full of care. “Agatha… can I come closer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to her. She was pale, her lips trembling, eyes shining but fierce. Still protecting. Still uncertain. But slowly — shakily — she nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio knelt down in front of her, carefully resting a hand on the bed. “I’m here as </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>. As Rio. Your </span>
<em>
<span>wife</span>
</em>
<span>. The </span>
<em>
<span>mother</span>
</em>
<span> of this baby. Not the collector. </span>
<em>
<span>Not Death</span>
</em>
<span>. Just me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She laid a gentle hand against Agatha’s knee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s okay, Ags,” she whispered. “She’s strong. She’s ready. And I didn’t come to take her. I came to </span>
<em>
<span>meet</span>
</em>
<span> her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up. Her eyes widened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She?” she croaked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. Then blanched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh shit — shit! That wasn’t — I didn’t mean to — That just slipped out! </span>
<em>
<span>I was worried</span>
</em>
<span>, you were afraid of me, and it just—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“RIO!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry! I </span>
<em>
<span>panicked</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s your job to take </span>
<em>
<span>lives</span>
</em>
<span>, not ruin </span>
<em>
<span>surprises</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> daughter too! And she was kicking my lungs, okay?! I was trying to be tender!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled shakily, her face half-twisted in pain and half in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she said slowly. “This baby is trying to climb out through my ribs. If she doesn’t stop, I swear on your </span>
<em>
<span>underworld throne</span>
</em>
<span> you are not touching me </span>
<em>
<span>for months</span>
</em>
<span>. I mean it. </span>
<em>
<span>MONTHS</span>
</em>
<span>. I will put binding spells on my underwear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed — despite the tears forming in her eyes. She cupped Agatha’s face gently and kissed her forehead. “Fair.” Then softer, her voice trembling. “But please… let me take care of you. Let me protect you. Let me </span>
<em>
<span>stay</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her, eyes full of fire and water and everything in between. She reached out and pulled Rio close, fingers curling into the back of her shirt, lips meeting hers in a kiss that was hot and desperate and full of pain and love and defiance and hope.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then get me to the goddamn hospital,” Agatha breathed against her mouth. “Because your daughter is </span>
<em>
<span>dramatic as hell</span>
</em>
<span> and I will not give birth in our bedroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood like a soldier. “Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as Agatha tried to get up, groaning and glaring all at once, Rio wrapped an arm around her back and whispered, “She’s going to be beautiful. Like you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “She better come out with </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> face and </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> sarcasm this time. Otherwise, I’m asking for a refund.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, kissed her one last time, and yelled down the hall:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicole! Nick! Operation Baby Is Go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick’s scream echoed back: “Do I still get to cut the cord?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>!” both mothers answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And just like that, chaos descended. And life prepared to rise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The delivery room was a blur of voices, sterile lights, and sweat-drenched tension.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was gripping the rails of the bed so hard her knuckles had turned white, her legs trembling, hair plastered to her face. Every contraction hit like a wave crashing through her spine. She screamed, cursed, cried, swore she'd hex the doctor, and at one point, threatened to summon a blood demon if anyone told her to "just breathe" again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had never been more terrified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stood beside her, one hand on Agatha’s damp forehead, the other gripped tightly by fingers that could crush stone. She whispered every grounding spell she knew, even the fake ones, just to keep talking. Agatha barely heard her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But when the moment came, when the final cry tore out of Agatha’s throat and her body went limp with exhaustion, the room filled with a sound that made everything else fall away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A cry. High-pitched. Fierce. </span>
<em>
<span>Alive</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The doctor held her up. “She’s perfect,” she said with a smile. “Congratulations.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's head rolled slightly to the side, her eyes glassy with exhaustion, her breath shallow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was still frozen in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The baby cried louder. Her skin was flushed, her hands curling into tiny fists. The nurse was already turning to place her in Agatha’s arms when Agatha raised a trembling hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No… </span>
<em>
<span>wait</span>
</em>
<span>.” She barely had the strength to speak. “Rio. Let her hold her first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, stunned. “</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span>?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You never… got to hold them. Not Nick. Not Nicole. You… never got that first moment. I want you to have it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The weight of that truth hit Rio like a brick wall. Her lips parted, her chest clenched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” she whispered, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hold her,” Agatha insisted, tears glistening in her eyes — purple now, deep and endless. “She’s </span>
<em>
<span>yours</span>
</em>
<span> too. And you deserve to meet her first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The nurse looked to the doctor, who nodded gently. A moment later, the baby — tiny, warm, wailing — was carefully placed into Rio’s trembling arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stiffened instantly, like someone had handed her a glass sculpture made of lightning. She held the baby awkwardly at first, her hands cupped so delicately it looked like she feared she'd crush her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, still breathless, watched from the bed with a weak smile. “You look like you’re holding a bomb.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I feel like I’m holding a bomb,” Rio breathed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The baby squirmed softly against her chest. Her skin was already calming. Her cries softened into little hiccups.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's eyes filled with tears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me how she looks like, Rio,” Agatha murmured, voice cracking. “Tell me. I can’t see well yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked down again, her breath catching. “She… she looks like you. Finally, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a weak, breathy laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She has your eyes,” Rio whispered, her thumb brushing the baby’s soft cheek. “Those deep, ocean-blue eyes. And your lips. She’s so tiny… Is she supposed to be </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> small?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked over at the doctor, half-panicked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman chuckled. “Exactly nine months and one day. Right on time. Perfect weight. A little tall, honestly. Congratulations, ladies Harkness-Vidal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked back down, blinking through tears. “She doesn’t </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> big. She looks like one of those weird dolls Nicole keeps in the basement.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From the hospital bed, Agatha raised a weak hand and pointed at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you just call my daughter a creepy basement doll?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio winced. “No! I mean—yes? But in a very… good way?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, too exhausted to argue but clearly storing the insult for future vengeance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s perfect,” Rio added quickly. “She’s </span>
<em>
<span>ours</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The baby gave a little grunt, wriggled in Rio’s arms, and let out a sigh so loud it made the nurse chuckle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat down beside Agatha and carefully laid the baby in her arms, helping guide her hands. Agatha cradled her daughter like something she'd been waiting her whole life to hold again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, forehead to forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you,” she whispered. “She’s here. And I didn’t come to take her. I came to </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span> her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's eyes brimmed again, but this time… she didn’t cry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She just nodded. And whispered back, “Welcome home, my little storm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lay back against the pillows, hair damp against her forehead, skin pale but glowing in the kind of way only mothers did — fragile and powerful all at once. Her arms cradled the tiny weight resting on her chest, warm and curled into herself, breathing in little fluttery sighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The baby’s forehead was wrinkled and soft, her skin still pink and delicate like the inside of a seashell. Her scent was new and raw — milk, cotton, and something sacred, like the beginning of something no one else could touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers gently traced over the baby’s brow, as if memorizing each line, each curve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s her name going to be?” she asked softly, voice hoarse from hours of labor but filled with something warmer. She didn’t look at Rio when she spoke, just kept her gaze on her daughter, hypnotized by the slow rise and fall of her chest. “I assume you and the kids took this mission very seriously.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat beside her, her hand resting over Agatha’s leg, thumb moving in soft circles. Her own eyes were heavy with tears she hadn’t had time to shed yet, and exhaustion lined every part of her posture — but there was light in her face, still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chuckled low in her throat. “Nicole wants </span>
<em>
<span>Victoria</span>
</em>
<span>. Says it’s the Latin root for Nicholas. She claims it’s symbolic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a breathy, worn laugh, her lips parting just enough to show her teeth. Her chest shook from the effort. “Of course she does. That girl takes symbolism as seriously as I take wine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and leaned in slightly, brushing a strand of hair from Agatha’s cheek, her touch reverent. Then her voice dropped into something quieter, something vulnerable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I was thinking… </span>
<em>
<span>Eden</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked and finally lifted her gaze to Rio, curiosity soft in her eyes. “Like the garden?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, her eyes distant, almost nostalgic. “Yes. It was one of the first creations. I used to walk those paths with my sister, long before you humans ever touched it. Helped name the animals. Helped care for the plants. It was quiet. Balanced. </span>
<em>
<span>Beautiful</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held her gaze. “You loved it there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I did,” Rio whispered. “And she feels like that. Like that peace. Like the start of something that doesn’t belong to the world’s chaos.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a stillness between them for a long moment, broken only by the baby’s tiny breath against Agatha’s skin. Then, slowly, Agatha smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” she murmured. “I like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, as if releasing something ancient and held too long. Agatha shifted slightly, the movement small, protective. She lowered her chin to kiss the baby’s temple and then turned toward Rio with glassy eyes and the most honest voice she’d used all night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to watch over Eden,” she said softly. “And I’m going to sleep for at least twelve hours. Possibly longer. If I don’t wake up by Thursday, bring wine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, her chest rising with the sound. She leaned in, resting her forehead against Agatha’s temple for a moment before whispering, “You deserve it. You did amazing. </span>
<em>
<span>Again</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha barely nodded, already halfway gone into sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But before she drifted fully, she murmured, “Thank you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at the tiny creature between them — her daughter, this impossible, beautiful girl — and whispered back with a lump in her throat, “No, my love. </span>
<em>
<span>Thank you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as Agatha surrendered to rest, Rio remained awake, watching over both of them like a guardian meant to be exactly where she was — finally, fully present at the beginning of life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not to take. But to protect.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>More than eight hours had passed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slept soundly, her body finally surrendering to rest. Her chest rose and fell in slow, steady rhythms, her lips slightly parted, one arm curled instinctively over where Eden had once pressed against her from within. Every so often, Rio would rise from the small armchair beside the bed, adjust her pillow, tuck the blanket around her shoulders, and smooth the stray strands of hair that clung to her temple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked so peaceful like that. </span>
<em>
<span>So soft</span>
</em>
<span>. It was almost hard to believe that hours earlier she had threatened to kill an entire medical staff if someone dared touch her foot during labor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Across the room, near the incubator glowing softly in pastel light, Nick and Nicole sat on padded stools with legs swinging and eyes wide. They hadn’t moved for the past half hour, utterly fascinated by the squirmy little creature that made odd noises and blinked at them like she already knew all their secrets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eden’s pale blue eyes flitted between them with a curious sharpness, her tiny fingers twitching like she was taking mental notes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> looks like Mom,” Nicole said, one elbow propped on her knee as she gently brushed a fingertip over Eden’s impossibly small knuckles. “She stares like a hawk. No, wait. Like an </span>
<em>
<span>eagle</span>
</em>
<span>. She’s totally monitoring us for weaknesses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eden blinked slowly, as if confirming the accusation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, meanwhile, was pouting. His chin in his hands, his face pressed to the side of the incubator. “She’s so small,” he muttered. “I still think she should’ve been a dragon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole didn’t even look at him. “Nick, drop it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She could’ve hatched.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She </span>
<em>
<span>literally</span>
</em>
<span> came out of a woman, you nerd.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Behind them, Rio sat stiffly in the corner chair, holding a thick paperback titled First-Time Parenting: A Practical Survival Guide for the Chronically Underprepared like it was the Necronomicon. Her eyes were darting over the chapter where Rio wrote in red pen on the first day: </span>
<em>
<span>How Not to Snap Your Baby in Half While Changing a Diaper</span>
</em>
<span>, and she looked vaguely horrified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are they so fragile?” she whispered, flipping a page. “They don’t have scales. Their bones are bendy. They can’t even hold their own heads. </span>
<em>
<span>How did humanity survive evolution like this</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole snorted. “You’re literally the personification of death and you’re scared of a diaper.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not scared of the </span>
<em>
<span>diaper</span>
</em>
<span>. I’m scared of </span>
<em>
<span>breaking</span>
</em>
<span> her,” Rio hissed. “She’s like a puddle made of hope and cartilage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eden let out a high-pitched grunt, then a loud </span>
<em>
<span>frrrrpt</span>
</em>
<span> echoed off the walls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All three of them froze. The baby blinked. Then wriggled. And then looked vaguely offended by her own noise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick and Nicole lost it. Nicole was doubled over, laughing silently, tears in her eyes. Nick had slid halfway off his stool, clutching his stomach. Even Eden gave a startled hiccup, like she’d surprised herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, however, looked terrified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh no,” she whispered. “That was the signal, wasn’t it? That was the poop sound.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole wiped her eyes and grinned wickedly. “Looks like it’s time for your first diaper change, mom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not ready. You do it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole leaned back smugly. “</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> made her, you change her. I didn’t ask for another sibling. But you asked for another child. This one's on you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pointed at her like she was declaring war. “I’m going to remember this. When you’re seventeen and begging me for a car, I will pull this day from my memory like a cursed scroll.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole gave a flawless, innocent shrug. “Then you better learn to change diapers fast. She’s not going to wait for your trauma therapy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick, still wiping tears, added, “At least she didn’t breathe fire. Small wins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio inhaled slowly. Rose from her chair like a condemned woman walking to the gallows. And looked down at Eden, who was now squinting up at her with that same owl-eyed intensity as Agatha, like she knew exactly what was about to happen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, little one,” Rio muttered. “Please don’t remember this part of your first day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned to the changing table. Unfolded the kit with the precision of a combat medic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s do this,” she whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And behind her, Nicole quietly took out her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Smile, Mom. This is going on the ‘First Times’ baby album.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicole.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m creating memories!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>will haunt you</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’ll still have to wipe poop.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned. “I miss being feared.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eden gave another fart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room exploded into laughter again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And from the bed, still half-asleep, Agatha mumbled faintly, “If you get poop on my sheets, I’m exiling all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t think that’s a little </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> tight?” Nicole raised a skeptical eyebrow as she eyed her baby sister, now wrapped in a brand-new blanket like a sacred artifact. Her diaper was changed, her bodily functions approved by the hospital’s nursing staff, and yet Eden looked... mildly inconvenienced by life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The baby blinked slowly. If she even tried to move, she’d likely roll across the table like a fat little worm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The book says it has to be like a </span>
<em>
<span>burrito</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said, holding up The First-Time Mother’s Illustrated Guide like it was gospel. “Burritos are tight so the filling doesn’t fall out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a burrito, Rio,” Agatha groaned from the hospital bed as she pushed herself upright, wincing slightly. “She’s your daughter. Your </span>
<em>
<span>human</span>
</em>
<span> daughter. If she stays wrapped like that one second longer, she’s going to develop spine issues and probably resentment. Give her to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, glancing down at the perfectly swaddled bundle in her arms. “Are you sure she won’t unravel like... like loose meat from a poorly rolled tortilla?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>!” Agatha barked with sharp, zero-patience authority.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was enough. With all the care of someone handling the last Phoenix egg in existence, Rio passed Eden over, her hands trembling only slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, despite her exhaustion, took the baby with practiced grace — rewrapping her swiftly, expertly, with the kind of ease that only someone with multiple children and excellent muscle memory could manage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There,” she muttered. “Now she’s secure and breathing properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared, awestruck. “You make it look so easy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s because it </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> easy. Now hand me that pillow, I need some support — and she needs to feed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole made a gagging noise from the corner. “</span>
<em>
<span>Ew</span>
</em>
<span>. I’ll wait outside.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re grossed out, emo child? You latched onto my chest like a baby calf for </span>
<em>
<span>two years</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha said dryly, adjusting the pillow under her arm. “Take your brother with you and buy him breakfast. Use your own money.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicole rolled her eyes but grabbed Nick’s hand. “Come on, future dragon boy. Let’s go find food.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nick didn’t resist. “As long as there’s pancakes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door clicked shut behind them, leaving the room in gentle silence. Just the two of them. Agatha. Rio. And Eden — small, squirmy, and slightly indignant. Rio sat down beside Agatha again, almost pressed against her side. She was close enough to hear every breath the baby made, to see every flutter of her lashes. Her eyes never left the newborn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Eden finally latched onto Agatha’s breast, Agatha flinched, a sharp breath escaping her lips. “Oh — damn. That hurts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, alarmed. “She bit you? </span>
<em>
<span>How</span>
</em>
<span>? She doesn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> teeth yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, darling,” Agatha breathed out slowly, trying to settle into the ache. “It’s just... the beginning always hurts. It always does. You forget, and then — well. </span>
<em>
<span>You remember</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes dropped to the baby, her expression shifting from concern to guilt. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think about how much you’d have to go through. I should’ve... I should’ve thought about that more before I — before we —”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice cut through her ramble with gentle finality.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached up with her free hand and cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb brushing softly against her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This kind of pain?” Agatha said quietly. “It’s the kind I promise is worth </span>
<em>
<span>every second</span>
</em>
<span>. Love hurts too, you know. And I’ve never once regretted this. Not you. Not her. Not any of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s throat bobbed. She pressed her hand over Agatha’s where it still rested on her face, holding it there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But the factory’s </span>
<em>
<span>closed</span>
</em>
<span>,” Agatha added, eyes narrowing slightly. “Do you understand me? No more little Death babies. This uterus is officially on lockdown.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, sheepish. “Okay. I’m happy with three little me’s.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Shut up,”</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha snorted. “She looks like </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>. Finally. My genes actually showed up for something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at Eden, who blinked up at her like she knew what they were talking about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio conceded, lips twitching. “She has your eyebrows. Very judgmental.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly and leaned back, adjusting Eden as the baby suckled peacefully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything else. She just sat there, watching them — Agatha glowing despite the pain, Eden feeding quietly, her tiny fingers twitching — and realized that for the first time in her eternal, chaotic existence...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to be anywhere else.</span>
