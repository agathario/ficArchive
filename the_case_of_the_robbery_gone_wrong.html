<h2 class="heading">The Call</h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It's just after 3 o'clock on a cold, gloomy Friday in early November when Rio gets the call.</p><p>They really don't need the third cup of coffee they just went and got, but they're bored and can't reasonably take off until 4:30 at the earliest. Flopping down into their desk chair, they huff and pick up their phone, planning to scroll idly through Instagram or something. As soon as they unlock it, though, it starts ringing.</p><p>"Please don't tell me you have an assignment for me," they groan in lieu of a greeting.</p><p>"Good afternoon to you too," Supervisory Special Agent Jimmy Woo says. He sounds tired, and Rio feels a little bad. Just a little.</p><p>"Good afternoon," they relent. "So, what's up?"</p><p>"Bank robbery out in Westview," Jimmy says. He sounds apologetic. "You know it? The locals need you out there ASAP."</p><p>"No, where the fuck is Westview? And are you really telling me I have to go out there today?" It's not like Rio has plans tonight, but it's the principle of the thing. It's a Friday.</p><p>"Hunterdon County. And yes, today." They've just started protesting when he interrupts. "There's a body, Vidal."</p><p>That gets Rio out of their chair. "You should have led with that," they snap, holding the phone between their shoulder and their ear as they grab their coat and keys. "Text me the address and let the locals know I'm on my way."</p><p>"Will do. Bye," Jimmy says, but Rio barely hears it as they pull the phone away from their ear and hang up, jogging out to their car.</p><p>Google Maps says it'll take an hour and 12 minutes to get from Newark to the First Bank of Westview. Way too far for a Friday afternoon, but, well, that's what they get for deciding to become an FBI agent when they were in their early 20s.</p><p>Rio realizes right as they get on the expressway that they left their fresh cup of coffee cooling on their desk. Now they're cold as fuck and wish they had it, especially since it's going to get dark as soon as they arrive in Westview and they probably have a long night ahead. They crank the heat up, then the radio, and yell along to Bruce Springsteen as they weave in and out of traffic. (They've been in Jersey for 15 years now and they'll be the first to admit that somewhere along the way, they became a total stereotype.)</p><p>The expressway finally dumps Rio off onto a tree-lined little state highway. They have to admit it's pretty out here. Quiet, peaceful, full of plants. As they approach town, though, the area loses its appeal. They drive past cookie-cutter houses, some of which already have elaborate Christmas decorations up, As they pull into the two blocks that count for a downtown here, they make a disgusted noise. Everything here is so <em>perfect</em>. They wouldn't be surprised if Hallmark actually films movies in this town square.</p><p>Shoving their anti-suburb bias aside, Rio parks across the street from the bank and strides across the street, flashing their badge at the first cop they see. "Thank God you're here, Special Agent Vidal," he says, extending a large hand. "Detective Herb Feltman. We, uh…we don't really see crimes like this in Westview. I won't lie, we're out of our depth."</p><p>Rio shakes his hand. "Happy to help. I heard there was a body?"</p><p>Detective Feltman nods and gestures for them to follow him, looking a little sick. "Yeah, a woman in her 40s or 50s. She didn't have anything with her except her phone." He takes something out of his pocket, and Rio assumes from the evidence bag it's in that this is the phone in question. They take it with a nod of thanks as the detective continues. "She was just sitting in the lobby when the perp came in. Preliminary interview with the teller makes it sound like the perp was all set to just walk out calmly when—bang—gun goes off and the perp sprints out the door."</p><p>Rio frowns. "So the perp had the cash in hand already? Why would they shoot at that point?"</p><p>The detective shrugs. "Could be that it was just an accident. First-time bank robber, twitchy finger?"</p><p>Something isn't right. They're at the body now, and Rio crouches down by the armchair. The woman is slumped over as if she's just dozed off. She looks wealthy, dressed in that understated but glamorous way that's only really possible if you have a lot of money. From the look of the town, though, everyone here is pretty rich. Rio peers at the woman's black turtleneck. It's shiny with blood, and it takes Rio a couple of seconds to determine where the gunshot wound is. "Has the bullet been retrieved?" they ask, glancing up at Detective Feltman.</p><p>He's looking towards the ceiling, clearly trying to avoid seeing the body. Fair enough. "Not yet. We picked up the casing over there—" he points to an evidence marker "—but we're assuming the bullet itself is embedded in the back of the chair, so we need to move the body before we can retrieve it. And of course we wanted you to get here before moving her."</p><p>Rio stands up, unnecessarily dusting their pants off. "Thank you. I don't think I can make any conclusions until there's an autopsy, though. So please go ahead and have the medical examiner's team move her. If your guys can retrieve the bullet, I'll send that, the casing, and the phone back to Newark for analysis. Speaking of analysis—security camera footage?"</p><p>"We already sent a copy to your office," Detective Feltman says. "None of it is very helpful, though. The perp was wearing a ski mask and all black, and the footage is <em>really</em> bad quality."</p><p>Rio sighs. "Okay, hopefully one of those things leads us somewhere soon. In the meantime, I'd love to get set up somewhere so I can interview the witnesses."</p><p>They spend the rest of the afternoon and most of the evening in the bank manager's office, chugging watery bank coffee and being reminded that eyewitness testimony is incredibly unreliable. According to the two tellers, the manager, and the three other customers who were there at the time of the robbery, the perpetrator is both short and tall, thin and fat, male and female (well, Rio, as a genderqueer person, sort of has to give that last one a pass).</p><p>After learning from the first teller they interview that the robber made off with a grand total of $5,000, Rio doesn't learn a single useful piece of information for the rest of the day. By the time they finally finish up with the last customer, a fluttery and <em>very</em> chatty old lady named Mrs. Hart, Rio is that deeply familiar but still unpleasant combination of frustrated, wired, and exhausted.</p><p>Detective Feltman directs them to the cheapest hotel in the area, which is a very nice Hampton Inn. No seedy motels for the people of Hunterdon County, apparently. The room is clean and warm, which is really all Rio needs. As they toss their overnight bag onto the bed, they suddenly realize that they haven't had anything since lunch except coffee and quickly place a ludicrously large Chinese delivery order before hopping in the shower.</p><p>Feeling more human once they're clean and cozy in a muscle tee and sweatpants, Rio settles in to inhale a full container of lo mein and half a portion of sweet and sour tofu while watching a hapless real estate agent try to satisfy both members of a couple who want totally opposite things on <em>House Hunters</em>.</p><p>Once the food is put away and they're all ready for bed, Rio finally sinks back onto the surprisingly soft mattress and lets their mind drift.</p><p>Why would the perp shoot this woman after already getting what they wanted? What are the chances that an accidentally fired gun would put a bullet directly through someone's heart? Why didn't the woman have anything with her except her phone? Surely you need a wallet at the bank.</p><p>At some point, Rio's pondering devolves into drifting, and they fall into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><hr/><p>The next day, Detective Feltman calls Rio as they're piling scrambled eggs onto a freshly made waffle. They love a complimentary hotel breakfast. "The ME called. She's good to do the autopsy at 10, if you can get down there by then."</p><p>Rio glances at their phone screen (it's 9:33), then puts the phone back to their ear. "Well, how far is the medical examiner's office?"</p><p>Detective Feltman chuckles. "Oh, we don't have a dedicated medical examiner's office, Special Agent Vidal. It's the county hospital you want, 10 minutes south of here. Just follow all the signs that say "Hospital" and you'll find it."</p><p>Rio shakes their head and hangs up. Their impression from yesterday is solidified: it might be pretty out here, but they're more than happy that they live in an actual city with an actual medical examiner's office.</p><p>Even after finishing their hefty breakfast, going back upstairs to get dressed, and making two wrong turns, Rio still makes it on time. The medical examiner, Dr. Jones, is a prim middle-aged lady who seems more like she spends her time running PTA meetings, not cutting open cadavers. Once the small talk is over, though ("Oh, my goodness, you're so <em>brave</em> to live in Newark!"), she runs an efficient autopsy.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, Rio has no new information, which is what they were expecting, but it's still disappointing. They walk out knowing exactly what they knew walking in: their Jane Doe was shot through the heart and died pretty much instantly. Everything else about her is remarkably normal.</p><p>Rio's looking at their phone, about to call Detective Feltman back, when someone says, "Special Agent?"</p><p>They look up and freeze. Standing in front of them is the hottest woman they've seen in a long time. She's maybe 30, wearing a pretty standard winter dyke uniform—messy brown waves flowing down from a beanie, plaid flannel, cuffed jeans over Docs—but <em>damn</em>, she makes them look good. She's also wearing a dark blue trenchcoat, and somehow makes it look cool, not dorky. Rio is suddenly reminded that they haven't had sex with another person in six months.</p><p>"Uh, yeah, that's me," Rio says as soon as they regain the ability to speak. They extend their hand. "Rio Vidal."</p><p>The woman takes Rio's hand and clasps it firmly, looking deep into their eyes with a small smile. Her eyes are very blue, and crinkle at the corners when she smiles. "Agnes O'Connor." She's warm, and Rio makes the handshake last a little longer than strictly necessary before letting go. Agnes' fingers brush over their palm as they pull away.</p><p>"Is there something I can help you with?" they ask, very professionally and normally. <em>It's professional and normal to lick your lips after asking a professional and normal question, right?</em></p><p>Agnes glances down at Rio's mouth, that little smile still on her face. She points to the doorway Rio just came through. "I need you to help me get in to see that body," she says softly. She's not quite batting her eyelashes, but she is making her eyes very big and blinking at Rio.</p><p>Now Rio at least has an excuse for staring and spluttering for a couple seconds before they finally say, "Excuse me?"</p><p>"I need to see the body," she says, more firmly this time. "Look, I'm a PI, and if that Jane Doe is who I think she is, I have a lot of information I can give you that I think will really help your investigation. But I need to make sure it's actually her first."</p><p>Rio has been an FBI agent for more than 15 years. They do everything by the book. They never bend rules, much less break them. <em>Except.</em> Except when gorgeous butches are involved. (This has only happened twice before, and both times, the favors involved said butches' heads between Rio's legs during work hours.) What Agnes is asking for is a <em>slightly</em> bigger breach in protocol. And yet Rio opens their mouth and what comes out is, "Okay."</p><p>They turn without waiting for a reaction and mouth, "<em>Okay?!</em>" to themself as they walk back into the morgue. Well, it's too late to stop now.</p><p>"Dr. Jones?" they say, startling the medical examiner just as she's throwing her gloves in the trash.</p><p>"Yes, Special Agent Vidal?" she asks wearily, as if expecting Rio to ask her to perform the whole autopsy over again.</p><p>"This is my—uh—associate, Agnes," they say. "She needs to look at the body." They don't elaborate, hoping Dr. Jones isn't the curious type.</p><p>It's their lucky day. She sighs and mutters something about entitled Feds as she pulls on a fresh pair of gloves, but she doesn't ask any further questions, and she pulls the sheet back to give Agnes a good look at the body.</p><p>Agnes steps forward, shoulder brushing against Rio's as she steps around them. She leans in, jerks back, and finally nods once, pressing her lips together. "Okay, thanks, Doc," she says curtly. She walks quickly to the door, brushing past Rio again. It can't be a coincidence that she made contact with them both times, can it?</p><p>Rio's lost in thought, pondering this, when Agnes turns around in the doorway and gestures impatiently. "It's her. Come with me to my car. Let's talk."</p><p>As they follow Agnes to her car, they lament the presence of the blue trenchcoat. It looks good, but it also means Rio can't see Agnes' ass—which, they remind themself suddenly, they shouldn't be staring at anyway. <em>Get it together, Vidal.</em></p><p>Agnes gets in the car and immediately starts the engine. The environmentalist part of Rio wants to chide her for it, but the part of them that's freezing from the cold weather plus the morgue wisely takes over and keeps their mouth shut, letting them enjoy the heat blasting into the car. They lean back in their seat, looking straight ahead, doing their best not to look at Agnes. </p><p>She turns so she's sitting a little sideways and leans against her window, very much looking at Rio. "Okay, so. Like I said, I'm a private investigator. One of my current cases is—" she suddenly lurches forward and reaches into the back seat, rummaging around "—a skip trace for a woman named Samira Menière. And before you ask, I can't tell you who my client is. All I can tell you is that she owes them a lot of money." With a grunt, she maneuvers herself back into a sitting position, now holding a folder. With her other hand, she reaches into the door panel and pulls out a pair of glasses.</p><p>Rio knows they're staring again as Agnes puts the glasses on. This is all too much for Rio right now. They can deal with a case, and they can deal with a hot woman (kind of), but both at the same time is overwhelming them. Agnes sees them looking, can probably see how big their pupils are, and she tilts the glasses down a little and looks at Rio over them, smirking. They're sure she's about to call them out for staring, but instead she just keeps that stupid little smirk on her face, pushes her glasses back up, flips the folder open, and passes it over to Rio.</p><p>They're about to congratulate themself on keeping it together when Agnes leans in, shoulder pressing against Rio's in an entirely unnecessary way. Her hair is tickling their neck. She smells like lavender and Old Spice. They can't help it—they inhale sharply, and she glances coyly up at them before pointing at a photo in the folder. "That's my target."</p><p>All right, this is enough to tear Rio's mind away from how mind-bogglingly attractive Agnes is for a moment. "That's definitely our Jane Doe," they say. Their voice is rough, and they clear their throat self-consciously. "What can you tell me about her?"</p><p>"Samira Menière, 52. Born in Salem, Massachusetts, current resident of New York, New York. No partner, no children, many enemies," Agnes rattles off. "She's the founder and CEO of Vertigo. It's a fintech company. Something about AI-powered crypto trading."</p><p>Rio can't suppress an "ugh" and Agnes grins. Her face is very close to Rio's. "Figured we'd be on the same page about that one," she says. Rio's a little dazed by her roguish smile, but they make themself pay attention as her face goes serious. "Here's the weird thing, though. She has no associations with Westview. As far as I can tell from my research, she'd never even been here before yesterday."</p><p>"Wait, then how did you know she was here?" Rio asks, confused.</p><p>"That's the thing," Agnes says slowly. "I didn't. I'm living here right now while I work a different case. I hadn't gotten to the surveillance phase with Menière yet. But along with everyone else in town, I was rubbernecking yesterday at the bank. I took a peek inside and noticed the corpse looked a little bit like her. I got a hunch and decided to check it out."</p><p>"Lucky break," Rio says, just to have something to say.</p><p>Agnes takes a deep breath. "I don't know, Special Agent Vidal. This is a tiny town. It doesn't feel coincidental. I don't think bank robbery was the perpetrator's main goal yesterday. I think this was a hit."</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio rubs their hand over their face. "Murder does make more sense. The facts of the case don't add up if it was an actual bank robbery. The woman was shot after the perpetrator had the money—they could have just walked out the door. And they shot her right through the heart, which is highly unlikely for an accident. Whereas if the shooting were the <em>point</em>…" They run their fingers through their chin-length hair, then let their head fall back against the headrest. "I wanted this case to be simple," they groan.</p><p>"Sorry for complicating things," Agnes says wryly. Then, more softly, a little shyly: "Can I make it up to you?</p><p>Immediately, an image flashes into Rio's mind: Agnes on her knees in the footwell, mouth latched onto Rio's cock, their hands fisted in her hair as she looks up at them, blue eyes wide and wanting. Agnes doesn't notice the way Rio's thighs clench together, too busy closing the folder and tossing it into the back seat. "I'll buy you lunch," she continues.</p><p>"Oh, of course. Lunch. Yeah," Rio says, blinking hard to try and push the fantasy away. "Yeah, let's have lunch. Let me just…my car?" Apparently they've lost higher brain function. Excellent.</p><p>Agnes smiles like Rio's being charming and not completely useless. "You're here already. Let's just take my car. I'll drive you back here when we're done."</p><p>"Yeah, okay. Good. That sounds good." With how Rio's doing right now, they'd probably fall flat on their face walking to their car right now anyway.</p><p>"Cool," Agnes says, putting the car in drive. "I know a great burger place a couple miles down that way, in Eastview." As she points, Rio can't help but notice her fingers. They're long and slender, nails short and practical. Rio thinks they could probably take three of them right now, right off the bat, no problem. They're so busy thinking about having Agnes' fingers inside of them that it doesn't even occur to them to mention they're vegetarian until Agnes has already pulled into the parking lot in front of Burgerburg.</p><p>"Shit, sorry, I'm vegetarian," they say, feeling very stupid. "Probably should have mentioned that before you drove all the way here."</p><p>"Oh, they have Impossible Burgers. And a mushroom burger," Agnes says breezily, unbuckling her seatbelt. "And salad, I guess," she adds after a moment.</p><p>Rio laughs. "Don't worry, I'm not getting a <em>salad</em> at a burger place."</p><p>"Oh, thank God. That would have made you, like, five percent less attractive," Agnes says, hopping out of the car. Rio's face goes hot, and they're grateful for the cold wind as they get out of the car too. <em>That's got to be flirting, right?</em> Rio tries to remember if this is the type of thing colleagues say to each other, and settles on "probably not?"</p><p>As soon as Agnes opens the inner door of Burgerburg, Rio is startled out of their thoughts by a cry of "Agnes!" from behind the counter. A teenager is enthusiastically waving at her, his red apron and the grin on his face at odds with his smudged eyeliner and ripped black jeans.</p><p>Agnes sighs, sweeping her arm in his direction as she steps up to the counter. "This is Teen."</p><p>"Billy," he says, putting his hand out for Rio to shake. His eyes go wide as he sees the badge around their neck. "Holy shit! I mean, holy crap! Are you a Fed?"</p><p>Rio laughs, shaking his hand. "Yeah, I'm a Fed. Rio Vidal."</p><p>"<em>Special Agent</em> Rio Vidal," he breathes, eyes lighting up with excitement. "Wow. So cool to meet you. You're here to investigate the bank robbery, right?"</p><p>"Yup—" Rio starts, but they're interrupted by Agnes saying testily, "They're <em>here</em>, at Burgerburg, for a burger, Teen."</p><p>"Oh! Yeah, of course, sorry," Billy says, not sounding sorry at all. "What will you have, Special Agent?"</p><p>Rio ends up getting the mushroom burger, Agnes orders an Impossible Burger, and they get a large order of fries to share. Billy bustles into the back to prepare their food, and Agnes and Rio slide into opposite sides of a booth. The seats are shiny red vinyl, and Rio tries not to notice how wide Agnes spreads her legs as she sits. They can't stand manspreading, but they're very willing to forgive the same behavior from a hot woman.</p><p>"Sorry about Teen," Agnes says, rolling her eyes. "He wants to be a private detective when he grows up, so he's been obsessed with me since I got into town."</p><p>"Who can blame him? It would be easy to become obsessed with you," Rio says without thinking, mind still on all the things they could do with Agnes' legs spread that wide. Agnes actually <em>blushes</em> as she gives Rio a lopsided little smirk.</p><p>"Careful, Vidal," she says, her voice suddenly low. "Don't make any promises you can't keep."</p><p>That voice <em>does things</em> to Rio. They're poking their tongue into the side of their cheek, contemplating just how suggestive to make their next remark, when Billy places three paper-lined plastic baskets on the table and plops down next to Agnes, forcing her to scoot over and sit properly. He seems completely unaware of the dirty looks he's getting from both Agnes and Rio as he says, "This is so exciting. I mean, very sad, of course, given, you know." He lowers his voice to a stage whisper. "The body." His voice returns to its normal volume as he continues, "But everyone in Westview must be thrilled that there's finally as much drama as we've had in Eastview!" He takes a huge bite out of his burger.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. This kid is clearly not about to move, so she might as well make conversation. "What's been going on in Eastview?"</p><p>Agnes sighs and rolls her eyes again, stuffing about a dozen French fries in her mouth in one go as Billy gestures excitedly towards her. "That's why Agnes is in town! You know Jennifer Kale? The skinfluencer?" Rio shakes their head, gesturing vaguely to their face to say, <em>do I look like I know what a skinfluencer even is?</em></p><p>Billy is undaunted. If anything, he looks thrilled to get to explain. "Jennifer Kale is huge on YouTube and TikTok. She does skincare content and started her own line of products a few years back. She lives in Eastview, and that's where her brick-and-mortar store is. For a while, she was singlehandedly boosting Eastview's economy because of all the skincare girlies coming into town just to visit her store. But then…" He takes a dramatic bite out of his burger.</p><p>"But then people started reporting issues with her products," Agnes picks up. "Allergic reactions to ingredients that never should have been in her stuff, chemical burns, the works."</p><p>"The videos are horrifying," Billy says with equal parts disgust and relish, still chewing. "And there were so <em>many</em> of them. One weekend, Kale Kare had lines down the block. The next? Not a single customer."</p><p>"There's a lawyer who lives in Westview, Lilia Calderu," Agnes continues. She acts reluctant, but she's clearly getting into telling this story with Billy, trading off as if they've rehearsed it. "She's a real shark—specializes in class action lawsuits. She usually goes after huge businesses, but, well, she's an older lady who lives in the area. She was a big Kale Kare consumer. So it became personal. She brought me on to find plaintiffs and do research for a potential class action. Not my usual line of work, but I go where the work goes, and she offered to put me up in a <em>very</em> nice house. Lilia just filed suit a week ago."</p><p>"I've been helping Agnes with her research," Billy says proudly.</p><p>"No, you haven't," Agnes says with exaggerated disgust. "Letting you look over my shoulder while I sit in here with my laptop isn't 'helping me with my research,' Teen."</p><p>He ignores her. "I was the one who tipped her off about Alice."</p><p>Rio knows this is their cue, so they say dutifully, "Who's Alice?"</p><p>"Alice Wu-Gulliver is Jennifer Kale's attorney," Agnes says.</p><p>"<em>And</em> her girlfriend," Billy adds triumphantly. "Or situationship, at least. They're trying to keep it a secret, but I saw them making out behind the counter of Kale Kare a couple of weeks ago. And last week. And this week."
</p><p>"While you were watching like a creep," Agnes snarks, throwing her empty burger wrapper down on the table for emphasis.</p><p>It's cute, this kid detective-mentor thing Billy and Agnes have going on. As much as she might try to, Agnes can't hide her obvious fondness for him, and Rio can see why. He's enthusiastic and sweet, and totally immune to Agnes' attempts to push him away. They eat their (delicious) mushroom burger and watch, amused, as Billy and Agnes keep trading barbs until Agnes finally says, "Okay, break's over, Teen. Burgerburg isn't paying you to sit around, and Special Agent Vidal and I have to talk about our case. Shoo." She flaps her hands at him for emphasis.</p><p>"I can help!" Billy says pleadingly, turning to Rio. He clearly knows Agnes is going to say no.</p><p>Rio's already bending the rules by discussing the case with Agnes without clearing it. They're definitely not going to break them completely by divulging confidential information to a minor. "Sorry, Billy," they say. As his hopeful face falls, they add hurriedly, "Hey, but if we need backup, I know where to find you."</p><p>That mollifies him enough that he willingly gets up from his seat, taking the empty baskets with him.</p><p>"You're going to bring Teen on as backup?" Agnes asks, clearly suppressing a smile.</p><p>"He looked so sad!" Rio hisses. "I had to say something!"</p><p>"Aw, the big bad FBI agent is soft at heart," Agnes teases, but she says it like it's a good thing.</p><p>Rio looks down, keeping back a smile of their own. "I thought you said we had to talk about the case."</p><p>"All right, all right," Agnes relents. "So walk me through what you have so far."</p><p>"Basically nothing," Rio says. "All I had before you came along was a phone we haven't been able to get into yet, a bullet and casing that haven't been analyzed, blurry security camera footage, and wildly conflicting eyewitness testimony. You've given me a huge lead, so thank you." What they don't say is that they have no idea if any of Agnes' information is any good. They really hope it is.</p><p>"My big question right now is, what the hell was Menière doing in Westview? Do you know how she got here?" Agnes asks. There's a little furrow between her eyebrows and a fire in her eyes as she leans forward, intent on cracking the case. She's incredibly attractive like this.</p><p>Rio shakes their head. "Things move so slow around here. As far as I know, Westview PD is still working on collecting security camera footage from the other businesses on that street to see if we can get any more details on the victim or the perp. I was actually getting ready to call Detective Feltman for an update when <em>someone</em> accosted me outside the morgue."</p><p>"And are you sorry I did?" Agnes asks, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>"Not at all," Rio says, offering her a genuine smile. <em>Focus, Vidal.</em> "All right, you've got to tell me who your client is now. The one who wanted you to run down Menière. Isn't it most likely that they got sick of waiting for you to find her and decided to just kill her instead?"</p><p>Agnes shakes her head emphatically. "Absolutely not, and absolutely not. Dead people don't pay. And even if they did, I trust this client completely. I can say with 100 percent certainty that they didn't kill her."</p><p>"Okay, you can't be a <em>hundred</em> percent certain," Rio scoffs. Agnes gives them a stubborn look. "Fine, I won't push it—for now. Let me take a different tack, then. I'll see if I can get some people back in Newark to start working on getting access to Vertigo's records. We can pull a list of people who have traded through them and live in the area. I also need to run her phone, the bullet, and the casing back to our lab, and go home and pack more stuff. I have a feeling I'm going to be here for a lot longer than I wanted to be."</p><p>"Would it be so bad, being stuck in Westview?" Agnes asks, leaning forward, voice low again.</p><p><em>Not with you around</em>, Rio wants to flirt. Instead, they take a deep breath and say, "While I'm gone, do you think you can ask around, see if anyone saw her yesterday before she went to the bank?</p><p>Agnes sits back, looking a little disappointed. "Of course."</p><p>The drive back to the hospital is quiet and awkward, and Rio kicks themself the entire time for ruining the mood. "Um, thanks for the ride back," they say haltingly as Agnes pulls into the parking lot. "Let me give you my number? For—for talking about the case," they hurry to add.</p><p>And it seems that their protesting too much is somehow reassuring to Agnes, because her eyes crinkle up as she unlocks her phone, passing it over to Rio.</p><hr/><p>The whole time Rio is driving back to the hotel to get their stuff and check out, and to the police station to pick up the bullet and casing, and back to Newark, they're thinking about Agnes. They imagine variation after variation of what her throaty voice might sound like crying out in pleasure or—they clench their thighs together—<em>whimpering</em>. Over the course of 90 minutes, they have Agnes every which way in their mind's eye: sitting, standing, lying down, missionary, from behind, pulling her hair, marking her up…</p><p>When they pull into the FBI parking lot in Newark and get out of the car, they are absolutely humiliated to see that they've left a wet spot on the seat. "Fuck," they hiss. They're of course aware that they've got it bad for this woman they've only known for a few hours, but there's something about seeing the stark evidence right there in front of their eyes that really hammers it home.</p><p>Thankfully, Rio's coat makes it impossible for anyone to see that they've soaked through their pants, but the cold air still swirls around their legs and feels distinctly unpleasant as it literally chills them to their core. They drop off the evidence and make their requests as quickly as humanly possible, basically sprinting back to their car when they're done.</p><p>As soon as they get inside their apartment, they fall into bed, tugging their pants and underwear off before flopping down onto their stomach and  frantically opening the drawer of their nightstand. They turn on their trusty wand vibrator and grind their swollen cock up against its head, moaning loudly. <em>What is she doing to me?</em> they think. They clamp the vibrator between their legs, grinding against the bed as they push up onto their elbows, imagining Agnes below them, eyes rolling into the back of her head as Rio fucks her. <em>Would she let me choke her?</em> they wonder, and as soon as that image enters their mind, they come immediately, teeth clamped around their pillow as they buck against the bed.</p><p>It doesn't take the edge off. If anything, they're needier than ever. They get up on their knees, legs apart, and grind down on the wand in that position, imagining it's Agnes' face. They envision how her hair would look, wild against the pillow, a few pieces stuck to her face with sweat, the little muffled noises she would make as they used her mouth. <em>I want to make her fall apart</em>, they think feverishly. It's a little scary how hard that thought makes them pulse, and they rip their shirt and undershirt off, suddenly feeling hotter than ever. They roll their nipples between their fingers as their cock slides all over the head of the vibrator, amply lubricated with their arousal. "Take it," they whisper to an imaginary Agnes, feeling crazy with need. "Take it for Daddy."</p><p><em>Oh. Where the fuck did that come from?</em> is the last thought they have before they're falling towards the headboard, crying out as an orgasm plows through them. Their cock pulses over and over as they come, moaning helplessly into the pillows.</p><p>After a few long moments, the stimulation gets to be too much and Rio fumbles to turn the vibrator off. They toss it aside and roll over onto the other side of the bed, panting as they throw an arm over their eyes. The old Catholic guilt comes washing over them in a wave as the pleasure recedes.</p><p><em>You're a fucking pervert</em>, they think as they haul themself out of bed and into the shower. Even as they berate themself (<em>Daddy? Really?</em>), there's another part of their brain imagining what Agnes would look like in the shower, long fingers trailing over her breasts, hot water running down her body in rivulets.</p><p>It's hopeless. Rio's always been a sucker for a competent woman with swagger, but even they haven't gone quite this crazy since they first started testosterone in their late 20s.</p><p>If things keep going on like this, it's going to be a long investigation.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>All day on Sunday, Rio alternates between puttering around their apartment and sitting on their couch staring at their phone, deciding whether or not to text Agnes—and if they do text her, what exactly to say.</p><p>If they were being honest, they'd say something unhinged, like <em>I haven't been able to stop thinking about you</em>. But they don't want to swing too far in the other direction and text her about work, either. Or maybe it would be best to hold off entirely.</p><p>They switch their laundry to the dryer and go back to their phone, opening up a new text to Agnes yet again. <em>Hi</em>, they type. Then they delete it.</p><p>This happens over and over, and by the time they're eating dinner, Rio's frustrated—with themself, mostly, for being north of 40 years old and still fretting over what to say to an attractive woman. In a fit of decisiveness, they pick up the phone, type <em>I'll be back in town tomorrow morning</em>, and hit send. Then, mildly horrified at what they've just done, they immediately lock their phone and throw it down on the couch. The screen lights up as it buzzes immediately. Rio picks up the phone as quickly as they threw it down.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>7:33 pm</em><br/>
i have a deposition all day tomorrow. want to get dinner after?</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio absolutely <em>does not</em> fall backwards on the couch and do several little fist pumps before bringing their phone back up. They rewrite their reply three times before gritting their teeth and just sending it. If they sound thirsty, so be it.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>7:36 pm</em><br/>
Yes, I'd love to! Looking forward to seeing you. Just tell me when and where.</p>
</blockquote><p>Apparently, their worry about being overenthusiastic was misplaced.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>7:37 pm</em><br/>
im going to assume youre actually excited and just texting like that because youre old<br/>
where are you stayign? i can come get you around 7<br/>
i hope you like pizza. 90% of the options around here are pizza places</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>7:39 pm</em><br/>
I'm sorry I know how to use proper grammar and punctuation 😜 I'm staying at the Hampton Inn. A ride would be great. Does anyone not like pizza??</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>7:41 pm</em><br/>
i know how to use proper grammar and punctuation, i just choose not to<br/>
anyway YES ive been on dates with multiple people who dont like pizza!!!!!</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio hesitates before replying, heart racing. They're pretty sure they have the right read on the situation, and they have more courage over text than in person, so they take a deep breath and type very quickly, eyes half-closed so they don't have to fully look at the screen.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>7:44 pm</em><br/>
Is tomorrow night a date?</p>
</blockquote><p>They lock their phone and toss it aside again before groaning into their hands. They're <em>giddy</em>. Forty-two years old and acting this foolish over someone they've barely known for a day. They peek through their fingers at the phone, willing it to buzz again.</p><p>They wait. And wait some more.</p><p>No reply.</p><p>"Fuck," they groan out loud before jumping up from the couch. They try to distract themself by doing dishes and cleaning up the kitchen, but they pick up their phone every couple of minutes to check it.</p><p>Finally, when they're about to give in and text Agnes saying <em>Never mind</em>, a message comes in.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>7:57 pm</em><br/>
do you want it to be?</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio's nerves are so strung out now that, fuck it, they go ahead and just say <em>Yes.</em> They don't have to wait long for a response this time.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>7:59 pm</em><br/>
OH THANK FUCK I WAS REALLY WORRIED YOU WERE GOING TO SAY NO<br/>
which wouldve been very embarrassing<br/>
whew ok cool see you tomorrow then</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio feels a huge, silly grin spreading across their face, and they're not even mad about it.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>8:00 pm</em><br/>
See you tomorrow. Good luck with your deposition!</p>
</blockquote><p>With a spring in their step, Rio sets to work packing their duffel bag for the week: undershirts, boxer briefs, socks, dress shirts, slacks, and two sets of workout clothes they're almost certain they're not going to use. They bite their lip for a second, thinking, and grab their vibrator from the nightstand where it's charging. That goes into the duffel as well, along with a couple of other choice items from Rio's bedside. If they're going on a date, they're going to be prepared.</p><hr/><p>The next day, Rio's day is too packed to give them any time to ruminate, which is probably for the best.</p><p>As soon as they get to Westview in the late morning, they're pulled into a meeting with Detective Feltman and the police chief, Phil Jones.</p><p>"Do you know Agnes O'Connor, the private investigator? Been in town for a few months?" Rio asks.</p><p>"Uh, yeah," Chief Jones says, looking nervous. "We—we've helped her out with a few records requests."</p><p>"What the Chief means is that she wanted access to privileged information and successfully bullied him into giving it to her," Detective Feltman clarifies. "She told him to—"</p><p>"Special Agent Vidal doesn't need to know that!" Chief Jones protests in vain.</p><p>"—eat her ass," the detective finishes with a grin.</p><p>Rio laughs. They suppose they should count themself lucky that Agnes likes them. "Do you trust her, though? Do you think her intel is good? She gave me a lead that could be very promising, but obviously I need to verify it first."</p><p>"Oh, absolutely," Detective Feltman says, sparing Chief Jones from having to answer. "She might be terrifying, but she does good work. She was out in Southern California before this. Called up a buddy of mine in Huntington Beach to check up on her bona fides. He told me she's legit, helped them take down a scammer who was raising money from pretending to have cancer."</p><p>"Okay, that's reassuring," Rio says. "She ID'd the body. I want some corroborating evidence before we go hard on pursuing this lead, but she showed me a picture and it looks a hell of a lot like our Jane Doe."</p><p>Both Westview cops look impressed, then a little sheepish. "Wow," Chief Jones says. "I guess it makes sense. A PI who's been all over the place like her probably has more experience than a couple of guys who haven't ever left Jersey."</p><p>"Hey, I've been to Pennsylvania," Detective Feltman protests.</p><p>Rio cuts in. "Any matches from running the Jane Doe's DNA or prints?"</p><p>The detective shakes his head sadly. "No hits. Whoever our lady was, she didn't have a record. I have a guy getting and combing through the surveillance footage from the nearby businesses. Either she drove here, and there's a car we can search for evidence, or she took the train and we can follow that lead. But in the meantime, her phone's probably your best bet for getting more info to back up whatever intel Ms. O'Connor gave you."</p><p>After a little more discussion, the chief kindly sets Rio up in an empty office. "We don't have a deputy chief right now," he says by way of explanation.</p><p>Rio gets their laptop out and starts checking on the various requests they have out, sending a couple of pointed emails to try and hurry the ballistics and cyber analysis teams along.</p><p>They're about to start doing some research of their own into Samira Menière when they get a new email from the cyber analysis team. Scanning through the basic details, Rio feels their heart rate pick up as they see that the phone's name is "Samira's iPhone." The email accounts present on the phone provide proof beyond doubt: <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0675676b6f7467286b63686f63746346616b676f6a2865696b" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a> and <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e182848ea19784939588868ecf84998289808f8684" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>. Rio feels comfortable saying the Jane Doe is definitely Samira Menière, CEO of Vertigo.</p><p>They scroll through Menière's recent emails, but can't find anything to explain why she would be in Westview. They get excited for a second when they look at her calendar and see an appointment for noon this past Friday, only to deflate with disappointment when the calendar item is just called "First Bank of Westview," no further details.</p><p>It's when they start going through her texts that they strike gold.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Unknown number</strong><br/>
<em>last Monday • 9:02 am</em><br/>
First Bank of Westview, 12 pm Friday.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Samira Menière</strong><br/>
<em>last Monday • 10:31 am</em><br/>
Received.</p>
</blockquote><p>If Agnes is right, whoever this unknown number belongs to lured Menière to Westview to kill her. Now Rio just has to figure out who it is—and preferably <em>why</em>.</p><p>After updating the chief and detective on the victim's identity, Rio puts in a request for the cyber analysis team to trace the unknown number, then spends the rest of the afternoon coming through the data from Menière's phone.</p><p>By the end of the workday, two things are very clear to Rio:</p><ol><li>The mysterious text exchange is the only thing that explains Menière's presence in Westview.</li>
<li>Vertigo, Samira Menière's supposed "crypto exchange," is definitely a grift.</li></ol><p>They make a couple of calls to the teams at the Department of Justice and Secret Service that handle crypto scams before calling it a day, elated by the confirmation that the victim is indeed Samira Menière. Their entire spine pops like a string of firecrackers when they stand up from the flimsy little desk chair, making them they've been hunched over their laptop for five hours straight.</p><p>They walk out to their car slowly, stretching every limb out as they go. About halfway across the parking lot, they notice a piece of paper under their windshield wiper. <em>There's no way the cops ticketed me for parking in their own lot, is there?</em> But when they get closer, it becomes clear that it's not a ticket. It looks like a torn-off piece of a brown paper grocery bag.</p><p>On it, scrawled in black marker, are the words "BE CAREFUL."</p><p>Rio frowns at it, then gets into their car and retrieves an empty folder and a tissue. Using the tissue, they pluck the piece of paper from the windshield and put it into the folder, which goes back into their bag. Maybe it's nothing—but maybe it's crucial evidence. Either way, they're not doing any further investigation tonight. Tonight, they have plans.</p><hr/><p>Rio is a decorated FBI agent. They're excellent at their job, they've been doing it for a long time, and they're utterly secure in their ability. However. Rio has one major weakness, and it's that they go a little bit insane when they're into someone. They largely avoid this by limiting their interactions and dating very rarely. Once in a while, they'll hook up with someone to take the edge off, but they're generally satisfied with their life as it stands.</p><p>Unfortunately, Agnes O'Connor has come in and thoroughly shaken things up. Rio can't remember the last time they were all-consumingly attracted to someone like this, and now that they know Agnes is at least somewhat interested too, there's an animal, primal part of their mind that's starting to take over. Gone are the nerves, gone (for now, at least) is the murder investigation—tonight, Rio's mind is laser-focused on Agnes.</p><p>They take their time showering before going back to their bag, ready to get dressed. They're <em>excited</em>. Then they realize that in their packing frenzy last night, they only packed work clothes, not anything date-worthy. Eyes narrowed, they dig through the bag, trying to come up with a game plan.</p><p>When they're done, they look in the mirror and smirk at themself. They look hot, and they know it. They're wearing a white dress shirt with no undershirt and three buttons undone, their nipples obvious through the fabric. The front of their black slacks bulges as their pack-and-play packer strains against the zipper. The jockstrap harness holding the packer is the only underwear Rio is wearing, and they know these pants are going to be ruined by the end of the night. It'll be worth it.</p><p>After pulling their coat on, they're downstairs by 6:50, and they grin as they see Agnes' car already waiting at the curb. "Someone was eager," they say as they get in.</p><p>"Says the person who's ten minutes early," Agnes counters. Rio's attempt to think up a comeback stalls out as they get a good look at Agnes. She's clearly come straight from her deposition: she's wearing a light blue dress shirt and soft oatmeal-colored sweater under a gray suit and the ever-present navy trenchcoat. Her hair falls in unruly waves around her face, which is presently very smug as she takes in Rio's reaction to her outfit. "See something you like?" she teases.</p><p>"Don't fish for compliments," Rio says mock-sternly. Agnes seems to like it, though: her pupils go dark and she swallows hard. Rio puts a knuckle under Agnes' chin. "But yes. I do see something I like. Handsome." They lean back with a smirk, putting their seatbelt on. "So. Pizza?"</p><p>Agnes shakes her head a little. "Pizza," she says weakly, starting the car. Rio can't help but chuckle.</p><p>They'd had a passing thought as they got in the car that they should update Agnes on the case on the way to dinner, but it's so much more fun to flirt with her. The thrill of the chase has Rio in its grip. "Seems like you liked me reprimanding you," they say casually, putting an elbow on the door and watching her reaction.</p><p>She makes a sort of strangled noise. "Don't know what you're talking about," she eventually manages.</p><p>"Don't lie to me," Rio snaps, and Agnes bites her lip. Her cheeks are pink and her chest is rising and falling fast. Rio grins ferally. "Yeah, that's what I thought."</p><p>"You're going to make me crash this fucking car," Agnes says, sounding slightly hysterical. It's astounding how the brash, ballsy private investigator <em>melts</em> from a little scolding.</p><p>"Oh, but what a way to go," Rio laughs. They're thoroughly enjoying themself, and they haven't even gotten to the restaurant yet. Still, for the remaining three minutes of the drive, they back off on the suggestive comments just in case Agnes is serious about getting so turned on she gets into a car accident.</p><p>The pizza place is very cute, with just a handful of tables and a wood-fire oven behind the bar. Rio's forgotten about their outfit by this point, so when they get to the table and take their coat off, it takes them a second to remember why Agnes is staring. "See something you like?" they quip.</p><p>Agnes doesn't even have a clever comment. She just nods slowly, tongue tracing slowly over her lips as her eyes track down Rio's open collar and the shadow of their nipples under their shirt. Her mouth falls open a little as she looks further down and sees Rio's bulge. She sits down hard in her chair, putting her face in her hands. "You are…very attractive, Special Agent Vidal," she says, voice muffled by her palms.</p><p>Rio takes their seat, laughing. There's nothing like the rush of the pursuit, this specific aroused glee that they haven't felt in a very long time. "We're on a date. I think you can call me Rio," they say. "Or…other things. If you want." The echo of their own voice the other night, growling <em>Take it for Daddy</em>, comes unbidden into their mind, and they feel their ears go hot.</p><p>Agnes uncovers her face. "Yeah?" she says, voice husky, eyes intent. "Like what?"</p><p>Before Rio can answer, a server appears by their table. "Hi, I'm Bev," she says cheerfully and obliviously. "Can I get you two started with some drinks?"</p><p>Rio takes a deep, grounding breath before ordering an Italian soda. Agnes follows suit and, the mood termporarily killed, their conversation turns to pizza toppings as the server walks away.</p><p>After remarkably little debate, they end up deciding to split an olive, arugula, and pineapple pizza. "I knew I liked you," Agnes says, and Rio's heart leaps a little. "You're pretty good at the whole 'serious FBI agent' schtick, but you have to be truly unhinged to like this combo."</p><p>The conversation flows easily from there. Agnes shares wild tales from investigations she's done all over the country, and Rio pulls out the two or three actually interesting stories they have from their tenure at the FBI. Rio hears Agnes laugh in earnest for the first time, a wild almost-cackle they want to draw out of her over and over again. They smile more than they have in a long while.</p><p>Before they know it, the pizza has been reduced to crumbs. Agnes pokes her tongue out, tracing it slowly over her finger, which has a spot of sauce on it. She looks Rio right in the eye as she swirls her tongue around the tip of her finger, then takes the whole thing into her mouth and <em>sucks</em>. Still staring, Rio flags the server down.</p><p>"Check, please," they say hoarsely.</p>

<p>"My place?" Agnes asks breathlessly as they speedwalk to the car.</p><p>"Yes," Rio agrees. There's a wild animal within Rio salivating and pulling at its chains, ready to shove Agnes up against the car and shove their hand down her pants. But an even larger part of them wants to slowly peel all those layers off of Agnes, slowly take her apart, and make her beg. They can force themself to be patient. To a point.</p><p>Which is why they don't complain when Agnes drives home terrifyingly fast. Fewer than 15 minutes later, they're pulling into the driveway of a decently-sized house. "Nice digs," Rio comments.</p><p>"It's even nicer inside," Agnes says, getting out of the car.</p><p>"You don't need to entice me into coming in," Rio grins as they jump out of the car and nearly run to keep up with Agnes. "I'm plenty motivated already."</p><p>"Good," Agnes replies as she walks up to the door and unlocks it.</p><p>Stepping through the door, Rio has to admit it <em>is</em> very nice inside, if a little old-fashioned—lots of wallpaper and wooden paneling. That's all they have the chance to see before Agnes turns around and pushes them up against the door, kissing them hard as she uses both of their body weights to slam the door shut.</p><p><em>Very cute.</em> Rio pushes hard against Agnes' shoulders and she stumbles backwards. "Now, now," they say, grabbing her lapels, "I think we both know that's not how this plays out." Without waiting for a response, they push her up against the nearest wall, kissing her on their terms, nipping at her lower lip. She moans quietly and Rio licks into her mouth, marking every new square inch as theirs. Letting go of her jacket, they press their entire body up against hers, letting her feel their packer against her leg.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," she gasps against their lips.</p><p>"That's the idea," Rio murmurs. They run their fingers through her hair, winding some around their hand and pulling her head back with it. She makes a broken little noise. "Where's the bedroom?" Rio demands, tugging her hair a little bit for emphasis.</p><p>They ease off to let Agnes slip out and start taking the stairs two at a time. Finally, <em>finally</em>, they reach the bedroom, and Rio gets to undress her top half. They slide the blazer down Agnes' arms, peel the sweater off her, slowly pop the buttons of her shirt, shove the sports bra up to expose her tits. They throw each layer haphazardly on the floor until her entire upper body is revealed to them in all its glory.</p><p>Rio wants to devour Agnes. As they graze their fingers over her nipples, run their hands all over her back and torso, they're almost dizzy with how much they<em> want</em> in this moment, a wholly unfamiliar feeling that's making their thinking hazy. Not so hazy that they care to ignore basic gun safety, though. Tapping Agnes' waist, right above the small pistol secured in an inside-the-waistband holster, they order, "Put your weapon away."</p><p>She grimaces, clearly resenting the interruption, but obeys without complaint. Rio watches hungrily as she expertly secures the pistol in a gun box on her nightstand, then sets the holster on top. They have a thing for women who know their way around a gun.</p><p>"Happy?" Agnes asks in a low voice, sauntering back to Rio. Before they can answer, she unbuckles their belt and starts fiddling with their fly. Their packer springs free as she eases the zipper down, and she groans, dropping to her knees.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," Rio says. "One second. I should probably follow my own advice." They quickly shuck their blazer, unholster their gun, and eject the magazine, putting both gun and magazine on Agnes' dresser—out of the way, but still within easy reach in the unlikely event they need it tonight. Once they've removed their holster as well, they're ready to get back to it: they reach into their pants pocket and pull out the rod that goes into their pack-and-play toy to make it erect.</p><p>As Agnes watches, the blue of her eyes reduced to a ring around her pupils, Rio pulls the front of their harness forward and slides the rod into the back of the packer. As they insert it, the packer stiffens and juts out, brushing against Agnes' lips. Rio can feel their actual cock swelling behind the packer in tandem.</p><p>Before Rio can say anything, Agnes has lunged forward, taking the entire packer in one go, letting it hit the back of her throat with a choked-off moan.</p><p>Oh, they can't have her taking control.</p><p>Rio pats her face firmly—not quite a slap, but not a caress either. "Did I tell you to start sucking me off?" they ask sternly. Their own voice sounds almost distant to them, blood roaring in their ears as their muscles coil and tense, ready to pounce on their prey.</p><p>Agnes lets the packer out of her mouth with a pop. "I thought it was clear from context," she says, eyes too wide, too innocent.</p><p>With supreme control, Rio places their hand around her throat, squeezing very gently, testing the waters. Her eyes flutter shut and she whimpers quietly. They want to hear that noise again and again. "Here's how this goes," Rio says, breathing heavy, almost shaking from how ready they are for this. "You follow orders. And if you're good—"</p><p>
<em>Fuck it.</em>
</p><p>"If you're good for daddy," they growl, "I'll fuck your face and that sopping wet, needy hole of yours."</p><p>Agnes, the fucking brat, blinks up at Rio from her knees. "And if I'm bad?" Her tongue traces over the tip of their packer. "Daddy?"</p><p>Rio gasps sharply, pulsing against the back of the packer. One word and they're almost undone. They have to stay in control. "You are fucking infuriating," they say in a low voice. "Get up." They encourage her by keeping their hand on her throat, putting a little upward pressure on it. When she's standing, they finally spring into action like they've been wanting to do for the last few painfully long minutes.</p><p>The pent-up energy resolves into a blur of motion: Rio grabs Agnes by the upper arms and spins her around, pressing their whole body up against her as they forcibly walk her to the bed. With a shove that's just this side of too hard, Rio uses their entire body to bend her over the bed, draping their body over hers. Agnes wriggles ineffectually, a little whine escaping her throat. They brush her hair to one side none too gently, then take both her wrists in one hand and pin them down above her head.</p><p>"What do you <em>think</em> happens if you're bad?" Rio says right into her ear, voice low and menacing.</p><p>Agnes' hips thrust gently but rhythmically against the bed as she pants. "Well," she says coyly. There's a long, long pause before she says, "I sure wouldn't want a spanking."</p><p>Rio is thrilled and a little relieved. They've thought more than once about bending the private investigator over, imagined a dozen ways she might respond. Now that they're in the moment, it feels even better than they thought it would. They scrape their teeth along her ear, eliciting another little noise.</p><p>"No? You sure?" they murmur. "You sure it's not something you've imagined?" Agnes lets out an embarrassed little moan, and Rio smirks. <em>Bingo.</em> "Tell me what happens when I give you this spanking you've never imagined and don't want," they continue before starting to kiss down her neck.</p><p>"Um," Agnes says, wiggling her ass against Rio's packer, trying surreptitiously to put some pressure where she wants it most.</p><p>They back up, putting some distance between their bodies but keeping Agnes' wrists pinned. "Keep that up and see what happens," they warn. They don't actually have anything in mind, but the threat seems to work.</p><p>"...a lot of different ways," Agnes says, partially muffled by the blankets.</p><p>"Speak up," Rio orders sharply.</p><p>Agnes makes an adorable little noise of frustration before obeying anyway. "I've thought about you spanking me a lot of different ways, okay?" she says loudly.</p><p>"See, was that so hard?" Rio asks condescendingly, rewarding Agnes by pressing back up against her. "Tell me one fantasy."</p><p>Agnes squeezes her eyes shut and doesn't say anything.</p><p>Rio gives her earlobe a hard nip. "You don't tell me, I don't spank you and I instead punish you by not letting you come tonight," they snap.</p><p>That does it. Agnes starts talking very fast. "You tell me to beg you to fuck me. I refuse," she gasps. "You—you pick me up and throw me over your lap and start whaling on me. I squirm and kick and try to stop you, and you immobilize me so I just have to—" another gasp "—I just have to <em>take it</em>. You keep telling me it'll stop if I just beg. I keep refusing. I don't give in until you make me cry."</p><p>Rio lets go of Agnes and stands back. They're pretty sure all their blood is in their cock now. They're dizzy, they're buzzing down to their fingertips, so ready to give this ridiculously hot woman what she wants. "Wow," they breathe.</p><p>She completely misinterprets their meaning. "I know, I knooow," she says into the comforter. "I'm such a fucking pervert."</p><p>Rio can't help it. They laugh out loud. Agnes rolls over to face them, incredulous. "Are you <em>laughing </em>at me?" She actually looks hurt.</p><p>"Sorry, I'm sorry," Rio says, hands on their knees, trying to get control of themself. "I'm laughing because that's not what I meant at all. Fuck. I was saying 'wow' because that's <em>exactly what I want to do to you</em>." Before she can react, they pounce again, caging her between their body and the bed. "So beg me, Agnes. Beg for my cock."</p><p>The hurt vanishes in an instant, replaced by a suppressed grin. Agnes rolls her tongue around inside her mouth, then: "Make me," she says, overemphasizing every consonant.</p><p>It's a joy to not have to hold back anymore. Rio has Agnes' pants unbuttoned, unzipped, and pulled down in a matter of seconds. Letting the fine wool dress pants tangle around her ankles (they'll happily pay for dry cleaning later), they haul her upright, sit down on the bed, and then kick her in the back of the knees so she falls face-down over their lap. A couple more tugs and her boxer briefs are down around her ankles too, a thin string of wetness connecting her cunt to the gusset of her underwear.</p><p>Rio picks it up with their fingers, then smears it against Agnes' perky, round ass. "Filthy," they spit. "You're really trying to tell me you're this wet and you don't want me to rail you?" Agnes doesn't say anything, just makes like she's trying to swim off Rio's lap, arms windmilling and legs kicking, getting her boxer briefs and pants even more tangled up than they already were. Time to get started.</p><p>With a loud smack—made louder by how slick their hand is—Rio brings their hand down on Agnes' ass. The pale skin immediately blooms pink and pretty. It makes Rio so hungry for more. They want her warm and red, blood rushing to the surface of her skin, alive and in pain and <em>loving it</em>. They lay down a matching handprint on the other cheek, then back to the first. Back, forth, back, forth, hitting a slightly different spot each time, so that after a minute or so, there's a rosy glow to Agnes' entire backside. With each blow, Agnes rolls to one side and then the other, acting like she's trying to avoid Rio's hand.</p><p>Rio pauses, rubbing their hand over the pinkened flesh. Through Agnes' parted thighs, they can see that she's dripping wet, getting her arousal all over the slacks they're still inexplicably wearing. "You've gotten my work pants all dirty," they spit, voice dripping with disdain. "Keep still before you spread your mess around." And they start up again, a little harder this time, not giving her a chance to answer back, following through each swing a little more so Agnes feels the vibrations from each spank in her core. She's making cute little grunts with each blow, clearly trying and failing to keep them back.</p><p>Rio shifts around on the bed between each blow, trying to get comfortable. They're being completely hypocritical about Agnes leaking all over their leg: they're not doing much better, and these pants might just need to be thrown out after tonight. They're flying high, fully suffused with the sheer joy of giving Agnes this dominance, this pain, this pleasure.</p><p>She fails to stay in place—Rio knew she would—so after another dozen or so, they lock their left arm around her waist and pull her in close, then swing their right leg up and over to put her in a leg lock. "I said. <em>Keep. Still</em>," they chide, emphasizing the last two words with sharp slaps to the tender skin at the tops of her thighs. Agnes fully yelps at those, an offended noise that Rio really finds very endearing. "Ready to beg yet?" they ask, lightly running their nails along her hot, pink skin.</p><p>Agnes shakes her head hard, mussing her hair even more. "You've barely touched me," she scoffs, her breathlessness giving away just how affected she is. Well, that and the copious wetness that continues to smear all over her inner thighs and Rio's pants.</p><p>"Oh, I was hoping you would say that," Rio says with a smile. <em>How did I get so lucky? </em>they think. They're used to partners who like a couple giggly little slaps on the ass, but people who actually want a full-on spanking that <em>hurts</em>, who get off on the pain, are few and far between. And if Agnes wants a real walloping, who is Rio to deny her? If it makes them so hard it's painful, that's just an added bonus.</p><p>A sadistic little thrill goes through them as they raise their right arm all the way, then bring it down with all their strength. "Ow! Fuck!" Agnes yells, startled. Rio does the same thing on a different spot, and again, and again. Agnes keeps trying to wriggle, to kick her legs, but Rio's got her clamped down tight. Finally, after Rio's hand catches the top of her thigh again, she throws a hand back to try and shield herself.</p><p>Rio's ready for this, was prepared for this—was <em>hoping</em> for this. Their left hand darts out to grab her wrist, easily pinning it to the small of her back. "If you want me to stop, all you have to do is beg," they say teasingly, echoing the fantasy she just shared. Agnes' only response is to struggle some more, trying to get her wrist out of Rio's firm grip. "Okay," Rio says, raising their hand again. "Your call."</p><p>Agnes' skin is blotchy now, still rosy in some spots, but a darker pink in others. Rio focuses this time on evening the color out, working on one spot until it looks about right, then moving onto the next, and so on. All the while, Agnes keeps up a steady stream of grunts, whines, and moans, her voice the only outlet for the pain now that she's unable to writhe over Rio's lap like she wants to. Rio's wriggling around a little bit themself, semi-grinding into the bed to take the edge off the agonizing arousal.</p><p>Once the color is even all over, Rio decides it's time to take things to the next stage. Without warning, they raise their arm high again, crashing their hand down on Agnes' upper thigh. "Fuck!" she yells. "Fuck!"</p><p>"That's right, Agnes. That's what I want you to beg me to do," Rio says calmly, their tone of voice masking their giddiness and totally at odds with the next brutal spank they administer to Agnes' other thigh. They keep this up, hard and slow, as Agnes' cries grow more colorful and high-pitched.</p><p>"You rat bastard! Fucking <em>sadist</em>!" she shrieks—and then her voice cracks on the next yelp and she lets out a little sob.</p><p>Right away, Rio eases up significantly, switching to not much more than firm pats. It's only now that they notice their hand is <em>sore</em>. Agnes sniffles, panting. "Can I have my hand back?" she asks meekly. Rio lets her wrist go, and she shoves her hair out of her face, wiping at her eyes. "Holy shit," she whispers. "Holy shit, holy shit, that was so <em>good</em>."</p><p>"It really was," Rio says, their voice husky and raw. They're more animal than human right now, a being of pure instinct and need. They rub and knead Agnes' ass for a while, then let their hand slip between her thighs and can't help but moan. "You're literally wet down to your knees," they say in awe.</p><p>"<em>Please</em> fuck me," Agnes says, unprompted. "Please, please, please, please, please put that cock inside me and pound me."</p><p>Rio is beyond ready to do just that, but they want one more thing from her first. Need it. "Please, <em>who</em>?" they ask, grabbing the back of her neck.</p><p>"<em>Please, Daddy</em>," she keens, and Rio hums in approval, a rumble deep in their chest.</p><p>"Get on your knees," they order, pushing her lightly. "Since you were so eager to have my cock in your mouth earlier, you can take it there first before I fuck you."</p><p>As Agnes kneels on the floor and looks up, Rio gets their first good look at her face in a good few minutes. She's flushed and sweaty and looks floaty, almost dazed. She gently runs her hands over her ass and closes her eyes, a serene little smile crossing her face. "Thank you," she murmurs.</p><p>"So polite right after you've been disciplined," Rio coos as they finally, <em>finally</em> take off their pants. They unbutton their shirt but leave it on. "I'm going to fuck your face now," they add casually.</p><p>Agnes lunges forward with her mouth and positively <em>devours</em> Rio's packer, enthusiastically bobbing her head up and down on it, letting it hit the back of her throat over and over. She's moaning and whimpering, channeling all of her pent-up desire into giving truly magnificent head.</p><p>This is good—so good—but Rio is beyond ready to be inside Agnes. They tell her as much, and stifle a laugh as she springs up and clambers onto the bed, getting on her elbows and knees and wiggling her ass enticingly. She turns and says, "Please fuck me, Daddy," eyes wide and voice breathy.</p><p>"Fuck, how are you so <em>perfect</em>?" Rio growls as they practically leap on top of her. They turn their packer so it's at the right angle and slowly guide it into Agnes' cunt. They both moan as Rio bottoms out. Rio luxuriates for just a moment before they grab hard at Agnes' hips and start to fuck her in earnest. They rock her back and forth, snapping their hips to meet hers with every thrust. Agnes keeps up a string of what Rio is pretty sure is nonsense—all they can hear is a lot of "ohhhhh, fuck" interspersed with "yesyesyesyesyes" and the occasional whimpered "please."</p><p>Rio is so worked up. They can't come from just rubbing up against their packer—not for a lack of trying—and in pleasuring Agnes, they're effectively edging themself. They want to make this good for Agnes, but they also need her to come soon or they might go into cardiac arrest. They redouble their efforts, muscles aching, entire body dripping with sweat as they fuck Agnes even faster. "You going to come?" they ask, voice raspy. "You going to come for Daddy?"</p><p>"Can I? Can I <em>please</em>?" Agnes whines. "Need…need…my clit," she gasps.</p><p>"So good," Rio grunts. "So good for waiting. Go ahead, touch yourself."</p><p>She doesn't need to be told twice. The low moan Agnes lets out as her fingers make contact with her clit slowly crescendos. "Oh fuck, oh fuck," she groans. "Grab my ass. Please, grab my ass."</p><p>As soon as Rio does, she convulses with a scream, collapsing onto the bed. Rio follows her down, continuing to fuck her as she shudders her way through her orgasm, their bodies sticky with sweat.</p><p>When she stills, they don't stop. Rio is nothing right now but a cock and the muscles required to thrust it into Agnes and a pulsing knot of pure desire that's so, so close but can't quite get there. "Can you keep going for me?" they ask desperately, hips continuing to work.</p><p>"Ahh, I don't kn—" The word dissolves into a shriek as another orgasm hits her. She rolls her hips against her hand one, two, three more times before withdrawing it, almost flinging it aside, and sinking into the bed with a huff, boneless and limp.</p><p>Rio wants to linger in this moment forever, but they need to come just a little bit more. "You're so fucking hot," they say vehemently, pulling out. They peel the harness and shirt off their sweaty body with some effort, letting them fall somewhere on the floor. "I'm—I'm going to get myself off now, okay?" they gasp, lying down next to Agnes, palming themself and letting their cock slide against their hand. No friction whatsoever; they're beyond soaked.</p><p>"Nooooo," Agnes moans quietly. With great effort, she turns her head to face Rio, then weakly pushes herself up onto her elbows. "Let me."</p><p>"You can't move right now," Rio says incredulously, stroking their cock quickly between two fingers. "I'll take care of this, and then you can go down on me in the morning if you want."</p><p>An adorable little frown appears on Agnes' face. "No. Now," she says stubbornly, dragging herself along the bed to try and get between Rio's legs. "Oh my God, you're so <em>big</em>," she adds, gazing at Rio's T-enlarged cock like it's the most beautiful thing she's ever seen.</p><p>"Well, if you insist, I'm not going to stop you," Rio relents.</p><p>In a flash, Agnes has Rio's cock in her mouth and is swirling her tongue around it.</p><p>It turns out that their concerns about her having trouble engaging in too much activity right after orgasming  that hard are moot, because within a few <em>seconds</em>, Rio's coming hard, one hand in the sheets, the other in Agnes' hair as they yell wordlessly into the room. They buck up against her face, getting her chin completely wet, grinding against her tongue over and over until she's wrung every last possible drop of pleasure out of them.</p><p>They lie there for a moment: Rio supine, Agnes with her cheek pillowed on their thigh. They're both still, sweaty, silent, <em>sated</em>. Then Rio tugs gently at Agnes' hair. "C'mere," they say weakly.</p><p>With the last of her strength, Agnes drags herself up so that she's lying on their chest, and the two of them soften into each other. Rio turns their face into Agnes' hair and kisses the top of her head, feeling a rush of tenderness wash over them.</p><p>In that moment, there's no robbery, no murder, no creeping sense of danger and dread. There's no tension, no unsated desire, no uncertainty about whether Agnes wants them and if so, how she wants them. There's just Rio's pleasured body and Agnes' pleasured body, one right up against the other. It feels right.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio fully intended to debrief after such an intense session. They really did. But somehow, the next thing they know, a beam of sunlight is bypassing a crack in Agnes' curtains to nail them directly in the face. They make a disgruntled noise and try to roll over, only to realize that they're fully immobilized by Agnes' entire body weight on them. Her head is still pillowed on their shoulder and chest, an arm and a leg each sprawled over Rio's body. As Rio moves, she groans quietly.</p><p>"Good morning," Rio says quietly, running one hand down her hair and around her upper back.</p><p>"Mmmph," Agnes says, burying her face in the crook of Rio's neck.</p><p>Rio really wants to get up, or at least move so the sun isn't in their face anymore, but they don't have the heart to disturb Agnes, so they settle for throwing their other arm over their eyes and trying to fall back asleep.</p><p>The gambit surprisingly works, and the next time Rio wakes up, the sun has moved just enough that it's not at risk of damaging their vision anymore. Agnes, on the other hand, is in the exact same position, and Rio <em>really</em> has to pee. They slowly try to slide out from under Agnes, but she just grabs onto them tighter.</p><p>"I'm really sorry, but I have to get up," they murmur, softening the unwelcome news with a kiss to Agnes' temple. She grumbles but finally lets them go, rolling onto her other side with a huff and grabbing an armful of the comforter to cuddle. Rio smiles at the sight fondly before tearing themself away to find the bathroom.</p><p>Once they're there, they figure they might as well rinse off. They moan quietly as they step into the shower. The water here is <em>hot</em>, and the water pressure is much better than at Rio's own apartment. Agnes wasn't kidding when she said this was a nice house.</p><p>They're luxuriating in just letting the water run over them when they hear the shower curtain sliding against the curtain rod. They open their eyes to see Agnes poking her head through the curtain, hair an absolute mess, eyes bleary but ravenous. She's looking shamelessly at Rio's body, and the hungry beast within Rio, so fully satisfied last night, roars to life once again.</p><p>"Mind if I join you?" Agnes asks. Her voice is raspy after all the screaming she did last  night.</p><p>"Please," Rio replies.</p><p>Their fantasies of Agnes in the shower a few days ago have nothing on the real thing. Rio leans against the shower wall and just stares as Agnes arches her back, letting the water saturate her hair. They find themselves thinking that the curved lines of her body look like a work of art, and they make a little bit of a face. They don't know if they've ever been sappy about someone like this.</p><p>Their thoughts return to the present as Agnes straightens her body up and the hot water runs down her back and over her tender ass. "Ooh, ow," she says in delight as the hot water reignites the sore flesh.</p><p>"Let me see," Rio says, reaching out to turn her by the shoulders.</p><p>She obliges happily, popping her butt out cheekily, and Rio runs their hands gently over her ass and upper thighs. They're flushed a very light pink, but she likely won't feel anything by tonight. Too bad. Rio was hoping a little bit for a bruise or two. They bite their lip at the thought of going harder on her. Maybe with their belt. They feel a little growling pulse of arousal as they imagine it.</p><p>Agnes is clearly on the same train of thought as she cranes her neck to look. "I wanted <em>marks</em>," she pouts.</p><p>"I'll keep that in mind for next time," Rio says, pinching her ass.</p><p>Agnes gasps and looks up at them. "Awfully presumptuous of you to assume there's going to be a next time," she teases.</p><p>"Am I wrong?" they quip back. Rio feels pretty certain that Agnes at least wants the sex as much as they do, even if she doesn't share whatever unfamiliar mushy feelings they seem to be developing rapidly.</p><p>She grins and answers by reaching out to them, pulling them in for a deep kiss. They nudge their thigh between her legs, and she grinds eagerly against them. She drags her hot, slick cunt against their leg, moaning into their mouth. They kiss away from her mouth and down her jaw, scraping their teeth lightly against her neck.</p><p>Once they get to her collarbone, they bite down. Agnes yelps, "Fuck!" and thrusts her hips hard. Rio grins ferally around the skin trapped between their teeth, keeping the pressure hard as they slowly—very slowly—drag their teeth over her skin, feeling each subcutaneous layer as it slips away.</p><p>There's an angry red bruise on her chest now, bracketed on either side by tooth marks, and Rio has scarcely seen anything so erotic in their life. "There's a mark for you," they say, and they intend for it to sound cocky, but they're so turned on by the sight that it comes out breathless. They want to bite again and again, gnaw at her until she's irrefutably <em>theirs</em>.</p><p>Agnes is so far gone she's not even pretending to play it cool. "<em>Please</em> get inside me right now," she begs, grabbing blindly for Rio's hand.</p><p>She's so wet and open that they're able to slide two fingers in right away, and they immediately set a furious pace, an animalistic growl slipping out from between their gritted teeth. Agnes lets her forehead fall against their shoulder as she moans wordlessly.</p><p>"Look at me," Rio pants, slipping a third finger in. "Look at me and rub that greedy clit of yours until you come."</p><p>Agnes' head lolls back as she fixes her gaze on Rio and starts feverishly touching herself. She squeezes her eyes shut for half a second, and Rio immediately stops fucking her, using their free hand to tweak her nipple. She yelps and corrects course, opening her eyes almost comically wide.</p><p>"Yeah, that's right," Rio babbles, barely knowing what they're saying. "That's so good. Look how much you can take for me. Look how easy it is for me to fuck you. I bet I could put my whole hand in you sometime."</p><p>It's that last sentence that makes Agnes clench down hard around Rio's fingers, clawing into their upper arm as she holds on for dear life and whines, "Oh, <em>fuck</em>," through gritted teeth. She trembles through her orgasm, staring right into Rio's eyes the entire time.</p><p>"Attaboy," Rio drawls, and she lets out a choked little noise. They thrust once with the fingers that are still inside her, just to hear that delicious little whimper again, before withdrawing and rinsing their hand off in the spray.</p><p>Agnes just stands there, hand still on Rio's arm, mouth slightly open, eyes finally fluttering shut.</p><p>Rio leans in so their hot breath passes over her ear as they talk. "Now, we're in the shower to get clean, and your little display has gotten Daddy all messy. So be a good boy and clean me up."</p><p>She drops to her knees without a word, eyes glassy and dark. Rio can feel their own knees going weak before she's even touched them, and they support themself as best as they can, back braced on the shower wall and hand on the wall-mounted soap dish.</p><p>Agnes <em>starts</em> by plunging her tongue as far into Rio as she can. They groan as she licks up, up, up, until the tip of her tongue swirls around the head of their cock. Rio gets a rush of euphoria as Agnes sucks their cock between her lips, then starts bobbing her head like she's sucking a much bigger dick.</p><p>"So, so, so good," they grunt as they grab hold of her head. Impatient, they hold her in place and take their pleasure from her, grinding up against her tongue. All of the sensation is overwhelming: the roar of the running water, the tickle of the shower spray occasionally landing on them, the glorious sight of Agnes on her knees and dedicated to pleasure.</p><p>Before long, Rio's overwhelmed by it all and falls into a slow, rolling orgasm, the kind they feel from the top of their head right down to their toes, rapidly alternating hot and cold despite the constant warm water rushing next to them. Agnes works them through it, not stilling her tongue until they forcibly push her head back. "I love feeling you pulse in my mouth," she says with wonder—and they can't do anything but pull her right back in.</p><p>In the end, Agnes' talented tongue makes Rio come twice more before they get to the business of actually cleaning themselves. Rio rinses off for real, reluctantly stepping out of the shower and toweling off as Agnes washes herself.</p><p>"Hey, can I borrow some sweatpants or something?" they call from the bedroom as they survey the wreckage of last night. "I'd, uh, rather not put last night's slacks back on."</p><p>Agnes snorts. "<em>Someone</em> punished me for getting their pants dirty last night, so I <em>guess</em> lending them a pair is the least I can do," she says in an exaggeratedly aggrieved tone. "Feel free to grab anything else you need, too. Socks and underwear are in the first dresser drawer, shirts in the second, pants in the third."</p><p>The thought of wearing Agnes' underwear grabs Rio by the throat and won't let them go until they slide the drawer open and take out a pair of silky black boxer briefs. They pull them on, aroused beyond belief by the idea of having something so intimate of Agnes' right up against their cock. They're already getting wet again. Agnes is making them insatiable. Before they can get too distracted again, they pull on a black long-sleeved T-shirt and black joggers.</p><p>In the process of picking up all of their fallen clothes (and their packer), Rio finds their phone in the pocket of their work pants and realizes with a pang that they haven't so much as glanced at their phone since last night. They don't even know what time it is. They turn the phone screen on and are immediately seized with panic when they realize it's almost 11 am and they have over a dozen missed calls. Among the many notifications is a text from Detective Feltman that just says, <em>10 am briefing??</em></p><p>"Oh, shit, I gotta go," Rio says, rushing into the bathroom. "I apparently agreed to give a briefing to the Westview cops that started 47 minutes ago."</p><p>Agnes sticks her head out of the shower, hair slick with conditioner. "Damn, I was going to make you breakfast. And then maybe eat you out again."</p><p>The image of Rio lingering over breakfast with Agnes tugs at their heart (and the image of Agnes lingering between their legs tugs at their cock), but they're already unacceptably distracted and this is a murder investigation. "I'll take you up on both of those things soon," they promise instead. They lean in and kiss Agnes sweetly on the mouth, then turn away before they get drawn in again.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, they reload and holster their gun, then quickly gather up their things and wrap everything into a neat little bundle inside their shirt. Downstairs, they shoot Detective Feldman a vague excuse, then quickly put on their boots and coat before darting out into the chilly November air.</p><p>It's only once their's on the sidewalk that they realize they rode here with Agnes last night and very much don't have a way to get to the station. "Shit," they mutter, turning to walk back up to the house.</p><p>That's when they hear someone whisper, "Hey."</p><p>Rio looks around wildly. It's only on the second pass that they see a guy pressed up against the side of the house next door. He has wild eyes, a scraggly beard, and deeply unfortunate fashion sense: the hat on his head is a terrible combination of bucket hat and fedora. He beckons Rio over jerkily. They look at Agnes' house, then back at the guy, weighing their options. They want to just ignore him, but he looks a little unhinged and a lot like he doesn't know how to give up, so with an exasperated sigh, they stride over to him.</p><p>"Can I help you?" they ask a little coldly.</p><p>"Did you get my note?" the guy whispers, glancing around in every direction except directly at Rio.</p><p>Rio's about to say "what note?" when they remember the scrap of paper from the parking lot yesterday. "'Be careful'? Yeah, I got it. What am I being careful of, exactly?"</p><p>He shakes his head rapidly, eyes still darting around. "She's always listening. Always watching. I've already said too much." He scuttles sideways along the wall of the house until he gets to the side door and slips inside. Rio stands there, just staring, for a few seconds. Now their curiosity's piqued, and they have half a mind to go after him, but their phone buzzes right then and reminds them that they're trying to get to the briefing that was now supposed to have started—<em>fuck</em>—53 minutes ago.</p><p>They shake their head and finally go back to Agnes' door. When they knock, they're relieved to find that Agnes is out of the shower. "You missed me that much?" she asks with a raised eyebrow. She's only wearing a sports bra and boxer briefs and it takes all of Rio's willpower to keep their eyes on her face.</p><p><em>Well, yes</em>, they want to respond. "I don't have my car," is what they say instead. "Would you mind giving me a ride to my hotel?"</p><p>During the short drive, Rio relays what happened with the weird guy.</p><p>"Oh, that's Ralph," Agnes says, waving her hand dismissively. "He's…odd. It's wild that he even spoke to you. We haven't exchanged more than two words since I moved in months ago."</p><p>"Do you know his full name? I'll do some background research on him just in case," Rio says, getting their phone out.</p><p>"Yeah," Agnes snorts. "It's Ralph Bohner."</p><p>"<em>Boner</em>? Like B-O-N-E-R?" Rio asks incredulously.</p><p>"No, there's an H after the O. Why, you got boners on the mind for some reason?" Agnes asks sweetly.</p><p>Rio smirks. "Let me know when you're free over the next few days and I'll let you find out for yourself."</p><p>It's not until much later, when Rio's almost at the station, that they remember again that they meant to debrief last night with Agnes. <em>Oh well. Guess that means I'll have to see her again sooner rather than later.</em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Between their very long shower with Agnes, being driven back to their hotel, changing into work-appropriate clothing, and driving to the Westview police station, Rio ends up being more than an hour and a half late to what was supposed to be the 10 am briefing. They're made even later by Jimmy calling them as they're getting ready and chewing them out for being late.</p><p>Either because the Westview Police Department is extremely understaffed or because Rio was so late—it's not made clear to them which, but they're inclined to think the former—the only other people attending the briefing are Chief Jones and Detective Feltman. Neither seems particularly happy, which Rio can't blame them for.</p><p>"Look, Special Agent Vidal," the chief says, looking very tired and very nervous, "let's be honest with each other. This is your investigation. We're not trying to run it—we're the first to admit we don't have the relevant experience. But we are doing our best to help. We'd just like some basic respect as we continue to work this case together." He takes a deep breath when he's done and mops his sweaty brow with an actual handkerchief, as if he's been rehearsing this speech in his head since 10 am.</p><p><em>Oh God, he probably has.</em> Rio's face goes hot with embarrassment. One of the first things they learned as a rookie was not to piss off the local cops on joint investigations. They've been acting uncharacteristically foolish these last couple of days.</p><p>"I'm—very sorry," they say awkwardly. "I had something come up this morning and—well, it won't happen again."</p><p>The chief clears his throat and Detective Feltman scuffs his shoe against the floor, both clearly just as uncomfortable as Rio is. "Well!" the detective says, clapping his hands together a little too loudly. "Let's, uh, get to the briefing. What do you have for us?"</p><p>Grateful to be moved along, Rio fills the local cops in on the new information they have so far: the mysterious text messages, the questionable dealings of Menière's crypto exchange, and that it's looking more and more likely that the bank robbery was a front for murder. "Do you know if anyone in town is into crypto?" they ask. "Could be that a dissatisfied customer decided to take their anger out on the CEO."</p><p>The look Jones and Feltman exchange makes it pretty clear that both of them barely know what crypto is, let alone whether there's anyone in Westview who wants to make it as a Bitcoin mogul.</p><p>"Okay, no problem—I have my team back in Newark working on getting access to a list of their customers, so we can cross-reference that way once we get the list." Rio doesn't mention that it's probably going to take a week or more to get the names. "One other thing I wanted to ask you about, then—what do you all know about a Ralph Bohner?"</p><p>Jones and Feltman look at each other again and sigh. The chief gestures to Detective Feltman, prompting him to speak. "He…sure is something," the detective says, rubbing the back of his head. "We haven't had any official run-ins with him. It's just a small town, and people talk. Consensus is that he's weird but harmless."</p><p>"That was my vibe, but I wanted to check," Rio says, and goes on to explain the note they found on their windshield and their exchange with Ralph this morning.</p><p>"My gut instinct is undiagnosed schizophrenia, but who really knows?" Chief Jones says with a shrug. "Until he does something criminal or at least dangerous, we don't really have grounds to get more information on him."</p><p>"What's his background? What does he do for a living? And does he live with anyone? Have family in the area?" Rio presses.</p><p>"He really keeps to himself," Feltman says. "He's lived here for…two years, maybe? He inherited the house after old Mr. Bohner passed away. As far as I know, he doesn't work. We thought at first that he was just here to clear out the house and sell it, but he stayed. You know, come to think of it, he used to be more normal—he was always reserved, but he would at least say 'hi' to people when he passed them on the street. In the last few months, though, he's gotten even more reclusive, rarely leaves the house. And when he does, he keeps his head down and doesn't talk to anyone except to say the occasional cryptic thing like he did with you."</p><p>"Which supports my schizophrenia theory," Chief Jones puts in.</p><p>"Can you think of anyone in particular who's spoken to him and might be able to give me more information?" Rio asks.</p><p>"Honestly, Special Agent Vidal, I wouldn't waste your time on this one," Detective Feltman sighs. "I admire that you want to follow every possible lead, but I can virtually guarantee that Ralph Bohner is a dead end."</p><p>"Fair enough," Rio says. "So, what do you all have?"</p><p>The briefing concludes shortly after that, given that precisely zero new information has come out of Westview PD. Rio is mildly irritated, but they keep it to themself. They don't need to make things worse with the local cops, especially not when they seem to be in a better place than they started the briefing at.</p><p>Being back at the station also sobers Rio a little, gets them to screw their head back on straight. It probably doesn't hurt that they had enough orgasms over the last 24 hours that they're not quite as consumed by Agnes as they have been over the last few days. Embarrassment and shame, those twin cold, familiar feelings, begin to twine themselves around Rio's body.</p><p>They swallow hard and sit down behind their borrowed desk, taking out their phone. Is it weird to text Agnes telling her they won't be free for a couple of days? That assumes that she wants to see them every day, which—does she? Is that reasonable? Now that their appetite for her has been somewhat sated, a lot more of their brain is engaged, which means that they have a lot more capacity to ruminate.</p><p>It also means they have a lot more capacity to <em>do their fucking job</em>, so they slap the phone face-down on the desk, deferring the anxiety spiral, and open their laptop.</p><p>To their surprise and delight, their inbox actually contains some useful information. The ballistics team has sent them a report on the bullet and casing: the bullet is a 9mm Luger, a personal defense variant that suggests the murder weapon wasn't owned by law enforcement or a member of the military. The report even contains striation analysis suggesting that the gun was a Smith &amp; Wesson Shield Plus, an ultra-compact pistol that also supports the idea that the shooter was a civilian.</p><p>The new evidence gives Rio enough momentum that for the first time in days, they actually have the wherewithal to go through their inbox—which reminds them that they are, in fact, working multiple other cases that they've been neglecting during their Agnes-related fugue state.</p><p>They work diligently through to the end of the day and then a little beyond, owing to their late start. When they finally look at their phone again at around 6, they're a little disappointed to see that they don't have any messages from Agnes. Just a little.</p><p>They open up their text window again and stare at it, chewing at their lip. In the end, they lock their phone, pack up their stuff, and go pick up a personal pizza to eat alone in their hotel room.</p><p>By the end of the day on Wednesday, after another full day behind the Westview deputy chief's desk, Rio has fully convinced themself that Agnes thinks they're a freak, and not in the fun way. They haven't heard anything from her since she dropped them off at their hotel the previous morning, and Rio's certain it's because of the sick, twisted things they wanted and, for some reason, decided to say out loud and do to her.</p><p>They're morosely picking over a container of grocery store sushi, vaguely paying attention to some lady on the TV ruining a beautiful historic house by painting it black, when their phone buzzes. They've so thoroughly nixed the possibility of Agnes texting them that it doesn't even occur to them that it might be her.</p><p>It's only when they pick up their phone a few minutes later, during the commercial break, that all of the excitement comes rushing back.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>9:07 pm</em><br/>
hey i know youre super busy but could i persuade you into a work and play sort of situation tomorrow<br/>
i have a lead<br/>
and ulterior motives</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio has so thoroughly talked themself into believing that Agnes has fully repudiated them that they only feel a cautious sort of optimism alongside the excitement. On one hand, they're thrilled all over again, heart pattering, all the clichés. On the other, their brain is a hamster wheel of <em>Does "ulterior motives" mean sex?</em> and <em>Work and play???</em></p><p>After much agonizing, they eventually succeed in responding like a normal person in their 40s and not a teenager.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>9:23 pm</em><br/>
Yes, sounds great! Lunch?</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>To Billy's delight, Rio and Agnes meet up at Burgerburg again. To his disappointment, however, Agnes makes it very clear to him as soon as she walks in that he's not invited to eat with them. He still drops their food off at their table instead of making them come up to the counter to get it.</p><p>Rio appears to have lost any suaveness they may have exhibited when previously interacting with Agnes, and their attempt at small talk winds up being, "You got an Impossible Burger again." They point to it with a French fry, as if there's any doubt about which burger is Agnes'.</p><p>She gives them an amused half-smile. "I did."</p><p>"Uh. Are you also vegetarian?" Rio says, hoping this passes for normal conversation.</p><p>"<em>God</em>, no!" Agnes says with a snort. Then her face goes a little soft, a little hesitant—a little like the way Rio feels. "No," she continues slowly, "I just didn't know if you'd be comfortable with me eating meat in front of you." Her cheeks are dusted with pink.</p><p>"That's very sweet," Rio says. Seeing Agnes blush has brought them right back to the last time her face was that flushed, when she was on her knees in her shower, sucking Rio's cock like her life depended on it, and they're quickly tumbling back into that dopey headspace she puts them into. Horny and stupid is better than plain awkward. Or something.</p><p>"You take that back!" Agnes says, outraged and completely unaware of the minor crisis Rio is experiencing. "I am not <em>sweet</em>. It's basic manners!"</p><p>"A lot of people would disagree with you," Rio says, somewhat on autopilot. Then they mentally catch up with the conversation and fold their arms, make their voice a little steely. "I think it's sweet and kind, and there's nothing you can do about it."</p><p>Agnes' eyes go wide at Rio's tone, lips parting slightly. <em>Oh</em>, Rio thinks.<em> Maybe she </em>was <em>okay with all the stuff we did the other night?</em> Then Agnes fully registers what they said and sticks her nose up. "I came here to talk about the case, not have my character assassinated. Billy might overhear you and think I have a heart."</p><p>"You want to talk about the case, I'm all ears," Rio says, firmly shoving their eternally distracting thoughts aside. "I'm having a hell of a time getting anywhere. Doesn't help that I've been bogged down in paperwork hell for my other cases."</p><p>"It's not as much as I would have liked, but it's not nothing," Agnes says. "I talked to Norm, who works at the jewelry store down the block from the bank, and he says he saw a woman matching Menière's description about 15 minutes before the shooting. So that should narrow down the amount of security camera footage that has to be gone through by a lot."</p><p>Before they know what they're doing, Rio has reached across the table, grabbed Agnes by the collar of her ever-present trenchcoat, and pulled her in for a deep, slightly ketchup-y kiss.</p><p>"<em>Oh my God</em>," comes Billy's voice from behind the counter.</p><p>"You saw nothing, Teen!" Agnes snaps without looking at him. Then, to Rio, much more quietly and sultrily, "You seem very pleased with this information, Special Agent. Any chance of a reward for a hardworking informant?" Her eyes are dark, and she's biting her lip.</p><p>The feral beast within Rio, which they'd spent a full day attempting to bury, comes alive in spectacular fashion. With great effort, Rio reins it in. Maybe a lunch meeting was a bad idea. They'd been eager to see Agnes as soon as possible, but if this were dinner, they could have their way with her immediately. They have enough of their rational mind left to know they can't take the afternoon off.</p><p>"Here's what's going to happen," Rio says in a low voice, doing their best to stop it from shaking. Both of them are leaning across the table, foreheads nearly touching. Rio is, as they always seem to be in Agnes' presence, painfully hard. "I'm going to go back to the station and finish out my workday. You're going to spend the rest of the day thinking about what you want for your reward, and you're not going to touch yourself. I'm going to come over at 6, you're going to beg me for what you want, and I'm going to decide if I want to give it to you." They lean back, smirking smugly at Agnes' stricken expression. "And then," they say in a much more normal, casual tone, "we can order pizza or something."</p><p>That marginally snaps Agnes out of it and she chuckles weakly. "Or something," she repeats, looking and sounding somewhat dazed.</p><p>"See you later," Rio says, slapping the table and standing up. They need to leave while they still seem like they have it together.</p><p>"Bye, Special Agent Vidal!" Billy calls cheerfully from behind the counter.</p><p>When Rio turns to look, Agnes is just staring at them, hungry and frustrated. Good.</p><p>"Bye, Billy!" they say with a wave, and walk out the door without looking at Agnes again.</p><hr/><p>By the time Rio gets back to the station, it's obvious that they might as well have taken the rest of the day off. Any mental capacity they clawed back over the previous day is gone once again. They stare at their inbox, reading the same subject lines over and over, not taking in any information at all. They set a pace of reading one email every half hour or so, the remainder of the time taken up by staring into space and squeezing their thighs together, imagining ever filthier variations on what Agnes might ask them for tonight.</p><p>They've been at their desk for two hours or so when Detective Feltman passes by their door, and Rio remembers suddenly that they were supposed to pass along Agnes' lead.</p><p>"Hey, Detective," they call, trying desperately to sound cool and normal. It's probably because they're trying so hard that their voice cracks. They clear their throat. "I was just coming to find you. We've got a lead."</p><p>He pauses, turns back, leans on the doorway. "Okay?" he says, giving them an odd look.</p><p>Rio can feel the heat climbing up their neck and probably turning the tips of their ears red, but they soldier on, doing their best to act natural. "Norm at the jewelry shop said he saw Menière walking past him to the bank. So that narrows down the range of security camera footage to go through."</p><p>"Oh, great," the detective says. He looks closely at Rio. "Were you out canvassing the neighborhood businesses? I could have our beat cops do that, you know."</p><p>"Uh, no," Rio says, scratching the back of their neck. Wow, they're really not acting normal. They clear their throat again. "Agnes did. Uh, Ms. O'Connor. Um, the private investigator."</p><p>Rio's heart sinks as Detective Feltman grins broadly. "I'm glad you're developing a good working relationship with our local PI," is all he says. And then he winks. Rio puts their head in their hands.</p><p>Rio's concentration just goes further downhill from there, and they end up taking off early. They feverishly send off a text to Agnes as they exit the station, brainpower so diminished that they can't even attempt to keep it cool.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>4:33 pm</em><br/>
I know I said 6, but I can't wait. How's 5:15 instead?</p>
</blockquote><p>The response is instant.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>4:33 pm</em><br/>
doors unlocked whenever you get here</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio originally said 5:15 because they were planning to stop by their hotel first, but they have a strong sense that Agnes is doing something she's not supposed to be doing. They fire off one last message before they start their car and peel off towards Agnes' house.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Rio Vidal</strong><br/>
<em>4:35 pm</em><br/>
You better not be fucking touching yourself. I told you, hands off.</p>
</blockquote><p>Glancing down at their phone at a red light, they see:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/>
<em>4:36 pm</em><br/>
oops, did i not mention i have poor working memory<br/>
also i cant read suddenly idk 🙂😎</p>
</blockquote><p>Grinding their teeth, Rio speeds up, blowing through a stop sign at a thankfully deserted intersection.</p><p>They need to teach Agnes a lesson.</p>

<p>Rio blows through Agnes' front door, slamming and locking it behind them. They curse as they struggle to unlace and take off their boots, then rip off their coat and throw it haphazardly on the bench by the door instead of hanging it up. They're making for the stairs, assuming Agnes is in the bedroom, when they hear a rustle from the living room.</p><p>Pivoting slowly, their jaw drops as they take in the sight before them: Agnes O'Connor, fully nude, pale skin glowing in the dim lamplight. She's sprawled on the couch, head resting on one of its arms so she's fully facing Rio. One leg is hooked over the back of the sofa, while the other dangles towards the floor, spreading her very wet, very pink cunt wide open for Rio's viewing pleasure.</p><p>Or it <em>would</em> be their pleasure if they hadn't explicitly told Agnes she wasn't allowed to touch herself for the rest of the day. She's rolling her clit between two fingers, gently rolling her hips. Her hair is scraped back into a messy ponytail, leaving her flushed face and dark eyes fully visible to Rio.</p><p>Something takes over Rio, something animal, as they cross the room in three long strides, seize Agnes' wrist, and wrench it away. They're distantly aware that they're growling, teeth bared, as they haul her to her feet and pin her arms to her sides.</p><p>"I thought I got to pick what happens tonight," Agnes pouts, trying to look at Rio over her shoulder as they perp-walk her up the stairs and into her bedroom.</p><p>Once they get there, Rio slams her front against the wall, holding her firmly by the shoulders. "You lost that privilege," they snarl in her ear, "when you decided to disobey me and get yourself off. On your couch, no less, with your door unlocked, so anyone could walk in and see you." They shove her a little bit for emphasis, their hips pinning hers to the wall. "I bet you <em>wanted</em> someone to come in and watch."</p><p>There's no smart comeback, just a whine and a nod. Rio grabs Agnes' ponytail and pulls. Her head jerks back, her pale neck stretched out and vulnerable.</p><p>"Answer me!" they snap.</p><p>"<em>Yesdaddy</em>," Agnes gasps. She's panting for it, almost drooling with how much she wants Rio.</p><p>Rio chuckles, pressing their whole body up against Agnes' now. "Yeah? Maybe one day we'll go to a play party in the city and I can have my way with you in front of an audience." Agnes makes a pathetic, broken noise. "Do I make you that desperate, huh? Just from talking to you?"</p><p>"Yeah…Daddy…" Agnes pants. Rio's heart skips a beat as they realize she's grinding against the wall now. So, so needy. Well, if she thinks she's desperate now, they can't imagine how she'll be by the time they're done with her.</p><p>They spin her so she's facing them, then push her back up against the wall. Fixing her with a stern glare, RIo says, "What do you think is going to happen here, Agnes? I bet you think I'm going to spank you, don't you?"</p><p>The wide-eyed look they get tells them they're right on the money, and they laugh in her face.</p><p>"No, you'd like that too much," Rio says, not bothering to hide their sadistic delight. "Instead…well, I have to imagine you have some rope around here."</p><hr/><p>Two hours later, Rio's feeling very satisfied. Agnes has rope looped around each wrist and each ankle, tied spread-eagle to the bedframe. More rope around her hips holds a wand vibrator in place. It's on the lowest setting, the head just nudging Agnes' clit, close enough that she can feel it, but too far for her to get the kind of pressure she needs to feel any real sensation.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, is sitting on an armchair that they've dragged directly in front of the bed, legs spread wide, thrusting their cock gently against their palm and moaning louder than strictly necessary as they work themself through a third orgasm.</p><p>"This could be you," they croon, wiggling their slick, shiny fingers in Agnes' direction. "You could have come by now—you could have made <em>me</em> come by now—if you hadn't been so greedy."</p><p>Much as she has for the bulk of the last two hours, Agnes just keens, wiggling her hips ineffectually. Rio smirks and slips their own fingers into their mouth. "Mmm," they say with over-the-top enjoyment. "Bet you wish you could taste this."</p><p>"Come <em>on</em>," Agnes says, but her voice is weak and breathy—all longing and no petulance.</p><p>Rio sighs and stands, stretching. They don't miss the way Agnes' eyes rove all over their body as their muscles strain taut. Then they crawl onto the bed, knees on either side of Agnes' hips. "You're lucky I'm not actually strict with you," they say matter-of-factly, brushing their fingers lightly over Agnes' tits.</p><p>She splutters. "N-not strict?" she eventually says, incredulous as well as turned on beyond belief.</p><p>"What you <em>deserve</em>," Rio continues, starting to concentrate their touch on Agnes' nipples, "is to get edged for another couple of hours, then to still not be allowed to come for the rest of the night." They roll her nipples between their thumbs and index fingers, not as hard as she likes. "But I'm too soft for my own good," they continue, "and I need to hear those delicious, needy sounds you make when you orgasm."</p><p>As Agnes tries to formulate a response, Rio scoots back, reaches down, and turns up the vibrator.</p><p>The effect is immediate, electric. Agnes arches her back high and makes a sound Rio's never heard before, a high, breathy wail that goes on and on and on. They file the noise away as one they want to elicit again and again.</p><p>"Fucking gorgeous," Rio murmurs, and aligns their cock over the vibrator before grinding down. They both moan loudly at that, Rio somehow ready to go again. They bend forward and bite down on the skin of Agnes' chest, right above her heart, sucking hard as she gasps and pants.</p><p>She mumbles something unintelligible. "What?" Rio asks, lips parted and swollen.</p><p>"M'neck," she slurs. "Mark me."</p><p>Rational thoughts, like <em>We are not teenagers</em> and <em>Aren't you supposed to appear in court in a few days?</em> are nowhere to be found. All that's present in Rio's mind is the primal need to bite down on the spot in Agnes' neck where they can see her pulse jumping, fast fast fast and warm. They clamp down with their teeth, and lick, and suck, and grind down with their pelvis, and with a choked-off cry, Agnes convulses under them.</p><p>Rio lifts themself up on their hands, watching Agnes closely as she trembles through her orgasm, a couple of tears leaking out of her eyes. The hickey on her neck is dark red and shiny with Rio's spit, and the visible marker of <em>possession</em> jolts through Rio. They roll their hips one more time and—there it is. They're coming yet again, forehead landing with a thud on Agnes' shoulder. Agnes screams directly into their ear and they realize she's coming <em>again</em>. Or still coming? Either way, it's <em>with Rio</em>.</p><p>They're not really sure where one orgasm ends and the next begins, each of them cyclically spurring the other into another climax, both bucking their hips jerkily against the head of the vibrator. They don't know which of them it is who makes a garbled noise that clearly means "too sensitive." It's definitely Rio who turns the vibrator off, Rio who clumsily unties Agnes with numb fingers, Rio who pulls the comforter over both of them and holds Agnes close. She's shivering, and Rio does their best to wrap their entire body around her to warm her up.</p><p>They lie like that for a while, time flowing slow and syrupy.</p><p>"Pizza," Agnes says suddenly.</p><p>Rio blinks, rousing themself from their half-doze. "Huh?"</p><p>"You said pizza," Agnes tries to clarify.</p><p>Rio frowns, realizes what Agnes means, and chuckles. "Okay, I have to let go of you if I'm going to order pizza, though," they warn.</p><p>She grumbles but acquiesces, and Rio sits up and calls Domino's. After they hang up, they look down and realize that Agnes has rolled over to face them. She looks appalled.</p><p>"What?" they ask, bewildered.</p><p>She holds up a finger. "One, there are twelve dozen local pizza places and you pick <em>Domino's</em>?" Another finger. "And two, you place orders by <em>calling places</em>?" Her voice is hoarse and she's clearly tired, but these egregious offenses have helped her shake off some of her languor.</p><p>Rio shrugs. "I have a craving for cheesy garlic bread. And yes, I call. What is it with millennials and not wanting to make phone calls?"</p><p>Agnes rolls her eyes. "You're a millennial too, dork."</p><p>"Don't call me a dork," RIo says half-heartedly. Stretching, they slide out of bed. "I'm just going to get some water. Be right back."</p><p>When they return, Agnes is curled up with the covers pulled tight around her. She looks…adorable. She opens one eye as they approach, and they hold out one of the glasses of water. She huffs, but sits up and takes it, the comforter falling down around her waist. Rio's mouth goes dry as they take in her nipples, tight and peaked, and the marks Rio sucked into her skin earlier. <em>My marks. Mine</em>, they think dizzily.</p><p>When they tear their eyes away and look at Agnes' face, she's smirking. She has also drained the entire glass of water. Instead of saying anything, Rio swaps her glass for theirs and escapes to get more water.</p><p>Before they return to the bedroom, they take a few deep breaths to center themself. They're not very good at aftercare and the after-conversation and all that, but it's the right thing to do. And—more important to them, although they wouldn't admit that to anyone—there's still a large part of them that feels bad and wrong and guilty about all of these things they're doing with Agnes, and hearing her say it was okay will go a little way toward reassuring Rio. So they stride in and plop down on the bed, starting to talk before they lose their nerve. "So, um," they start eloquently. Agnes looks up curiously, sipping this glass of water more slowly. "How…was that…for you?"</p><p>The look she gives them is almost pitying, but she has the decency to hold back the laugh that's clearly bubbling up in their chest. "Yeah, I think it was okay," she says, lips twitching.</p><p>Rio grunts in frustration. "You know what I mean. What did you like? What didn't you like?" <em>What will make you run for the hills if I try anything like it again?</em> "Same questions go for the other night, by the way, because we didn't have this conversation then and really should ha—"</p><p>"Rio," Agnes interrupts. "Do I strike you as the type of person who keeps my mouth shut if I don't like something?"</p><p>"Well, no. But," they continue valiantly, "It's still responsible for me to check in."</p><p>She gives them a shrewd look. "Rio, I have liked everything we've done together. Even the part where you unjustly tortured me for hours on end earlier this evening. We're—" she takes a sharp breath, as if second-guessing what she's about to say "—we're weirdly compatible," she finishes in a rush.</p><p>It shouldn't really make a difference, to hear it in words when they already had all the evidence they needed in Agnes' reactions, but hearing out loud that Agnes really has been into everything lifts a weight off Rio's shoulders. They blink at her. "Yeah," they say roughly. "It's…kind of hard for me to believe that you're into all these things."</p><p>Agnes puts a hand on their knee. When they look over at her, her expression is soft and open. New. "You're allowed good things," she says, as if it's that simple.</p><p>And strangely, Rio believes her.</p><p>They bend down and kiss her softly. It's the first time they've kissed like this, sweet and slow—not a stop on the way to fucking, but its own thing, and Rio allows a little kernel of hope to blossom. Maybe Agnes has soft and mushy feelings for Rio too.</p>

<h2 class="heading">The Block Party</h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agnes invites Rio to a block party but doesn't actually show up.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>With great effort, Rio manages to go back to their hotel room on Thursday night (after polishing off an entire loaf of cheesy bread), and as such, they're able to actually put in a full day of work on Friday.</p><p>That evening, they're searching for an excuse to see Agnes again when she provides it for them.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong><br/><em>11:02 pm</em><br/>there's a fall block party on my block tomorrow - you should stop by</p>
</blockquote><p>Rio was originally planning to go back to Newark for the whole weekend, but they can keep it to just Sunday.</p><hr/><p>Rio shouldn't be surprised, given how affluent Westview is, but the block party is <em>fancy</em>. The entire neighborhood is fully decorated for the holidays by now, giant blow-up turkeys bobbing gently in the wind and strings of lights painstakingly arranged all over the houses. Instead of Solo cups and paper plates, there are actual servers walking around with trays of hors d'oeuvres and drinks. Rio was worried about being overdressed in their work clothes, but there isn't a casual piece of clothing in sight. They look a little boring, but not at all out of place.</p><p>As Rio looks around for Agnes, they notice that one of the servers is Billy, who has traded out his Burgerburg apron for a white dress shirt and black wool coat. He's still wearing his ripped jeans, though. "Hi, Special Agent Vidal!" he says, waving enthusiastically. It's a testament to his skill as a waiter that the tray of drinks balanced on his other hand stays completely still despite how vigorously he's waving.</p><p>"Hi, Billy. What you got there?" Rio asks, walking over to him.</p><p>"It's a pumpkin spice virgin mimosa," he says, as if this is a normal combination of words. He rattles off the ingredients: "Freshly squeezed orange juice, pumpkin spice syrup, a little verjus, and seltzer. Mrs. Hart made them. Want one?"</p><p>That combination sounds awful, but Rio accepts out of morbid curiosity. "You're a busy kid," they say. "Burgerburg, catering gigs…do you do other stuff too?"</p><p>He shrugs, still keeping the tray of concoctions perfectly balanced. "I'm sure Agnes has told you I'm an amateur detective," he says, trying to sound modest and failing. "So Burgerburg is the main way I make money, and I take side gigs when I can, but my real <em>occupation</em> is detective work."</p><p>He's saying all of this with great seriousness, so Rio suppresses their smile as they ask, "What kind of detecting have you gotten up to lately?"</p><p>Billy looks around at this point and says, "It's kind of a long story. Let me see if I can find someone to hand this off to and I'll tell you all about it."</p><p>As Billy walks off, Rio takes a sip of the drink. It's only because they were so completely expecting it to be awful that they don't immediately spit it out.</p><p>"Do you like that, honey?" a high-pitched voice says from behind Rio.</p><p>They turn around and recognize the fluttery old woman they'd interviewed at the bank the day of the murder. She's wearing a truly astounding autumn leaves-patterned quilted jacket. Making an effort to smile, Rio says, "Mrs. Hart, right? It's—a fascinating combination. How did you come up with it?"</p><p>"Yes, dear. Oh, you know, a lot of our hors d'oeuvres are brunch-inspired, so I started thinking about brunch and the fall, and it just came to me! Pumpkin spice mimosas! I don't really approve of day-drinking, you know, so I came up with a non-alcoholic version. What can I say? I was just inspired," Mrs. Hart says, spreading her hands.</p><p>Just then, Ralph Bohner passes them and gives Rio an odd, fixed stare before turning the same strange look on Mrs. Hart, looking back at Rio, and then quickly walking away. The local cops might think they should stop pursuing Ralph Bohner as a lead, but it doesn't hurt to ask a couple questions if the topic has already presented itself. "What's his deal?" Rio asks quietly.</p><p>"Ralph? Oh, he's a sweet boy," Mrs. Hart says, turning to follow him with her eyes. "Always happy to help me out whenever I need a hand. But he's a little—oh, I don't know what the correct term is these days. Touched in the head? He means well, but he says some <em>very</em> strange things sometimes."</p><p>Rio doesn't understand how the weirdest guys can still be so charming to old ladies. It boggles the mind. "What kind of strange things?" they ask.</p><p>"You know, people following him, voices telling him to do things, that kind of thing," Mrs. Hart says in that way of older ladies who claim to hate gossip but are absolutely delighted when they get to spill anyone else's business.</p><p>Rio frowns. "Do you know if he's getting any medical care?"</p><p>"Oh, it's not that big of a deal," Mrs. Hart says dismissively. "Back in my day, we didn't give people medicine for everything, you know. He just needs people to be kind to him and not look at him funny. You remember that, Mr. FBI." She turns and walks away with an offended sniff.</p><p>"Yikes, what did you say to her?" Billy asks, slouching up. "Mrs. Hart never gets mad."</p><p>"I was just asking about her and Agnes' weird neighbor," Rio says, a little petulant. "I'm investigating a <em>murder</em>. She shouldn't be surprised if I ask a couple of questions."</p><p>"Ooh, so the robbery <em>was</em> a cover for murder?" Billy asks, his eyes lighting up. "That was my main hypothesis! From what I've gathered—"</p><p>"Just—pretend you didn't hear that, Billy," they say, burying their face in their hands. Careless mistake. Trying to distract him, they add, "You were going to tell me about your detective work."</p><p>"Yeah, but your case is so much more interesting," Billy says, almost bouncing on the balls of his feet. He lowers his voice, looking around unsubtly. "What does Mr. Bohner have to do with the murder?"</p><p>"Nothing. Nothing!" Rio says emphatically. "There's nothing to tell. But I'm sure you have a lot to share about your investigations."</p><p>"Fine," Billy says begrudgingly. He shoves his hands into his pockets and looks down at his boots. "I'm investigating my brother's disappearance."</p><p>Rio stares. They were expecting "the case of the missing library book" or "why is my crush so sad all of a sudden?" Not an actual missing person. Not an actual missing person who's his own brother.</p><p>"I'm so sorry," they say. "What was his name?"</p><p>"Tommy," Billy says. All of the youthful exuberance is gone from his face, and he narrates the facts with practiced detachment. "We're twins. He went missing five years ago, so when we were 13. He ran track and I didn't, so we went home from school separately that day. He never got home."</p><p>Rio feels terrible now for assuming Billy's aspiration was frivolous. "Who else is working on his case?" they ask.</p><p>"I mean, technically the Eastview Sheriff's Office, but they're useless. My mom's a PI too, so she was working on it for a while, but after Dad died, she couldn't really handle it anymore. So it's my job to find Tommy." Billy looks fierce, determined—and yet hollow. "Mom's been through a lot. My uncle died when I was little, but then things were good for a while…and then Tommy disappeared. And then Dad died in a plane crash three years ago. I'm the only one she has now. And I'm the only one looking for Tommy."</p><p>Rio recognizes Billy's expression from looking at their own young self in the mirror: a fierce determination to bear burdens no child should ever have to bear.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Billy," they repeat. "I lost my family when I was young, too. Your mom's lucky to have you." Trying to figure out what else they can say to reassure him, they continue, "Once I'm done with this investigation, if you want me to take a look at what you have on Tommy, I'd be happy to help."</p><p>Billy lights up again. Rio recognizes that, too: the ability to bounce right back from remembering their lost family. The <em>necessity</em> of bouncing back. "Really?!" he beams. "Oh, thank you, Special Agent Vidal! And if you change your mind about accepting my assistance over the course of your investigation, my offer to help still stands."</p><p>"Thank you," they say quietly. They don't truly believe the kid could be of any help to them, but he doesn't need to know that. He nods and gets back to work, back to his gregarious self as he offers more of the horrible drinks to partygoers.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, is filled with melancholy, beset by a flood of memories that they generally do their best to keep locked up. Sneaking out to go hang out in a parking lot with their friends. The odd glow as they biked up the street, a sunrise that only grew brighter and brighter as they approached home. Everyone and everything that had ever been theirs, gone in a single night. The guilt, the guilt, the guilt.</p><p>They grit their teeth and start walking, blinking back tears. They want to find Agnes more than ever.</p><hr/><p>Half an hour later, Rio finally finds Agnes. She's in her house.</p><p>They knocked on the door as a last-ditch effort after not seeing her anywhere, not really expecting her to answer. But here she is in a Provincetown sweatshirt and baggy jeans, hair in a messy ponytail, glasses sitting on her nose—and Rio's hickey prominently visible on her neck. She's never looked sexier.</p><p>"Come in, you're letting the heat out," Agnes says when Rio continues to just stand on the doorstep, looking at her incredulously.</p><p>As they step over the threshold, they ask, "Why aren't you out at the block party?"</p><p>She shrugs, waving them into the living room and gesturing towards the couch. "I don't like being around that many people at once."</p><p>Rio stares as they sit. "...You invited me <em>to</em> the block party."</p><p>Agnes smirks. "I just wanted to see you again." Then she really looks at Rio, takes in their expression and their red-rimmed eyes. "Wait. Are you okay?"</p><p>They take a deep breath, looking up at the ceiling. "Yeah, I just—had a heavy conversation with Billy. You know about his brother?"</p><p>"Of course," Agnes replies. "Like I said, he glommed onto me as soon as I got into town. It's a rough case, though. I know he doesn't want to believe it, but it's virtually certain that Tommy's—"</p><p>"—dead, yeah," Rio finishes with a sigh. "Poor kid."</p><p>Agnes lets out a breath too. "Yeah. Don't tell him I said this, because he doesn't need a big head, but he's a smart kid. He made good headway into the investigation with basically no resources and no evidence. Did better than those Eastview meatheads, for sure. But I almost hope he doesn't get any further, you know? So he doesn't have to find a body."</p><p>Rio squeezes their eyes shut. Is it better or worse to have a body? Sometimes they think they might be less fucked up in the head if they'd had anything to hold on to, any hope at all. "I don't know," they say, hunching forward. "Anyway, the whole conversation just—brought up a lot for me."</p><p>Agnes bends down over Rio, one knee on the couch, face hovering above theirs.</p><p>"What are you doing?" they ask, looking up at her.</p><p>"Taking your mind off things," she murmurs, hot breath against Rio's lips. She leans in, grazes her lips gently over theirs, then lowers her entire body so it's flush against Rio's.</p><p>She's packing.</p><p>She's packing, and Rio gets so wet so fast, all of the bad old memories swept away as they feel the bulge against their thigh.</p><p>They're far from opposed to Agnes fucking them, but—"You can top, but I hope you know I'm still in charge," they say, making sure there's an edge of steel in their voice.</p><p>Agnes falters slightly. So she did think she had a chance of dominating Rio. Adorable. She looks like she's about to make a stand, but Rio preempts her by grabbing her ass, hard. Agnes' eyes flutter shut and a little whisper of a moan leaves her mouth. Rio brings their other hand up and puts it on the back of Agnes' neck, heavy and warm, drawing her ear down to Rio's mouth.</p><p>"I have a feeling we'll both enjoy it more if you let me tell you <em>exactly</em> how best to pleasure me," they whisper before biting down lightly on her earlobe. They're hungry for her.</p><p>Now that her mouth is right up against Rio's ear, they can hear the sharp intake of breath, the little squeak, and finally, whispered: "Yes, Daddy."</p><p>Rio chuckles. "Good boy," they growl, and Agnes whimpers, rolling her hips against Rio. They smack her sharply on the hip. "Get up and strip," they order. "I want to see what we're working with here."</p><p>Agnes jumps up from the couch with so much enthusiasm that it would be funny if Rio weren't so fucking horny. She peels off the sweatshirt, then the tank top she has underneath. She's not wearing a bra. It takes everything Rio has to let her keep going instead of pouncing on her. Instead, they sit up a little bit to get a good look and say archly, "Someone's eager. Well, go on."</p><p>She eases the waistband of her sweatpants out and over her strap-on. It's dark purple, a little curved, and <em>big</em>. Not so big that Rio's worried about not being able to take it. But it is big enough that simply looking at it jutting out from Agnes' hips makes Rio's cock twitch.</p><p>Agnes pushes the sweatpants the rest of the way down and turns away to stop out, wiggling her ass a little bit in Rio's face. They prefer to wear jockstrap or underwear harnesses because they can't be bothered with all the adjusting and buckles, but they deeply appreciate the aesthetic of the strappy harness secured snugly around Agnes' ass and thighs.</p><p>Seeing her bent over and presenting her ass like this gives Rio an idea. As Agnes moves to climb back onto the couch, Rio stops her with a hand to the center of her chest. They can feel her heart pattering against her ribcage. "Before we get started," they say, grazing their hand up Agnes' throat to take hold of her chin, "go to the kitchen and get me a wooden spoon."</p>

<p>Agnes' eyes light up at the mention of the wooden spoon. "What for?" she asks with mock innocence, licking her lips.</p><p>"Well," Rio says, letting their hand drift down to one of Agnes' nipples, then the other, "I have a small paddle I usually like to use on insolent brats who play dumb, but I foolishly didn't bring it with me on my work trip." They end their sentence with a squeeze of Agnes' right breast, and she lets out a soft moan before she can stop herself. "Any more questions?" Rio asks.</p><p>They're the picture of poise, despite the heat simmering beneath their skin. They're close to boiling over with want, and they don't know if they can hold out much longer if Agnes decides to keep playing dumb.</p><p>Thankfully, she seems to have gotten it out of her system for now. "No, sir," she says, looking a little dazed.</p><p>"Oh, <em>sir</em>," Rio groans. "I like that. Yeah. What do you say, then, when I say, 'Go get me a wooden spoon'?"</p><p>"Yes, sir," Agnes says immediately in that same soft, almost hypnotized voice. She walks slowly into the kitchen, fully under Rio's spell. As she goes, Rio efficiently strips off their own clothing.</p><p>A couple of drawer slams later, Agnes walks back into the living room, spoon in hand. It's a testament to her natural air of self-assuredness that she doesn't look ridiculous walking around naked except for an eight-inch purple strap-on and harness. Her silence as she hands over the spoon is the biggest giveaway that she is, in fact, deeply affected by Rio.</p><p>"Good boy," Rio murmurs, taking the spoon and tucking it between their thigh and the back of the couch. They stretch out languidly, parting their legs wide. "Now get over here and fuck me."</p><p>Rio is so, so wet, and Agnes only has to run the cock up and down their slit a couple of times before it's fully slicked up. She slowly but inexorably enters Rio, one hand spreading them open as she does. "That's right," Rio sighs, grabbing blindly for the spoon. "Now <em>rail me</em>."</p><p>Agnes braces her hands on the couch cushions and snaps her hips forward. Once she bottoms out, she rolls her hips, and Rio moans loudly. She slowly pulls most of the way out and then thrusts into Rio again, repeating the same slow, maddening pattern over and over. It feels good, but Rio knows how to make it even better.</p><p>Rio flicks their wrist and the spoon lands with a loud crack on Agnes' ass. She shrieks, more out of surprise than pain, and pauses to look down at Rio, affronted.</p><p>"Faster," Rio orders breathlessly, reaching around to pop her other ass cheek.</p><p>"Oh, fuck," Agnes groans, and suddenly she's pounding Rio like they've never been pounded before. She takes incredibly well to the new form of encouragement, making the most delicious noises in Rio's ear as they blindly snap the wooden spoon against her skin, getting more guttural by the minute as she pumps into RIo as fast as she can.</p><p>After a while, the jerking of her hips starts to get erratic, and Rio puts the spoon down, grabbing her hips hard and holding her still. "W-why—stop?" Agnes asks, leaning back to look at Rio. She's a mess. Her hair is tangled, her pupils blown, her face red and sweaty with exertion. <em>She's beautiful.</em></p><p>"You were about to come," Rio says, fighting to keep their voice steady, in control. Agnes does her best to thrust again, but Rio holds fast. "Watch it," they say sharply. "I might call this whole thing off if you're not good."</p><p>The warning works, and Agnes stills. Rio lets her remain there in silence for a moment, hovering over Rio, breathing deeply. She doesn't do staying still or being quiet very well, especially not in this state, so it's not long before she's whining, "Rio, <em>please</em>. I just want to make you feel good."</p><p>They let an amused smirk cross their face. "Hey, remember what happened when you touched yourself without permission the other day?" Agnes' hips buck involuntarily at the memory as she nods, and Rio firms up their grip. She bites her lip as she gazes down at Rio, wanton and desperate. "Yeah, so that's what's going to happen again if you come before I do. So do your best to hold off, okay?"</p><p>"Okay." Agnes nods frantically, tousled waves bouncing as she does.</p><p>Rio slaps the side of one leg. "Try again."</p><p>Agnes gasps. "<em>Yessir</em>," she hisses.</p><p>Finally, Rio lets go of her hips and lets her start back up. They've left imprints behind where they were grabbing, and the sight of the red marks drives them wild. As Agnes bends down over them, supporting herself on her elbows while she pounds into them, they clutch onto her upper back. They don't recognize the sounds that are being wrenched out of them now that she's changed angles.</p><p>The longer she goes, the more pleasure courses through their body. Rio's starting to get lightheaded. In an effort to stay grounded, they hang on to Agnes for dear life, digging their nails into her back. She lets out a strangled cry right into their ear as they slowly scratch down her back, imagining how eight vivid red lines must be standing out against her pale skin, and the combined sound and image are enough to send Rio careening into an orgasm.</p><p>When they're done screaming, they look up to find Agnes crying. "<em>Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease</em>," she whispers over and over, fully sheathed inside Rio and rolling her hips minutely to keep herself right on the edge.</p><p>She makes Rio ravenous. "Hold it," they say, their voice raspy and not quite as stern as they want it to be. Agnes whines, more tears running down her face. She looks broken, ruined, and Rio has never seen anything sexier in their entire life. "Hold it," they say again, a little louder, more warningly, as her hips begin to jerk harder.</p><p>They grope around for the wooden spoon, glad to find it within arm's reach. "You're going to count down from ten," they say, looking her right in her wet blue eyes. They squeeze shut, tears shining like crystals at the corners as Rio hits her as hard as they can right on the undercurve of her ass.</p><p>Agnes wails. "Ten," she gasps, struggling not to grind too hard against Rio.</p><p><em>Crack.</em> "Nine," choked out around a sob.</p><p><em>Crack.</em> A howl. "E-eight."</p><p>Rio doesn't let up, spanking her as hard as they possibly can from this awkward angle. She's so, so close, and she's holding back <em>just for Rio</em>. It's heady. They can't remember ever feeling more powerful than this.</p><p><em>Crack.</em> She's full-on crying now, and Rio probably shouldn't find it so hot to feel her hot tears raining down all over their chest. "T-t-two," she barely manages to say.</p><p>"You're going to count 'one,' and then you're going to wait for permission, understand?" Rio demands.</p><p>Agnes just nods, and Rio gives the nonverbal answer a pass this time. They're ready to watch her fall apart.</p><p><em>Crack.</em> "One!" Agnes shrieks. "Please, sir, please, Daddy, please, please—"</p><p>Rio interrupts her tearful babbling by grabbing hold of her hips again, this time to roll them forcefully. "<em>Come</em>," they growl.</p><p>Finally let off her leash, Agnes grinds her clit against the base of her strap-on in tight, quick circles, jerking into Rio with every pass. They feel themself getting closer and closer to another orgasm and breathe deep, doing their best to hold it off. They need to see this happen.</p><p>"<em>Now</em>," Rio snaps, and Agnes climaxes spectacularly. She collapses down on top of Rio, moaning directly into their ear as her entire body tenses up and she comes and comes and comes. But it's the sound of her little shuddering sobs as she comes down from her peak that send Rio over the edge again, trembling under Agnes' warm weight.</p><p>They lie there on the couch, hot and damp with sweat and arousal, just breathing. Then Agnes moves a little, and Rio realizes she's still inside them. "Oof, out," they mutter. "Sensitive."</p><p>Agnes groans reluctantly, but eases out of Rio. With a surprising amount of dexterity given how shaky she is, she gets the harness off and tosses it to the side, then collapses back on top of Rio again. They chuckle.</p><p>She makes a little sound, as if she was about to say something but decided against it. "What is it?" Rio asks.</p><p>A huff, like she's annoyed that Rio picked up on it, and then: "Was I a good boy?" Agnes mumbles, voice uncharacteristically small and unsure.</p><p>Something unfamiliar and tender that's been budding for the last few days burst into full bloom within Rio. They wrap their arms around her, squeezing her a little too tight. "Such a good boy," they say, kissing her head.</p><p>Agnes makes a pleased little noise at that, planting a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss on Rio's collarbone. She says something into their skin.</p><p>"I can't hear you," Rio says, gently brushing Agnes' hair out of her face. They feel so soft towards her it aches. They lean back as much as they can, put a finger under her chin to encourage her to turn towards them.</p><p>"You should stay here instead of your hotel," Agnes whispers. Her eyes are squeezed tightly shut, as if afraid to see what Rio's reaction might be.</p><p>They lie very still, surprised but not at all unhappy with the idea. They're aware, logically, that they've known this woman for a little over a week. Even back when they identified as a lesbian, they'd never been a U-Hauler. But it's been pretty clear in these eight days that Agnes is <em>different</em>.</p><p>And that's why they say, "Okay, Agnes."</p><hr/><p>Sunday morning sees Rio at the Hampton Inn bright and early. Agnes was not happy with how early they rolled out of bed, but they need to head back to Newark sooner rather than later, or they might as well not bother. ("So don't bother," Agnes had said, weakly tugging at Rio's arm. It required more fortitude than Rio wants to admit to pull away and say goodbye.)</p><p>Their plan is to check out of the hotel, go home to Newark to do some laundry and pack a bigger bag with a wider variety of clothing in it, and then drive back to Westview on Monday morning to (<em>temporarily</em>) move in with Agnes.</p><p>Rio should know better by now than to plan more than a few hours into the future.</p><p>The first sign that the day is going wrong is that they get a call from the Newark field office at 8 am on a Sunday. "Vidal," they say, voice clipped as they stride through the hotel lobby.</p><p>"Vidal, it's Salazar," the voice on the other line says. "So, bad news."</p><p>"I gathered from the fact that you're calling me this early on a Sunday," Rio says dryly, unlocking the door to their room.</p><p>"I'm not happy about it either," Special Agent Salazar sighs. "Look, Vertigo's lawyers are putting up a hell of a fight to try and block us from getting their user records, and the judge says we don't have just cause."</p><p>"Their CEO being murdered isn't <em>cause</em>?" Rio asks incredulously. They hold the phone to their ear with one shoulder as they create a neat pile out of the food containers that wouldn't fit into the trash can and stuff their dirty clothes into their bag.</p><p>"Yeah, the ruling makes no sense. I smell something fishy with this judge, and the lawyers agree," Salazar says. "We're currently working on an emergency motion to get a different judge to take the case, but I figured you should know ASAP about the roadblock and that Vertigo might have a judge on their payroll."</p><p>"Appreciate it," Rio says curtly, and hangs up with a grumble. They want to flop on the bed and groan loudly for about an hour, but it'll probably be more productive to multitask groaning and driving, so they do a last sweep of the room, gather up their stuff, and head out.</p><p>They've barely stepped off the elevator before their way to the lobby is blocked by two women. Rio recognizes one of them: it's Jennifer Kale, the "skinfluencer" Billy had gossiped about the first time they were at Burgerburg with Agnes. Rio doesn't recognize the other, but she's the one who speaks first.</p><p>"Special Agent Rio Vidal?" she asks—no, demands. It's a very lawyerly way of speaking that, combined with the equally lawyerly leather portfolio she's holding, gives Rio a good guess as to who this is.</p><p>"Alice Wu-Gulliver," they say, hoping they're right. It'll be awkward if they're wrong.</p><p>But both women look taken aback, so Rio's right.</p><p>"And Jennifer Kale," they say, looking up at her, pressing their advantage. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"</p><p>"We need to talk to you," Jennifer says. Her eyes are narrowed slightly, as if she doesn't quite trust RIo. That's fine. Rio doesn't trust her either.</p><p>"We're talking right now," they say, deadpan.</p><p>"Privately," Alice specifies with some impatience.</p><p>Rio sighs. "Is there any chance this can wait? I need to get back to Newark."</p><p>"Oh, if you're leaving town, we <em>definitely</em> need to talk now," Jennifer says emphatically.</p><p>"I guess we can go to my room, then," they say begrudgingly. "Just be warned that it's not the tidiest right now. I've been here all week."</p><p>Once Rio is perched on the end of the bed, Jennifer is settled on the armchair, and Alice is on the desk chair, Alice opens the portfolio and begins to speak.</p><p>"We're aware that you've developed a…close working relationship with the private investigator Agnes O'Connor," she says. "Since you know who we are, you're probably aware that she's assisting local attorney Lilia Calderu in smearing my client's small business through a frivolous class action lawsuit."</p><p>"Sure," Rio says, still not quite sure where this is going. They really don't want to get caught up in petty skincare drama.</p><p>"As a result," Alice continues, "I've been doing my own research into Lilia Calderu and Agnes O'Connor. I used to be a cop, you see, and I'm not bad at investigating myself. I think what I've dug up on our local private investigator might be pertinent to your case."</p><p>Jennifer jumps in at this point, plucking a piece of paper from the portfolio and handing it to Rio with a flourish.</p><p>"Agnes O'Connor," Jennifer says smugly, "is not who she claims to be."</p>

<p>Confusion. Betrayal. Panic. Anger. Sadness. Rio's head whirls as they drive home to Newark.</p><p>Their apartment feels colder and darker and lonelier than it ever has before. They spend the rest of Sunday lying on their bed, staring at the ceiling and alternating between the maelstrom of emotions and feeling numb. At some point in the evening, they eventually roll out of bed and eat a couple of freezer-burned Eggo waffles before slowly making their way into the shower, sitting under the spray and staring at the grooves in the wall tile until the hot water runs out.</p><p>Shivering, they jump up with a curse, towel off, get dressed for bed, and crawl under the covers. They don't look at their phone.</p><p>Around 5 am, they give up on getting a good night's sleep and take the opportunity to get themself together before going into the office. After all, they have a lot of information to corroborate and a murder case to solve. <em>Get your head in the game, Vidal.</em></p><p>They go for a run as the sun rises, blasting some early Linkin Park through their headphones as they do their best to clear their head. Once they're home and showered, they don their mental armor as they put on their suit, gun, and badge.</p><p>As they sit down to breakfast (well, coffee), they finally check their phone. There are a lot of texts from Agnes, and Rio swipes the notifications away quickly without reading. Everything else can be addressed once they get to work, and they suddenly don't want to sit still for another second. They grab their coat and drive to the office, unnecessarily honking at every car that vaguely gets near them. It doesn't make them feel better.</p><p>They put in a long day at the office, mostly managing to avoid interacting with anyone as they look up information and build up a dossier, begrudgingly making a couple of phone calls when they can't get a task done any other way. By the end of the day, they have a thick file folder and a game plan for the next day.</p><p>Their phone has buzzed over and over with texts and calls from Agnes throughout the day. They haven't answered a single one, but they also can't bring themself to block her. Not just yet. After tomorrow? Maybe.</p><p>Rio tells themself they need to unwind to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow is a big day, after all. That's the only reason they get their vibrator out that night. And if the memory of Agnes' flushed, sweaty body, taut with the orgasm she was holding at bay <em>for Rio</em>, pops into their head? Well, they can't help that. They can't help that it makes them come twice in quick succession. And they're just not going to acknowledge the hot tears that pour down their face before they fall into a fitful sleep.</p><hr/><p>Tuesday dawns drizzly and gray. Fitting. Rio only packs work clothes and gets back on the road to Westview. The billboards and roadside motels on the drive have become familiar, but there's no sense of excitement on this drive. They're filled instead with a growing sense of dread that they do their best to tamp down.</p><p>When they get into town, they drive straight to Agnes' house and pound on the door.</p><p>She looks like shit. Her eyes are bleary and red-rimmed, dark circles making it clear that she barely slept last night. Her hair is disheveled, her sweatshirt and joggers wrinkled. And <em>fuck</em>, she looks so good despite it all. Rio's filled with sudden twin jolts of concern and lust. <em>Fuck, get it together, Vidal. Focus.</em></p><p>In the moment it takes Rio to give themself that little pep talk, Agnes has flung her arms around them. "Where the <em>fuck</em> have you been?" she asks, and she sounds angry and hurt and scared. Rio tries very hard not to care. When they just stand there, don't speak or make an attempt to return the embrace, Agnes lets go and steps back. "What? What's wrong?"</p><p>Rio pushes past her and sits down at the dining table, slapping their file folder down. "Sit," they say tersely, pointing at the chair across from them.</p><p>"Rio, what the fuck—"</p><p>"<em>Sit</em>," Rio insists.</p><p>Agnes pulls out the chair with a loud, screeching scrape, flopping down into it with a huff. "What is going on? You were supposed to come back yesterday and—"</p><p>"So," Rio interrupts loudly, flipping the folder open to reveal the first photo, "we know Samira Menière. Founder and CEO of the Vertigo crypto exchange. Yes?" They need to barrel ahead, can't afford to let their feelings into this.</p><p>"Yes…?" Agnes says, brow furrowed. Her face is still tight with hurt and fury, but her eyes dart between Rio's face and the folder, trying to figure out what Rio is getting at.</p><p>Rio clenches their teeth before they go on. "She was also the former Chief Financial Officer of Salem Investment Securities." They flip to the next photograph, a corporate portrait of a severe-looking older woman with deep frown lines and hair pulled back into a tight bun, and stab their finger at it. "Salem Investment Securities, the 19 billion-dollar Ponzi scheme founded and led by one Evanora Harkness." They watch Agnes' face carefully.</p><p>Face stony, Agnes reaches out, closes the folder, looks up at Rio, and says, "Okay. So you know who my mother is."</p><p>Rio sits in silence, waiting for more. But Agnes is a private investigator and knows the game of waiting out the person you're interrogating, so she presses her lips together, glaring at Rio. Finally, they give in first. "That's it?"</p><p>"What else do you want me to say? Yes, Evanora Harkness was my mother. Yes, she ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history." Agnes throws her hands up in the air. "What else is there?"</p><p>"What el—" Rio splutters. Closing their eyes, they take a breath before continuing to speak in a more measured tone. "It's awfully convenient that the CFO of your mother's company showed up in the same town you're staying in and left in a body bag. And you just happened to be walking by the crime scene so you could conveniently get a glimpse of her face. Which then gave you an in to make contact with the FBI agent leading the investigation. What <em>coincidences</em>."</p><p>"They <em>were</em> coincidences!" Agnes snaps, slapping the table. She sounds angry but looks frantic, and—fuck—those are tears shining in her eyes. (Rio tries very hard not to remember the last time Agnes looked up at them with tears in her eyes.) "You really think—fuck, Rio, I can't believe I have to say this! <em>I didn't kill Menière!</em>"</p><p>Many, many emotions have been battling within Rio since Jennifer and Alice started laying out everything they knew about Agnes two days ago, but anger wins out now. "You really expect me to believe that?" they burst out. "Now that I know you've been lying to me from the moment we met?"</p><p>"It wasn't so much lying as strategically omitting information," she quips.</p><p>Rio once again squeezes their eyes shut and opens them again, leveling a glare at the woman they've been stupid enough to swoon over for days—the woman they were about to <em>move in with after a week</em>. She's good, they'll give her that. "'The murder victim was the CFO of my mother's historic Ponzi scheme' is a big piece of information to omit. <em>Agatha</em>."</p><p>Agnes flinches as if she's been hit. "Don't call me that," she says very softly. Against all of RIo's professional instincts, the hurt look on her face tugs at them.</p><p>"Why not?" they ask, voice still hard. They're harsher than they need to be, actively quashing the part of themself that has a fucking heart. "That's your name, isn't it? Agatha Harkness, daughter of Evanora Harkness?"</p><p>"Not for a long time," Agnes says. Her gaze is steely, even as a single tear trickles down each cheek. "If you've looked into me, then you know I'm Agnes O'Connor everywhere it matters. They're all by-the-book legal name changes. I'd think you of all people would respect that. <em>Rio.</em>"</p><p>As someone who legally changed their own name decades ago, Rio knows she's right. And yet they can't admit it. Everything in Rio's heart is telling them to relent, but they need to put their personal feelings aside and do their job. "That doesn't change the facts," they spit, opening the folder again and spreading out the rest of the papers. "You have a pretty lengthy record, starting from when you were a teenager."</p><p>Agnes scoffs. "You're going to use shoplifting charges to try and claim I'm a murderer?"</p><p>Rio presses on. "Your movements over the last five years have tracked exactly with the high-profile arrests of six other key employees from your mother's firm. And then there's Menière, the highest-ranking of them."</p><p>Agnes angrily brushes the tears from her face with the side of her hand. "Think about it for two seconds. Why the fuck would I actively give you more information about the killing if I was the one who did it?"</p><p>Rio's prepared for this one. "So I would trust you and you could steer the investigation!" They're almost yelling at this point. "And it fucking <em>worked</em>!" They suddenly realize they're crying too, full-on. "I'm fine with being outwitted, but I really wish you hadn't slept with me as part of your plan. Probably should have put your cute little gun away before we fucked, by the way."</p><p>Agnes' face shuts down completely, expression completely neutral. "Fuck you," she says coldly. "Get out."</p><p>"You need to come down to the police station with me," Rio says quietly. <em>This is my job</em>, they repeat to themself over and over.</p><p>Agnes barks out a bitter laugh. "You're having the local cops detain me? That's bullshit. I'm not going anywhere with you," Agnes says, still eerily chilly and calm.</p><p>"If you don't come with me, the cops are going to have to come here and pick you up. I—I negotiated this so there wouldn't be a spectacle," Rio says, trying to keep their voice equally flat and dispassionate. They're barely keeping it together.</p><p>"Then they can come here and pick me up. This is a small town, Special Agent Vidal." Ouch. The use of their title and last name hurts. "Everyone's going to know soon anyway. Might as well provide a little entertainment. Because if you think I'm going quietly, you're dumber than I thought."</p><p>Rio inclines their head silently before standing and placing a call to Detective Feltman, staring out the window as they ask him to come over.</p><p>They wait in tense, uncomfortable silence until the slick scrape of tires announces the detective's arrival.</p><p>Rio leaves the house as he enters, nodding to him. As they hurry back to their car through the misty rain, they break down in sobs.</p><p><em>Evidence is evidence</em>, they repeat to themself. Means, motive, opportunity: Agnes has them all. The voice inside them screaming that she's innocent is stupid, soft, weak. They have more than enough to detain her for 24 hours while they finish the investigation. And they <em>need</em> to have her detained right away, or else they're not going to look even remotely impartial. They know better than to think everyone in town isn't aware they're hooking up.</p><p>
<em>Evidence is evidence. This is what professionals do.</em>
</p><p>But if that's true, why does it feel so wrong?</p><hr/><p>Out of all the people who could be pounding on their hotel room door that evening, Billy is far from the top of the list. "What the fuck have you done?" he demands as soon as Rio opens the door. He's devoid of his usual enthusiasm and charm, instead radiating a cold anger.</p><p>Rio shrugs helplessly. "My job, Billy," they say, but they know there isn't much conviction in their voice.</p><p>"Let me in," he says firmly, and they don't have the will to fight him. At least it's their first night in this room, so there's only one pizza box by the trash can. It only looks slightly like a depression nest. Billy strides in, taking off his coat, and flings it over the back of the armchair before sitting down. "The <em>fuck</em> you're doing your job," he snaps. "There's no way Agnes did it. And by the way, I know procedure. You didn't have to get her thrown in jail."</p><p>"I can't discuss the case with you," Rio says tiredly, sitting down on the bed, "but I can say that there's some very compelling evidence—"</p><p>"She. Didn't. Do. It," Billy snaps. "I <em>know</em> her, and I know she's not a fucking murderer."</p><p>"You don't know her as well as you think you do," Rio sighs.</p><p>Billy narrows his eyes. "Are you talking about her being a Harkness?" he asks. He laughs humorlessly when Rio widens their eyes in surprise. "Yeah, Rio, I know. I know you think I'm just a stupid kid, but I know what I'm doing. I found out within the first month she was here." It stings a little bit that he's not calling them "Special Agent Vidal" anymore. That he's not gazing at them with that wide-eyed adoration.</p><p>Rio sighs again. They already fucked this investigation up by letting Agnes in, and they're emotionally exhausted and not quite thinking straight. Working with Agnes has, apparently, ruined them for working alone. So they might as well bring Billy in too. "Do you know who the murder victim in my case is?" they ask.</p><p>He shakes his head, somehow managing to make the gesture belligerent. "How could I? You wouldn't even admit that it was more than a bank robbery until right now."</p><p>"She was Evanora Harkness' former CFO," Rio says tightly. "She was shot with a gun like the one Agnes has. And Agnes doesn't have an alibi for the time of the shooting. Motive, means, opportunity. It's not enough to convict, but it's more than enough to hold her while I do gather the rest of the evidence."</p><p>"God, you're cold," Billy says with disgust. (Rio doesn't feel cold. They're burning up with emotion. But they're here to do their job.) "Okay, explain the motive to me some more. So she's the former CFO of Salem Investment Securities. So what?"</p><p>Rio stares. "So she probably knew something about the company, something that would be within Agnes' interests to keep quiet. This is the kind of thing I need to complete the investigation."</p><p>Billy laughs again, leaning back and looking at the ceiling, and manages to make it sound pained. "Rio, did you bother asking Agnes <em>why</em> she changed her name?"</p><p>They grit their teeth. They refuse to be made to feel guilty by this child. "There were other, more pressing issues to discuss."</p><p>"Well, if you'd bothered," Billy spits, "you would know that she changed her name when she was 16, the second her mother threw her out. Agnes hated Evanora, Rio. And the feeling was mutual. She's spent her entire life trying to get out from under her shadow, and right now, you're making it worse for her than anyone has since Evanora. Agnes has no reason to try and protect Evanora's secrets, let alone <em>kill</em> for them."</p><p>Rio collapses back onto the bed, covering their eyes with their hands. Whatever. Professional boundaries seem nonexistent right now. The feeling sloshing around inside them feels a little bit like nausea and a whole lot like guilt. "She's still our current most likely suspect," they say, but there's no force behind it.</p><p>"So find a likelier one," Billy says firmly. "I'm not happy with you right now, but you're the best chance at getting Agnes released, so I'm going to help you. Get up. We're going to the station."</p><p>Rio would be lying if they didn't admit that Billy's utter conviction gives them a little hope that Agnes might be innocent. Just a little.</p>

<p>Rio spent the hours since leaving Agnes' house moping instead of what they should have been doing, which was continuing the investigation. So in a way, it's nice to have a quietly simmering Billy beside them. His zeal—even if it's aimed in the opposite direction from theirs—reminds them of what they were like early in their career, doggedly pursuing every lead. They need a little bit of that energy right now.</p><p>They pull into the police station's small parking lot. There's only one other car parked there at this time of night, and the mist haloing the streetlamps and station lights gives everything an ethereal yet creepy glow. The officer stationed at the front desk nods absentmindedly at Rio and Billy as they make a beeline for Rio's borrowed office. Small towns are wild. Rio can't imagine a city police station being this quiet, and they especially can't imagine two non-police officers being allowed to just waltz in.</p><p>As soon as they enter the vacant deputy chief's office, Billy picks up a visitor's chair with some effort and drags it around to Rio's side of the desk.</p><p>"Making ourselves right at home, are we?" Rio asks dryly,</p><p>Billy looks up with a venomous glare. "We have work to do, Special Agent Vidal. So take a seat and go over the evidence with me."</p><p>Maybe it's something about being back at their desk that jolts Rio back into work mode, the critical thinking part of their brain finally kicking in. They suddenly realize that it's entirely possible that Billy is Agnes' accomplice. He could have come in with this indignant teen shtick to derail the investigation even further, picking up where Agnes left off. It's really pretty embarrassing how easily Rio has been thrown off by Agnes this week.</p><p>"I can't do that, Billy," they respond flatly. "This is an FBI investigation, and you're a civilian."</p><p>"Agnes was a civilian," Billy says adamantly.</p><p>"Yes," Rio says, "exactly." Choosing to give him a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, they continue, "I get that you're worried about her. And believe me, I don't want her to be our perpetrator either. You got what you wanted—I'm here at my desk now, and I'm going to get to work, okay? But I'm not compromising my investigation any more by bringing in another civilian."</p><p>With an obnoxious, unnecessarily loud screech, Billy drags the chair back along the linoleum, pulling it around to the other side of the desk. "Fine," he says testily. "You don't have to share things with me. But I'm staying." He settles down across from Rio and whips out his phone, starting to poke at the screen like it's personally offended him.</p><p>Rio rolls their eyes. Teens are so dramatic. And what does he think he's going to get out of this, anyway? "Fine," they huff, opening up their laptop.</p><p>It's not particularly easy to focus when those righteously furious eyebrows are frowning at them from the other side of the desk, but Rio gets to work picking out relevant emails from their inbox and marking them for follow-up. Apparently, the various processes Rio set in motion last week have finally come to fruition while they were variously getting railed and moping over the last couple of days, and they have multiple leads to follow.</p><p>Their team back in Newark has finished tracing the unknown phone number that texted Menière with the meeting time and location that led to her demise. It's a prepaid phone card that was purchased at the Eastview Mall Target. A promising lead to follow up on tomorrow morning. And…</p><p>"Holy shit," Rio breathes.</p><p>"What?" Billy asks, sitting up straight and looking up from his phone.</p><p>"They finally finished the analysis of the bank security camera footage," Rio says breathlessly, too excited to remember the resolution they made five minutes ago to stop giving Billy information about the case. "The perp is most likely between five-nine and six feet, 150 to 180 pounds. It wasn't Agnes."</p><p>Billy leaps out of his seat. "I told you!" he says, somehow managing to demonstrate elation and anger at the same time.</p><p>"Settle down," Rio says, as much to themself as to Billy. "This isn't conclusive."</p><p>The giddiness leaves him as quickly as it came. "Oh, come on," he grouses, collapsing back into the chair. "What, now you're saying she's some criminal mastermind and got someone else to do it? Give me a break. This exonerates her. Just let her out of jail!"</p><p>Rio shakes their head. "That was a slip. I shouldn't have told you any of that. The figure on the security camera footage is basically just a shadow. We need more." But even as the words are coming out of their mouth, they can feel a little bit of hope rising in their chest.</p><p>A little bit of hope, and a lot of guilt. If Rio <em>is</em> wrong, that means they've been a massive asshole to Agnes.</p><p>They'll have to cross that bridge when they come to it. Or something.</p><hr/><p>Around 1 am, Rio announces that they've done all they can for the night, and gives Billy a ride back to their hotel so he can pick up his bike.</p><p>"I have work tomorrow, so I can't be on top of you," Billy says, fiddling with his bike lock. "Promise me you'll keep working on the case instead of hiding in your hotel room?" The anger has dissipated now, replaced with a sort of miserable exhaustion, and it softens Rio towards him.</p><p>"I promise," Rio says. <em>I care about her too</em>, they almost add, but they stop themself before the words come out. They shouldn't. They can't.</p><p>It turns out that actually using their brain to keep working on the investigation and catch up on backed-up paperwork was just what they needed to finally fall asleep. They turn on the TV with the intention of watching one episode of Celebrity IOU, but within minutes, they've drifted off into a blissfully dreamless sleep.</p><p>When their alarm blares at 7 am, they actually feel a little rested, which is very welcome after the last few days. Once they've showered and loaded up on the complimentary breakfast, washing down a heaping pile of scrambled eggs and waffles with three cups of mediocre coffee, they feel more like a person than they have since Friday.</p><p>By 7:45, they're already pulling into the Eastview Mall parking lot, ready to get a start on the day's work. The November sun shines weakly down on the old mall, and Rio feels like they just might have a chance of getting somewhere with this investigation today.</p><p>They haven't been in an actual mall in close to a decade, and they're not sure if they've <em>ever</em> been in a mall before 8 am. It's creepy. Most of the stores are shuttered and dark, there's no music playing, and their steps echo as they walk through the atrium.</p><p>Clear on the other side of the ground floor, past the giant fountain, they can see a group of old people walking briskly around the perimeter, pumping their arms and keeping up a constant stream of conversation. Thankfully, Rio's trying to go to Target, which is on this side of the mall, far away from any nosy old folks.</p><p>There's still a giant plastic gate closed over the Target entrance, and they knock on it loudly, craning their neck to see if there are any staff visible. No luck. After a few moments, they knock again, even louder, and call, "Excuse me?"</p><p>No luck.</p><p>They wait another minute—literally count down from 60—and knock again. "Hello?"</p><p>"Oh, they don't open until 8, honey," a voice says from behind them.</p><p>Rio turns to find the entire posse of mall walkers assembled behind them, staring curiously at the crazy person hammering on the obviously closed gate. "I'm aware," Rio says, fighting to keep from rolling their eyes. "I was hoping to speak to their management before the store opened."</p><p>"It's no use," another old lady pipes up. "Trust me, I've tried to get in early to complain about the shameful way they always put clothing on hangers with the wrong size marked on them, and these ungrateful kids won't give me the time of day. Things just aren't the way they used to be. You're just going to have to wait, sweetie."</p><p>The temptation to spell out the difference between a bored senior citizen and an FBI agent is strong, but Rio would rather not wave their badge around if they don't have to—especially not with this doubtless gossipy crew listening to every word. Instead, they give the group a half-smile and set off with no particular destination other than <em>away</em>.</p><p>Basically nothing is open, though, so Rio spends 10 excruciating minutes peering into the window of the nearby Hot Topic. They wrinkle their nose. It's all anime and video game merch now, the window display filled with plushies and cosplay supplies. Not an emo band tee in sight. The old biddy was right about one thing—things really aren't the way they used to be.</p><p>Finally, Rio's saved from the horror of a pair of Bluey high-top sneakers by the loud clacking of the Target gate lifting, and they hurry back to the store entrance.</p><p>"Excuse me!" they call to the red-shirted kid who's trying to walk away as quickly as humanly possible. "Hey, I'm talking to you!"</p><p>The store worker's shoulders slump as he stops walking and turns around. "How can I help you today?" he asks politely, despite his extremely clear desire to be doing anything but talking to Rio. His name tag says "Eddie".</p><p>Rio reaches inside their coat and flashes their badge. "FBI. I'm going to need to see your security tapes for last Sunday, the first, please."</p><p>Eddie's eyes go round. "I have to escalate that to a manager," he says quickly, as if reciting from an employee handbook.</p><p>Rio grits their teeth. "Listen, kid, I don't have time for this. I'm going to get what I want sooner or later, but I'm on a deadline and it's in everyone's best interest if it's sooner. I know you have access to that video here on site. Just let me in to the security office so I can start looking at footage, and <em>then</em> you can call your manager. How's that?"</p><p>He looks at Rio closely, thinks for a few long moments, and then says, "Just…let me make a call really quick."</p><p>RIo has no choice but to stand there and wait as Eddie takes his phone out and turns away from them. He murmurs into the phone, then apparently hears something surprising or—exciting? Either way, he straightens up as he glances back at RIo, a small smile appearing on his face. His speech gets more animated, and then he nods a bunch of times. "Okay. Love you," he says before hanging up.</p><p>"You got a thing going on with your manager?" Rio says, raising their eyebrows. They're not about to judge, especially given their recent indiscretions, but this kid is just a kid.</p><p>Eddie grins. "That wasn't my manager. That was my boyfriend. I think you know him."</p><p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em> Why do people in small towns all have to know each other? Rio sighs. "Aspiring investigator, raccoon eyeliner, doesn't own pants that don't have holes in them?" they ask.</p><p>"The very same," he says, eyes going all soft. "Anyway, he's really mad at you, but he still wants to help—and <em>I</em> want to help—so follow me."</p><p>"He's made that <em>very</em> clear," Rio says dryly, trailing behind Eddie as he enters the security office. It's a tiny, sweltering hot room mostly comprised of monitors. He looks over his shoulder quickly before letting Rio in.</p><p>"Obviously, you're not supposed to be in here, so let's be quick," he whispers as he sits down at the small desk. "Date and time again, please?"</p><p>Rio checks their notepad. "November 1. The purchase was made at 11:54 am, so let's start just before that." They lean against the back wall as Eddie pulls the correct feed up onto the main monitor. Once he has the video up, Rio flaps their hands at him. "Okay, go keep watch outside," they say. "I can take it from here."</p><p>"You sure I can't help?" Eddie asks hopefully.</p><p>Rio rolls their eyes. "You can help by letting me do my job. You and Billy are really made for each other."</p><p>As Eddie steps outside reluctantly, Rio sets to work scrubbing through the footage.</p><p>Nothing, nothing, and then…"No way," they mutter as they see who's checking out at the exact time the prepaid phone card was bought. They rewind a few seconds, then whip out their phone and film the screen just so they have the evidence on hand, then stand and exit the security office, nearly knocking Eddie over.</p><p>"Got what you needed?" he asks, casually steering them away from the office.</p><p>"Yep," Rio says shortly.</p><p>"...care to share?" he follows up with a winning smile.</p><p>Rio snorts. "Your boyfriend wishes. Thank you for your help, Eddie, but I've got to go."</p><p>They swing by the police station to fill Detective Feltman in and invite him along to their next stop. They go in separate cars, and Rio's grateful for the solitude as they turn onto Agnes' street. A knot of grief and guilt settles heavy in their stomach as they pull up to the spot right behind Detective Feltman—which happens to be directly in front of Agnes' house. They clench the steering wheel tight, knuckles white as they will away the tears that threaten to flood their eyes.</p><p>The detective gets out of his car and knocks on their window. "Ready?" he asks.</p><p>Rio opens the car door and steps out, steeling themself. "Let's do it."</p>

<p>Rio takes a long, lingering look at Agnes' house, hope and dread warring in the pit of their stomach. They desperately want this lead to pan out and prove definitively that Agnes is innocent. But there's still a chance she's guilty. (And if she's not guilty, she's going to be furious with Rio.)</p><p>So: a little hope, a lot of dread, and—inescapably—a healthy dose of arousal nudging their cock into fullness as they remember all the things they've done in that house.</p><p>Detective Feltman clears his throat, and Rio packs <em>all</em> of those feelings into a neat little box before following him up the front steps of Ralph Bohner's house.</p><p>Before either Rio or the detective can knock, Mrs. Hart pops up from her front garden, rake in hand. The brim of her sun visor is at least as wide as her head, and she's bundled up in a bright blue puffy jacket that clashes horribly with her magenta scarf.</p><p>"Oh my goodness!" she cries from among her leaf bags. "First Agnes and now poor Ralph? Next thing you know, you're going to be hauling <em>me</em> in!"</p><p>"Just stay out of trouble and you have nothing to worry about, Mrs. Hart," the detective calls with a chuckle before rapping sharply on Ralph's door.</p><p>There's no answer.</p><p>"He's got to be home," Detective Feltman muses. "The man rarely leaves the house."</p><p>"Let's go around," Rio suggests, remembering their last interaction with Ralph and how he had concluded it by slipping creepily in the side door. They lead the way and open the screen door before knocking rapidly. "Mr. Bohner, we know you're in there," they say, cupping their hands around their mouth and putting them against the door. "We just have a couple questions."</p><p>There's a long pause. Then the door creaks open a crack, held mostly shut by a chain. It's dark inside.</p><p>"Mr. Bohner?" Rio asks cautiously.</p><p>A wide, wild-looking, dark brown eye appears out of the gloom. "Can you protect me?" Ralph whispers, almost too quietly for Rio to hear. "I'll talk if you protect me."</p><p>Rio raises their eyebrows. "Depends on what I'm protecting you from, and what information you have for me," they say softly.</p><p>The eye moves rapidly from side to side, and Rio assumes he's shaking his head. "Not here," he hisses. "I need a guarantee of protection."</p><p>Rio's still not sure what Ralph's deal is, but it's very possible that he's a murderer, and these games are getting old. They're rapidly running out of patience. "Come on down to the station with me and the good detective here and we'll see what we can do," they say curtly.</p><p>The eye draws back. There's a long silence, and then it reappears. "Pretend to arrest me," Ralph mutters.</p><p>Rio exchanges a look with Detective Feltman. "Um. What?"</p><p>"I want out. I'm ready to be done with all of this. But I can't be seen voluntarily cooperating with you," he continues. "If you want my intel, pretend to arrest me."</p><p>"Do it," Rio says to the detective. When he hesitates, they say, "If you get any heat for this, say it was my idea. Federal overreach and all that. Just—do it." They'll be damned if they let Ralph slip away.</p><p>"I don't like this," Detective Feltman says to both of them, but he takes a pair of handcuffs off his belt anyway.</p><p>The door closes slightly and there's a rattle as Ralph undoes the chain. Detective Feltman quickly shoulders the door open and puts the cuffs on Ralph, who blinks rapidly as he's escorted into the sunlight.</p><p>Mrs. Hart watches avidly from her yard, not even pretending to rake anymore as the three of them emerge from the side of the house, Detective Feltman pushing Ralph ahead of him. Ralph's doing a convincing job of acting, struggling a little as the detective marches him to the waiting squad car.</p><p>"Be careful, Ralphie!" Mrs. Hart calls as Detective Feltman shoves Ralph into the back of the car. She keeps her eye on Detective Feltman and Rio's cars until they reach the end of the block and turn the corner.</p><hr/><p>"I would like to be in a room with no windows, please," Ralph says as soon as they get into the police station.</p><p>"I really wouldn't be making demands if I were your position," Rio says testily.</p><p>Detective Feltman shrugs. "He's not actually under arrest, Special Agent Vidal." <em>For now</em>, Rio thinks hotly. "I mean, it's not comfortable," the detective continues, "but we can go down to the basement."</p><p>And that's how Rio ends up conducting an interrogation while perched uncomfortably on an overturned bucket in the dim, damp basement of the Westview police station. Ralph and Detective Feltman each sit on an old crate. The fluorescent light flickers every 26 seconds—Rio couldn't help but start counting after the first few times it happened.</p><p>Now that he's underground and away from the possibility of prying eyes, Ralph seems to relax a little bit. His posture straightens, his eyes don't shift around as much, and his speech patterns seem more normal.</p><p>"Thank you for indulging me," he's saying. "I know it seems paranoid, but she really does have eyes and ears everywhere. She knows things she shouldn't know. And she's scary when she gets mad. I know everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I can't tell you how serious I am when I say she will murder me if she finds out I'm talking. I really need you to prot—"</p><p>"You keep saying 'she' and we don't know who you're referring to," Rio interrupts. The countdown to Agatha's impending release is ticking down relentlessly, and they need some kind of new information before she gets out of detention. Their patience has all but worn out.</p><p>"My neighbor!" Ralph replies, looking pained.</p><p>Rio's heart is in their throat as they croak, "Agnes O'Connor?"</p><p>The next moment feels like it's years long, Rio's ears ringing with nervousness and fear. What if he says yes? It's only then that they realize just how much they've gotten their hopes up that Agnes is innocent.</p><p>"What? No!" Ralph exclaims with genuine confusion, and Rio heaves a huge sigh. They feel like they're going to pass out. "No, my other neighbor," Ralph continues.</p><p>"Wait. Mrs. Hart?" Detective Feltman asks incredulously.</p><p>"I mean, that's not her real name, but yes," Ralph says. "I'll tell you everything. But you have to promise to put me in witness protection or something."</p><p>"Yes, yes, we can protect you," Rio says quickly, motioning for Ralph to hurry things along. They feel like they're about to start climbing out of their skin.</p><p>"We can't promise you immunity from criminal charges," Detective Feltman cuts in warningly.</p><p>"Oh, I don't care about that," Ralph says. "I've done some pretty horrible things. I deserve to be held accountable for them. And prison might be safer for me than the outside world if she's still running around out there."</p><p>"Tell us what you know," Rio says, raising their voice a little. "We'll figure out details later." If they get out of this without outright yelling at Ralph, it'll be a miracle.</p><p>"Okay, okay," Ralph says, putting his hands up appeasingly. "So. It makes sense that you thought Agnes did it. That's what Mrs. Hart wanted. She <em>hates</em> Agnes. Something about her mom?"</p><p>"One of Evanora's investors, probably," Rio murmurs.</p><p>"I don't know, I was just the errand boy," Ralph shrugs. "So it started off as just little things. I would help her out around the house and stuff. It was when she asked me to go buy the gun that I started freaking out."</p><p>"Where is the gun now?" Rio interjects.</p><p>Ralph shakes his head despairingly. "I don't know. She made me give it to her after—you know. I shouldn't have done that. It's registered to me. She said she knew the perfect place to dispose of it, but I wouldn't be surprised if she's going to try and set me up."</p><p>Rio sits back. "Okay. So she asked you to buy the gun and you freaked out. What happened next?"</p><p>"She th-threatened me," Ralph says, hunching into himself again. "Told me she'd find someone else to kill me <em>and</em> her target. So I did it. I bought the gun, I bought the ammo. She had me buy a prepaid phone card so she could contact that woman anonymously."</p><p>Rio takes note of him volunteering the phone card information. There's no way he could know that that's how Rio found him. As a result, their voice is a little gentler when they say, "And what happened the day of the bank robbery?"</p><p>"I just did what she told me to do," he says. His voice is plaintive, almost childish. "I went to the bank. I handed a note to the teller. The teller gave me a bag of cash. I turned around and Mrs. Hart was right there, watching me. She nodded towards the woman. It all happened so fast. I shot her and ran, but not before I looked back and saw Mrs. Hart's face. She looked so…satisfied."</p><p>"What did you get out of all this, Ralph?" Detective Feltman asks, leaning forward. "I mean, why go through with killing someone? Why not come to us sooner?"</p><p>Ralph shakes his head helplessly. "At first, it was because I wanted to help. I—I have a hard time talking to people. I was lonely. And she listened to me like the things I said actually mattered. So I figured the least I could do was help her out when she asked me to. Then, like I said, she told me she'd have me killed. I mean, I <em>tried</em> to tell you before it happened. I left a note on your car."</p><p>Detective Feltman looks perplexed. Then, suddenly, a recollection appears to hit him. "The soggy napkin on my windshield Friday morning," he says. "Ralph, the ink had run everywhere and the napkin was falling to shreds. I meant you should have actually spoken to us."</p><p>Ralph runs his hands through his hair. "I realize that now. It just didn't seem like a viable option at the time. Now that the Feds are involved, I feel like my chances of surviving being a snitch are a little higher."</p><p>Rio sighs. "I'll make some calls. We can probably get someone to take you to a temporary safe house while we work things out." They turn to the detective. "I'm sold. Call the jail and have them release Agnes right now. I'm heading back to Mrs. Hart's."</p><p>"She's not stupid," Ralph says tiredly. "She'll be gone by now. On the road, plotting my death."</p><hr/><p>Unfortunately, Ralph is right. It's been less than an hour, but Mrs. Hart is nowhere to be found. The Westview cops put out an APB for her car, but Rio has a feeling it's not going to be that easy to find her.</p><p>That means Rio's next priority is something they feel desperately ambivalent about: they walk down the street and sit down on Agnes' stoop, trying to figure out what to say.</p><p>An hour later, Agnes arrives home in the back of a cop car. She looks like hell.</p><p>She's wearing the same ratty sweats she was in when Rio had her carted off to jail, her hair's a mess, and she looks even more sleep-deprived than she did the previous day.</p><p>Rio supposes they deserve it, but it still hurts when Agnes walks up the steps and unlocks her front door without so much as looking at them.</p><p>They stand, wincing as feeling comes back into their legs, and put their hand on the doorknob before she can shut the door. "Agnes…" they say softly.</p><p>She wrenches the door so that their hand slips off the knob and slams it shut. They hear the thunk of the deadbolt.</p><p>Foolishly, Rio didn't anticipate this possibility while they were freezing their ass off and ruminating on Agatha's porch steps. They were expecting more yelling, maybe some crying. Not being iced out completely.</p><p>They stand there for a long couple of minutes, chewing their chapped lips and trying to figure out what to do next. They don't want to be creepy, don't want to bang on the door endlessly or sit out here in the cold hoping she feels sorry for them. (Well. They <em>want</em> to do those things. They just know they're not a good idea.)</p><p>Finally, Rio walks down the steps slowly, hoping the entire time that the door will open behind them and Agnes will tell them to come in. But she doesn't.</p>

<p>Rio's not too proud to admit when they need help, so they get in their car and drive to Burgerburg.</p><p>They're fully aware that Billy isn't happy with them, but they hold out a tiny bit of hope that he might be a little more charitably inclined now that Agnes is out of jail.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>"You want me to <em>what</em>?" Billy asks incredulously. "She's mad at you because you baselessly threw her in jail! <em>I'm </em>mad at you because you baselessly threw her in jail! Why would I help you?"</p><p>"I don't know, Billy. I…"</p><p>Rio trails off as they take stock of what's happening right now. They're 42 years old, standing at the counter of a burger joint, basically pleading with a teenager to help them get a girl's attention. And being rejected. <em>Pathetic.</em></p><p>But they have nothing left to lose, so they take a deep breath and continue talking. "I had to do something that I did not want to do, even though it was my job. And it hurt her." They swallow. "I want to fix it."</p><p>"Bullshit," Billy snaps. "You didn't <em>have</em> to do anything. You made a choice, and it was a bad one."</p><p>"I <em>know</em>," Rio says miserably. "I'm just asking you to help me get a foot in the door so I can apologize for that bad choice."</p><p>"Fair point. It might make Agnes maybe 1 percent less mad if you get off your high FBI horse and admit that you made the wrong call because you were overcorrecting for sleeping with her," Billy says snidely.</p><p>Rio flinches. "That's not what happened," they say halfheartedly. But deep down, they know it's true.</p><p>Billy just shakes his head. He jerks his chin towards the door, where a couple of people are currently walking in. "I have customers. Anyway, have you <em>met</em> Agnes? If she doesn't want to talk to you, she doesn't want to talk to you. I'm not going to be able to talk her into it." When Rio just stands there, looking helplessly at him, he adds, "<em>Goodbye</em>, Rio."</p><p>Faced with no other choice, Rio slinks out of Burgerburg, looking and feeling defeated. It's still drizzling and miserable, and Rio turns on the engine and blasts the heat as they try to figure out their next move.</p><p>They feel like they're a teenager again, going from acquaintance to acquaintance trying to figure out how to sit at the same lunch table as Heather MacIntosh. (They try not to dwell too much on the fact that even after all their efforts, she hadn't given them the time of day, and they'd been reduced to pining for the last two and a half years of high school.)</p><p>Back in the day, Rio had tried to befriend Heather's friends. But who are Agnes' friends? Does she even have any in town?</p><p>It hits Rio suddenly that they don't know her very well at all. They recognize that their current behavior is objectively foolish: expending all of this time and energy trying to win back a woman they've known for all of 10 days when there's a murderous mastermind on the loose.</p><p>In their defense, there are no immediate indicators of where Mrs. Hart might have gone. Is it possible that Rio should be working a little harder to find some more of those indicators? Possibly. But, they justify, they're not going to be in peak investigating form until this whole Agnes situation is taken care of anyway.</p><p>It's with that train of thought that they have a brainwave. There is one person Agnes has mentioned and Rio hasn't met yet.</p><hr/><p>Rio pulls up in front of an old house that has been converted into a small office building. There's a hodgepodge of crooked little signs displaying the names of the businesses within, the paint peeling from most.</p><p>They get out and hurry onto the covered porch, doing their best not to get too wet. They ring one of the eight doorbells stuck haphazardly to the doorframe, and a minute or two later, they hear footsteps coming down the stairs.</p><p>The door creaks open, and a woman with curly gray hair stands in the doorway. She's wearing a tunic, wide-legged pants, and a fringed shawl, all in clashing shades of orange and yellow and turquoise. "Special Agent Vidal," she says, nodding and stepping aside to let RIo in. "I was wondering when I'd get to meet you."</p><p>Rio's thrown off. "You…were?"</p><p>"I've heard a lot about you from Agnes," says Lilia Calderu, gesturing for Rio to follow her up the stairs. "Mostly glowing, until it became so full of vitriol I'm not actually sure what she was trying to say about you."</p><p>They enter a tiny office that's packed to the brim with filing cabinets and loose folders. The only clear spot is the desk chair. The desk itself and the two visitors' chairs in front of it are both piled high with papers, and Rio's not sure how this woman gets anything done.</p><p>Lilia takes a pile from one of the chairs and shifts it to the floor. "Sit, sit," she says, waving at the chair. "I'll get you a cup of tea."</p><p>Before Rio can say anything (like, perhaps, "I'm not a huge fan of tea"), she's disappeared down the hall.</p><p>While they wait for Lilia, they don't have much to do besides take stock of the room. There are dusty framed diplomas on one wall (B.A. from Rutgers, J.D. from Seton Hall, LL.M. from Columbia), while another is covered entirely by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Lilia's book collection is eclectic: there are plenty of legal reference books, but the shelves are also filled with knick-knacks and what look to be trashy romance novels.</p><p>Rio's about to reach for <em>Divining the Devil's Desires</em> when Lilia returns. They snatch their hand back and return to their seat guiltily. They haven't done anything wrong, per se, but while Lilia is friendly enough, she has strong school principal vibes that set Rio a little bit on edge.</p><p>"Here you go," Lilia says, handing Rio a delicate teacup perched on an honest-to-God saucer. Both cup and saucer are rimmed with gold, the surfaces decorated with intricately painted suns and moons and stars.</p><p>Rio sniffs surreptitiously at the tea. It doesn't smell all that bad—floral, but not cloyingly so. They take a sip and are pleasantly surprised by how fragrant it is. "Thank you," they say, and they mean it genuinely.</p><p>Lilia settles herself on her desk chair before folding her hands and fixing Rio with a stern look. "Now, Special Agent Vidal, I have several bones to pick with you."</p><p>"Fair enough," Rio says sheepishly, inspecting the patterns on their teacup in order to avoid Lilia's gaze.</p><p>"I know you're aware of the class action suit I've filed against Kale Kare and its owner, Jennifer Kale," Lilia begins matter-of-factly. "It would have been nice to have a heads-up before my only investigator was thrown in jail and my case was put in jeopardy."</p><p>Rio blinks a couple of times. Is she actually saying that her skincare lawsuit should have been on Rio's radar during their <em>murder investigation</em>? They realize their mouth has actually fallen open, and they shut it quickly. "I'm…sorry," they say slowly. "Your lawsuit wasn't quite, uh, top of mind for me."</p><p>Lilia sucks her teeth and pushes on. "I had to call in a number of favors to keep the information from leaking to the Eastview Sheriff's Department and from there to that Alice Wu-Gulliver."</p><p>Rio decides not to reveal that Alice and Jennifer were the ones who tipped them off about Agnes. Instead: "Again, I'm very sorry about that, Ms. Calderu."</p><p>"Lilia, please," she says with a frown and a shake of her head. "Anyway, that's water under the bridge now. I haven't received any notice of motions to disqualify evidence obtained by Agnes, and she's home safe. Good timing there, by the way. You saved me a trip down to the jail."</p><p>The words "um, thanks" are barely out of Rio's mouth when Lilia barrels forward.</p><p>"Now, that's the <em>only</em> thing you've done right in the last couple of days," she says severely. "I am astounded by how badly you've bungled this investigation <em>and</em> your relationship with Agnes. She hasn't had an easy life. She made herself vulnerable to you. And this is how you repay her?"</p><p>Rio's embarrassed to realize that they're tearing up. "I know," they choke out quietly, still not meeting Lilia's gaze.</p><p>She sighs, voice becoming a little gentler. "I have the strong feeling that you've fallen hard for her. The way you've conducted the investigation wasn't incompetence, was it? It was sheer panic once you realized you might have been carrying on with the perpetrator of the crime you were investigating."</p><p>"Billy called it overcorrection," Rio says begrudgingly. They slide down a little in their chair, feeling stupid and chastened.</p><p>"That kid has a good head on his shoulders," Lilia says. "And I'm sure you do, too, most of the time."</p><p>Rio groans quietly. "I know I've been an idiot. I know I hurt her really badly. I just want to tell her I'm sorry, but she won't even look at me, let alone listen to me."</p><p>"And you want me to talk her into hearing you out," Lilia says. It's not a question.</p><p>"Well, yes," Rio says. Their tea is empty, and they take to swirling the dregs around, watching the patterns they make in the bottom of the cup. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but it looks like the sediment settles into the outline of a heart.</p><p>Lilia leans over her desk and takes a long, hard look at Rio. "All right," she says after a long silence. "You're a law enforcement officer who's willing to admit when they're wrong and take action to make things right. That counts for a lot in my book." She stands up. "Let's go, then."</p><p>Rio's eyes widen. "Wh— Now?"</p><p>Lilia rolls her eyes. "Yes, now, unless you'd rather stew for an entire night and drive yourself crazy before we go speak to her."</p><p>"I guess that makes sense," Rio mutters. They awkwardly set the teacup and saucer down on top of one of Lilia's piles before following her out the door.</p><p>"We'll take my car," Lilia says.</p><p>Taking charge comes naturally to her—she doesn't even consider that Rio might have alternate thoughts or opinions—so she looks surprised when Rio asks, "Why?"</p><p>"Because if she sees your car, I doubt she'll open the door," Lilia says, unlocking her beat-up old VW Golf. Rio has to admit this makes sense and gets into the passenger seat after shoving an attaché case and several old food wrappers into the back seat to make room.</p><p>Rio starts feeling nauseous with anxiety as they approach Agnes' house. <em>Maybe I should just leave Westview and forget about all of this</em>, they think wildly.</p><p>But the only thing more frightening than facing Agnes right now is the prospect of never seeing her again.</p><p>"Sit tight," Lilia says as she screeches to a stop roughly in front of Agnes' house. She's left the car at a severe angle, the front almost mounting the curb while the back is a full two feet away. Rio bites their tongue as Lilia gets out of the car and walks purposefully up to Agnes' door.</p><p>Rio sinks down in their seat, peering over the edge of the window. Lilia rings the doorbell and knocks three times before Agnes finally comes to the door, looking disheveled and disgruntled. She's at least wearing a different sweatshirt than she was previously, and her hair is damp, as if she's just gotten out of the shower. The two exchange some heated words before Agnes' shoulders slump and she reluctantly steps aside to let Lilia in.</p><p>The ensuing 15 minutes feel like hours to Rio. It gives them plenty of time to second-guess what they're doing here. Is it too late to get out of the car and run away? They curse the suburbs: while it was only a 10-minute drive on the highway from Lilia's office, it would be a very, very long and dangerous walk back to their car. And once again, they have to admit that if they left right now, they'd just end up back here again in a day or two.</p><p>They want to get out and pace, at the very least, but that might make Lilia's plan backfire—so their nervous energy has nowhere to go. They stay put, hugging their knees to their chest in the passenger seat and chewing hard at their lip, a habit they'd worked hard to break in their 20s. <em>What the hell are they talking about in there?</em> Rio wonders. </p><p>Finally, Lilia opens the door to the house and waves Rio over. They take a slow, deep breath before getting out of the car and walking up to the house on wobbly legs. They're not sure they've ever been this nervous in their life.</p><p>As soon as Rio passes the threshold, Lilia steps neatly out of the house. "Good luck," she says with a wink before quickly shutting the door behind her.</p><p>And Rio is left standing in the entryway, heart hammering so hard they swear they can feel it throughout their entire body.</p><p>Agnes is sitting slumped at the kitchen counter, head propped on her hand, idly trailing a spoon through a half-drunk cup of coffee. She doesn't look up as Rio hesitantly steps closer.</p><p>"Hi," they say softly. She doesn't respond. They arrive at the counter and try, "Can I sit?"</p><p>She shrugs and vaguely waves her hand at the stool, which Rio takes as a yes. She still hasn't looked at them, concentrating intently on her coffee.</p><p>Well, there's nothing for it but to say what they came here to say. "Agnes, I'm so, so sorry for how I treated you. I'm so sorry for having you detained. I—I say this to explain, not as an excuse: I didn't want to admit it, but I was afraid that my feelings for you were clouding my judgment, making me see you in too positive a light. So I went way too far in the other direction. I was trying so hard to be professional that I did something <em>un</em>professional. My feelings did cloud my judgment, but in the opposite way than I thought they would. You don't have to respond—I just…I just wanted to say this to your face."</p><p>Agnes is very, very still. At some point, she let her spoon fall with a <em>clink</em> into the mug, and her hands are now laced together tightly on the counter, knuckles white as she stares down at them. She doesn't respond for a long moment, and Rio shifts, getting ready to stand and leave.</p><p>Right before they stand, she opens her mouth. "I shouldn't forgive you," she says. Her voice is rough, as if she's been crying.</p><p>"I know. I have no right to want that," Rio says quickly.</p><p>"Let me finish, please," Agnes says, sounding exhausted. Rio sits back, chagrined. "I shouldn't forgive you," she repeats, "but I do. I'm angry, I'm hurt, but mostly…<em>I miss you</em>."</p><p>Rio opens their mouth and then shuts it. They're going to let her keep talking, but—what does she mean by this? Could she possibly—</p><p>"You make me crazy." She finally looks up at Rio with a sigh. Her eyes are pink and puffy. "Rio, I never, <em>ever</em> let people in. I let my guard down around you and you hurt me, the way every person I've ever been vulnerable with has hurt me. And yet I haven't been able to stop thinking about you." She unlaces her fingers, tentatively reaches a hand across the table. Rio takes it in both of theirs, holding Agnes' hand like it's something precious. Because it is.</p><p>"You don't have to give me another chance," Rio says, their heart in their throat. "But I promise that if you do, I will do my best never to hurt you again. And I'll never hurt you like <em>that</em> again."</p><p>Agnes squeezes Rio's hand and says, voice grave, "If you ever fuck up like this again, I will never be able to trust you."</p><p>Rio nods eagerly but silently. They're afraid that if they speak, they'll break this fragile peace that's just starting to come into existence.</p><p>With a sigh, Agnes lets go. "All of that said, I've had a very long couple of days, and I need some time and space. Thank you for coming by and saying that. Don't tell Lilia, but I'm glad she talked me into letting you in."</p><p>It hurts Rio to hear that Agnes wants them to leave so soon after they arrived, but they know it's more than fair. "Of course," they say quickly, jumping up from their stool. Then they look out the window and pause. "Um. Lilia gave me a ride here, but it looks like she left. Would you—would you mind driving me back to her office so I can pick up my car?"</p><p>Agnes winces. "Honestly? I…<em>really</em> want you right now. And I don't know if I can hold back if I'm in a confined space with you for much longer. I promise I'll be in touch soon, but you're going to have to make your own way back."</p><p>When Agnes says "I really want you," the sudden strength of the longing in Rio's heart and their cock blows them away. They squeeze their thighs together as they say, breathlessly, "Yeah, of course. Yes."</p><p>And when they get back to their hotel after a dazed Uber ride to Lilia's office, they—for once—don't fuck themself silly while imagining what they might do to Agnes (or what she might do to them) the next time they see her. It's hard to resist, but they want the next time they come to be at her hands.</p><p>Instead, they flop into bed with a huge sigh and then just lie there, aching, aching, aching.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The following days are filled with research and legwork to try and figure out Mrs. Hart's identity. Periods of solid work are punctuated by Rio checking their phone every time the thought occurs to them or they convince themself they felt it buzz in their pocket. Every time, there's no notification from Agnes.</p><p>When Rio's not checking their phone, though, they learn a lot. They're once again reminded that they're pretty damn good at their job the majority of the time—that is, when they're not being lovesick and insane.</p><p>From what Ralph said during his interrogation—that "Mrs. Hart" had mentioned something about Agnes' mother—Rio thinks it's pretty likely that their perp was a victim of Evanora Harkness' Ponzi scheme. Luckily, the case against Salem Investment Securities was largely conducted by the FBI, and it's not difficult for Rio to gain access to the information.</p><p>Any advantage ease of access might give them, though, is tempered by the sheer volume of files. Salem Investment Securities was the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a huge case with a correspondingly huge bank of evidence. Takeout boxes and coffee cups begin to pile up around Rio in their borrowed office at the police station, and the local cops quickly learn that they won't get much out of Rio by way of conversation.</p><p>Rio's also slowed down somewhat because they can't help but get sidetracked by the tidbits they find about Agnes in the company records. There's an Agatha Harkness listed as an intern every summer between 12 and 15 years ago. The most recent records, from what must have been just before Agnes' senior year of college, show her taking responsibility for a handful of accounts herself. It looks like Agnes was being set up to work at the company—there's even a letter offering her the position of account executive in her file, listing a start date of June 1 the year she graduated from college.</p><p>After that, though, there's nothing about Agatha Harkness at all. All the files Rio's able to access are marked as having been recovered, meaning they were purged from the company's file systems at one point.</p><p>It does seem like "Mrs. Hart" was particularly invested in attacking Agnes, so on a hunch, Rio downloads the files for all of the accounts Agnes personally handled as an intern over a decade ago. They filter out all the clients who were no longer with Salem by the time the company went under and end up with a very short list—just four people.</p><p>Once they send that list back to their team in Newark to start running down possibilities, they turn back to Agnes' very limited paper trail. If she's not going to call them…well, this isn't <em>completely</em> unrelated to their investigation.</p><p>(Okay, they're obsessed. They can at least admit that quietly to themself. But, they rationalize, it's less weird to put the resources of the Federal Bureau of Investigation towards investigating the person you're interested in than to lie in bed masturbating about her. Or something.)</p><p>Combing through public records, they find the court order for Agnes' name change, dated the same June she was supposed to start working at her mother's firm. Over the following seven years, it seems, she lived in various apartments in Brooklyn, working minimum wage jobs and hovering around the poverty line. There are a handful of minor violations listed—speeding tickets, drinking alcohol in a public park, and "unreasonable noise"—but nothing close to even the shoplifting charges she racked up in high school.</p><p>Things changed drastically five years ago. Rio cross-checks the records, and—yes. Within three months of Evanora Harkness' arrest and the collapse of Salem Investment Securities, Agnes left her last Brooklyn apartment, and has had no fixed address since then.</p><p>It's a fun little puzzle to keep Rio's mind occupied while they wait for more information on their actual list of suspects. (They studiously ignore the fact that it's past 7 pm, a wholly reasonable time to go back to their hotel room.) They find traces of Agnes' presence all over the map for the last five years: from Massachusetts to Arizona, then Wisconsin and Florida, then Arkansas and Southern California.</p><p>Picking at a Burgerburg salad, their need for nutrients having outweighed their moral opposition to getting salads at a burger joint, Rio ruminates for a little while over what could have driven this sudden desire to jaunt around the country.</p><p>Suddenly, that last location tickles something in their brain—something Detective Feltman mentioned right after Rio first met Agnes. <em>She was out in Southern California before this. Called up a buddy of mine in Huntington Beach… He told me she's legit, helped them take down a scammer who was raising money from pretending to have cancer.</em></p><p>It's not hard to find news articles about the case, which got national coverage, including a three-part Hulu documentary series. The scammer was Mary Crawford, a respectable-seeming mother of two who went through increasingly elaborate ruses to convince people in her community that she had breast cancer, then leukemia, then eye cancer. She raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for supposed experimental treatments, somehow continuing the ruse for three full years.</p><p>Earlier this year, the local police came across a trove of evidence demonstrating that she was making it all up. The media coverage doesn't say how they came into possession of this evidence. That was earlier this year, and Crawford was convicted of wire fraud just a few months ago.</p><p>Rio physically reels as they go through Crawford's biography. Something stands out very clearly: right up until her move to Huntington Beach five years ago, Mary Crawford was the head of human resources at none other than Salem Investment Securities.</p><p>With that information in hand, they think they have a pretty clear picture of how the Huntington Beach Police Department might have gotten their hands on a complete dossier of proof that Crawford was running a scam.</p><p>Out of curiosity, Rio looks up the remainder of Salem Investment Securities' C-suite and discovers a string of arrests going back five years. Before Huntington Beach, Agnes was in Little Rock, where former Chief of Staff Inola Todd was pulling in tens of thousands of dollars a month catfishing unsuspecting suckers. In Miami, she happened to be there at the same time as the arrest of a ransomware developer who used to be Salem's Chief Technology Officer. Milwaukee? The old Chief Marketing Officer was making claims that her nutritional supplement was FDA-approved for the treatment of dementia. Tucson, former Chief Counsel, an online store selling very expensive and very nonexistent luxury goods.</p><p>And the splashiest case of all was Agnes' first: the revelation that a fast-growing, big-budget, high-profile Massachusetts animal welfare nonprofit was actually the money laundering scheme of one Joey Roland, who had just come off a decade-long stint as Salem's Chief Operations Officer.</p><p>Rio sits back and lets out a low, impressed whistle, even though there's nobody to listen except the silent room and maybe the one officer on duty at the front desk at 2 am—if she's not asleep. It seems that Agnes' entire career as a private investigator has consisted of taking down the former leadership of her mother's old company.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's nothing for them to <em>do</em> with this revelation right now. It doesn't get them any closer to finding "Mrs. Hart," and they can't talk to Agnes about it, because as much as they want to show up clawing at her front door, they're determined to respect her wish for space.</p><p>Resigned, Rio stands up, brushing crumbs off their wrinkled suit and wincing as they stretch. The tightness in their neck seems to have become permanent, wrapping its way around their skull and making their head throb. Maybe going back to the hotel and getting some rest isn't a bad idea.</p><hr/><p>They're rewarded for their (relatively) healthy decision-making when they wake up at 7 am to a text from Agnes.</p><p>
<strong>Agnes O'Connor</strong>
</p><p>
<em>5:31 am</em>
</p><p>come over when you're up?</p><p>Rio almost drops their phone in their haste to reply, "On my way!" There's an actual spring in their step as they shower and get ready for the day. They take a little more time than strictly necessary adjusting their suit, making sure their shirt looks perfect under their jacket. By the time they get in their car, they're nearly vibrating out of excitement and nerves.</p><p>The coffees they pick up on the way probably won't help with that, but it seems like the least they can do.</p><p>When Agnes opens her door, they realize they're not alone in their ambivalent anxiety: she looks pale, nauseous, and radiant all at the same time. She's dressed casually, but just a little too nicely for this early in the morning. Rio's seen her at this time before, and her hair is too neat, her plush velour bathrobe a little too unwrinkled. (It's also <em>wide</em> open at the collar, and Rio finds themself getting a little heated that the whole street is getting a free show.)</p><p>They clear their throat. "Hey," they say weakly, offering a small smile.</p><p>Agnes pauses for a moment, then lunges forward to press her lips to Rio's briefly. "Hi," she whispers against their mouth.</p><p>Something that's been clenched around Rio's heart for days finally relaxes. Their strained little quirk of the lips turns into a real grin. "I missed you," they say, a little of the past days' angst lifting.</p><p>"Me too," Agnes says, and as she stands back to let them in, Rio can see their own relief and growing giddiness reflected on her face.</p><p>The silence that follows still feels a little stilted, though, and Rio thrusts one of the coffees forward. "Here," they say awkwardly. "For you." They can feel their ears turning hot.</p><p>Agnes takes it wordlessly and leads Rio into the living room, sprawling out on an armchair. As they perch on the sofa, Rio tries not to look at the gap where Agnes' robe falls open between her splayed knees. She catches them not-looking.</p><p>"Ever the gentleman," she says, smirking as she takes a little sip of her coffee. Her tongue traces over her bottom lip, possibly to catch an errant drop of coffee. Or possibly to torture Rio. They shift in their seat, parting their own legs a little in a fruitless bid to relieve the quickly mounting pressure against their cock.</p><p>"So, uh," Rio begins, trying desperately to sound casual and normal, "I came across some interesting information about you while I was looking into 'Mrs. Hart.'"</p><p>That casts an immediate chill on the room. Agnes' eyes narrow and she sits up a little, rearranging herself so she's not so open to Rio. She opens her mouth—</p><p>"Wait, fuck," Rio says, wide-eyed and suddenly realizing that this sounds a hell of a lot like the last conversation they had with Agnes before she got locked up. They run hot and cold with utter mortification. "No, this isn't a lead-in to me accusing you again. Fuck! No, I just wanted to—" They set their coffee cup on the end table a little too hand and bury their face in their hands, heedless of the small splash of coffee that's slowly dripping down their wrist.</p><p>"Wanted to what?" Agnes asks. She sounds a little suspicious, but mostly curious.</p><p>Rio takes the chance of peeking up from their hands. She's leaning forward, looking at them intently, the top of her robe falling—<em>don't look, Vidal.</em> They put their face back in their hands for a second and then look off toward the window. "I wanted to tell you that going after every member of your mother's firm's leadership team and getting them all arrested is absolutely deranged. And also extremely hot."</p><p>Agnes relaxes, grinning smugly. "Does bringing justice to scammers get your little FBI cock all hot and bothered?"</p><p>"Hey, watch yourself," Rio says, their sternness a little playful, a little not.</p><p>They see it hit her like a physical object, the way her eyes glaze and her throat bobs. They think for a second, and then decide they want to draw this out a little longer before they do what they really want to do, which is rip that robe open and cover Agnes' chest in bite marks.</p><p>So they continue, as if their last remark was normal and not at all charged, "You did a good job covering your tracks. It took some doing to connect you with all of those arrests." They pick their coffee up and do their best to wipe away the droplets that splashed everywhere. "I do wish you'd just been forthcoming from the start, though. It would have been good evidence in your favor that you turned the other six in and let them face justice through the courts instead of killing them."</p><p>"Most people wouldn't see it that way," Agnes scoffs with a dismissive wave. "You're right—I guess you wouldn't have broken my trust so badly if I had trusted you first—but how was I supposed to know that?"</p><p>The bitterness and tension are reentering the conversation, and this isn't how Rio wants things to go. In a bid to ease the mood, Rio says hurriedly, "So, when you told me way back on the first day we met that you were a hundred percent certain that your client didn't kill Menière, you actually <em>could</em> be certain. Because your client is you."</p><p>There's a knowing look in Agnes' eye. She knows they're trying to keep things light, and indulges them. "Yup, guilty. Of <em>not</em> killing her, that is," she says with a wink.</p><p>Rio laughs a little harder than is warranted. They're off-balance, out of sorts. This is <em>awkward</em>. Even though Agnes has made it pretty damn clear that she wants them here, the weight of what they've done is too heavy to leave their mind for long. They're here, but they don't know how to act.</p><p>"Listen," Agnes says, taking Rio's hand, grounding them. "It sounds like you don't have anything conclusive on Mrs. Hart yet." She squeezes. "Let's stop talking shop."</p><p>Rio nods jerkily, suddenly very nervous. "Yeah," they croak, tightening their hand even harder around Agnes'. "Okay."</p><p>"I have—requests," Agnes says, looking Rio in the eye. Her eyes are so blue, blazing like a desert sky. "I need you to prove you still want me." She rubs lightly at Rio's hand for a while with her thumb, cheeks pinkening. They get a little dizzy and realize they're holding their breath, completely unclear on where this is going.</p><p>She finally takes a deep breath and says, "I want to fight you."</p><p>This doesn't elucidate things at all. Rio frowns. "Wait, what? How does that—" They pause for a second. "Say more about that."</p><p>"Like…" Agnes scrunches her face up for a second, thinking, and Rio can't help the rush of affection that goes through them at how <em>cute</em> she is like this. "I want you to try and do things to me, and I want to fight back, and I want you to overpower me," she continues. "Again and again, until I can't fight back anymore and have no choice but to <em>take it</em>. Keep going after me, even when I push you away."</p><p>Rio sits with that for a moment, just gazing at Agnes. Their lips are parted, their heart thrumming. They're far from expert at navigating the overall emotional mire they set up for themself and Agnes. But this? This, they know how to do.</p><p>No time like the present. They nod once, sharply, then withdraw their hand roughly from Agnes', scooting to a spot on the couch that has a clear spot of rug in front of it.</p><p>They snap their fingers and point to the ground. "Knees," they order crisply.</p><p>Agnes laughs in their face. "In your fucking dreams, Vidal," she spits, and they grin fiercely in return.</p><p>Her defiance is belied by the fact that she doesn't move out of Rio's reach, so once they stand up, they're easily able to reach out with one hand and take hold of her neck, using the other to grab her shoulder in a bruising grip and drag her forcibly from the armchair onto the ground.</p><p>"No discipline. No manners," Rio snarls, putting more pressure on the sides of Agnes' neck. She thrashes around, baring her teeth ferally and actually letting out a little growl. Rio feels primal, bestial. This is what they do best.</p><p>Agnes struggles so hard that she actually manages to free her shoulder from Rio's grip. Well, that won't do.</p><p>Rio lets go of her throat suddenly, then steps around her. She's not expecting it, and it takes a second for her to react and start turning around. By then, Rio's entire right arm is already wrapped around her neck, trapping her in a headlock. "Say, 'I'm sorry, sir,' and maybe I'll consider a more lenient punishment," they husk into her ear.</p><p>They feel a flash of guilt for enjoying this so much, for having such a good time so soon after hurting her so badly.</p><p>Then again, she literally asked for it.</p><p>"Fuck you," Agnes gasps, interrupting their thoughts. She startles Rio by putting her weight on one knee, freeing the other leg to swing back and stomp hard on their foot. It barely even hurts, but it's enough for Rio to loosen their grip a bit. Agnes smoothly slides her head down and out of the headlock. By the time Rio gets up, Agnes has already broken into a dead run across the house.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, there isn't really anywhere to go.</p><p>Rio catches up to her in no time and tackles her bodily, knocking her down onto the entryway rug. They give her no quarter, quickly grabbing her wrists, pinning them to her back, and pushing her face-down. For good measure, they fully lie down on top of her to keep her trapped there. They bite hard at her earlobe before whispering, "Gotcha."</p><p>She writhes around, and Rio lets her, happy to let her tire herself out. In the meantime, every jerk and thrash of her body has her grinding her ass up against their cock, and Rio can't help but start to moan.</p><p>And that's what gets Agnes to relent. All of that manhandling, and all it takes for her to settle down is a few noises from low in Rio's chest. Agnes breathes out a bunch of syllables that Rio assumes are words.</p><p>"What's that?" they snap. "Speak up!" To emphasize their point, they ease up on her a little bit, lifting her by her restrained arms, and then slam her back into the ground.</p><p>Agnes grunts in pain and frustration and then whimpers, "Use me, Daddy."</p><p>They laugh meanly, enjoying how the sound echoes off the walls of the narrow foyer. "Wouldn't you just like that, you easy thing? Yeah, in your fucking dreams." They shirt slightly so they can bring one knee up against Agnes' cunt, pressing hard once before easing off again. "No, you're going to have to do more than a little begging to get me inside of you. You haven't earned the right to a single thing you want tonight."</p><p>That brings the brat right back out of Agatha, and she stills for a second before bucking up with explosive force, twisting her arm out of Rio's grip and elbowing them hard in the stomach while simultaneously rolling to the side. Rio finds themself staring at the ceiling, the wind knocked out of them.</p><p>Oh, now they're pissed. Mostly at themself, honestly, for underestimating Agnes. They got cocky, assumed their FBI training trumps whatever hand-to-hand combat experience she might have. And they're determined to give her what she wants out of this experience.</p><p>Rio springs to their feet with agility, but Agnes is already pounding up the stairs, and the bedroom door slams shut before Rio's even halfway up.</p><p>(But they don't hear the lock click. Because Agnes <em>wants</em> them to catch her. And they will.)</p><p>Rio takes the last steps two at a time, bounding up the stairs like an unleashed hound. They don't slow for a second, taking one, two, three flying steps towards the door, then wrenching the knob and careening through in the same breath.</p><p>Agnes is nowhere to be seen. But Rio's been an FBI agent for a long time, and they can search a room in their sleep.</p><p>They prowl through the room at speed. First stop is the closet, because it's the most obvious spot. Empty. Next up, behind the curtains: suspects still think they can do that for some reason. Not Agnes, though. Third time should be the charm, especially because Rio sort of only checked the first two places to build anticipation. They can hear her trying not to pant too loudly, so they're certain she's…</p><p>They kick hard under the bed and hear a soft "oof" as their foot makes contact with something soft.</p><p>"Get out from under there before I drag you out," Rio snaps. The effect is a little diminished by the fact that they're also out of breath.</p><p>"Don't threaten me with a good time," the bed quips.</p><p>Rio sighs, getting down on the ground. "You're going to regret this, O'Connor," they grit out, peering under the bed to get a sense of where Agnes' various body parts are.</p><p>They're met with her phone flashlight shining full-on into their eyes. Rookie mistake on Rio's part. But now they know where her arm is. They reach out, aiming for just past the light, and wrap one strong hand around her wrist. They apply pressure until she drops her phone, and then blink rapidly to clear the spots from their vision.</p><p>"Now you're really going to get it," they growl.</p>

<p>Reaching blindly for Agnes' upper arms, Rio hooks their forearms into her armpits and forcefully yanks her upper body out from under the bed. They see a flash of a thoroughly delighted grin on her face before she gets back into the scene and replaces it with a snarl. She thrashes around in Rio's grip, making things as difficult for them as possible as they slowly but surely drag her out.</p><p>When her whole body is finally clear from the bed, Rio leans down and kisses Agnes, nipping at her lip and licking into her mouth almost immediately. It's aggressive and dirty and Agnes responds beautifully, all resistance giving way as her body abandons its struggle in favor of instinctively arching up towards Rio.</p><p>While she's distracted, Rio works quickly, loosening the tie of Agnes' bathrobe and surreptitiously pulling it out of the loops. As Agnes begins to run her hands down their waist, they loop the strip of fabric around, expertly forming it into makeshift handcuffs. Their fingers are nimble, the muscle memory of this particular set of knots long ingrained from both professional and personal experience.</p><p>Once the cuffs are ready, Rio breaks the kiss quickly and seizes Agnes' hands, pulling them in front of her, forcing them through the loops, and pulling hard to tighten the tie.</p><p>Agnes looks at her bound wrists for a moment, startled. Then she bares her teeth and lunges for Rio, bringing her hands up in front of her to…try and grab at their face?</p><p>They're not exactly sure what her objective is here, but it doesn't matter: this is RIo's show now. They easily catch her and pull her up into a kneeling position, and for the second time today, Rio puts Agnes in a headlock.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going, boy?" they rasp into her ear as she squirms. It's a far cry from her earlier struggles, more of a token effort than anything else. "You can run and hide and tussle with me all you want, but I'm always going to catch you. I'm always going to find you." They kiss the side of her neck, biting down and sucking for a moment before they withdraw and add, "And if you fight me, I'm always going to win."</p><p>Pressed up this close against Agnes, Rio can feel the conflict in her body: part of her wants to give in, to soften, to bare her soft underbelly to Rio. Another part is all trapped animal, gnashing and flailing—and for now, at least, that's still the part that wins out.</p><p>"You'll give up," Agnes spits, grabbing onto Rio's arm with her bound hands, twisting her head and shoulders to try and escape. "Everyone always gives up eventually." Her voice cracks slightly, revealing something real beneath the posturing, and Rio's heart wrenches.</p><p>"Not me," they say, voice grounded and gravelly. They mean it—more than they should, given that they've still only known her for a little over a week and managed to hurt her badly within that time. The guilt of leaving her behind once, combined with whatever haze overtakes their mind and body every time they're around Agnes, has them wanting to pledge their undying fealty to her. And if the way to show her they're here for her is to hunt and restrain and dominate her, they're more than happy to do it. "I'm here right now, and I will be here. So submit. I know you want it," they continue, emphasizing their words with a little squeeze to her throat.</p><p>Agnes shakes her head hard, tossing it left, right, left. She does her best to kick backwards at Rio, but aiming backwards is difficult, especially since she's kneeling. All other options exhausted, she starts to claw at Rio's forearm, fingernails leaving deep dents in their skin.</p><p>Before she can do any actual damage, Rio lifts the arm that isn't restraining her and slaps her hard on the side of her leg. "<em>Behave</em>," they order sternly.</p><p>They're just having second thoughts—should they have been softer, kinder?—when instinct has them jerking their head to the side, narrowly avoiding getting their nose smashed in as Agnes throws her head back with a feral grunt. She's making it very clear what kind of reaction she wants from them.</p><p>"Okay, Agnes," Rio says, voice deadly calm. "If that's how you want to play it…"</p><p>They slide their arm around so the inside of their elbow is cradling Agnes' neck from the back instead of choking her from the front, then position their other arm behind her knees. Rio scoops Agnes up off the ground, doing so easily despite her continued writhing.</p><p><em>Bridal carry</em>, a small voice in the back of their mind says, and they push it away before they get too mushy to continue the scene.</p><p>Instead, they toss Agnes face-down onto the bed, and she barely catches herself on her tied hands, flinging them out in front of her. Before she can do anything more, they reach out and undo the tie, then force both of her arms behind her back, folding them so Rio can bind her forearms together. They need clear access to the lower half of her body for this next part.</p><p>Agnes continues to struggle, flopping around on the bed like a gasping fish. Rio can feel a little laughter bubbling up in them at the sight, and they let it loose, turning it a little mocking, a little cruel, as it leaves their mouth. "There are consequences when you don't settle down," they say, idly flipping up the back of her bathrobe. She's not wearing anything underneath, her inner thighs clearly wet and shiny.</p><p>They can't help but get on the bed and start licking, cleaning her up with their tongue but avoiding anywhere that could actually get her off. The taste of her makes them shudder with want, makes them intensely aware of their throbbing cock. Agnes spreads her legs obscenely wide, pressing her hips against the mattress in a fruitless bid for friction.</p><p>"Mmm," Rio says, licking their lips as they sit up. "I would keep going," they continue casually, running their hands up and down Agnes' legs. "But you chose to misbehave." They sigh loudly, theatrically, as they stand up and unbuckle their belt.</p><p>They do a little foley work, letting the leather snap against their body as it whooshes through their belt loops, then jingling the buckle a little more than absolutely necessary as they fold it in half.</p><p>It has the intended effect. Agnes tries to stifle her whimper in the sheets, but Rio hears it loud and clear. Savors it. Even more obvious to them is what they can see between Agnes' spread thighs: her cunt glistening and messy, clenching desperately around nothing. They laugh again, harshly. "You want this so bad," they jeer, and she doesn't even have the presence of mind to deny it as they raise their arm high and bring the belt whooshing through the air.</p><p>As it hits her across the fullest part of her ass, she doesn't react beyond her jaw clenching, gritting her teeth to keep from making a noise. She's doing her best to hold still, muscles stiff, and Rio takes that as their cue to go harder.</p><p>They vary their swing from blow to blow, bringing the belt down again and again until Agnes jerks a leg involuntarily. Each stroke of the belt leaves a pretty pink band behind, and it drives Rio wild to see visual evidence of not only the power they have over Agnes, but the trust she's placing in them right now.</p><p>The marks are a little darker on the right, where the folded end of the belt snaps against Agnes' skin, and Rio can't stand an unevenly painted canvas, so they pause to walk around to Agnes' right side, preparing to even things out.</p><p>Agnes turns her head to look at them, poorly masking her absolute exhilaration. She bites her lip to hide her smile, but it only serves to make her look even more aroused. Rio wants to grin back at her, but they take a deep breath, anchor themself firmly in their dominant headspace, and glare at her instead, gaze flinty as they snap, "If you're still looking that pleased, I guess I'm not hitting hard enough."</p><p>They make sure she's watching the arc of the belt as they let it fall backwards over their shoulder, then whip it down hard onto her ass. Her bright blue eyes widen, then squeeze tightly shut as she registers the pain of impact. Her teeth dig even further into her lip and she makes a choked little sound, which seems to mark the end of her determination to stay silent. "Is that all you've got?" she spits, moving to close her legs.</p><p>Rio seizes one of her ankles with their free hand. "Keep 'em spread," they instruct, letting their nails dig in a little. "I like seeing you drip more and more the harder I whoop you."</p><p>Agnes does her best to pull her leg out of Rio's grasp. "Fucking <em>make me</em>," she snaps. "Bet you can't—"</p><p>Before she can finish her sentence, Rio is on the bed, kneeling between Agnes' legs to forcibly keep them apart. Rio wraps the belt around their hand a couple of times to shorten it and then swings it gently, letting the folded end of the belt slap lightly against Agnes' swollen, throbbing clit.</p><p>Well, relatively lightly. It makes enough of an impact that Agnes screeches, and it looks at first like she's struggling to get away—but her movements are too rhythmic, and she's not going anywhere, and it soon becomes clear that she's just rutting against the bed. Rio taps her clit with the belt again, a little harder, and they're finally rewarded with a loud, longing moan.</p><p>"Bet I can't what, huh?" they ask coolly, doing their best to keep their voice under control. It's taking all the self-control they have to keep from straddling one of Agnes' thighs and just riding it until they come. They know it wouldn't take long.</p><p>"You still need more proof that I can take you in hand?" They unfurl the belt again and lean back so they can aim at Agnes' ass again. "Silly. Little. Slut," they pronounce, each word accompanied by a loud crack of the belt.</p><p>Little welts start to rise on Agnes' reddened skin as Rio keeps going. <em>Beautiful.</em> She's doing a worse and worse job of pretending to be unaffected now, hips raising to meet the belt again after each blow. Rio still has fantasies of really working her over, leaving bruises behind like they promised, but it's been too long since they last made Agnes come, and they're reaching their limit, all too eager to feel her pulsing around their fingers.</p><p>So they toss the belt aside and slip three fingers inside Agnes, easy as anything. She's so sloppy and wet that Rio wonders if she can even feel it, but the loud, surprised cry she lets out makes it more than clear that she does. "I feel good inside of you, don't I?" Rio murmurs, leaning down to kiss the inflamed skin of Agnes' ass cheek. The only response is a moan. "It would feel better if I—" they curl their fingers very slightly "—fucked you, wouldn't it?"</p><p>The only response is a garbled whimper that may or may not be words.</p><p>"See," Rio continues, pausing to kiss up Agnes' spine as they hold their fingers still inside Agnes, "I ordered you to submit. To behave." They bite her shoulderblade. "So now you have two choices. You can keep being a defiant little brat, and I'll leave you tied up and untouched for the rest of the night while I get myself off, or…" They pull their fingers out a little bit and then ram them back in. Agnes keens. "You can apologize nicely, and give in to me, and I'll make you come as many times as you want. And maybe some more beyond that."</p><p>Rio can feel Agnes' body tensing up against theirs once again, can feel the fight ebbing and flowing throughout her body. The internal conflict shudders through her, and they don't know if they've ever experienced anything more wonderful than the moment when Agnes' body goes limp against the bed.</p><p>"Please fuck me," Agnes whines. It sounds like she's crying.</p><p>Rio removes their hand from inside her and she chokes out a sob. They reach up for her face and grab her by the cheeks, smearing her own arousal all over her face in the process. She <em>is</em> crying, eyes red, tears tracing down the side of her face. Rio has scarcely seen anything more erotic.</p><p>"Where's my apology?" they ask, squeezing Agnes' face. The feral energy that seems to overtake them so easily when they're with her is rising. "Unrepentant, ungrateful brats don't get fucked," they spit.</p><p>There's a pause as Agnes gazes up at Rio with adoring, wide, watery eyes. Then something shatters inside her and she babbles, "I'm sorry, I'll be good, I won't fight anymore, I'll submit, just <em>please</em>, Daddy, fuck me, please!"</p><p>Rio was preparing a torrent of praise for this moment—they're as much about reinforcing good behavior as punishing bad behavior—but the second Agnes says "Daddy," their brain fully whites out. The words are gone, replaced by that primal, crazed energy completely taking them over at the sound of her raw, desperate voice. They slam three fingers back into her, grabbing at her hip with their other hand, wordlessly directing her to raise her ass in the air so they can drive their fingers in at a deeper angle.</p><p>Agnes is letting out a long, continuous wail now, drooling helplessly onto the sheets as Rio pounds her hard and fast. "Can you take more?" they gasp. They're not thinking anymore, they're a machine—in this moment, they exist only to pour so much pleasure into Agnes that she can't handle it anymore.</p><p>"Yes—God—more—please—put your whole fucking hand in me!" Agnes screams. More tears track down her cheeks, and before they know what they're doing, Rio's bending down to lick her tears away as they add a fourth finger.</p><p>"Oh, oh, fuck, so full, so— Fill me up!" she shrieks.</p><p>They have to sit back to see what they're doing as they slide their fingers out, tuck their thumb up against the other four fingers, and slowly, slowly start putting their entire hand inside of Agnes. Their mouth drops open as they watch her stretching wider and wider to take them, barely registering the howl Agnes is letting out.</p><p>Words fall out of Rio's mouth without them fully knowing what they're saying. "Take it, take it, take all of me," they gasp. "Bruising you up—filling you up so you can't forget me—you'll feel me for <em>days</em>." On the last word of that sentence, Rio fits the widest part of their hand inside Agnes' cunt, stretching her out with their knuckles, hot and slick and wet.</p><p>Rio loses control. They fumble their fly open, shoving their left hand inside their pants (how are they still wearing pants?). They're somehow <em>too</em> wet, fingers slipping around too much to achieve sufficient friction between their cock and their hand. With a frustrated growl, they yank their hand back out of their pants and bring it down with a wet slap on the back of Agnes' leg, making her yelp as they put their fist in a little deeper at the same time.</p><p>In a frenzy, they start slapping her clit as they fuck her with their fist, tears welling up as they whisper harshly, "I'm going to give you everything you can take, I'm going to give you everything you need. I'm not going anywhere as long as you want me here. You're mine as long as you want to be, you hear me? <em>Mine.</em>"</p><p>And Agnes doesn't say anything in response—not in words, anyway. But as Rio says the word "mine," she clenches down around their hand so hard it almost hurts, crying out as she convulses and shudders. Rio does their best to keep fucking her through it, barely able to move from how tightly she's clamped down around them. They do their best anyway, wringing a series of long, strangled moans from deep within Agnes.</p><p>It feels like her climax lasts hours: every time Rio thinks she's done, they knock their knuckles against their clit again or move their fist slightly inside her, and she squeezes down around them again with a weak whimper, starting another round of trembling against the bed.</p><p>Finally, she cringes away when Rio next touches her clit. "Okay," she mumbles into the sheets, and Rio starts the slow process of easing their hand out of her. She sobs in half-pleasure, half-overstimulation as they slide out.</p><p>Once their hand is free, Rio quickly moves to release the knot securing the bathrobe tie around Agnes' arms. She's been tied up for a little longer than they intended, and they hurriedly knead from her wrists all the way up to her shoulders after they throw the tie aside, inadvertently covering her arms in her own arousal. She clearly doesn't notice, groaning as she melts bonelessly into the mattress, Rio's strong fingers massaging away any soreness that might have built up while she was bound.</p><p>It wouldn't be surprising if she fell asleep now—Rio's actually expecting it—so it surprises them when after a couple of minutes, Agnes rolls over languidly and tugs ineffectually at the waistband of their unbuttoned pants. "Use my face," she mumbles. Rio gives her a <em>look</em>, and she quickly corrects herself. "Use my face, <em>please</em>, Daddy," she breathes, yanking more insistently at their pants. "Want your cock in my mouth."</p><p>And with that, Rio remembers that aside from their brief attempt to jerk themself off while they were fisting Agnes, they haven't been touched a single time this morning, and their hard-on makes itself known with a vengeance.</p><p>"What a good boy," they coo, brushing her sweaty, tangled hair away from her face. "You're totally fucked out, but you know you have to thank Daddy properly, don't you?"</p><p>They're still a little hesitant about calling themself Daddy, still feel that sick shame licking at the back of their mind as they say it, but Agnes' reaction helps to push it away. Her mouth goes slack and she nods, licking her lips as Rio finally strips their clothes off and frees their boner from the confines of their boxer briefs. "Get on your back and scoot up," they say, and it brings a wide smile to their face and a twitch to their cock to see Agnes wince as her inflamed skin chafes against the sheets.</p><p>There's a dopey, blissful look on Agnes' face that Rio only sees for a second before they straddle it, grabbing onto the headboard and sinking down onto her mouth. "Oh—oh, fuck," they groan. <em>This is going to be so embarrassing</em>, they think, frantically trying to hold their orgasm back as Agnes sucks their cock into her mouth, grabbing them firmly by the hips to help them keep their balance. It's no use, though: within less than a minute, Rio feels their climax hurtling towards them, fast and inevitable.</p><p>"Gonna—gonna come down your throat," they pant, squeezing the headboard for dear life. "Gonna make you swallow it all—<em>fuck</em>!"</p><p>They might be grinding down too hard on Agnes' face—they can't tell, and right this second, they don't really care, motivated solely by wrenching the most possible pleasure out of this moment. They're dimly aware that Agnes is actively helping them move, moving them by the hips and dragging their sopping wet cunt all over her face.</p><p>As soon as they have the presence of mind, Rio kneels up, and Agnes takes several huge gulps of air. Rio's about to say something—to apologize, maybe, for suffocating her—when Agnes says blearily, "My vibrator's in the top drawer of the nightstand."</p><p>Rio flops down to the bed, rolling onto their side to stare at her incredulously. "I think that might kill you," they say, still catching their own breath.</p><p>"Please?" she asks, blinking over at them with a pout. "I can't help it if having you come in my mouth gets me hopelessly turned on."</p><p>Rio sighs and rolls over to open the drawer. The decade between them and Agnes is showing. "I think that might kill <em>me</em>," they mutter—but they hand the vibrator over anyway.</p><hr/><p>As it turns out, Rio didn't die—but they did fall hard into sleep after another several orgasms.</p><p>They wake to Agnes almost fully on top of them, face tucked between their neck and shoulder and the rest of her body sprawled like a starfish. Her leg falls between Rio's in a way that has them instinctively grinding against it before they can think. <em>How can I still go again after all of that?</em> they marvel.</p><p>But they have to shove that thought to the side for now, because what woke them up was the insistent buzzing of their phone on the nightstand. From what they can see out of Agnes' east-facing bedroom window, it's well past noon, and they hope whoever it is hasn't been trying to get hold of them for too long. They try for about five seconds to get out from under Agnes, determine it's not going to happen, and answer the phone with a sigh.</p><p>"Hello?" They do their best to sound awake, which has the unfortunate consequence of waking Agnes rather suddenly. She jerks awake with a mumble, and Rio motions for her to be quiet.</p><p>To Rio's surprise, it's Jimmy Woo himself on the other end of the line. They were expecting an analyst, not their boss.</p><p>"Hey, Vidal," he says excitedly. "Big break. Salazar found something."</p><p>Rio should have known better than to indicate to Agnes that she needs to stay silent. She's positively beaming as she slowly inches down the bed, kissing Rio's sternum, then their belly.</p><p>They whip their hand out and grab a fistful of her incredibly tousled hair, glaring at her as they say to Jimmy, "Wait, so why are <em>you</em> calling me?"</p><p>This backfires wildly on them as Agnes bites her lip, rolling her eyes back in her head. They shove her head away with a grimace, making an "I'll slit your throat" gesture.</p><p>"Maybe I just wanted to say hi," Jimmy responds, and Rio can just see the dweeby little grin he undoubtedly has on his face right now. "And also, I was getting to that. So Salazar found records of a private jet flying out from Jugtown Mountain Airport the day 'Mrs. Hart' disappeared—that's about 15 minutes outside of Westview."</p><p>Rio's torn between suppressing a juvenile joke about the name of the airport, formulating a response to Jimmy, and trying to kick Agnes away as, undaunted, she continues her journey down Rio's body, now kissing the inside of their knee.</p><p>They clear their throat and pause for what's definitely a little too long before asking, "How do we know she was on the plane?"</p><p>"Well…" Jimmy says dramatically, clearly relishing the impending reveal. He pauses for a long moment before finally continuing, "The private jet belonged to Samira Menière. So either it was 'Mrs. Hart' on the jet, or it's a lead worth following up on anyway. It landed on a tiny island in the middle of Lake Erie called Kelleys Island. So the reason I'm calling and not Salazar is that I'm giving you formal authorization to go out there and hunt her down."</p><p>The rush Rio is feeling right now might be due to the thrill of the renewed chase, or it might be from Agnes swirling her tongue around the tip of their cock, looking up at them with falsely innocent eyes. Giving up on stopping her for now, they fight to keep their voice level as they reply to Jimmy while bucking their hips up into Agnes' mouth, raking the fingers of their free hand through her hair. "Holy shit," they say, and they hope their breathlessness and lack of substantive contribution to the conversation can be attributed to the shock of the news.</p><p>"Yup. The exact location should be in your inbox in the next couple minutes. And remember our new budget policy, Vidal. You can make the drive in under a day, so you'll be headed over by car," Jimmy says.</p><p>Rio sighs, barely keeping from turning it into a moan as yet another orgasm builds. "No chance of an exception given that this is time-sensitive?" they ask. Agnes is bobbing her head up and down now, and Rio fully gives in, wrapping their legs around her back and squeezing her head between their thighs.</p><p>"No, a team from the Cleveland office is already headed over. You'll be lead once you arrive," Jimmy says placatingly, "but they have it under control until then."</p><p>"Okay, cool, thanks, Jimmy," Rio says hurriedly. They're fast reaching the point of incoherence, so they hang up without waiting for him to say goodbye and give themself over, tossing their phone aside and grabbing onto Agnes' head with both hands before riding her face to another trembling, toe-curling climax.</p><p>Once they've come down a little, she climbs back up the bed, licking her lips with an angelic smile.</p><p>"Incorrigible brat," Rio says fondly, reaching out so she can rest her head on their chest. "Anyway—how would you like to go on a little road trip?"</p>
