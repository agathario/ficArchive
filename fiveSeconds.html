<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Five seconds!” The official called, raising one hand in the air as they watched their stopwatch.</p><p>Agatha counted her breaths and squared her shoulders. She clenched her hands twice for good luck. </p><p> A few feet ahead of her, Rio caught her eye, giving her a cocky smile and a wink. </p><p>As the jammer, Agatha had one job. Break through the pack, lap them, score four points. One for each sucker trying to stop her. All while trying to stop the other jammer from making it past her own team. Then do it again, and again, until time ran out.</p><p>Even though based on stats she was undoubtedly the best in the league, roller derby <em> was </em> a team sport. That technicality didn’t stop her from frequently teasing that The Coven would be nothing without their star player. She got away with it because her ego wasn’t unfounded. People would occasionally roll their eyes whenever she crowed about her prowess and victory but rarely did anyone challenge her or correct her. </p><p>She was just that good, formidable, undeniable.</p><p>The only other player she didn’t dispute matched her skill was Rio. She played the pivot, alternating between being an extra defensive body and the only other player who could score points. <em> If </em>Agatha passed the star-printed cover on her helmet to her. </p><p>Agatha wasn’t the picture of a perfect team player, but she couldn’t be called selfish either. What she wanted most was for her team to win, and every bout she fought to do her part to make it happen. For the team, of course.</p><p>But there was no denying victory always tasted sweeter when she dominated the score board. She never settled for just eeking out a win, she wanted total defeat of her opponents. She craved blood. And Rio was the only other person who matched that intensity.</p><p>They made a good team even if stylistically they operated differently. Agatha was all force, unafraid of shoulder checking opposing blockers, doing whatever it took to force her way through. </p><p>She didn’t care that it cost her an obscene share of penalties. She was the only person in league history to set the record for both the most points scored and most minutes spent in the penalty box in a single season. Another achievement for her to boast about.</p><p>In contrast, Rio, was all about speed, getting low and darting around the opposition with a dancer’s grace. Agility that was not just feline, but almost ethereal, like she could melt her form and pass through bodies like they were nothing. An undeniable force of nature.</p><p>Her signature move was jumping the apex, coming in hot to turns, and jumping around the mass of bodies to cut corners and gain a few seconds of advantage. More than once she’d had close calls, but always managed to pull it off. And when she did, she never failed to throw a cocky grin Agatha’s way.</p><p>Flanking Rio were the three blockers on the team: Alice, Jen, and Wanda. Responsible for both helping clear a path for her and keeping the other team’s jammer at bay. </p><p>The ref’s whistle sounded, their hand came down, and the jam was on.</p><p>The pack began their lap around the track, bodies slamming into each other as her team fought for any available opening. </p><p>Agatha surged forward, her skates flying across the polished track as her eyes scanned for an opening. The blockers ahead locked their shoulder and hips forming a tight wall. No gaps. Not yet…</p><p>Just ahead, Rio barked, “Jen, sweep right!” and Jen followed, slamming her shoulder into another player and destabilizing the wall for an instant. A second was all she needed.</p><p>She dropped her shoulder and pushed herself into the crowd of players, dodging an elbow and letting it glance off her.</p><p>“Nice try!” she taunted, grinning around her mouthguard.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a flash of a purple jersey as Rio dodged a hit and circled towards the back of the pack. As usual, intently watching Agatha’s every move, ready to capitalize on any chance to help score.</p><p>She always played better when she felt her eyes on her. A good show was nothing without an audience.</p><p>They rounded the second turn and she heard a sharp whistle. “Green, three, cut!” A player on the other team had drawn a penalty. She smirked, <em> for once </em> it wasn’t her number being called for the first penalty.</p><p>The opposing pack tightened around her, and she came face to face with the other team’s pivot. She faked left, drawing them forward, and attempted to throw them off balance. But they quickly juked to the side, cutting off the space. Agatha growled in frustration, she wasn’t getting through.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio called to her left.</p><p>She didn’t need more instruction than that. On the track, Rio only called her first name for one reason. They’d pulled this move a hundred times. She whipped the cover from her helmet, stretching her arm out to the side as she spun. For a brief moment, Rio’s finger brushed hers before wrapping around the cover and pulling it on.</p><p>Agatha slammed her body into the player unlucky enough to find herself caught between them. And that was all the opening Rio needed.</p><p>Rio shot forward in a blur. She darted past the pack and the crow roared as she hit the back half. It was a race now. But the other jammer, a tall woman in a dark green jersey was quick too. They were neck and neck as they approached the curve.</p><p>Rio bent low into the turn and Agatha watched as her muscles coiled. She leapt and the crowd became frenzied. But just as she began to land, the other skater clipped the side of her foot. Everything froze, suspended in time, Rio’s body twisted in mid-air… then everything came crashing down.</p><p>Her knee slammed into the track with a sickening noise and Rio immediately rolled awkwardly to her side.</p><p>Agatha’s voice pierced over the sound of the whistle screaming through the air. “Rio!”</p><p>It had all happened so fast. The jump, clip, crash. Her eyes flashed with rage as she barreled towards the skater who had caused the accident.</p><p>“Green, Fifteen, Low block!” The official shouted out the penalty but Agatha barely heard it over the roar of her rage.</p><p>“What the fuck!” Agatha yelled, ripping out her mouth guard and balling it into her fist.</p><p>But before she could get her hands on the other player, Jen and Alice materialized out of nowhere grabbing her arms and holding her back.</p><p>“Cool it Harkness!” Jen barked, keeping a death grip on her arm. “You are <em> not </em>getting another suspension on my watch.”</p><p>“She’s not worth it.” Alice agreed, pulling her back with surprising force as she wrapped her arms around her waist.</p><p>“Cap! You see this shit?” Agatha called, eyes pleading with Wanda as their captain skated over to them.</p><p>Her face was set in a firm expression as she shook her head. “Save it. You’re needed elsewhere.” She jerked her head toward the ground where Rio still was crumpled, holding her knee.</p><p>Suddenly pummeling the other player wasn’t the priority.</p><p>“Have someone else sub in. I’m going with her.” Agatha said before skating over to where several people were crowding Rio whot still lay sprawled on the ground. She wasn't getting up. Not a good sign.</p><p>“Let me through!” She huffed, pushing past to kneel by her side.</p><p>“We called an ambulance,” a distant voice called, but her focus was locked on Rio.</p><p>Injuries weren’t uncommon, but Rio not popping right back up <em> was </em> rare. It had never happened in over a year of them playing together. Her face was screwed up as tears fell freely and she feebly tried to stretch her leg. </p><p>“Hang on hot shot. Just stay where you are.” Agatha said softly, gently reaching to unclip Rio’s helmet and pulling it off her head.</p><p>“I’m <em> not </em> going in a fucking ambulance.” Rio gritted out, struggling to prop herself up on her elbows. “I just need a second.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>She fixed her with a stern look, one that clearly showed that this wasn’t going to be a negotiation. Her fate had been sealed the second she failed to out manuever gravity and physics. However, Agatha understood, Rio’s ego had taken the hit right along with her leg. She spun this knowledge in her favor as she attempted to play to her pride. </p><p>“You’re hurt. And yeah, maybe we lose today without you. But if you don’t get help, you’ll make it worse and you’ll be out a lot longer. I need my partner out there.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, her pride warring with the pain radiating from her knee. “You’ve got Jen,” she muttered, wiping at her face to smear away the tears she couldn’t seem to stop. “She’s good enough to fill in at pivot.”</p><p>“Good enough?” Agatha scoffed, arching a brow. “She’s so much taller than you, all the timings will be off.” She let her voice drop a touch, adding, “No one else out here even comes close to what we’ve got, Rio. You know that. So let’s get you checked out and fixed up so you can be back where we need you.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, her gaze softening despite the pain and tension. Agatha almost always had a way of drawing her focus, even when her pride made her stubborn as all hell. They both knew that.</p><p>It had been that way since they’d first started skating together. Their chemistry on the track had been immediate, electric. Agatha could read Rio’s movements as if they’d choreographed them in advance, and Rio always seemed to know when Agatha was about to make a big move, ready to clean up the chaos and bodies she left behind.</p><p>Off the track…</p><p>Agatha’s mind flickered to one of their recent tournaments when they’d dominated the opposing team so thoroughly it almost felt cruel. The post-game after-party had been a wild affair, the team riding high on adrenaline and cheap beer. Agatha had found herself leaning against the wall, Rio beside her, the two of them watching the chaos of their teammates dancing and yelling over truly terrible karaoke.</p><p>She’d lost count but was pretty sure this was the third screeching rendition of <em> We Are The Champions </em>she’d heard tonight.</p><p>“You know,” Agatha had said, her voice low and teasing, “we could do this more often if you’d stop holding back.”</p><p>Rio had laughed, tilting her head in that way that always made Agatha’s stomach flutter. “Holding back? I’m not the one who spent half the game in the penalty box. You’re lucky that I was around to score fifteen in that last jam.”</p><p>“Your ass never hits the penalty box because, you’re <em> always</em> playing it safe,” Agatha had shot back, grinning as she stepped closer, her voice dropping. “Except when you’re showing off.”</p><p>Rio had looked at her then, and the way her dark eyes lingered had been impossible to ignore. “Well, we all know that there’s only room for one star on the team, sweetheart,” she’d teased, “I know that you don’t like sharing the spotlight.”</p><p>In an impulsive moment, Agatha had grabbed her by the shirt and kissed her. For a moment, Rio had kissed her back, her hand grabbing Agatha’s arm like she might pull her closer.</p><p>But just as she’d felt her tongue tease over her lips, Rio had pulled away, breathless and flushed. “Agatha, we can’t,” she’d said, her voice a mix of regret and frustration.</p><p>“Sure we can,” Agatha had murmured, trying to play it off, not used to being denied. Not when she was half drunk on victory and cheap beer. Not ever, really. “Teammates hook up all the time. It can be just this once. I <em> know </em> you want me.”</p><p>She trailed her fingers down Rio’s arm, pouting slightly, “Maybe I want you too.”</p><p>Rio’s expression had turned serious then, her eyes searching Agatha’s face. “If I start something with you,” she’d said softly, “I wouldn’t want it to be just one time. And I wouldn’t be able to stop.”</p><p>That honesty had silenced Agatha. So rarely was she speechless that she didn’t know what to make of it other than nodding dumbly and taking a step back. </p><p>So they’d left it at that, saving their tension for the track, where their frustration and chemistry only made them play harder.</p><p>Now, kneeling beside Rio, that same tension simmered, even through the pain and worry. </p><p>“Come on,” she said, her voice softer. “Don’t be stubborn now. Let them check you out. We’ll figure the rest out later.”</p><p>Rio sighed, a shaky exhale that betrayed just how much she was hurting. She looked at Agatha, her lips quirking into a faint, tired smile. “You’re a pain in the ass.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, smiling despite herself. “And here I thought it was your knee that was fucked.”</p><p>Rio laughed weakly. “Fine,” she muttered. “But only because you asked so nicely.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, relief washing over her. “That’s my girl,” she said without thinking, the words slipping out before she could stop them.</p><p>Rio raised a brow, her smile turning teasing despite the tears still glinting in her eyes. “Your girl?”</p><p>“On the track,” Agatha shot back quickly, her cheeks flushing. “Don’t get any ideas.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, letting her head fall back against the track. “Too late.”</p><p>Agatha followed the ambulance to the hospital, the bout forgotten as they both awaited the x-rays to come back.</p><p>The diagnosis wasn’t surprising.</p><p>Torn ACL requiring reconstructive surgery. Six to nine months for recovery. Up to a year before she could return to high-impact activities.</p><p>It crushed the team, Agatha, but no one more than Rio.</p><p>In the first few weeks after the accident, she’d gamely shown up at a few practices on crutches, cheering the team on and trying to give Jen pointers. But it wasn’t the same. And after a series of losses, they were all getting frustrated.</p><p>And then she disappeared.</p><hr/><p>Agatha stood on the sidewalk, glaring up at Rio’s apartment building. The buzzer had gone unanswered, just as it had the last five times she’d pressed it. She’d lost count of the total number of undelivered texts and unanswered calls. It had been four months since Rio blew out her knee, two since Rio stopped showing up to practices, and one more month of dodged messages and half-hearted excuses that no one was buying.</p><p>Least of all her.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t the type to let things go.</p><p>Her eyes caught on the faint glow of light through the window of Rio’s bedroom on the third floor. So she <em> was </em> home.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>Agatha huffed, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes. “Alright, Vidal,” she muttered under her breath. “If you’re gonna hide, you’ve gotta hide better than that.”</p><p>Feeling reckless, she scanned the side of the apartment building. The rusty fire escape was just within reach if she could boost herself up from the trashcan nearby. It was probably a bad idea. No, definitely a bad idea. The last thing the team morale needed was another player out on injury.</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>Kicking aside a stray bottle, Agatha hoisted herself onto the lid of the trashcan, wobbling slightly before steadying herself. From there, it was just a matter of gripping the edge of the fire escape and pulling herself up. Her arms protested as she climbed, but the adrenaline carried her all the way to Rio’s bedroom window.</p><p>The curtains were drawn, but she could see the silhouette of Rio moving inside, how she was managing to pace on crutches, she wasn’t sure. Agatha tapped on the glass, loud enough to be heard but not enough to draw the neighbors’ attention. She was already pressing her luck and was surprised no one had reported the strange woman scaling the fire escape.</p><p>The pacing stopped.</p><p>A moment later, the curtains were pulled aside, and there she was. Rio was backlit from the warm light of her apartment, her brow arched in a mixture of amusement and exasperation. She slid the window up with deliberate slowness, leaning against the sill as she looked down at Agatha.</p><p>“Well,” Rio drawled, her voice dripping with mockery. “If it isn’t my very own Spider-Woman. What part of ‘I need space’ didn’t you understand?”</p><p>Agatha leaned on the frame of the fire escape, completely unfazed even as she tried to catch her breath. “The part where you actually said it out loud,” she shot back. “Ignoring texts and calls doesn’t count.”</p><p>Rio sighed, her lips twitching like she wanted to smile but was trying her level best not to. “You’re a menace, you know that?”</p><p>“Apparently,” Agatha quipped. “Are you gonna let me in, or do I have to camp out here all night? The neighbors might talk…”</p><p>Rio shook her head, stepping back from the window. “You’ve got some nerve, Harkness.”</p><p>“Guilty,” Agatha said, swinging one leg over the sill and stepping into the room.</p><p>The air inside was warm and faintly smelled like lavender. Agatha took in Rio in her sweats and oversized hoodie, her hair half messily tied back. It was the first time seeing her in weeks. She looked tired.</p><p>Rio stood a few steps away, watching her with a guarded expression. “So, what do you want?” she asked, folding her arms.</p><p>“Easy tiger, hold onto those claws for a second.” Agatha interrupted, smiling as if she was letting Rio in on a secret joke. “I wouldn’t <em> dream </em> of coming by without a peace offering, but I couldn’t climb up balancing a pizza and a six-pack.” It didn’t make Rio laugh fully, but the amused snort was enough to push her to keep going. “If you promise to let me back in, I’ll take the stairs like a normal person and go grab it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, flopping onto the sofa with an eye roll.</p><p>“Better think fast before someone snags it off the stoop,” Agatha teased placing her hands on her hips and rocking on her heels as she waited.</p><p>“Go ahead,” she scoffed with a wave of her hand. “It’s not like I can outrun you to stop you.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, “Back in a second. Don’t lock me out.”</p><p>And for the second time tonight, she tested the endurance of her heart as she practically flew down the stairs to the front door. Thankfully both the pizza and the beer were still there, if a little colder.</p><p>Agatha grabbed both, balancing them precariously as she bounded back up the stairs. Her adrenaline from the earlier climb hadn’t quite worn off, but she told herself that was the only reason her heart was racing.</p><p>When she reached Rio’s door again, she didn’t bother knocking.</p><p>“Wow, you made it back in record time. Guess I’ll have to wait a little longer for that restraining order.” Rio said dryly, not looking up from the TV as she flicked through the channels, probably searching for something to put on as a kind of buffer.</p><p>Agatha smirked as she entered, setting the pizza and beer on the coffee table. “You’d miss me too much to go through with it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, but did snag two beers. She opened one with the cap of the other and put it to the side for Agatha before popping her own. Agatha slid her jacket off, tossing it carelessly over the arm of the sofa before sitting down to join her.</p><p>She opened the pizza box and gestured toward Rio. “Truce?”</p><p>Rio stared at the pizza for a moment before sighing and reaching for a slice. “Fine. But only because I’m starving. It’s such a pain in the ass to get down the stairs so I’ve been limited to what I can get delivered.”</p><p>“Well, if only there were people in your life who would be more than happy to help with things like that,” Agatha quipped, taking a slice of pizza. “Oh wait! You <em> do </em> but you seem to have conveniently forgotten that.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Rio bit out, her knuckles whitening around the neck of the bottle.</p><p>“What do I <em> want </em>?” Agatha repeated, incredulous. “You’ve been MIA for months, Rio. The team’s worried. I’m worried.”</p><p>“Well, you don’t have to be, there’s a lot more than one person who makes a team. If you can’t figure out how to win without me, that’s on you.” Rio said curtly, looking away.</p><p>“That isn’t what this is about. And that’s not how it works,” Agatha snapped, “You don’t just get to disappear and leave us hanging. Leave <em> me </em> hanging.”</p><p>Rio flinched at that, her gaze dropping to the floor. For a moment, the fire in Agatha dimmed, she was being too brash too harsh. She hadn’t come here to scold Rio, she just wanted to check on her.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, her voice quieter now. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, biting her lip. “I—I just needed space, okay?” she said finally, her voice cracking. “I didn’t want everyone hovering over me like I’m broken.”</p><p>Agatha softened. “Don’t be ridiculous. You’re not broken, you’re hurt. There’s a difference.”</p><p>Rio let out a bitter laugh, shaking her head. “Maybe. But I can’t stand sitting on the sidelines. Watching you all practice without me. Watching you all get beat up in games that you should be winning. It feels like—” She stopped, her voice trailing off as she clenched her fists.</p><p>“Like you’re being left behind,” Agatha finished, leaning closer. Rio didn’t move away.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio admitted, her voice barely audible.</p><p>Agatha hesitated before reaching out, placing a hand on Rio’s shoulder. “You’re not,” she said firmly. “No one’s leaving you behind. We’re not just your teammates. We’re your friends. Get your head out of your ass.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her then, her eyes shining slightly. “You’re annoyingly persistent, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, her fingers giving Rio’s shoulder a gentle squeeze. She’d do anything to keep away the tears that were threatening to fall down Rio’s cheeks. “Maybe. But you love it.”</p><p>The room was quiet for a few minutes as they ate, only interrupted by the sound of some basketball game playing on the tv in the background. Agatha didn’t push, knowing if Rio wanted to talk more, she would.</p><p>This was a friendly mental health check, not an interrogation. She could be patient.</p><p>Finally, Rio set her beer down. “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice soft but steady.</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “For what?”</p><p>“For ghosting,” Rio admitted, looking down at her lap. “For not answering. For being a shitty teammate.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “Please. Get over yourself. You’re not a shitty teammate. You’re hurt. Physically and, I promise I won’t rat you out, probably a little emotionally too. It’s okay to take time to deal with that. I’d be pissed if I got knocked out for months because of a shitty split second decision too.”</p><p>“Yeah, but I should’ve said something,” Rio countered, her voice tinged with guilt. “Instead of making everyone…worry.”</p><p>“You’re right should have. But, that’s how it goes. Should’ve, would’ve, could’ve, but <em>didn’t.</em>” Agatha said bluntly. “I get it though. I know how much being out on that track means to you. How hard it is not to be… strong. You get a reputation for always having the teams back and then you can’t. It sucks.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, watching her with cautiously. “You sound like you’re speaking from experience.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I’ve had my fair share of injuries. And I think despite your current theatrics I still hold the crown as the most stubborn person on the team.” She smirked. “The difference is, I didn’t have someone as charming and persistent as me to climb my fire escape and shove pizza at me. So, yeah your knee is fucked but we’re canceling the pity party of one. You could do worse.”</p><p>That earned her a small laugh, and Agatha felt a flicker of victory. Rio leaned back against the couch, her posture relaxing for the first time all night.</p><p>“Why do you care so much?” Rio asked after a beat, her voice quieter now. “I mean, yeah, we’re teammates, friends, but…you didn’t have to do all this.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and opened another beer. “You know why.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a sly grin as she tapped her bottle against the table. “Still trying to get in my pants, Harkness?”</p><p>She snorted, taking a sip as she figured out a response. “Obviously. I figured pizza, beer, and breaking and entering would be what finally sealed the deal.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, shaking her head. “You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Agatha said, setting her beer down and leaning forward, picking at the fraying hole in her jeans. Her tone grew softer despite herself, “Maybe that’s how it started. I’m not blind. You’re gorgeous, funny, annoyingly good at everything you do…”</p><p>“Go on,” Rio teased, though her voice was quieter now.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, a small smile on her lips before her gaze shifted to the floor. “But then you got hurt, and I—” She paused and chewed her lip as she chose her next words carefully. “Seeing you down like that, and then…just gone. It wasn’t fun anymore. Practice wasn’t fun. Every match has sucked. And it’s not just because we’re on a losing streak. I just… missed having you around.”</p><p>The words hung in the air, heavy and honest. Agatha risked a glance at Rio, who was watching her with wide keen eyes, but didn’t say anything else. The vulnerability made Agatha’s skin itch. She leaned back and tried to draw on a smirk, hoping that she hadn’t shared too much.</p><p>“Anyway, don’t let it go to your head. I just like having someone to boss around on the track. Keeps me sharp.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, the tension in her shoulders easing slightly. “Uh-huh. Sure.”</p><p>She smiled and tried to regain the charm she usually wielded with ease, hoping she’d, at least temporarily, dodged the emotional minefield of her own making.</p><p>“So…is the ‘no teammates’ rule still in place, or does my death-defying pizza delivery make you willing to consider a loophole?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“C’mon, technically we’re not teammates right now. You’re injured. And I’m pretty sure the rule shouldn't apply if one of us is benched.”</p><p>Rio’s bemused smile turned wry. “You think I’m gonna hook up with you while I’m sitting here with a bum leg? I’ll remind you my doctor said no strenuous activity.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged dramatically before wagging her eyebrows. “Hey, I’m just saying, the timing might be perfect. I don’t mind doing all the work.”</p><p>That earned her a real laugh, one that made Rio’s eyes crinkle at the corners as she threw her head back. Agatha immediately longed to hear it again. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And you’re smiling,” Agatha countered, leaning back with a satisfied grin. “Which means I’m doing something right.”</p><p>Rio shook her head but didn’t argue, her smile lingering. She rested her head against the back of the couch, her eyes drifting toward Agatha. The smile on her lips softened, her posture less guarded now.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll play along. What would you do if I wasn’t injured?” she asked, the question laced with teasing, but her tone held a note of curiosity that made Agatha pause.</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the question. She leaned forward and tilted her head as she considered her answer. Normally, she had no problem laying the charm on thick or leaning into overtly flirtatious banter, she knew how to form innuendo as easily as her own name.</p><p>But this felt different. If Rio was asking seriously—if there was even a chance she was considering... something more—Agatha wasn’t going to miss her shot.</p><p>“Well…” Agatha began, a slow smile spreading as she shifted a little closer on the couch letting their thighs brush. “If you weren’t injured, I’d probably still start with the pizza, because priorities. Then, I’d find some excuse to stick around—maybe we’d watch a movie, and I’d make sure to sit close enough to steal your blanket.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, but the corner of her mouth twitched upward. “Wow, mystery solved, <em> that’s</em> how you get the ladies. By flirting like a kid at summer camp. Real bold. You know, that’s not what I expected based on the rumors I’ve heard.”</p><p>“I’m not done,” Agatha said, her tone turning more playful as she leaned in a little further. “Once you were comfortable, I’d find some way to casually brush your knee, like I wasn’t doing it on purpose. And if you didn’t pull away, I might get a little braver and—”</p><p>“Braver, huh? You don’t strike me as the type to be coy.” Rio interrupted, her voice lower now, but there was a flicker of something more in her eyes. Interest.</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened. She was definitely onto something. “Maybe I’d tuck your hair behind your ear, or…” She let her voice trail off, her gaze locking onto Rio’s. “Or I’d just cut the shit and ask you if I could kiss you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, almost imperceptibly, but Agatha caught it. Her teasing demeanor faltered, replaced by something more genuine as she leaned back slightly, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“You’d ask?” Rio said softly, her tone unreadable. “If I remember, last time we did this you had a more direct approach.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her confidence wavering for a split second before she steadied herself. “Yeah. I’d ask. Because if I’m going to kiss you, <em> well</em>, <em> again</em>, I want it to be something you want too.”</p><p>The room was silent except for the faint hum of traffic outside and the noise from the tv. Rio’s gaze dropped to her lap, then back up to Agatha, her expression unreadable. For a moment, Agatha thought she might have miscalculated, but then Rio leaned forward, closing the distance between them ever so slightly.</p><p>“What if I said yes?” Rio asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her heart pounding as her hand hesitated between them. “Then I’d do this.”</p><p>She cupped Rio’s face gently, her thumb brushing over her cheek as she leaned in, pausing just a breath away. “This <em> is </em> okay right?” She was so close she could see her faint freckles.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered closed, and she nodded once, her lips parting as she whispered, “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need any more encouragement. She closed the gap, her lips meeting Rio’s in a kiss far more tentative than the one they had shared months ago at the party. In that moment the street noise faded, and all that mattered was the warmth of Rio’s lips on hers and the way she kissed back like she’d been waiting for this as long as Agatha had.</p><p>She deepened the kiss slowly, her hand sliding to the base of Rio’s neck, fingers tangling lightly in her messy hair. Rio’s breath hitched, and she tilted her head as she lifted a hand to cup Agatha’s cheek, responding with an eagerness that sent a thrill through her entire body.</p><p>She leaned closer, mindful not to put any weight near Rio’s injured leg, but unable to stop the way her body gravitated toward her. Agatha propped herself up with one hand on the arm of the couch as she leaned over her.</p><p>Rio’s hands found their way to Agatha’s waist, her touch hesitant at first but quickly growing bolder. Her fingers grazed beneath the hem of her sweater and her grip tightened as Agatha whimpered softly. </p><p>Agatha’s heart was racing, her senses drowning in the addictive press of Rio’s mouth. She could taste the beer on her tongue and instead of repulsive it was intoxicating. Every shift, every touch felt like a new discovery, and Agatha could feel her restraint slipping away with each passing moment.</p><p>When Agatha lightly nipped at Rio’s bottom lip, she felt a quiet moan escape her. Rio tugged her closer, her fingers flexing against Agatha’s sides and beginning to move higher under her sweater, and Agatha couldn’t help the returning hum of satisfaction that left her. She wanted more, but—</p><p>Agatha pulled back abruptly, her breathing uneven as she stared at Rio. Her lips were wet, slightly swollen from their kisses. Her cheeks were a gorgeous shade, far too flushed to just be from making out on the couch. </p><p>Agatha suspected though that she probably looked the same way. She squeezed her eyes shut, willing her heart to calm down. “Oh,” she said softly, her voice tinged with regret. “I get it now.”</p><p>Rio blinked up at her, her cheeks and lips flushed the same red from the kiss. “Get what?” she asked, her voice husky.</p><p>“What you said before. The first time I kissed you. About not wanting to stop.” Agatha exhaled a shaky laugh, her hand brushing Rio’s jaw as she pulled back further, forcing some distance between them. “If we keep going, I’m not going to want to stop either.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, still catching her breath. “You’re probably right,” she said after a moment, her lips twitching into a wry smile. “I guess this is the part where I say thanks for dinner but it’s uh… getting late and all that.”</p><p>Agatha smiled back, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek one last time before she let her hand drop. “Yeah,” she said, her voice soft. “It’s the part where I probably should get going.”</p><p>She stood and grabbed her jacket, throwing it over her shoulder as she made her way to the door. At the threshold, she paused and glanced back at Rio, unable to resist teasing her one last time. “Don’t worry. I’ll be back before you know it. Don't ghost us again, you know I'm not afraid of making a scene.”</p><p>As she stepped outside, her lips still tingled faintly. She couldn’t help but brush her fingers over her mouth as she walked as if to hold onto the sensation a little longer.</p><p>Her mind replayed the way Rio had leaned into her touch, the soft catch of her breath when Agatha’s hand found its way to her neck. She could still feel the heat of Rio’s palms on her waist, hesitant but sure enough to send a spark down her spine. It had been intoxicating—so unlike anything she’d expected. So much more than she’d planned when she’d originally come over with the goal of knocking some sense into her teammate.</p><p>She'd always been an overachiever.</p><p>As Agatha reached the corner of the street, her steps faltered. She glanced back at the apartment building, as a sudden noise caught her attention.</p><p>"Hey, Harkness!"</p><p>Agatha craned her neck and looked up to see Rio leaning out of her bedroom window, her hair messy and her face still adorably flushed.</p><p>“You forgot something!” Rio called down, her voice carrying a playful edge.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, brow arching as she leaned back to look up at her. “Oh yeah? What’s that?”</p><p>Rio rested her arms on the windowsill, giving her a wry smile. “Next time, bring pad thai. Maybe some spring rolls. And <em> then </em> I’ll let you use the stairs.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh, shaking her head. She raised a hand to salute Rio, her fingers brushing her temple. “You drive a hard bargain. I’ll see what I can do. Don’t run off anywhere.”</p><p>Rio smirked and disappeared back inside, leaving Agatha standing in the quiet street with a dumbstruck smile that wouldn’t leave her face.</p><p>The walk back to her place felt shorter somehow, her steps lighter than they’d been in weeks. She was already mentally planning the next excuse she’d need to see Rio again. Something told her it wouldn’t take much convincing—not after tonight.</p><p>It’d be a while before The Coven had their second best player back. But until then, perhaps there was a new game to be played.</p><p>They didn’t agree on when she’d swing by again, it just became a routine. Agatha would come by on Friday nights with takeout. Rio would impishly ignore the first three times she hit the buzzer before finally letting her in. They’d settle on the couch and chat while watching a game or some awful reality show. And while Agatha would always leave, more often than not it would be after having her breath stolen by increasingly heated kisses.</p><p>Once she left with a hickey and caught herself admiring it in the mirror for days.</p><p>But she didn’t press for more, and Rio didn’t ask.</p><hr/><p>The rink was packed for the championship qualifier. Agatha led the warm-ups with her usual focus, as they got ready to fight to salvage their season.</p><p>As the team returned to the bench, there was a ripple of surprised chatter that rolled through the team. Agatha followed the shift in energy and froze, her gaze snagging on a familiar figure sitting in the stands.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She was wearing a Coven hoodie, her hair tied back in a loose ponytail, knee brace visible over her jeans. She leaned on the railing, grinning as she gave a small wave.</p><p>Agatha skated up to the railing, her grin breaking wide as she leaned on it. “Am I seeing a ghost or did you finally decide to grace us with your presence again?” she teased, her voice light but her chest tight with an unexpected rush of joy.</p><p>“Figured I’d see if you’ve been holding it down without me,” Rio shot back, her voice carrying easily over the noise.</p><p>Agatha laughed, a laugh that felt lighter than anything she’d let herself feel in months. “Well, watch closely and maybe you’ll learn a few things.”</p><p>When the bout started, The Coven wasted no time and came out swinging. The opposing team was tough, and the score stayed neck and neck for most of the first half. But Agatha was unstoppable, every play an effort to channel the energy generated knowing Rio was watching. </p><p>By the time the final buzzer sounded, The Coven had won decisively. Agatha had shattered the all-time record for points scored in a single match, and the crowd erupted in cheers. Her teammates swarmed her, knocking her to the ground and chanting her name, their voices blending with the roar of the stands.</p><p>From her spot in the bleachers, Rio cheered wildly, her smile larger and more genuine than Agatha had ever seen it.</p><p>The rink emptied slowly, the celebratory buzz lingering in the air. Her team filed off into the locker room, leaving her with a few teasing comments that she ignored. Agatha only wanted congratulations from one person, and climbed the steps two at a time, plopping down next to Rio with a satisfied sigh.</p><p>“Not bad, huh?” Agatha said, leaning back and stretching her arms behind her head, letting her cocky grin shine through.</p><p>“Not bad?” Rio echoed, her tone incredulous. “Fucking crushed it, Harkness. That was unreal.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “It was, wasn’t it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, laughing softly. “And I love how humble you are! But seriously, congrats on the record.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, her voice dropping to a teasing lilt. “You know, I probably wouldn’t have broken it if you weren’t benched. Less competition.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed playfully. “And here I thought I was special. I thought you scored all those points just to show off for me.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha admitted, her tone mock-serious. She turned slightly toward Rio, her grin softening. “Did it work? Are you impressed?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Don’t let it get to your head.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in just a fraction closer, her voice dropping conspiratorially. “Too late. My ego’s already through the roof. But…” She glanced down at Rio’s knee brace and back up, her grin shifting into something mischievous. “I have a specific way I want to celebrate.”</p><p>Rio arched a wry eyebrow. “Oh? And what would that be?”</p><p>“A victory lap. You and me.” Agatha tilted her head toward the empty track below.</p><p>Rio let out a dry laugh, gesturing at her knee. “Not sure if you noticed, but this thing isn’t exactly screaming ‘nimble’ right now. I just got cleared to start <em> light </em> exercise. And I don’t even have my skates.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her protest, reaching down to tug a pair of scuffed practice skates out of her bag. She held them up like a prize. “Good thing I came prepared.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, clearly torn between disbelief and amusement. “You just so happened to bring extra skates to a game?”</p><p>“I always bring them,” Agatha said matter-of-factly. “Never know when you’ll need a backup pair. And tonight, it looks like they’re for you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, chuckling softly. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“True,” Agatha replied, batting her lashes playfully as she plopped the skates onto Rio’s lap. “But you can’t say no. Not when <em> all I want </em>to celebrate is for you to skate a lap with me.” She gave her a pout to seal the deal.</p><p>Rio looked at her, her expression softening slightly. “Look, I—”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha interrupted gently, her teasing tone dipping into something warmer. “I won’t let you fall, I promise. We’ll take it slow. I just… I miss skating with you.”</p><p>Rio sighed, her fingers brushing the worn leather of the skates. “You never give up, huh?”</p><p>“It’s part of my charm.” Agatha grinned, standing and holding out her hand. “C’mon. Just one. For me? Just like old times.”</p><p>Rio groaned but grabbed Agatha’s hand, letting her pull her to her feet. Agatha kneeled and helped lace up the skates. When they were secure, she stayed close as Rio stepped onto the track, her movements hesitant like it was her very first time.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Agatha said, her voice firm but reassuring. She slid an arm around Rio’s waist for support, their skates rolling in unison as they took the first few cautious strides.</p><p>Rio wobbled slightly, gripping Agatha’s arm. “You’d better not let me fall, Harkness.”</p><p>“Never,” Agatha said softly, her voice filled with quiet confidence.</p><p>They picked up a slow rhythm, the sound of their skates on the polished floor echoing in the empty space. Agatha kept her promise, staying close, and guiding Rio as she found her balance.</p><p>By the time they finished their lap, Rio’s smile matched Agatha’s, her cheeks flushed as she tried a small spin. She skated backward a few paces before coming to a stop.</p><p>“See?” Agatha said, beaming. “You’ve still got it.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, a quiet fondness in her gaze. “Maybe.”</p><p>They stood there for a moment until, with an uncharacteristic tentativeness, Agatha held out her hand again.</p><p>“One more lap?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t hesitate to take her hand. “One more.”</p>

<p>
<span>Rio’s return to the track should have been a triumph. Instead, it had rapidly descended into chaos.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She still wasn’t match fit—not completely—but when the league needed someone to step in as a referee for the spring tournament, Rio had agreed. Having her back skating with the team would have been ideal, but seeing her out there in stripes was better than not seeing her at all. Agatha had missed watching Rio’s smooth, commanding style on the track, and seeing her roll out in her ref gear had stirred something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before the match, Rio had sought her out during warm-ups. She caught Agatha by the arm, steering her to the side with a wry, pointed look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Play nice out there,” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> nice,” Agatha shot back, not missing a beat. “It’s not </span>
<em>
<span>my fault</span>
</em>
<span> everyone else gets in my way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched her eyebrow, her lips twitching with the effort to suppress a smile. “Hey, I’m serious. Normally, they wouldn’t even let me ref for a team I’ve played on, but Kitty had to bow out last minute, and they were desperate. I’ve got to be extra careful not to look like I’m playing favorites.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed a hand to her chest, a picture of mock innocence. “Moi?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m serious,” Rio warned, though the corner of her mouth betrayed her amusement. “If I see you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, then don’t look too closely,” Agatha interrupted, grinning in a wicked way that made it clear there’d be no holding back her usual antics for Rio’s benefit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s rolled her eyes and shook her head, smiling fondly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clean match, Harkness. I’m counting on you,” she sighed, glancing around to make sure no one was looking before sending her off with a light slap to her ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The whistle blew to signal the start of the match, and Agatha surged forward, her legs pumping hard as she wove through the pack. It was a high-stakes game, with both teams neck and neck in the standings coming into the bout.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no time to waste, and Agatha quickly made her presence known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She ducked low, slipping past the opposing blockers with practiced ease, but in her eagerness, she threw a shoulder into a player just a little too forcefully. The other skater stumbled, and the sharp trill of a whistle followed immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Purple, seven, back block!” Rio’s voice rang out, firm and unmistakable. She pointed at Agatha, wagging a finger with an exaggerated scolding gesture as she signaled the penalty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, pushing off toward the penalty box. She caught Rio’s gaze as she passed, her lips twitching into a smirk. “Really? That was soft, I barely touched her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep it up, and you’ll see how hard I can be,” Rio shot back smoothly, her tone all business but Agatha could tell she was holding back a smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barked a laugh as she slid into the penalty box. She wasn’t seriously upset. How could she be? Rio was back, and 30 seconds was a small price to pay to have her eyes on her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The match wore on, quickly proving to be one of the most heated and competitive games of the season. Both teams were relentless, trading leads every few minutes. Agatha was in her element, cutting through the chaos like a knife. But she wasn’t the only one working overtime.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, true to her word, was keeping an eagle eye on her—and calling her out at every opportunity. By the start of the second half, Agatha had racked up five penalties, all courtesy of Rio’s whistle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re killing me, stripes,” Agatha muttered as she skated past Rio after yet another call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re killing yourself, seven,” Rio retorted, her lips quirking despite her best efforts to stay impartial.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, biting back a retort. She couldn’t decide if Rio was genuinely out to get her or if she was overcompensating in her effort to appear unbiased. Either way, it was annoying… but not entirely unpleasant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a thrill in the tension between them, the way Rio’s gaze lingered just a moment too long when she called her penalties, or the faint flush that crept up her neck when Agatha mouthed off at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If it had only stayed like that through the final whistle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the final five minutes, the score was still tied, the crowd shouted at a fever pitch, and Agatha was out for blood. Her teammates shouted back and forth between each other as the clock wore down. The pack was a blur of bodies and wheels, and in the chaos, the blocker that had been harassing her all match finally made a mistake, leaving a tiny gap for Agatha to make a move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha faked her out, quickly turning to weave behind Alice, and cutting across the back half. Hot on her tail, number thirteen on the other team tried to follow. Jen caught her with her elbow, a move meant to slow her down. But she was going too fast to keep her footing. In slow motion the player spun out, her skates catching awkwardly on the edge of the track, and careened straight into Rio. The collision was brutal, the sound of both of them hitting the floor reverberating through the arena.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio went down hard, Agatha’s heart lurched as she was sent nine months back in time. Back to the day of the jump, the clip, the fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The whistles screamed, but Agatha barely heard them. A familiar rage didn’t simmer, it erupted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck, thirteen?” she roared, tearing across the track toward the fallen skaters.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was already trying to wave her off, pushing herself upright with a grimace. “I’m fine,” she snapped, but her voice was tight with pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t matter. Thirteen had been reckless all game, but this was the last straw. Agatha’s fists clenched as she closed the distance, her vision tunneling on the smirking skater.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey! I’m talking to you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harkness!” An official’s voice barked, but Agatha ignored it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t matter. None of it mattered. How </span>
<em>
<span>dare</span>
</em>
<span> she? Thirteen had been reckless the entire match; sloppy hits, lazy footwork, a complete disregard for safety.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The fuck is wrong with you?” Agatha snarled, her fury a storm. “If you can’t fucking control yourself, you shouldn’t be out here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harkness!” A referee’s voice barked from somewhere nearby, but it was lost under the roar of the blood rushing in her ears. Her vision tunneled on the player, who was still sprawled on the ground, smirking despite the chaos she’d caused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s your problem, Purple?” She shoved herself upright, meeting Agatha’s glare with a sneer. “Just lost my footing. I thought she’d get out of my way. Isn’t she your nimble one?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw red. Before she could think better of it, her fist connected with Thirteen’s jaw, a crack loud enough to echo through the arena.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gasps erupted from the crowd, a mix of shock and rabid bloodthirsty delight as skaters scrambled to intervene.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thirteen staggered, one hand flying to her face. But she wasn’t down. The sneer twisted into a feral grin as she launched herself at Agatha, her elbow arcing wide. Agatha didn’t duck in time; the blow caught her lip, splitting it open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hands grabbed Agatha’s waist, pulling her back, but she struggled against them, her skates scraping against the track. She swung blindly, fury driving her every move. There were several pairs of hands on her now, several familiar voices shouting at her to cool it, get it together, and a flurry of other admonishments.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The whistles screamed louder now, as the referees tried to restore order to the teams and the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Amid the chaos, a voice rang out—low, firm, unyielding. “Purple! Seven! </span>
<em>
<span>Foul out!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze mid-swing, the words slicing through her rage like a full keg of ice water being dumped over her. She twisted to face the source, and there was Rio, standing tall despite the crash, her brown eyes blazing with authority.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding me,” Agatha hissed, chest heaving as she yanked herself free of the hands holding her back. She stormed toward Rio, her skates grinding against the track, anger radiating off her in waves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t flinch. She planted her feet firmly, arms crossed, her jaw set. “You’re done, Harkness. Leave the track.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, her busted lip throbbing in time with her pulse. “Are you kidding me? Are you seriously not going to call anything on her? She wiped you out!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’ll handle it,” Rio snapped, her tone sharp. “I don’t need you to fight my battles. We have rules for a reason. Now go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes burned as she searched Rio’s face for any crack, any sign that this was all some kind of cruel joke. But Rio’s expression didn’t waver.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you gonna make me?” Agatha growled, her voice low and dangerous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softened, just a fraction. Her next words were quieter, gentler, but no less firm. “Agatha. Please. Don’t make a scene. Hit the locker room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her body taut as every muscle still coiled and ready to spring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait for me,” Rio added, her voice dropping even lower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, the fury in Agatha’s chest wavered, just enough for her to register the faint plea beneath Rio’s steady exterior. With a sharp exhale, she spun on her heel, eyeing the other skater. She left, but not before spitting the blood pooling in her mouth at her feet.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>As the locker room door slammed shut behind her, the roar of the crowd felt like a distant memory. Agatha tore off her helmet, throwing it onto the bench. A few seconds later she threw her skates in the corner as well as she began to pace. Her lip hurt, but it was nothing compared to the sting of frustration and humiliation coursing through her veins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could Rio pull her out like that? After everything? How dare she scold her just for looking out for her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swiped at the blood trickling down her chin, muttering curses under her breath as the adrenaline finally began to fade. But the anger didn’t go anywhere, it lingered, heavy and hot, twisting in her gut like a knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes passed, though it felt like hours before the sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway. The door creaked open, and Rio stepped inside, her expression unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped pacing, crossing her arms as she leaned against the lockers, her glare sharp enough to cut. “So, did she get a slap on the wrist or what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, closing the door behind her and leaning against it. “She took her penalty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great,” Agatha snapped, rolling her eyes. “That’s just great. Meanwhile, I’m sitting in here like a fucking loser, because you </span>
<em>
<span>think</span>
</em>
<span> I overreacted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did overreact,” Rio said, her tone calm but firm. “You punched her, Agatha. You’re lucky she didn’t press charges.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She deserved it,” Agatha shot back. “She wiped you out. She could’ve seriously hurt you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was an accident,” Rio said, stepping closer now, her voice steady but quieter. “But this little outburst tells me a lot. How am I supposed to be on the team again, actually taking hits, if you go ballistic like that? You can’t lose your head every time something happens to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glare faltered, her jaw tightening. “It wasn’t just an accident, Rio. She was reckless. She—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held up a hand, cutting her off. “I know. And it was dealt with. By the rule book.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s glare faltered, her frustration shifting into something rawer. “It’s not just that, Rio. She was out of control—she had no right to be on that track, and now she’s risking </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>. You’re—” She broke off, biting down on the words she wasn’t ready to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio arched a brow, her lips quirking into a faint smirk that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’m what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, running a hand through her hair as she turned away. “It doesn’t matter. The point is, someone had to do something, and you—” She stopped, her shoulders tense as she struggled to find the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, stepping closer until she was just a foot away. Her voice softened, “Agatha. Look at me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated, her jaw tightening as she slowly turned to face her. Rio’s dark eyes met hers, steady and unwavering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it,” Rio said, her voice quiet but firm. “You were pissed, and you had every right to be. But throwing punches? That’s not how we handle it. Not here. It’s a bad look for not just for yourself, but for the team, the sport…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“…and me.” Rio’s voice softened, the frustration giving way to something gentler. “Do you think I want my first game back—even as a ref—to be remembered for this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightened, the guilt cutting deeper than she cared to admit. “I wasn’t thinking about that. I was—” She stopped, her words catching on the weight of her emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, a knowing smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “Yeah, I noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The teasing edge in Rio’s voice made Agatha bristle, but it also sent a thrill racing through her. The locker room felt too small, the tension between them too thick to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away, trying to steady herself. “I didn’t mean for it to go that far.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, and suddenly, her presence was all Agatha could feel. “Maybe not,” she said softly, “but you’re not good at holding back, </span>
<em>
<span>are you</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That broke something in Agatha. The rawness of Rio’s voice, the heat in her gaze—it was too much. Before she could think it through, Agatha surged forward, her hands grabbing the front of Rio’s striped jersey and hauling her in as she kissed her fiercely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a heartbeat, startled, but then she responded just as hard. Her hands gripped Agatha’s hips, pulling her closer as their mouths clashed. The intensity sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine, and she felt Rio’s teeth scrape against her lip, reopening the cut she’d gotten earlier in the game. The metallic taste of blood hit both of their tongues, but neither of them cared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, gasping for air, Rio’s lips were swollen, and her eyes darted over Agatha. “Just to be clear, that stunt wasn’t…okay,” she murmured, though the grin tugging at her lips betrayed her. “But damn, you looked hot out there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help the breathless laugh that escaped her, though her hands stayed fisted in Rio’s jersey. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio said, her tone dipping into something huskier, more dangerous. “The way you threw that punch? Hot as hell. Dumb, reckless, stupid, but hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Yeah. That pretty much sums me up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not stupid,” Rio murmured before crashing into another kiss against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The metallic clang of the lockers echoed through the room as Rio pressed her weight into Agatha, their lips colliding again. Agatha gasped softly at the cold metal against her back, then again at the warmth of Rio’s hands sliding up her sides. She tugged at Rio’s jersey, her fingers curling into the damp fabric before pulling it over her head in one swift motion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s skin glistened faintly, still flushed from the game, and Agatha’s breath hitched at the sight. She leaned in and pressed a kiss to her pulse, letting her tongue flick out to taste her skin and sweat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cautiously, she let her teeth scrape over the spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darkened, her smirk turning feral as she grabbed the hem of Agatha’s jersey and yanked it over her head, tossing it to the side without breaking eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything sparked as Rio leaned in again, her lips capturing Agatha’s in a kiss that was rougher, hungrier. Agatha moaned softly against her mouth, her hands moving to Rio’s hips, tugging her even closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio’s hands found the waistband of Agatha’s shorts, she hesitated for the briefest moment, her gaze searching Agatha’s face. “Say the word, and I’ll stop,” she murmured, her voice low and steady despite the storm of emotion in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, her own hands deftly tugging at Rio’s belt. “Don’t you dare stop now,” she whispered, her words both command and plea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need further encouragement. She grinned, pressing Agatha harder against the lockers, her lips finding her neck again as their clothes hit the floor. Both of them were a mess of tangled limbs, flushed skin, and ragged breaths, their movements growing more urgent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” Agatha huffed, “The match, did we win?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded as she steered them to the end shower stall. “Mhm. And they’re busy celebrating so we have a bit of time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both startled as Agatha turned the handle and cold water sprayed over both of them. “Fuck! It’s the other one!” They laughed as they clung to each other, shaking slightly as the water heated up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio traced her thumb over Agatha’s split lip, wiping away the last of the dried blood. For a moment it looked like she was about to speak, but Agatha kissed her again before she could.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck I want you.” Her hands wandered greedily over Rio’s body, turning them so her back was against the wall of the shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved her hands to slip between Rio’s legs, still murmuring against her neck as she tried to convey just </span>
<em>
<span>how much</span>
</em>
<span> she wanted her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she brushed over Rio’s clit for the first time she was rewarded by the most delicious gasp and she smirked against her neck. But her victory was short-lived as they heard the locker room door creak open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Wanda’s voice echoed, startling them both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her breath catching in her throat. She turned her head slightly to meet Rio’s wide-eyed gaze. “Shh, hang on” she mouthed, pressing a finger to her lips before wrapping her hands under Rio’s thighs and lifting her up so that only one pair of feet would be seen under the shower wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looped her arms around her shoulders and locked her legs around her waist. Agatha tried not to think too hard about how she felt pressed against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quiet,” She whispered her voice steady despite the racing of her heart. Agatha took a deep breath to steel herself before raising her voice to call over the spray of the shower. “Yeah, I’m in here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You good? The team wants to see you,” Wanda called back, her voice edging closer. “I know you’re pissed you got thrown out, but you still helped us get the win. You should celebrate with us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, weighing her options, before replying. “I just need a minute to cool off, Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clamped a hand over her own mouth to stifle a laugh, her body shaking with silent mirth. Agatha swatted her hip lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda didn’t seem deterred. “Cool off? Or are you sulking in there?” she teased, the sound of her footsteps stopping just before the first stall. “Should I come check on you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darted to Rio, whose face was flushed—not from embarrassment but from the suppressed laughter threatening to burst forth. Agatha rolled her eyes before shouting back, “I’m fine! Unless, of course, you want to join me in here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that, Rio scowled and bit her shoulder hard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, then Wanda laughed. “Tempting, Harkness, but I think I’ll pass. Just don’t drown yourself in there alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got it,” Agatha replied, her voice breezy. As she heard Wanda’s footsteps heading toward the door, she lowered Rio back down, and quickly curled two fingers inside her. Rio sank her teeth into her neck to stifle her moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh hey,” Wanda called, her voice distant as if she were just poking her head through the door. “You haven’t seen Vidal have you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took every bit of restraint she had not to laugh. But she decided in that moment that if she had to suffer, Rio did too. She began to pump her fingers inside her, grinning devilishly as Rio’s eyes widened and she bit down on her lip to stifle her moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, I haven’t,” Agatha called breezily, pausing to nip at her earlobe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, if you find her before I do… don’t go off on her. She was just doing her job. We’ll catch you at the afterparty”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agathe grinned and curled her fingers hard. “Yep. I’ve got her handled. Don’t worry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, they heard the locker room door shut completely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are a fucking menace,” Rio ground out between her clenched teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh baby let me handle you. Captain’s orders.” Agatha teased, pulling one of her legs up and encouraging Rio to give her better access.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed her shoulder and pulled her closer as she wrapped her leg up around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck. You feel so good. We should’ve been doing this the whole time,” Rio hummed kissing at the column of Agatha’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was your stupid rules that said we couldn’t,” she growled, curling her fingers against her front wall again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped against her, clinging to her shoulders as she rocked her hips down against her hand. Agatha felt every flex of her body as she ground against her, eagerly matching her frantic pace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t wait to get you home,” she murmured rolling her thumb over her clit again. “I can’t wait to take my time with you. Use my strap on you. Taste you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned loudly, the sound echoing off the tiled words, and Agatha briefly wondered how far that sound would carry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you like that idea, honey? Imagine all the things I can do with a bit more room,” she kissed Rio hungrily and pressed her thumb more firmly against her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we can do that. Whatever you want.” Rio choked out, stuttering out her words as her nails dug into Agatha’s back to pull her closer still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha applied the same energy she brought to their matches, the same competitive force, to a singular focus of getting Rio off. She could feel her tightening around her fingers. Rio’s hands slipped up and down her back as she writhed between her and the wall, scrambling for purchase as if she were trying to climb up her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She followed every move, not letting up her pace until Rio stiffened and cried out, her nails raking down her back. Agatha wondered if there’d be marks tomorrow, she hoped there would be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed Rio’s throat, careful not to leave a visible mark. Gently she lowered Rio’s leg until she had both feet firmly on the floor. Her hands circled around her waist, still half holding her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Small kisses were peppered down her neck. Tiny nips over the swell of her breast, here she could leave some marks without them being caught and she delighted in doing so. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So she carried on as Rio caught her breath until they both felt the heat of the shower start to fade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“C’mon, we should get out of here. I think the cold shower thing is for before sex not after.” Agatha teased, stepping out and wrapping herself in a towel before tossing one to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught it but quickly looped it over Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her into another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lay down on the bench. Let me take care of you,” she murmured, her voice still low and heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a skeptical look. “No way. You know how many sweaty disgusting people have sat on those?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Rio shrugged and gave her a cocky smile, “I’ll lay down and you can sit on—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was quieted with another hungry kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll hold you to that,” Agatha promised. “Later. We </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> need to get to the party before any more rumors start to spread.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The steam lingered in the locker room as Agatha pulled her shirt over her head, still toweling her damp hair. Across from her, Rio buttoned up her shirt, her movements unhurried but precise, projecting cool confidence despite the faint flush still coloring her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tossed her towel onto a bench, crossing her arms as she leaned against the lockers much like she had been when Rio first came in almost an hour ago. “So,” she began, her tone dripping with mock seriousness, “remind me what’s the penalty for hooking up with a teammate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look up as she tucked in her shirt and fastened her belt, but the smirk playing on her lips was unmistakable. “Well… like you’ve been saying, technically, you’re not a teammate anymore, so I’d say you’re in the clear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” Agatha said, raising an eyebrow. “So I </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> good enough that you finally agreed to my loophole. Convenient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally glanced up, her dark eyes glinting with amusement. “It’s not breaking a rule if you’re willing to go out with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Broke the rule? You started it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, her smirk turning sly. “Technically, you kissed me first a while back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pretended to mull it over, tapping her chin. “Hmm. Well, considering you made me a target out there tonight with all those penalties...you might owe me more than dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin grew, her gaze dropping briefly to Agatha’s lips. “Oh, I already have some ideas in mind to pay you back.” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The team’s after-party was already in full swing when Agatha and Rio arrived. Music thumped through the bar, a mix of laughter and voices weaving around it. They had claimed a table in the corner, their drinks scattered around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice spotted them first, nudging Jen and muttering something under her breath. Without a word, she reached into her pocket and slid a crumpled twenty-dollar bill across the table. Jen snatched it up with a triumphant grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow as they approached, tossing her bag onto an empty chair. “What was that about?” she asked, gesturing toward the exchange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shrugged, her face a picture of innocence. “Nothing you need to worry about, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mhm,” Agatha said, eyeing them suspiciously before grabbing a chair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda leaned back in her seat, a teasing grin stretching across her face. “Well, well, look who decided to grace us with their presence. Thought you two might’ve ditched us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, leaning casually against the table. “I had to get a shower! I didn’t want to show up like all of you sweaty heathens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Wanda drawled, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she turned her attention to Rio. “And what about you, Rio? How was </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> shower?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The table went silent for a beat, as Jen choked on her drink and Alice burst into laughter, slapping the table with delight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, to her credit, barely flinched. She gave Wanda a cool, measured look, though the faintest flush crept up her neck. “Refreshing,” she replied evenly, taking the seat beside Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Under the table, Agatha slid her hand onto her knee and squeezed lightly. Between the ruthless and familiar teasing among their teammates and Rio back by her side, it felt like everything was falling back into place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As it should be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked back to Agatha’s place together, ignoring the catcalls from their team as they exited the bar. Rio wrapped her arm around her shoulder, pulling her close to her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I ask you something?” Agatha asked, face flushed and a little brazen after the drinks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, watch the curb there,” her more sober companion replied as they crossed the street.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why now? What changed? I thought your rule—“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and shushed her with a quick kiss. “It wasn’t ever a real rule. I just… if we crossed that line, I wanted it to be more than a fling you know? And maybe I wanted to see you sweat a bit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed loudly, throwing her head back as she leaned against her, slipping her hand into Rio’s back pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a good thing I’m so competitive then. I’m </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> going to back down from a challenge. I like to win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and shook her head as they approached Agatha’s building.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know sex was a competition,” she teased as Agatha fumbled with her keys.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is if you’re doing it right.” Agatha quickly fired back before pushing the door open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her a cheeky wink as she stepped in and closed the door behind her. “Prove it then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she did.</span>
