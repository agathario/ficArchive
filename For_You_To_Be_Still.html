<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha felt recharged. She always did when there were at least three bodies at her feet and this time she’d managed five. She took a deep breath and looked at the purple weave swirling around her torso. It had been a while and this time it felt great. </p><p>People were desperate in the aftermath of half of the population disappearing suddenly. Witches were scrambling with half their covens gone. If she wanted to, Agatha was sure that she could gather another group within a week. </p><p>She was so lost in the thoughts of massive amounts of power that she had forgotten the reason she usually left fairly quickly after killing. </p><p>But she didn’t expect to be able to see her.</p><p>It wasn’t the silent, swift, and regal visage she was used to. </p><p>Rio stumbled into the cleaning and collapsed to her knees. A spray of flowers grew in a sweeping motion, like a speeding clock hand around Rio followed by their rapid death and decay. She cried out, clutching her abdomen and shrinking into a ball of a person, a black ichor weeping out of her eyes and the corner of her mouth. </p><p>Everything seemed to calm and Agatha moved to her, falling to her knees, “What happened?”</p><p>Rio seized one last time, grabbing a fistful of earth under her hand. From her touch, a stream of mushrooms shot out in a line toward the bodies Agatha created, enveloping them at a lightning speed and dragging them underground. </p><p>She closed her eyes, splaying out on the ground in front of Agatha, who didn’t know how to help. </p><p>Rio’s chest was heaving like she couldn’t catch her breath for several seconds before she seemed to calm. She didn’t even seem to register that Agatha was there until Agatha pushed the hair out of her face and asked again, “What happened?”</p><p>Rio pushed herself into sitting. “Everything is wrong.” She seemed delirious and exhausted. She tucked a leg under herself in an attempt to stand and careened to one side, only staying upright because Agatha caught her. </p><p>“Does this have to do with half of everyone disappearing?” Agatha asked, lowering them both back to the ground.</p><p>Rio nodded, trying to get up again. “The natural balance - it’s - I have to go.”</p><p>“Go where?” Agatha asked, guiding Rio into a standing position, but not letting her go in case she fell again.</p><p>“I’m -” Rio started, but another flash of flora sprouted around them, this time trees growing abnormally fast in a circle around them, reaching full heights of thirty feet before they started decaying from the inside out. </p><p>“Wherever you’re going,” Agatha looked up at the massive trees all starting to crack and groan above them. “Take me with you.” She knew at least one if not all of them would collapse on top of them at any second. </p><p>With a soft sigh, they blinked out of existence and reappeared somewhere else. The effort of moving them caused Rio to pass out completely, fully going limp in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Agatha looked around. She found that they were in a small cottage that seemed very familiar in the most annoying way. She huffed and pushed Rio onto the bed with less care than she would have had she not realized that they were back in the cottage they shared when they were together hundreds of years ago.</p><p>Agatha tightened her coat around herself and looked around. It was exactly as she had remembered it, though a little chilly. There were plants growing everywhere and sunshine pouring through the windows. </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, passed out on the bed, then looked around. She wasn’t sure she could stand being there for very long so, as she did when she got uncomfortable, she left. Or at least she tried to. </p><p>She moved to the front door of the cottage, wrenching it open and instead of a sunshine filled glade where they had spent years taking walks and foraging, she found a void. She took a tentative step toward the edge of the porch and looked down. There wasn’t much to see because the light from the house was swallowed in every direction. There was nothing. </p><p>She stepped back inside and picked up the nearest small object, which happened to be a candle and threw it into the void. There was no sound and she could only track it for a second before it was swallowed. </p><p>“Great,” she huffed and walked back into the cottage, letting the door close. </p><p>Several attempts to rouse Rio were unsuccessful and the last one ended with Rio writhing in pain and screaming. Agatha gave up and decided to make herself at home. Again. </p><p>She started a fire to warm the place up and grabbed a book to read. There was no getting out until Rio was ready and Rio was not in a state to do much. </p><p>Agatha kept looking up from her book at Rio whose face would writhe in pain every so often. She would let out a small whine and then contort. The plants in the cottage would bloom and then whither in a rapid cycle in a massive fluctuation of power. </p><p>Agatha would force her thoughts to ‘maybe the pain is what she deserves’ and ‘maybe since she’s less powerful she can be defeated’, but those thoughts always felt so hollow when it came to Rio. She crossed one leg over the other and leaned on the arm of the chair she was on, staring intently at her. She watched as Rio lay there, her lips parted and her eyes squeezed shut, against the sheets that used to be theirs. She was trying so hard to be angry, but she’d never seen Rio so weak.</p><p>Her eyes flickered to the kitchen. There was a small, curved knife on the counter. She could probably at the very least do some damage while she had the upper hand. </p><p>Her jaw clenched when she looked back at Rio. The fingers around her stomach gripped hard and she squirmed, kicking the blankets away.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha couldn’t just watch. With a frustrated, “Ahhgg!” she pushed up out of the chair, tossing the unread book onto the table. She set the kettle on the woodburning stove, then dipped some cloth into the water in the wash basin. She moved to the bed and sat next to Rio. Her face was smeared with something Agatha couldn’t place, but it couldn’t be comfortable. She carefully cleaned Rio’s face and then rinsed out the rag. She brought it back and placed it on Rio’s forehead. </p><p>“This isn’t a pathetic attempt to win me back right?” Agatha asked, pushing the hair out of Rio’s face. </p><p>Rio’s only answer was a mewling followed by another surge in the plant life. </p><p>Agatha exhaled loudly and stood up. “Okay, so I will do some research and see if we can get you stabilized so I can go home.” Agatha moved to the hoards of books they had both collected over the years. It was all starting to come back to her where she might find more information about green witches and the natural balance. She had to stand on a stack of books and reach for a tome on the top of a bookcase. But as she pulled it down, a cascade of letters fell with them as well. </p><p>She ducked her head as they fell, watching them come to rest on the ground. As soon as she knelt to pick them up, she realized what they were. They were the love letters they’d written each other. Rio would leave one on her pillow when she left to do her job. Agatha would leave one in a tree nearby, knowing Rio would find it. Rio would leave one on the open windowsill and Agatha would tuck one into the pocket of Rio’s cloak. </p><p>Since she was older and more jaded it seemed like something two naive lovebirds would do, but she remembered how sweet it was. She remembered how reading Rio’s letters made her feel. She had been alone for so long it took her a while to trust Rio, but once she did it felt like she’d never be alone again. </p><p>In the present, Agatha gathered all the letters and shoved them back onto the bookcase. The cottage was a museum to their relationship and some things were best relived in memory. </p><p>Agatha found a few books that would help with pain relief and sleep, but nothing that would clue her into how to really help Rio. Half of all life disappearing instantaneously was not something the witches of old would have written about.</p><p>With what she could find, she made a tea that she hoped would deaden Rio’s pain enough to maybe get her lucid enough so she could assist in her own treatments. The problem was getting her to drink it.</p><p>It was warmer in the cottage since the fire so she shed her coat, picked up a spoon from the kitchen, and brought the concoction with her to the bed. She knelt down next to the bed and dipped the spoon into the tea. “This is going to taste like grass which I’m sure you love.” </p><p>The barb made Rio smile through the pain. Her head lolled over toward Agatha and she could barely open her eyes, her hands gripping hard on her stomach. “This is the end.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked, spoon poised just away from Rio’s lips. </p><p>Rio shook her head and rolled over on the bed so she was on her side facing Agatha. She stretched her back and groaned. “I failed.” She cleared her throat. “There’s another one - co-coming.” She seemed to choke on something and blood trickled out of the corner of her mouth. </p><p>“What?” Agatha shook her head, initially rejecting the revelation. “No.” She became horrified at the prospect. Rio was always there. She was always around and Agatha always knew how to find her. “What will happen to you?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and smiled, waving her hand into the air. A shower of dark green sparkles rained from her hand as black veins crawled up her face. </p><p>Tears flooded Agatha’s eyes. “No. You can’t leave not like this.” She set the tea down and turned her head so it was much the same direction as Rio’s and rested her hand on her cheek. “How do I stop this?”</p><p>Rio put her hand on top of Agatha’s and pressed it to her cheek. “I don’t think - don’t think…” She winced. “Don’t worry about me. You’ll fi-finally be fr-free.” </p><p>The tears in Agatha’s eyes started to fall. She leaned forward, her forehead on Rio’s. She whispered, “Don’t leave me.”</p><p>Rio let out a sad smile and tilted her head up to kiss Agatha’s forehead. “You are my greatest love.” The black veins took a deeper root into her, squeezing her chest so it felt like she couldn’t breathe. “You have to go.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shook her head and pulled back to look at Rio with teary conviction. “I’ll fix this. I can save you.” She moved her hand to the back of Rio’s head and took a fistful of her hair. “Don’t let go. Fight. You have to live so <em> I </em> get to kill you.” When Rio didn’t answer she leaned closer and demanded, “Promise me.”</p><p>Rio tilted her chin back and writhed. She forced herself to open her eyes and at seeing Agatha’s determination and teary face she nodded, “I promise.”</p><p>Agatha was up like a shot at the promise. She started throwing books around, looking for the answer. She frantically read through pages that couldn’t help her and tossed them away when they wouldn’t help. </p><p>Agatha’s hands started shaking when she saw Rio’s eyes slip closed and soft motes of black start to float away from her body. “You said you’d fight,” Agatha snarled. </p><p>Another smile crossed Rio’s face. “Anything for you, my love.” Her writhing had stilled and she seemed too weak to move. </p><p>Agatha dropped the book she was holding and put her hands on her head as she paced. She couldn’t think of anything. There was a panic that was blurring out all of the knowledge in her brain. Tears continued to pour down her face and she muttered, “You have to stay. Even if I have to -” Then it dawned on her. </p><p>She ran to the dresser and pulled out the first scarf she saw. She moved to the bed and knelt next to it, taking Rio’s hand in her own. She started wrapping their joined hands in the scarf and chanting. </p><p>Rio opened her eyes and looked curiously at their joined hands. </p><p>“Don’t get any ideas,” Agatha’s reply came like an automatic retort that required no thought as she continued chanting. </p><p>Rio smiled again. “I’d never dream of it.”</p><p>As Agatha chanted, the purple light around their hands grew and grew and grew until it enveloped them. The light coalesced into a rope that wound itself around Rio’s body, starting at her legs, snaking around her torso, then coiling around her throat. </p><p>They both started to rise from where they had been, bodies floating in the middle of the cottage they’d shared so many centuries ago. Agatha held fast to Rio’s hand, not that she could let go even if she wanted to. The rope around Rio constricted and on instinct her free hand went to claw at the one around her neck. </p><p>“Let it happen,” Agatha instructed gently. She squeezed Rio’s hand in hers, trying to reassure her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes met Agatha’s and the instinctual fear of the rope around her throat faded. In Agatha’s eyes, she found a concern and an earnesty that was so rare. She let her arm relax, floating freely in the air next to them. </p><p>When she sensed the spell completing itself, Agatha let out a last, massive burst of energy. The blinding purple light exploded around them and everything faded. </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha woke up in the field where she’d first met the stumbling, pained Rio. Agatha’s kills had started to decompose in the circle they were standing in when they fell. Rio was on the ground next to her, green cloak covering most of her body. The only thing reaching out of it was her hand that was still tied to Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha scooted across the bloody grass closer to Rio. She pushed Rio’s hood back with the tips of her fingers and saw the blood was gone. The black ichor was gone. She slowly woke up as if from a deep slumber. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha busied herself with untying their clasped hands and then sat up, letting Rio push up off of the ground into a seated position on her own. Rio looked around like she wasn’t sure where she was. She furrowed her brow and then put her hand on her chest. “I’m bound.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sort of,” Agatha replied, rolling the scarf up in her hand and stuffing it into her coat pocket, both of which shouldn’t still be on her person if Rio’s hallucination had been normal. “You’re bound to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at Agatha from the ground where she was still orienting herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered her hand to Rio and Rio took it, using Agatha’s strength to stand. She still seemed disoriented, but shook out her cloak and set her shoulders. She raised her hood and closed her eyes. “They’re gone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a moment to observe Rio. “The one that comes after?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly and opened her eyes. She met Agatha’s eyes with deep question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away from Rio, adjusting the buttons on the cuff of her coat sleeves. “I finally got what I wanted. I can’t die because if I go, you do too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It unnerved Agatha how quiet Rio was. She was hoping for a sharp retort or Rio biting back at being leashed. She took a chance and looked back at Rio. She huffed as soon as she realized Rio was reaping the people that she had just killed. She muttered, “Back to work already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio was finished, she stood over the last body, shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Then she asked while Agatha was busy pretending to be interested in something in the opposite direction. “How does this work? I can feel that we can’t be apart for very long without…” she gestured to her torso, “Unraveling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Honestly and truly, Agatha hadn’t thought that far. She did what she could to keep Rio from ‘unraveling’ or being replaced in a panicked moment of experimental hope. “We’re centuries old adults.” Agatha lifted her chin and straightened her posture. “We can… figure something out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed to accept that answer. Her eyes, as always, were daggers that saw right through Agatha. She looked away almost timidly, “Thank you. For saving me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah well,” Agatha tried to play it off like she didn’t go crazy trying to save her. “You owe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bowed her head in acquiescence. She couldn’t argue with Agatha over that point. “I’ll be back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know-” Agatha started, but Rio was gone in a whirl of leaves and grass. Agatha huffed and rolled her eyes. “Well, try not to unravel.”</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha was making tea in the kitchen of a house she had </span>
<em>
<span>borrowed</span>
</em>
<span> when she sensed Rio aparate nearby. She looked casually over her shoulder and saw Rio seemed to be in a bit of pain, but no worse for wear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tea?” Agatha asked, looking back to the distribution of tea leaves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure,” Rio moved into the foyer of the house, removed her cloak and hung it on the coat rack near the front door. It was a magical coak that could disappear at will, but it was polite that she was trying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kill anyone fun today?” Agatha asked, partly so it wasn’t silent anymore and partly to be a bitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed to be intent on quiet and brooding at the table so she replied with a simple. “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to be a really fun roommate,” Agatha poured the hot water over the leaves. “I can tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. She was leaned back in one of the wooden kitchen chairs, with her booted foot up in another one, flexing her hand in the air, watching all of the plants in the kitchen get greener and fuller. A vine started to weave its way around the top of the wall just under the ceiling, infusing itself into the drywall and bordering the windows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t mess up this house,” Agatha walked with the teacups to the table and sat down across from Rio. “I just acquired it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s big,” Rio looked up at the ceiling like she could see the second floor. She weaved her hand up higher doing something Agatha couldn’t see. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, looking up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s mold upstairs,” Rio drug her hand from one side of the ceiling to the other as if wiping. “And a leak in the bathroom pipes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you fix it?” Agatha asked, picking up her teacup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned wickedly. “Is that your favor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I come to collect my favor, you’ll know it,” Agatha took a sip of her tea. “But as far as roommate stuff goes, feel free to grow some better tea than this. It’s stale.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll get some seeds when I go out,” Rio had finished sealing the leak upstairs with the minerals she extracted from the water and picked up her tea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Drinking tea together was quiet and Agatha started going over what she needed to do to gather the next group of witches to execute. “I plan to stay here for a while so I need you to wear normal clothes in case the neighbors see you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, silently sipping her tea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her own clothes that were probably a tad more renaissance faire than one would expect inside of a suburban New England house. “I should too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I need a cover story?” Rio asked, her face shifting from brooding to interested and curious. “A traveling troubadour maybe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe you don’t talk to anyone else,” Agatha let out a smile, without looking at Rio. “No one uses troubadour unpretentiously anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio’s eyebrows rose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took another sip of her tear and got lost deep in thought. When she pulled herself back to the present, she realized Rio was staring at her. When she looked back, Rio’s eyes dropped immediately to her tea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a bit unnerved by how familiar it felt and stood up. “I’m going to go through the clothes upstairs.” She swept out of the kitchen, leaving Rio and her half-drunk tea behind.</span>

<p>
<span>As far as unexpected roommates went, Rio was easy. She knew all of the things that agitated Agatha so she avoided them. She would leave treats out for her from around the world and made sure the kettle was always hot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One rainy evening, Agatha had had a fairly successful day and had gotten four witches to agree to meet her in the woods in the next week. She celebrated with a glass of wine in the kitchen, realizing, as she tended to do, just how isolated she was from every other person on the planet. She couldn’t confide in anyone. She couldn’t get someone in on her con game, lest they try to stop her or worse steal the con for themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the kitchen wall, feeling a well of loneliness that had never gone away after… </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a flutter of wind in the living room that rattled the chandelier and a few pages of the open books on the coffee table. She rose to her feet and marched into the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was taking off her cloak, smelling of salt and ocean air. She looked up from placing it gently on the back of the couch to see Agatha standing in the kitchen doorway, her hands glowing purple and fury on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squared her body with Agatha’s, but didn’t draw her knife. She stood, relaxed and patient. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take out your knife,” Agatha told her through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did as instructed, but let it hang limply by her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fight me,” Agatha hurled a blast of purple at Rio, striking her in the shoulder. It knocked her backwards into the fireplace, but didn’t knock her off of her feet. She took a step toward Agatha and stood still again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fight me!” Agatha roared. She used her magic to pick up the couch and hurl it at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, normally adept at dodging basically anything, let the couch hit her and knock her to the ground. She pushed it off of her and stood up, moving to stand in front of Agatha again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why won’t you fight me!” Agatha pointed her hands at the ground, pushing white hot purple flames up around Rio’s feet, burning away her clothing and charring her skin from the floor to the ceiling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched the face of Death reveal itself, the half skull in a permanent smile as the skin was burned away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the sight of it, Agatha let the flames die out. She watched Rio’s organs patch themselves up and her skin regrow over her muscles. She watched her face take it’s familiar form and found her eyes to be sympathetic and not angry with her which made Agatha all the more furious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why won’t you fight back!” Agatha marched up to Rio, grabbed her by the throat and pinned her against the wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know why,” Rio breathed out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you owe me,” Agatha snarled. “I could unmake you right here, right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio put both of her hands around Agatha’s wrist, but didn’t try to pull her hand away from her throat. “You’re better than lying to yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I can’t break the binding?” Agatha asked, eyes shining with tears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. She just reached forward and wiped a tear from Agatha’s cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The simple, tender action put Agatha on her heels. She took a step back, taking her hand from Rio’s neck. In the shock of it, she turned around and walked out of the living room, finding her way up the stairs, into the master bedroom and into the bathroom. She turned on the shower and stood under the water with her clothes on, closing her eyes against the spray. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hated more than anything that Rio’s presence was comforting to her. She resented it. She hated that she couldn’t just let her go and deal with whatever Death came after. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was dredging up things in her that she thought were long dead and buried. The polar opposite emotions she felt when looking at Rio were so confounding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she got out of the shower, she hung her soaked clothes up to dry and put on some pajamas of the previous owner. It was a matching pajama pants and shirt, but it was silk so she could let the faux pas slide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crawled into the bed and picked up the book she had left on the nightstand. She didn’t want to see Rio again for the rest of the night so she read until she fell asleep, half her mind on the witch downstairs.</span>

<span>Rio had taken to dressing like a normal person fairly well. Her affinity for long flowing coats and scarves could be construed as peculiar, but as she followed Agatha around the grocery store, no one paid her a second look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I read online that most roommate arrangements come with some kind of shared meal preparation schedule,” Agatha started explaining. She had avoided looking at Rio for the most part and leading the way with the shopping cart was a great excuse for it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have to eat,” Rio reminded her out of earshot of any other patrons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I do and I’m tired of cooking,” Agatha picked up a mesh bag of tomatoes and put them in the cart that Rio promptly took out of the cart and replaced with a different one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, “Does this mean you miss my cooking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the only thing I miss,” Agatha snapped and pushed the cart away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood in place, amused for a moment before following Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On the way back to the house, they passed a construction wall that had been covered in missing persons fliers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced around the wall, seeing people who meant nothing to her. Then she spotted a child. A toothy grinned school picture in front of a fake backdrop of trees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to them?” Agatha asked, a rare moment of earnesty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s looked over at the wall of faces. She shook her head. “I don’t know. They’re not dead, but…” She turned away from the wall, keeping stride with Agatha. She sighed. “I don’t know.”</span>

<span>A few planning days later, Agatha was in the upstairs bath, leaned back with her eyes closed. The water was almost too warm, but the lavender scent was strong and calming. She felt Rio reappear nearby. When she reached out through their invisible tether, she felt her just outside of the bathroom door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes and looked toward the door. She could just make out Rio’s legs outstretched from the gap between the floor and the door. She was sitting on the floor outside of the bathroom, though Agatha couldn’t make out what she was doing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’re going to sit out there, make yourself useful,” Agatha called, trying to be callous, but finding a comfort in Rio’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Three small water lilies bloomed in the bath around Agatha, each a pristine white that let out a pleasant floral scent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside of the bathroom, Rio was exhausted, having spent too long away from Agatha. She was still getting used to having a time limit for reaping. She leaned back on the wall next to the bathroom door with her legs stretched out from under her, only wearing a large t-shirt she’d found in a dresser in the second bedroom. She had a book in her lap that she had planned to read while she waited to feel better, but instead of reading it to herself, she started reading aloud.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha listened to Rio read from a book of poems, letting her calm, even voice relax her even more through the wooden bathroom door. There was a pause in the flow of the poems and Rio started a new one. </span>
</p><p>It took Agatha a few lines to listen in, but when she heard Rio's voice quiver she felt the verses hit straight into her chest.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>"I love you only because it's you the one I love;</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I hate you deeply, and hating you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is that I do not see you but love you blindly."</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was getting choked up reading, and had to clear her throat to continue. She mumbled the next few lines, then cleared her throat again. <br/></span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>"In this part of the story I am the one who</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood. "</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio choked out the end of the poem, the only sound in the house were the tears that were tracking down Agatha’s face falling into the bathwater. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a long pause, there was a rush of wind from under the door and Rio was gone. Agatha’s eyes lowered to the lilies in the water as they wilted from the heat without her protection. Agatha picked one up and brought it to her nose, inhaling the scent as deeply as she could. </span>

<p>
<span>When Agatha awoke the next morning, the house smelled of cinnamon and warm bread. She pulled the duvet cover tight over her shoulder. It may smell incredible, but she was also still tired.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out through their connection, feeling along it like a safety rope in a dark cave with her mind. Her intention was to let Rio know that she’d be down in a few minutes after pushing herself out of sleep, but it was a half-awake gesture that was sloppy and groping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the connection she heard faint screaming. It sounded like Rio was screaming. “No! Get back!” Then more screaming, like she was being torn apart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was out of bed, flying down the stairs, following the tether between them. She dropped to her feet in the doorway of the kitchen, skidding to a stop, hands up, swirling in purple, ready to blast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What she found was Rio, turning around confused, holding a cinnamon bun on a plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around for any hidden danger. She swallowed and tried to find an illusion or an enemy. “I…You’re okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me,” Rio set the cinnamon bun down on the counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was disheveled and wearing green plaid pajama pants with an oversized t-shirt. She let the purple fade and looked around one last time. “You were screaming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t,” Rio answered. She shifted her jaw and gestured to the stove. “Tea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached through the tether again and she was starting to hear it again when Rio, the one in front of her, snapped. “Stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately released the tether. She narrowed her eyes at Rio. “What is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is my burden,” Rio answered gravely. She moved to the kettle and turned on the fire beneath it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked to the table and put her hands on the back of a chair. She was losing patience. “What is your burden?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t matter,” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped her hand out, a thread of purple grabbing Rio’s wrist and turning her around. “What is it?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ghosts!” Rio lost her cool and squared with Agatha, though not aggressively. Her stature was definitely defensive. Her right foot slid back like if she anticipated getting hit and wanted to stay on her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brow, “Ghosts?” She studied Rio’s hard expression, “Of… everyone?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rio shook her head. “Just a few that need to be watched.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you fighting them?” Agatha asked, softening. She pulled out her chair and sat down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Sometimes.” She took a deep breath. “When they get… rowdy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drummed her fingers on the table and waited for Rio to turn to her, setting a fork next to her anxious fingers before asking, “Is it dangerous?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To anyone but me,” Rio moved back toward the kettle to prepare the teacups.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up the fork and looked at the cinnamon bun. “It hurts you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised her eyebrows in acquiescence. “It can.”</span>

<span>In her limited capacity, Rio had taken on a few more mortal tendencies like eating and sleeping. Agatha would catch her eating a sandwich in the kitchen in the middle of the night and dozing off on the couch in the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It seemed that Rio was avoiding her while having to stay nearby so she’d huddle up in the guest room or stay in the kitchen when Agatha was in bed. She’d trail far behind when Agatha was out of the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night before Agatha was to meet the witches in the woods, she knocked on the open guest room door where Rio was napping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slowly opened her eyes and picked up her head a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned on the doorframe, pressing her shoulder into it and drummed her fingers on it. “I uh, wanted to see if you were coming tomorrow. Fresh bodies and all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned on her side and propped her head up. “Yeah. I’ll be there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha nodded, “I’ll wait for you then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sensed that Agatha was lingering and she was learning how to be tired so she fell back into old habits. She lifted the blanket next to her, sending a silent invitation she hadn’t attempted in centuries.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated in the doorway, but it was so appealing and no one had touched her in so long. She moved into the room and sat down on the side of the bed away from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to lay down, her back to Rio who let the blanket drop over her, letting her arm settle with it. Her arm found its natural place around Agatha’s waist as her body pressed to Agatha’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the dark, Agatha closed her eyes feeling a rush of touch, not just any touch, but the touch of someone who would protect her and love her. The chaste touch of someone who knew her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the dark, Agatha whispered, “I still hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio answered, her breath caressing the back of Agatha’s neck as she drifted off to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lay there in that bed, staring at the wall for several minutes. Then she rested her arm on top of Rio’s securing her arm in place. She closed her eyes and let herself fall asleep in the arms of the person she loved and hated the most on the planet.</span>

<p>
<span>“That was tidy,” Agatha looked down at the bodies in front of her. She felt stronger. She felt the magick moving through her body, like a rippling, coiling snake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would normally celebrate, but she was arrested by watching Rio, kneel down next to each body in turn and silently tilt her head. Then she’d reach out a hand, grasp something Agatha couldn’t see, and pull it away. Once she’d gotten each one, she swirled her hands together and pushed up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio also seemed a bit stronger. The weariness in her face faded a bit and she stood up straighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This seems mutually beneficial,” Agatha commented, turning away from the bodies on the ground to start the walk back to the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always has been,” Rio’s voice was like a whisper in her ear and she was gone again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha enjoyed her short walk through the woods and her short drive back to their house. She sat at the kitchen table, going over her next move. She needed to figure out where she was going next. She had a laptop open, a map, and a small dish of water with a needle in it. She was using a ruler to draw lines on the map, referencing the laptop and the bowl of water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“High tech,” Rio commented, making her way to the refrigerator. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adapt or die,” Agatha answered automatically, but then realized who she was talking to. She waved her hand in the air. “You know what I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened the refrigerator and reached for a cardboard carton of blueberries. Her fingers had just hit the fuzzy side of it when she froze. She straightened up, let the refrigerator close, and drew her knife. “Get away from the windows. Don’t look outside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew when Rio used that tone of voice, she shouldn’t argue. She quickly stood up, backed away from the kitchen and moved to the side so she was hidden from the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned against the wall and had expected a blast of window glass coming inward. Instead there was a soft hissing noise. She heard her own name being whispered on the air as it became putrid and sour. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, who Agatha had never really heard have to recite an incantation, started quietly chanting. As her chant went on, the house started to rumble and quake. Agatha held onto the wall as the chandelier swayed above her and the half-broken couch rattled across the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chanced a peek around the corner and saw arms and faces in various states of decay, smashing soundlessly on the windows like they were trapped in an aquarium. The chanting seemed to be pushing them away, making space between the house and whatever they were. Revenants if she had to guess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And all it took was one eyelidless eyeball to roll her way and Agatha was spotted. There was a horrible screeching and the revenants broke through whatever Rio was doing and charged toward Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you not to look!” Rio yelled over the screeches. She gave up on the barrier wall and threw up a wall of writhing twisting vines through the wall of the house, and ran back toward the living room. “We have to go!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took one step past Agatha that vaulted her into the air and she grabbed Agatha’s hand as she went. Agatha’s only reaction was to blast a hole in the roof as they soared toward it. Once they were above the house, Rio let go and Agatha was in charge of flying herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The revenants sprang after them like rockets shooting into the sky, a streak of gray-black smoke following them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned in the air, flying backwards, throwing blasts at the revenants as they went. Her green-black magick didn’t seem to do much to them so Agatha gave it a shot. Her purple slowed them down enough that Rio could start another chant. This one was different and with each word a revenant disappeared into a puff of smoke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha joined her chant and they started disappearing faster. When the last of them poofed away, Agatha pointed to a park most likely in the next town so they could set down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as her feet touched the ground, Agatha asked, “What the hell was that?” gesturing to the sky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m still figuring it out,” Rio was immediately closed off and turned away from Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha grabbed Rio’s arm and spun her around. “You start telling me what the hell is going on. Especially if it’s going to demolish my house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s tongue ran across her bottom teeth on the right side and she seemed to be gathering the words. “I was gone.” She waved her hands in the air, tilting her head back so her hair fell away from her face, and then spinning around to face away from Agatha, starting a short pace away. She turned back around. “Unraveled for maybe a second.” She steepled her fingers as she walked. “Long enough to create an opening for someone else.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Another Green Witch?” Agatha asked, starting to piece things together. She put a booted foot on the seat of a picnic table and hoisted herself into sitting on the top of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. “Sort of.” She moved her hands between them, revealing the tether connecting them, a single purple cord from Agatha that wrapped around Rio’s entire body in elegant lines and knots. “I took back most of it when I,” she gestured again to the tether and then let it dissipate. “But they still have some power and they released some… revenants to hunt me down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We get rid of the… </span>
<em>
<span>Other Green Witch</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha offered. “The revenants…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will be loose, but easier to reclaim,” Rio answered. She put her hands on her hips and looked at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you don’t know who the Other is because?” Agatha asked, resting her elbows on the tops of her knees and her chin on top of two closed fists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio furrowed her brow, “Why would I?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you can… die?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head from side to side. “Not really, but in a way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love your straight answers,” Agatha pushed off of the picnic table and stood up. “So, we find a way to hide you, find a way to figure out who is next in line to be the grim reaper, and find some idiot to stand between us and the revenants while we get the Other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio looked to the side like she was trying to find an issue with the plan. Or an alternative plan. The problem was that as someone whose job was pretty straight forward, she didn’t have to think herself out of situations very often. “Oookay.” Then she came back around to the beginning of the plan - the part where Agatha was helping her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t become Death,” Rio looked at Agatha. “There is no succession.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate your job,” Agatha rolled her eyes and shook her head. “I don’t want it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted her jaw trying to find Agatha’s angle. Rio was smart, but Agatha was crafty in a way Rio had never had to be. She could weave favors and deals and plans into something that seemed so benign. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t bring him-” Rio started. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved like a wraith into Rio’s space, lowering her voice to a dangerous level. “If his name comes out of your mouth, I will release this tether right here, right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed and took a step back. A fury that Agatha had never seen directed at her overtook her face, but Agatha refused to back down. They stared at each other, both trying to bore into the other’s brain with daggers from their eyes until Rio huffed, turned around, and disappeared in a breeze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coward!” Agatha yelled after her. </span>

<span>Agatha walked through the park and used a bit of illusion magick to scare a teen walking to their car into dropping their keys and running back into the wooded part of the park. He tripped once, scrambling to get back up, and keep running from the massive, illusory dog Agatha sent after him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked up his keys and got into his car, wrinkling her nose at the strong patchouli smell in the car. She rolled down the windows and created a soft breeze to move it out. Then she turned on the car, was assaulted with some kind man and guitar music that she turned down almost all the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure where she was going, but she stopped at a gas station to get some road trip snacks. She flicked her wrist at the cashier and covered them in a cloud of smoke that moved with them while she gathered what she wanted, grabbed her own bag from behind the counter, and walked back out to the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached the car, she saw Rio in the passenger’s seat, one booted foot on the dashboard. She decided that she wanted to be mad that she was in the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Done throwing a fit?” Agatha snarked, opening the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. She held a folded piece of lined yellow paper out for Agatha between her first two fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took it and opened it. It was an address. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get rid of the body and the house is yours,” Rio answered, turning her head to look out the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was pretty sure she knew where the street was and stuffed the paper in the cupholder. “You couldn’t get rid of the body?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio replied offhanded, “Not my job.”</span>

<span>The new house was a large Victorian in a neighborhood where the houses were a decent distance apart and they wouldn’t be easily observed. Massive trees surrounded the house, creating a barrier between the house and the outside world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The inside was lavishly furnished and Agatha was impressed upon entering. She would never let Rio know that though. “It’ll do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved to the couch and flopped down on it, sinking in the soft, green fabric. “You better hurry. The body is decomposing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a half growl of annoyance before starting her search of the house for a decomposing body. She found it in the bathtub with a plugged in tube tv that appeared to have been resting on the edge of the tub and had fallen in. There was a smoke and burnt hair smell in the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The decomposition process had already started, but the water had cooled in the bathtub to slow it. Agatha flexed her hands toward the body and started lifting it out of the water with her purple. She slowly moved with it to the window, having to carefully keep the water from dripping on her feet. She had to hold the body with one hand and open the window with the other. Then she unceremoniously shot the body out the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She left the window open to let the foul air out and used her magick to pull the bathtub drain. Once the water started draining out of the tub, Agatha breezed out of the room and started surveying the house in earnest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She decided that the master bedroom would be hers. There was a massive four-poster bed in the middle of the room and a reading nook of bay windows. Most importantly no one had died in the connected bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was opening wardrobes and snooping around when she heard a soft knock on the doorframe. She turned around and found Rio leaned on the frame, hair messy from what seemed to have been a nap. “I’m going to get food. Do you want anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah,” Agatha was knocked back on her heels at the offer. They had been snippy with each other earlier and if she was honest, Agatha was still holding onto some of it. But Rio, leaning on that door frame, her hair sort of tossed around and her clothes ill-fitting and rumpled, there was something spectacular about her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook herself out of her trance with a swallow and waved flippantly. “Whatever you’re having.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio put her hands in her pockets and nodded. She started to turn away, but turned back. “Do you remember when we were on that boat in Pacaya Samiria and you translated those carvings in those old rocks at the mason’s place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brow in thought and then snapped her fingers. “The serum? It’s was a- It made spirits corporeal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “You think it would work on revenants?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only one way to find out,” Agatha smiled. She pushed some framed photos off of the nightstand and picked up a notepad that had been under them. “We need a potions guy.” She wrote down her short list. “Three more witches. Protection, divination, and potions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think any of them work at the burger place I’m going to?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her list and then ripped the page off. “I’m coming with you. We have a stop to make.”</span>

<span>“Why are we waiting?” Rio asked before taking a sip from the straw of her drink. She eyed the building across from them. Several faded and broken neon signs announced ‘Madame Calderu’s Psychic Readings’. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just watched a whole bridesmaid party go in there,” Agatha took a fry from the bag and popped it into her mouth. “I don’t have the temperament for them today, or any day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, watching Agatha’s root around in the bottom of the burger bag for stray fries. It was a painfully normal moment sitting in a dead man’s 1975 Mercedes across the street from the psychic’s shop. Before Agatha could catch her enjoying the moment, Rio turned back to her own food, content to keep the moment for herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was so easy to fall back into old habits. When Agatha was trying to rearrange herself in the driver’s seat, Rio just held her hand out so Agatha could put her drink in it and have more space. Agatha tossed her pickles into Rio’s burger wrapper without asking and didn’t speak on it. They accidentally switched drinks a few times and no one fussed. It was so easy to move around in each other’s space even though the tension would eviscerate a lesser being.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The door burst open in the psychic shop and a young woman ran out, tears and mascara streaming down her face. Two more young people ran after her, followed by one who was walking and laughing so hard she was in tears as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they had cleared the block, Agatha got out of the car and walked across the street. She waited for Rio to saunter up behind her and warned, as she opened the door. “Don’t be weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In defiance of the order, Rio hissed at Agatha as she walked past, into the shop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It smelled as one would expect a psychic shop to smell. Incense was still burning near the back of the shop and Rio peeled off to the right, inspecting the retail section while Agatha approached the table with the crystal ball on it. From the back of the building a woman with long, curly salt and pepper hair breezed in. “Welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had a congenial smile on her face until she saw Agatha standing here. “What do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need something divined,” Agatha put her hands on the table where it seemed like readings were done. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone knows what your past and future is Ms. Harkness,” Lilia Calderu crossed her arms. “Witch murder.” She tilted her head and seemed to realize that someone else was in her shop. She looked over at Rio, who wasn’t looking at her and narrowed her eyes. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is the problem,” Agatha answered. She materialized the tether between them and yanked on her end so Rio was pulled backward toward them. She stumbled for a moment, but caught her footing. Her face morphed from serene shopper to furious indignation in an instant. She immediately drew her dagger and leapt at Agatha in a righteous fury. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop!” Lilia yelled, hands up. “Not in my shop!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio twisted in mid-air, several feet away and above Agatha, becoming a breeze speckled with dead leaves that shot through Agatha’s space. Agatha threw up an arm over her face and the leaves stuck in the thick sleeves of her coat, poking her arms through it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio coalesced next to her, she slipped her dagger back into the sheath. Before Agatha could react, Rio pulled a wad of money out of her pocket and dropped it on the reading table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s eyes got wide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was irritated as she shook leaves off of her coat, but seemed to calm at the sight of the money. She adjusted her stance to be less hostile and more presentable. “So? How about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the moment, Lilia ignored Agatha and looked to Rio. “Your aura is different.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “It’s split.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what it is,” Lilia snapped. She moved to Rio and started looking around her head and shoulders. “Fractured is more like it.” She lifted Rio’s arm and examined her palm. Then she dropped it, blinking hard. “Shouldn’t have done that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at her own hand, not sure what was weird or different about it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a power surge in the building and Lilia’s eyes got wide. Her attention shot to Rio. “You have to win.” She stood up and put her hands on Rio’s face. “There are divergent futures. You have to win to keep us on the right path.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha over Lilia’s shoulder. She wasn’t sure how to take the information. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are the chances you know the protection witch and potions witch that will give us the best chance?” Agatha asked, moving to Lilia to put her hands on Lilia’s shoulders and guide her away from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll need some time,” Lilia turned and walked around the table to sit in front of her crystal ball. She didn’t reference it or touch it. She pulled her phone out of her cardigan pocket and started poking at it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ookay,” Agatha pulled her coat tight around herself. “How long? It sounded like we don’t have a lot of time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some things can’t be rushed,” Lilia waved her off. Then she froze in place, dismissing arm in the air. The lights around them started to flicker and the building rumbled. She cocked her head. “Chicken Coop.” Then she frowned. “Kale.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen Kale?” Agatha groaned and rolled her head back. “Can we reroll that second one? There’s gotta be a better potion maker.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what I got,” Lilia shrugged. She looked at her phone and turned it toward them. “Chicken Coop is a bar at the edge of town. Underground magick fighting. You’ll find your protection witch there.”</span>

<p>
<span>The Chicken Coop had more motorcycles outside than Agatha anticipated. She grabbed Rio’s arm and pulled her around the side of the bar. “We have to change clothes.” She pulled her purple from her palm and sprinkled some around herself and around Rio, changing their conspicuous clothes into jeans and button down shirts. Rio was wearing a green and blue flannel and Agatha had a slightly dressier purple button down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was unbuttoning the cuffs around her wrists and rolling up her sleeves. “Did you know about the divergent futures?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “I can’t see into the future.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha accepted what Rio said at face value. “Alright,” Agatha stepped around Rio. “I haven’t lost yet and I don’t plan to start now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, the bar had wood paneled walls, a stage with a wall of chicken wire in front of it, and a significant number of Westview’s working class. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” Agatha wrinkled her nose. “I hate it here.” She folded her arms in front of herself and gestured for Rio to peel off. “Start a fight. That should bring her out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t really surprised that Rio didn’t instantly start a fight on the other side of the bar. They were both weaving through the crowd, Agatha pretending to be genial and Rio slipping from one grouping of shadows to the next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had an eye out, scanning each person she passed, but she wasn’t sure what a protection witch would look like. If she’d have weapons or a distinctive look like a leather jacket with spikes or a mohawk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been far too long inside of the junky place and she hoped that as someone more conspicuous than her, Rio would have drawn her attention already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, when she looked across the bar, she didn’t find Rio diligently searching for the witch. At the bar, Rio had been cornered by a woman a bit taller than her with a charming smile and a casual hand in her pocket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched her brush Rio’s hair away from her face and lean in to speak into Rio’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed to genuinely smile and lean back casually on the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could not get over the audacity of someone flirting so blatantly with Rio </span>
<em>
<span>in front of her</span>
</em>
<span>. Who was this person? Some common witch. Some common witch that would be powerless and dead soon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed people out of the way, drawing the attention of everyone, including Rio and the woman as she approached. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha asked, pushing past the woman to speak directly to Rio, annoyance making her jaw tight when she asked, “Find the protection witch?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a moment of assessment before Rio broke out in a knowing smile. She tilted her head with an innocent blink, “Who?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh a protection witch?” the woman with the audacity asked, taking a step to the side so she could be part of the conversation, “Alice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did another reorganization of her emotions, pushing the jealousy and possessiveness into the deep dark part of her psyche she pretended wasn’t there. She leaned casually on the bar. “You know her?” Agatha asked, her hand slipping behind Rio, across the wooden bar to grab the bright green handle of a cocktail knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand clasped around her wrist and the bartender said, “Drop it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Drop what?” Agatha asked, feigning innocence. When Rio stepped to the side and everyone could see what she was holding, she smiled sheepishly, “Oh I thought that was my drink.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You haven’t gotten a drink yet,” the bartender put her hands on her hips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I assume you’re out of bordeaux,” Agatha sneered, crossing her arms and resting the back of her hand against the bottom of her chin. She turned back to the woman who had been about to get stabbed, “So, Alice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think she’s about to go on,” the woman gestured behind her toward a large pit in the middle of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With an appalling lack of fanfare, the crowds started to move to the pit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had no interest in the fight. If Alice was a pit fighter then that was all she needed to know. She needed someone who was going to throw their body in front of her without being scared of the pain and if she did this kind of thing for fun, she definitely wasn’t scared of the pain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She picked up a pen from a jar behind the bar and a napkin. Then she scribbled down her new address. She passed it to the bartender. “Tell Alice to come to this address. I have a very lucrative job for her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not my jo-” the bartender started, but Agatha was already walking away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to force herself not to look back to see if Rio was following her. She was stacking reason upon reason to be mad on top of each other, hoping they would add up to something she could stand on. But so far it was shaky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was relieved when she pushed open the door to the outside world and turned to go to the car, when she glanced out of her peripheral vision, she saw Rio walking out the door as well. </span>

<p>
<span>The drive was silent and Rio seemed in deep thought, while Agatha was deeply thinking about what Rio could be thinking about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled into the driveway, they found Lilia sitting on the front porch steps, a large canvas garment bag over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh hey,” Agatha tried to play off her confusion and mild alert. “What are you doing here, Lucy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia,” Lilia corrected her. “This address was on a piece of mail in the money you gave me.” She glanced at Rio and then back at Agatha. “We need to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made some tea as the reluctant hostess while Rio and Lilia sat at the table. Lilia kept looking at Rio and then quickly looking away like she was trying to catch a glimpse of the sun without going blind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t imagine that you showing up on our doorstep is good news,” Agatha brought two cups of tea to the table and sat down, setting one in front of Lilia and pointedly not making one for Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t get a lot of answers for questions that I ask, but I get a lot of answers for things I didn’t,” she replied, putting her hands around the teacup. She seemed to remember something and unzipped one of the pockets of the garment bag and pulled out a notebook. It was an old leather bound notebook with soft sides and pages that weren’t all the same width. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened it to the page marked with a red ribbon and turned it toward them. “I saw this a few hours ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sketch was bordered on the bottom by a sketched silhouette of a town. Above it, pencil shaded clouds parted and a heavily colored-in rift appeared in between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this?” Agatha asked, “What am I looking at?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It opens,” Lilia pointed to the dark lightning bolt shaded in in the sky. “The door you guard. It opens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked to Rio’s reaction for how she should react. She wasn’t sure what to do with the information herself. She knew there were parts of what Rio did that she had never explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was stone still, staring at Lilia’s finger pointing at the chasm. She had stopped breathing and stopped blinking. Her eyes glazed over as she was lost in thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked and then abruptly stood up. The action startled Agatha, who instinctively pushed her chair back, away from the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need the potions witch,” Rio started toward the door without looking back. “Now.”</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>“Do you know the end?” Agatha asked, after they’d all been closed into the elevator that was shooting upwards. It wasn’t directed at Rio who hadn’t said a word and was staring at the elevator doors like they were keeping her caged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know the order of what I see,” Lilia told her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What she saw was a thousand years ago and it almost ended everything,” Rio finally spoke up just before the doors opened. She stepped out, leaving the two witches behind her aghast until the doors started to close again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stuck her arm out and stopped the doors so she and Lilia could scramble out after her across the polished marble floors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. Kale isn’t having visitors today,” a security guard at a massive set of double doors was telling Rio as she approached. With a wave of her hand, Rio sent the security guard flying across the room and with a wave of her other hand, the doors in front of them blasted off their hinges. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not one for knocking huh?” Lilia asked Agatha as they followed, stepping over the splintered shards of the wooden door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is her knocking,” Agatha answered, her voice laced with an unspoken warning to stay out of her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they caught up with Rio, she was standing in a very plush and pastel living room in front of a woman in a bathrobe with under eye patches on, holding a coffee cup. One wall of the living room was a very organized wall of clear apothecary shelves, all lit from beneath, neatly displaying their contents. The perpendicular wall was all windows overlooking the downtown area. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should have known,” Jen Kale leaned to the side to see around Rio, as she peeled off her under eye patches. “Is this your demon pet, Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her hands up. “I’m just the entourage.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah right,” Jen turned back to Rio. “What the hell do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A serum to turn ghosts corporeal,” Rio answered. “First seen in Pacaya Samiria. Pre-Columbian.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed and started to turn away, “Come back with a real request.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slinked up next to Rio and leaned close to her. “Told you she couldn’t do it,” Agatha said, sotto voce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen paused her retreat back into her high rise apartment. “Unless you have the ingredient list on you, no one can do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia moved to stand on the other side of Rio. “It is a matter of some importance.” She cleared her throat. “There is a struggle over the dominion of death. There is a fork in the road ahead and… one of them is… empty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shifted her jaw. “And you are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia Calderu,” Lilia introduced herself with a reverent nod. “First generation Divination.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen hummed. “I recognize that name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a store downtown,” Lilia offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen shook her head. “Leggings?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Lilia nodded, “That too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you owe me a new pair because the fleece ones I bought two months ago already came apart at the seams,” Jen put a hand on her hip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia threw her hands up and turned her head away. “Sorry, no refunds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was generally annoyed with anyone being more annoying than her so when she rolled her eyes away from the conversation, she saw Rio tense next to her. Her instinct was to reach over and grab her arm, unsure of what was going to happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched Rio’s eyes search all of the floor to ceiling windows, methodically and frantically. Then she found what she was looking for and Agatha’s eyes followed it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was another cloud of revenants moving in their direction. A bulk of black and gray smoke with faces and hands reaching out the front of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s why we need the serum,” Agatha kept hold of Rio’s upper arm and pointed at the quickly darkening sky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Lilia both turned at the same time to follow Agatha’s direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell is that?” Jen demanded, gesturing to the quickly approaching anomaly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Revenants,” Lilia breathed out. “A lot of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get back,” Rio moved her arm in front of Agatha, a hand on her waist, pushing her behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a stupid and chivalrous thing for Rio to do. Agatha had helped last time the revenants followed them after all. But it was instinct, just like when Agatha’s hand went to Rio’s waist from behind and squeezed just above her hip. “We have to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just loud enough for Lilia and Jen to hear it. Lilia was willing to believe her immediately and was the first one to turn from the coming onslaught to move to the interior of the building. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled Rio backwards a few steps before turning around to follow Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It took a moment of realization on Jen’s part, but she grabbed a large, soft sided leather bag from under her couch and started following them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were all in the hallway when the glass of the apartment shattered like wet tissue paper, blowing cold air and shrapnel in through the broken door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited for Jen in the doorway of the open elevator Lilia and Agatha were already in. Jen careened into the elevator right into Lilia and Rio stepped into the elevator. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen waved her hand at the doors that glowed with nearly imperceptible pink runes and closed just as the first featureless face smashed into it. The elevator started shooting downward and Lilia grabbed onto the closest person to her. Rio allowed her to hang onto her arm, even putting her hand on top of Lilia’s as the elevator shot downward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you do?” Agatha demanded of Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia closed her eyes, “I don’t want to die in an elevator.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not very many people die in elevators from falling,” Rio commented offhandedly, like stating a fact would keep them from dying or make Lilia less frightened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s an emergency exit,” Jen answered. Nearly all at once a burst of air pushed at the bottom of the elevator and it slowed to a gentle stop. The doors slid open like a reverse guillotine. Jen sighed deeply. “I’m glad it worked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve never </span>
<em>
<span>used</span>
</em>
<span> it before?” Agatha gawked, following as Jen strode out of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not all of us are constantly getting chased out of every place we’ve ever lived by an angry mob,” Jen answered, moving through the parking garage that opened up before them. “I’m out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed Jen to a large SUV with dark tinted windows. The flights flickered on as Jen started the SUV from the key fob in her hand. Agatha ran around Jen and put her hands up, “Wait, wait, wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen stopped and looked pissed, but most importantly, she stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you ever seen that before?” Agatha pointed upwards. From the look on her face, she knew Jen hadn’t. “I know you haven’t. That is going to get much, much worse if we can’t fight them and we can’t fight them unless we can hurt them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you can’t hurt them without the serum,” Jen sighed. She adjusted her bathrobe. “Shit.” She sighed, “Okay. But when this is over you’re fixing the windows in my apartment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Agatha agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And as soon as I make it, I’m gone,” Jen sidestepped Agatha and opened the driver’s door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even better,” Agatha put her palms up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked up when Lilia got into the passenger’s seat. She looked at her incredulously, “What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Safety in numbers,” Lilia smiled and put her seatbelt on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have a safehouse,” Agatha opened the back driver’s side. “And a protection witch.” She looked across the backseat when Rio opened the door, but paused before getting in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, holding her eyes and seeming apologetic. She closed the backseat door and moved to the passenger’s side. She knocked on the window so Lilia would roll it down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can banish them one at a time if they get too close,” Rio told her. “Agatha can help.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” Lilia asked without judgment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed, “I’ll meet you at the house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, wait!” Agatha started trying to crawl over the seat so she could see Rio and tell her it was stupid to leave alone and stupid to leave them, but she got stuck in her seatbelt and by the time she unbuckled it, Rio was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s her deal?” Jen asked, pulling out of the parking spot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flopped back in her seat and glared out the window. “She’s a workaholic.”</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>They had managed to shake the revenants either by driving away or by Rio not being anywhere near them anymore. When they pulled into the driveway, Jen parked the car and looked at the house. “It’s cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After she got out of the car, Agatha noticed a red, sport motorcycle in the driveway close to the house, parked close to the wall. She checked the windows looking out toward them and then the sky around them for the cloud of revenants. There didn’t seem to be any threats, but the motorcycle was new and the reason she pretended to be polite and let Jen and Lilia go into the house before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is your door unlocked?” Jen asked, pushing through the tall, solid door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the first time she realized that she and Rio hadn’t been locking the door as they went in and out, and that maybe they didn’t even have the key to. She shrugged and kind of made a sputtering noise as she walked past them so she didn’t have to answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped dead when she saw an unfamiliar woman sitting at the kitchen table, reading over their research. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this like an end of days thing?” she asked, looking up from the books that had been open in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her hands in her coat pockets and straightened up. “Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman nodded, kicking a booted foot off of the chair next to her and stood up. “Alice Wu Gulliver.” She offered her hand to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook it politely then gestured behind her. “This is the rest of the team.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what does ‘end of days’ mean?” Jen asked, then stepped over toward the books on the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re at a crossroads,” Lilia answered and moved to where she had been sitting. She picked up her sketch and started explaining what was going on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t need to be present for the rehashing of everything. She slipped out of the kitchen and made her way into the living room. She was about to take off her coat and sit when she felt the other end of her tether coalesce upstairs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up at the ceiling like she could see her and heard the bathroom faucet turn on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Curiosity got the better of her and she followed the sound up the stairs. She moved to the bedroom at the far end of the house and stepped in. Rio had decorated her room by growing plants into the walls again, vines crawling up one wall and flowers poking through the wallpaper of another. There were tiny animal bones stabbed into the headboard in intricate, swirling patterns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The running water shut off as she approached the open bathroom door and she heard the water in the bathtub move around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kept a respectful distance from the doorway, choosing to lean back against the wall on one side of it. After a beat, she heard the water stop moving. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re such a creep,” Rio eventually said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled because there was no disgust in her voice and there was even a hint of a smile. The purple tether on her hand appeared and she felt a gentle tug on it. She allowed the tug to pull her into the bathroom where she found Rio up to her chin in water that had floating islands of moss through it. The water itself was murky and smelled floral. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’d it go?” Agatha put her hands in the pockets of her slacks and leaned on the doorframe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio half-heartedly shrugged in the water, sending ripples through it, making the patches of moss dance as they hovered over her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an oddly tender moment between the two of them. Rio was naked and vulnerable in the bathtub and Agatha was just standing there, letting the humidity of the steam coming off the water wash over her. It felt so comfortable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she met Rio’s eyes she saw that she’d been watching her from the water, raised her eyebrows curious and open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to find something to say that wasn’t sappy or sentimental. She pushed off of the wall, broke eye contact, and cleared her throat. “Alice is here, the, uh, protection witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just hummed in reply. She held Agatha’s eyes for a moment and then dredged her hand out of the water. She lifted her closed fist to Agatha, turned it over, and unfurled her fingers. A small spray of purple flowers, each very small and bunched together unfurled as well, dewy and vibrant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes at the party trick, but stepped into the bathroom to pluck it out of Rio’s hand. She brought it up to her nose to smell it and found it sweet and earthy. She took a step back to the safety of the doorway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gazed at the flower and twirled it between her fingers. After a deep sigh, she muttered, “I hate you,” as if automatic with no emotion behind it and stepped out of the bathroom to make her way back downstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the bathroom, Rio slowly sank below the water as tiny mushrooms sprouted on the moss undulating in the water.</span>

<p>
<span>When she got downstairs, Agatha was immediately sought out by Jen. “I’m going to need so much more material than this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll get it,” Agatha seemed annoyed to be demanded of so quickly after having a pleasant moment upstairs, but not annoyed enough to be snippy back. She twirled the flower Rio had given her between her fingers. “Get me a list.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen seemed surprised by how easy it was to get Agatha to agree. “Fine. Give me half an hour. I’ll leave you alone with your devotion flower.” She turned to go back into the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My what?” Agatha furrowed her brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Devotion flower,” Jen paused to gesture to it. “Heliotropium arborescens. Means eternal devotion. Did they teach you nothing before you killed your coven?” When Agatha didn’t seem to know how to react. “Just in case they didn't, it's also highly toxic so don’t eat it.” She started to walk away and then turned back. “And invasive so don’t throw it outside.” Then she continued away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at the all too appropriate flower for a beat more before deciding to keep it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offered to go down to the store at the end of the street to get some essentials since they were all traveling pretty light and she needed to stretch her legs. When she returned with a bag full of toiletries and sandwiches, she heard laughing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The laughter died down for a beat as she slipped in the front door and then Agatha heard Rio say, “Anyway, he was really annoying so I gave him bad directions to Cairo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laughter burst out again as Agatha walked into the kitchen. She found the other four witches sitting around the table, books, papers, and laptops open all around it like they were cramming for a test. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been so long since Agatha had been among a group of people who were smiling and laughing and not desperate for her help or terrified of her. A group of women who chose to live with her and work for a common goal. A coven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone looked up like they were waiting for Agatha’s reaction to the group laughing together, like some kind schoolmarm about to reprimand them. She was in a good mood though so she started pulling out the sandwiches and handing them out. “Be careful. The last time Rio made this many women laugh in the same place, we had to fight our way out of a Romanian ossuary with broken wine bottles and a hand crossbow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Jen let out a surprised smile. “You </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know how to have fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lunch descended into reminiscing and storytelling. They lost a few hours to it, but when they all decided to get back to work, it was in a comfortable silence among the beginnings of a coven. </span>

<p>
<span>As night grew around them, Agatha realized that she hadn’t seen Rio and Lilia in a while. She set her book down, feeling like over the past few hours of reading, she had learned nothing about Green Witches that she didn’t already know, other than Rio was anomalous and could only be studied in person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wandered to the kitchen under the guise of filling up her tea and then moved to the study where Jen had taken over, writing what appeared to be a graduate level chemistry and rune thesis on the old wall paper. She found Alice in the backyard walking around the perimeter of the house and scratching things into the outside of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, upstairs, she heard Lilia speaking. Agatha slowed her steps and kept her heels on the ground to keep from creaking any of the floors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clear your mind,” Lilia gently instructed. “Feel your power and follow it. It’s fraying and branching out. Reach for it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was silence and Agatha could feel her heartbeat in her chest. She was sure she knew what they were doing and it may be the only way to find the Other, but it felt dangerous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and felt along the tether between her and Rio like she was pulling herself down a rope to the bottom of a lake. She could feel Rio searching. She could feel the laser-like focus and the determination. It felt like flying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she felt the pain. Not in herself, but she could feel Rio’s pain. It was like being torn apart from the inside. Then a voice permeated everything. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I will become Death.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Very suddenly Agatha was standing in a shallow pool of water in an infinite space with no walls or structures. It was pitch dark, but she could see by the light of stars speckled the water around her feet. Agatha felt vastly out of place and exposed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were two people standing in the distance. She could make out the outline of Rio, a body she knew all too well, but the other was different. A bit taller with longer hair. They seemed to be having a staring contest or waiting for the other to make the first move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, suddenly the Other’s eyes shot to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With several dozen, juddering, nearly instantaneous steps the Other was standing in front of Agatha. Agatha felt cold hands closing around her throat. It didn’t feel like her air supply was being cut off. It felt like a gale was being shoved down her throat. It was so much at once and her throat was so dry, she couldn’t breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” the roar of Rio’s voice came sailing toward them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other was knocked away from Agatha with the full force of Rio’s entire body and physical power. Rio landed on top of her and Agatha got her breath back in time to see the Other plunge her whole, clawed hand into Rio’s chest. Blood ran down the Other’s arm, dripping all the way down, and pooling across her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other laughed as the blood dripped onto her face. “Death bleeds for a mortal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go!” Rio thrust her free hand out toward Agatha and Agatha felt herself being thrown backwards. The force made her vision go white for a moment before she went crashing down into the cottage she’d shared with Rio centuries ago. The place she’d torn apart trying to save Rio the first time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Agatha yelled at the ceiling. She ran to the door and threw it open, finding the foreboding void of before. “No!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a burst of purple from her chest, she tore down the illusion from the shingles to the wooden slats of the walls to the floor. Every piece of furniture was rendered down to dust as she tore it all down. She held herself above the void, trying to feel her way out - trying to get back to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally felt the tether and followed it as quickly as she could, coming back to her body in the hallway of the stolen house where her new coven was trying to save the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She threw her body into the room Lilia was now pressed against the wall of. Rio was floating in the air, seemingly asleep and a gaping wound in her chest creating a waterfall of blood that ran down her hanging arms and legs onto the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wake up!” Agatha made the tether corporeal and yanked on it as hard as she could. It tightened around Rio and she tumbled back down onto the bed. Out of her trance, she turned on her side, coughing and sputtering, pushing up on her hands and knees. She drew her knife and bounded to her feet, her back to the wall, looking for a threat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only people in the room were Lilia and Agatha, but the thundering steps of Alice and Jen were closing in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha put her hand up toward Rio, keeping one on the tether sparking in her hand. “It’s me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met Agatha’s eyes and took a deep breath as the wound in her chest started to close up on its own. She swallowed and sheathed her knife as Alice bounded into the room and Jen stopped behind Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa, what the-” Alice started, seeing the terrified state of Lilia and Rio breathing heavily standing on a bed covered in blood and the staticy purple tether that extended from Agatha’s hand and wrapped around Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What in the shibari,” Jen asked over Agatha’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dismissed the visible state of the tether and took Rio’s hand to help her down. Rio hopped off of the bed and looked Agatha over. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha answered, “But you need a new dream house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Alice stood in the middle of the room and gestured to the blood covered bed. “What the hell is going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you find her?” Lilia asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. She turned to Alice who looked like she was going to blast the next person who spoke without explaining anything. “I had to look for the Other. I found her and now we can track her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you have to sacrifice a whole goat?” Jen asked, pointing at the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waved her hand over it and the blood seemed to dry up immediately then dissipate into the air. Jen put her shirt over her mouth and Alice waved the air in front of her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did well,” Lilia stepped around the bed and put her hand on Rio’s upper arm. “We’ll keep track of her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked like she was about to ask something else of Rio and Rio looked exhausted so Agatha interrupted, “How’s the serum coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m- still working on it,” Jen answered, seemingly not prepared to be asked about it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha gestured to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes and walked off. Alice stayed for a moment, then stopped in front of Rio. “Do you need anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice patted her back as she left the room. “I’m going to finish the perimeter.” She nodded to Agatha on the way out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take first watch,” Rio told Lilia and then walked out of the room without saying anything else to Agatha.</span>

<p>
<span>First watch apparently meant walking around the house in the trancelike state, sitting down in random places and then getting up to move again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was late in the night when Jen took a break from formulating a coalescence serum to get some coffee. She paused in the doorway when she found Rio on the counter in front of the coffee maker. “Agatha,” Jen called from the kitchen. “Get your cat off of the counter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t get up from the couch or look up from her book. “She’s the house cat. You do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had walked into the kitchen during the exchange. She set her tea up down on the table and moved to the counter. She patted the side of Rio’s leg. “C’mon, dear. It’s time to go to bed. Your watch is over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stirred at the touch and opened her eyes. She looked at Lilia and took in how tired she was. “I can keep going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smiled a sage smile and patted Rio’s knee. “I may be 450 years old, but I can stay up past Wheel of Fortune.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away guiltily then breathed out a quick, “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the couch, Agatha watched Rio slink off upstairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her attention was stolen by Alice sitting down next to her on the couch. “Nothing outside. Inside is secure too though I think we should salt the rest of the windows.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was distracted and answered, “Yeah, sure. Great.” Then, without looking directly at Alice at all, she stood and moved to the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The only person she was fooling, when she said she was going upstairs to change into more comfortable clothes, was herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had made herself comfortable in the living room armchair and watched Agatha disappear before taking her guardpost looking out for the Other. She looked at Alice who rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are they going to get us all killed?” Alice asked, leaning back into the couch and putting an arm across the back of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia shook her head. “I haven’t looked, but probably.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s bedroom was the farthest from Agatha’s so figuring out a reason to wander in that direction was difficult. She had vaguely heard Alice about salting the windows so she decided that was her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s door was open and Agatha walked in like it was her own room, sweeping in, but trying to be quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After pretending not to see the bed or anyone on it as she approached the window, she turned around and found Rio was gone. Probably off to reap the reluctant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the air in the room started to move, Agatha quickly turned to the window. Before Rio could ask, Agatha said, “Alice asked me to check the salt on the windows.” As Agatha actually examined it, she found intricate salt runes running all the way around the windows, unmoved by Rio’s movements. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t answered so Agatha turned toward around. Rio was standing in a zombie-like state, staring at the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha took a step toward her so she was within arm’s length, then reached out to grab a handful of her sleeve and turn her around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She found Rio essentially asleep on her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha worried her side of the binding had failed so she made the tether visible. The tether still snaked between them, but the binding on Rio’s side was starting to show deep blue cracks in it. Beneath the cracked tether, Rio’s skin was starting to blacken. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha noticed that when she took a step toward her, the tether started healing itself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gently guided Rio into lying down, prodding her legs and pushing her shoulder back onto the pillow. She looked down at her, wanting to be so angry and holding onto it so hard, but when she saw the Other put her hand through Rio’s chest… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha left the room without looking back, but returned with a book. She sat down on the bed next to Rio and sat against the headboard that was thankfully more comfortable than it looked. She cracked open the book and started reading. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few pages in, Rio turned in the bed and wriggled until she was comfortable. Comfortable meant she was facing Agatha and bent at the waist enough that her forehead was resting against the outside of Agatha’s thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her, her hair falling around her face, a restful innocent look on her face. And in that moment, she looked so much like him. Curled against her leg, smooth brown hair falling all over her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the back of her mind, Agatha always knew that there was some Rio in him. Some magick that was contributed in the deepest passion or an endearing love they shared. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head back as tears came. She had lost them both so close together and Rio had been the only person she could have shared her grief with and she was the cause of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel the ache of missing them both so much like it had just happened. She looked down at Rio again and reached for her face, but hesitated for a moment. Then she brushed some of her hair away from her face and tucked it behind her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The roil of pain and anger and fury roared inside of her then sank into a deep despair. She had lost a partner and a son. The woman who, if they had met a few hundred years later, she’d have called her wife. And the son they’d created of their love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tear fell from her cheek onto Rio’s and at the angle she was at, it looked like she was crying as well. Agatha stroked her hair one last time, feeling both of her loves under her fingers before she slipped out of the bed and out of the room. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha had gone to her bedroom and closed the door. She checked the salt runes around the windows and pulled the curtains closed. She ran a bath and got into it, sinking low around her shoulders. She looked up at the ceiling and sunk down until just the barest expanse of her face was above the water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she closed her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her mind go blank and just floated in the water, feeling her body from her toes to the top of her head. She wriggled her fingers in the water and thought of every muscle in her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In her attempt to not remember anything, she felt her consciousness drifting away. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>In the woods, many centuries ago, Agatha Harkness was asleep. She was laying on an rudimentary bedroll, a young boy in her arms. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nearby, a black bear was rooting around the base of a tree when it smelled something interesting. After studying the air for a few seconds, it lumbered toward the lingering smell of cooked meat. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The camp the bear approached had been warded, but the bear had not been the target of the ward, and entered freely in search of food.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He didn’t make much noise as he entered the camp, mere feet from Agatha and her son. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Too warm in his mother’s embrace, the boy squirmed, trying to get comfortable and when he couldn’t, he opened his eyes to find a better spot. In the moonlight and the dying campfire, he saw the bear, hulking toward them. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The boy was awake enough to see a rock sail through the air from outside of the camp and hit a pan that was drying on a nearby tree. The sound echoed through the forest in the still night, sending Agatha scrambling to her feet and the bear fearfully running away. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The boy was still on the ground, behind the back of his protective mother, looking for where the rock had come from. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He saw a woman he’d seen before standing behind a tree in the forest, her green hood pulled up over her head, but her kind face smiling faintly at him in the moonlight. She pressed her finger to her lips and stepped behind the tree disappearing. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s consciousness came back to her in the bath. The water had gone cold and she could feel she’d been in the water too long. But she stayed still in the water to think about her dream. Or… memory? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought back and remembered the night a loud noise woke her up and she found a bear running from her camp. She didn’t know what the noise had been and assumed the bear had knocked something over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed it off and grabbed onto the sides of the tub to hoist herself out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She towel dried her hair, changed into shorts and a tshirt that had belonged to the previous occupant of the house, and got into bed. The house was still and quiet so she assumed everyone else was asleep as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Agatha couldn’t go to sleep. She kept thinking about that night with the bear. She could have fallen asleep in the bathtub, sure, but she was also tethered to Rio. She had been able to push into her more mentally than ever before. Maybe their subconsciousnesses reached for each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After nearly an hour of trying to go to sleep and tossing and turning and trying to turn her brain off, she got out of bed and crept out of the master bedroom. She tiptoed down the hall and slipped into the door to Rio’s room she had left ajar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood over Rio’s sleeping form for a long while, then started pacing with her arms crossed at the foot of the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stirred a bit a few laps in and she lifted the blanket next to her without opening her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped walking and just stared. Rio had tented the blanket so she could get into it, an action that she may not even be consciously doing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath and walked to the side of the bed where the tented blanket was open and knelt down next to it. She put her hand on top of Rio’s and pulled it down so the tent was closed. It also served to wake Rio up, having her invitation rejected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There was a bear in the woods,” Agatha started, holding onto the edge of the bed, and looking at Rio from eye level. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes focused on her, but seemed confused as to what she was saying. She remained quiet and listened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was sleeping and Nicky was sleeping and I hadn’t-” Agatha struggled. “I had forgotten to ward against regular beasts.” She held Rio’s eyes, seeing her start to follow. “Did you throw a rock at the pan on the tree to wake me up and scare it away?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio narrowed her eyes, not in confusion, but in investigation. She nodded slowly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a memory?” Agatha asked, eyes widening. “I saw your memory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath and slowly sat up. She had changed into a tank top and ran a hand through her hair. She didn’t say anything, but seemed to be bracing herself, muscles in her shoulders tensing and a hard line formed in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A whole host of emotions passed over Agatha’s face from wonder to betrayal to fury to relief. No one emotion coalesced to become completely dominant so Agatha’s entire body felt like she was vibrating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second Agatha broke eye contact, she made her way swiftly out of the bedroom door. She didn’t stop moving until she was in the backyard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She paced in the moonlight and muttered under her breath. “Watching us like some kind of -” A few more steps. “I didn’t need protection. I needed-” More steps. “Then she does it anyway.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha screamed, “Aaaah!” at the sky because there felt like no other way to let out the storm of emotion inside of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it?” Alice was immediately at the open back door, hands glowing orange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha honestly forgot there was anyone else in the house and just looked at Alice, frustrated and incoherent. She just screamed again, her whole body tensing. “Aaaah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice looked around and stood up straight. “Should I get… is this a Rio thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just yelled louder at the sound of her name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so no,” Alice straightened up and looked at the sky. There weren’t any telltale signs of harbingers of the Other so she closed the backdoor and walked outside. She carefully stayed out of Agatha’s way as she made her way to the massive tree in the backyard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she approached there was a peculiar smell and she looked around to see a body was hanging from the tree, obviously dead and very naked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that yours?” Alice asked, pointing up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took Agatha a moment to register the speaking, then another to acknowledge it, then another to flick her wrist and the body went flying away from their backyard. She returned to pacing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oookay,” Alice sat down at the base of the tree and leaned back on it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked, irritated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You hired me to protect,” Alice shrugged. “I’m protecting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, “You’re getting paid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded. “Really well.” She shrugged. “I guess if the worst comes to pass it won’t matter. I would have done it for less, but Rio-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t say her name,” Agatha pointed at Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded, putting her hands up in surrender, “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know she’s Death right?” Agatha pointed at the house like an accusatory prosecutor presenting damning evidence. “The end of the road for everyone and everything.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that’s the point of all this,” Alice gestured to the house around them. “To keep it that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned in frustration at failing to try to vilify Rio. “She’s Death!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Alice nodded, bending her knees so she could loop her arms loosely around them. “Pretty cool.” Alice smiled, “I did meet Grace Slick in New York in the 70s - 1970s. That was pretty cool too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” Agatha asked, wide eyed and furious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grace Slick,” Alice gestured like the name again would help. Then she went on. “Jefferson Airplane. Well and then Jefferson Starship. And then Starship, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Alice like a teakettle ready to whistle before she turned on her heel and started pacing again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was quiet as Agatha paced which would annoy Agatha when she remembered she was there. That was rare though so Agatha continued pacing and muttering, then occasionally looking at Alice and sputtering, before continuing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who does she think she is?” Agatha muttered. “I went - we - and then she just - how many times.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was falling asleep against the tree when Agatha finally shouted, “Ah ha!” Then she stormed back into the house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is gonna kill us,” Alice sighed and made her way back into the house. Agatha was already most of the way up the stairs, so Alice decided to retire to her own bedroom and get some real sleep. </span>

<p>
<span>Of course Rio wasn’t there when Agatha barged into her room. The pent up emotional tsunami that she was going to unleash on Rio had nowhere to go. She took a moment to gather herself and ran through her options. None of them were going to be satisfying in the moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was so tired and feeling so volatile that she sat down in the bed and looked at the wall. Maybe if she took a few minutes, she could calm herself down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, she didn’t get those few minutes because Rio appeared in the bed next to her, riding a soft breeze. Rio was facing away from her on the bed, already lying down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So Agatha let it all loose at once. She put her hand on Rio’s hip to turn her onto her back while pushing up on her own elbow, getting closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed surprised, but when Agatha kissed her, her eyes slid closed on reflex. As soon as her lips touched Rio’s, Agatha could feel the tightness in her chest of wanting. The comfort and the warmth from the kiss spread through her body and she started to remember every kiss that came before it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But that’s not what she was looking for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she got her wits about her, she deepened the kiss, feeling Rio’s hands caressing her face. Agatha pushed through the tether into Rio’s mind while she was distracted. She had to know. She pushed through millennia of memories and billions of souls escorted from the mortal coil. Then she found it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha had contracted something so pedestrian and annoying. Some kind of cold made it so hard to sleep on top of how fussy Nicky had gotten in the past few days. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She cursed her mother and her coven for not teaching her the basics of witchcraft. Agatha could make entire towns hallucinate the end of days and lift boulders with her magick, but she was having to experiment with cold remedies so that she could sleep.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I know, baby,” Agatha cooed as she finally got Nicky to sleep. She laid him down on a nest of blankets under a tree and leaned back against the trunk of it, struggling to keep her eyes open. </span>

<span>She had dozed off and at some point Nicky started moving. A woman in a green cloak materialized on the wind and knelt down next to him. She smiled kindly at him, gently picking him up and bouncing him. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio took Nicky a few steps away and sang him a lullaby in a long dead language. He quieted down and eventually went back to sleep. When she set him back down, she sat next to the nest of blankets, watching him sleep. She smiled as a tear tracked down her face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Just before disappearing again, Rio reached into a gathering bag on her waist and pulled out some herbs. She dropped them in Agatha’s now-cold tea and then gazed at her for a moment, hurt all over her face before disappearing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scrambled from one memory to the next, getting bogged down in feelings, but knowing she needed to keep going before Rio pushed her out. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nicky was pretending to read a book under a tree. He looked at all of the bags around him and sighed. The women who they belonged to would be dead soon and he and his mother could get back on the road. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He looked bored and, worst of all, a bit sad. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“What’s wrong?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He looked up at the sound of a familiar voice and a smile popped onto his face. Rio couldn’t help, but smile back, her green hood falling back from her face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I got bored,” he told her, pushing his book off of his lap and standing up. He ran to her and hugged her legs. “Where have you been?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Everywhere,” Rio told him, then knelt down to be eye level with him. “What do you want to do today?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He tapped his chin in thought and then let out a sly grin. “Let’s play shop.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio chuckled and patted his face. “Okay.” She went to sit down a bit away from all of the bags. She crossed her legs and splayed out her cloak, making herself presentable. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nicky walked up to her and stood tall. “I’d like to buy a goat please. My old one got too old.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh just one?” Rio asked. “They’re much better in pairs.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No,” Nicky put his hands on his hips in a very serious way he’d seen farmers in shops do. “I’d like to build a barn, but I don’t know how to build one big enough for two goats.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hmm,” Rio pretended to think about it. “Okay. One goat. That’ll be seven flowers.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nicky sprang into action, running around the meadow, picking seven flowers of varying colors and lengths. He ran back to Rio and presented the flowers. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“These are such beautiful flowers,” Rio accepted them and picked a long blade of grass next to her to wrap the flowers in a bundle. She gave the bundle back to Nicky. “I think your kind gesture deserves a goat without the flowers.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He raised an eyebrow. “No shopkeeper is that nice.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio grinned. “I haven’t been to a shop in a while.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We went to one where there were sooo many cups,” he started telling her a story about the last journey he and his mother went on. He got tired of standing while he told it so she flopped into Rio’s lap and she held him while he told of a weird frog he’d seen and an owl that he was sure was following them. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She asked questions when appropriate and absently brushed his hair away from his face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>When she felt the ending of several lives nearby, she patted his shoulder. “I have to go.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Really?” he asked, sadly standing up and looking at her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio nodded, saddened as well. “I’ll be back though.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“When do I get to see where you live?” he asked, looking at the bundle of flowers in his hand.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio forced a smile that even Nicky knew wasn’t all that genuine. “Soon.” She kissed his forehead and smoothed out his hair. “Give your mother the flowers.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He nodded. Then he hugged her around the neck. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio’s jaw twitched with tears she didn’t want to let loose in front of Nicky. Instead, she forced a smile as he pulled away. “Don’t forget your goat.” Then she raised her hood and wandered off into the forest.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha walked back into the meadow. She had a wide smile on her face and scooped Nicky up as soon as she saw him. He giggled as she showered his face with kisses. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“What do you say we get out of here?” she asked. “I think we should stay at an inn tonight.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Can my goat come?” he asked as Agatha set him on his feet. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha seemed puzzled, but raised an eyebrow, “Your old goat?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No,” Nicky answered, presenting the flowers to Agatha. “I got a new one. I bought it with flowers.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha seemed confused, but chalked it up to her son’s wonderful imagination. She accepted the flowers and smelled them, “Must be a beautiful goat for such beautiful flowers.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He smiled, proud of himself. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha kissed his forehead and as she did, she heard a bleating from the edge of the meadow. She looked over his head and saw a goat wanding out of the treeline, looking for sweeter grass. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha looked around the meadow and didn’t see anyone. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Who did you buy the goat from?” Agatha asked, holding Nicky to her hip, watching for anyone nearby.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The shopkeeper,” he told her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha asked a few more questions and then decided that the goat wasn’t a threat. She helped him tie a harness for the goat and they started walking away, onto the next adventure.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel herself getting pushed out of Rio’s memories and she let it happen. She wasn’t sure she could stand to see anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the bed they had been in, their lips were still meshed together, but they were both crying. Rio broke the kiss, pulling away and withdrawing from Agatha. Rio sat up and turned away from Agatha, dropping her head into her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel the telltale wind of Rio leaving pick up, but it faded before she disappeared. Agatha wiped her face and made the tether visible. It was still healing and maybe Rio couldn’t leave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was hard to distinguish what emotions belonged to whom. Agatha could still feel the residual pain of watching Nicky walk away. She could feel the pain of not being able to be there for him in every moment of his life, but also the joy of the moments she got. She could feel the distant longing. She was sure the streak of betrayal was her own, but it was so hard to distill the violent emotions from the ones that felt like drowning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you should go,” Rio’s voice was a low rumble because if it was any louder or higher, it’d be obvious she was breaking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to rebut the dismissal or ask for clarification or… divine mother forbid apologize. But she knew when she had pushed Rio too hard. It hadn’t happened often, but when it did Agatha knew when to throw in the towel. She pushed up off of the bed and retreated to her room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In her bulky blankets of her bed, she lay there looking at the ceiling. She remembered all of the times something serendipitous happened to her and Nicky while they were together and wondered if it was Rio. She wondered if Nicky always seemed so brave because Rio had been there to comfort him when Agatha couldn’t. She wondered if wild animals or marauders rarely approached them because Rio was in the shadows chasing them off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As dawn broke, Agatha’s brain had exhausted itself and she finally fell asleep. </span>

<p>
<span>When she woke up she could hear the sound of magick out her window. It had the distinct sound of blasts and shields, fighting magick. Agatha burst out of bed, worried that some kind of fight had broken out and no one woke her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However when she got to the window, she found Rio and Alice outside, throwing blasts at each other and batting them away. Rio had her knife out and Alice had some kind of glowing orange spectral shield. Rio leapt into the air, sailing over Alice and bringing her knife down hard on the shield. The shield shattered into dust, leaving her defenseless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice whipped a quick, viper-like hand out and grabbed Rio’s ankle and pulled her down to the ground. Rio hit the ground on her back, but quickly rolled backwards landing on her feet, knife in hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both stopped moving, sizing each other up, ready to pounce before Alice broke out in a smile. Rio’s shoulders relaxed and she smiled as well. Agatha watched them exchange compliments and pleasantries. She watched Rio approach Alice and gently take her arm. She ran her fingers over a long cut in her forearm to heal it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The touch seemed far too intimate for Agatha’s taste and her whole body tensed when Alice tilted her head, smiling and said something to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and let go of her arm, waved her hand like she was waving off gratitude or a compliment. Rio pointed her knife playfully at Alice and took a few paces back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice readied herself as well getting her hands ready to cast. She said something that made Rio run her tongue over her bottom lip and nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated it. She pushed away from the windows and left them to their sparring match. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned on the shower in her bathroom and disrobed, deciding to start the day clean. The problem with getting in the shower was the idle time to think. The time to think about Rio’s relationship with Nicky. The time to think about Rio’s pain and adoration for her son. The time to think about Rio silently supporting them from the shadows because Agatha herself had cast her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The night before Agatha felt angry and betrayed. In the shower, she felt emotionally exhausted. It turned out being tethered to her ex was less the power play she hoped it would be and more of a forced therapy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finished in the shower, not sure how she was going to navigate the rest of the day. She very slowly got ready, pulling on jeans and a sweater. She had found nice thick socks she liked from the master bedroom and made her way downstairs with drying hair and a tremendous amount of trepidation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia was sitting on the couch, reading a book when Agatha got downstairs. Lilia looked up to see who it was and then resumed reading. “The kettle is still hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered, quietly making her way to the kitchen. She made some tea and ate a bagel someone had run down to the store on the corner for. When she heard the backdoor open and Alice’s voice penetrate the house, in a panic she scampered to the office where Jen had been working. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened up in the doorway and swept into the room with as much authority as she could. “Any progress?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked up from staring at a rune on the wall. She wasn’t snippy like Agatha expected. She looked exhausted and pensive. “I think - I’m close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha softened at the reply. It was hard to be abrasive when Jen was working overtime to save Rio and to a lesser extent, the world as they knew it. “Anything I can do?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen covered a yawn. She shook her head, trying to wake herself up. “More coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or,” Agatha looked around the room and saw how much it resembled a manic academic’s study. “You go take a nap. Freshen up at least.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen turned to look at Agatha. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll read it over, make some notes,” Agatha gestured to the wall. “You go take a shower or a nap. Clear your head okay? Then when you get back, we’ll fill you with as much caffeine as your body can handle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked toward the window and seemed surprised to find light shining through the thick wooden blinds. “Oh, yeah. Okay. An hour.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An hour,” Agatha nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen left the room and Agatha pulled a chair into the middle of the room and sat in it. She started trying to decipher what Jen was doing while she sipped her tea and listened very carefully for anyone’s approach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, in the process of reading through everything in the study, she found the list of ingredients Jen had forgotten to give her earlier. It gave her something to do that wasn’t so far out of her wheelhouse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She read the list as she made her way to the front door. She wished she knew where Rio had gotten all that money, but she also didn’t want to interact with Rio for a while. She truly wasn’t sure which way it would go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha managed to sneak out of the house without interacting with anyone. She didn’t have a car as her stolen car from the adolescent in the park was left in Jen’s building when they were attacked so she walked to the store, knowing that it wasn’t going to have everything, but it was a start. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lack of money was starting to get annoying so she pickpocketed who may have actually been the same adolescent she stole the car from in the park. It felt mean to use the same dog visage to chase him into her so she could grab his phone and his wallet, but it was effective. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had made her way to the botanical gardens where she did a lot of collecting that was explicitly against every single sign she reached past, but she was pretty sneaky and the illusionary rabid dog trick worked wonders basically anywhere. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The only hitch in an otherwise delightful afternoon of thievery and illusions was that on her way to a plant nursery she realized someone was following her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few seconds of wondering who it could be, she rolled her eyes at herself, feeling the tether leading to the person tailing her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” Agatha asked, not stopping or turning around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To not unravel,” Rio answered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, this really is getting tedious,” Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio continued walking at the same distance behind her, hood up, hands in her coat pockets. “Don’t worry. It’ll be over soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha whirled around in the middle of the residential street to face Rio, “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “The tether is fading. The Other will be here soon.” She stopped walking a few yards from Agatha and kicked at the sidewalk. “I’ll either, ironically, be dead or you’ll never have to see me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled without humor, “What about when I die?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Other has given me some fun ideas about how to use revenants to do my bidding,” Rio took a step toward Agatha, it was threatening and not in a physical way. “Don’t worry. I’ll send my prettiest revenant to come collect you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They stared at each other hard in the middle of the residential street, in the middle of a sunny afternoon. Rio’s threat stood between them and Agatha could only gape at it. There was a flicker of fear just before her face hardened and she spat out, “Good.” Then she turned around and walked away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had to stay nearby, but she kept her distance. Then halfway through the plant nursery Agatha felt her disappear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt like she’d been holding her breath the entire time and when Rio was gone, tears welled up in her eyes. She’d finally done it. She had finally pushed away the last person on earth who cared about her. She couldn’t shake the cold fury in Rio’s eyes when she said she’d send a revenant to get her when she died. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As hard as Agatha ran away from death, she was never afraid of dying because at the end of it all, Rio would be there - the singular entity that cared for her. She never imagined dying, but Rio being there made it almost comforting. And she was alone again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped the bag of everything she’d bought, stolen, and collected over the afternoon in the middle of the nursery aisle and left it. She walked numbly out of the nursery and into the parking lot. She walked through the parking lot and down the street. It didn’t matter anymore. Nothing mattered anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had been so hell bent on saving Rio and for what? So they could go back to centuries of ignoring each other. She’d never see Rio again. Maybe the end of the world wouldn’t be so bad.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked for an hour before going back to the nursery to get what she had gathered. She didn’t want to have wasted the day and the remaining witches might have a use for what she had gathered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had gotten back to the residential block the house was on when she started psyching herself up for leaving the coven. It had been the first one she had had so far that hadn’t tried to kill her. And there was Rio… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts were interrupted by a large swatch of pink flowers running through the neighborhood and then dying and decaying within a few seconds. Next purple and blue flowers started growing and dying. Vines reached out in every direction across the ground, covering houses, and crawling up trees. The vines withered into nothing, crumbling off of everything they had just grown over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A cold panic took over her body and she started running. She blasted in the front door as she ran, dropping the bag of serum ingredients as she entered. She could hear Rio screaming in the living room and when Agatha tried to summon the tether, it flickered into her hand and crumbled into nothingness like all of the plants outside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia was holding Rio’s head as she screamed and writhed. Motes of black were floating off of her body as Rio herself crumbled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you let go?” Alice demanded as Agatha walked in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha rushed in and pulled up her sleeves. “Everyone repeat after me.” She had taken the role of conductor in a symphony, even as her hands were shaking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are we tethering her to?” Jen asked, holding her necklace between two fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Both Agatha and Alice said, “Me,” at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t even like her,” Alice added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me!” Agatha added with all the venom she could muster. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Jen seemed to defer to Lilia who swallowed and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” Agatha started her incantation and after the first verse of it, the rest of the coven joined in. They all started chanting in unison, different colored tethers all reaching out for and snaking around Rio’s convulsing body. A pink tether, wrapped around her wrists, orange moving in on her legs. A yellow tether gently wrapped around her head like a crown. Then the purple tether, the boldest and quickest wrapped around her torso multiple times before sinking deep into her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The screams subsided as the ritual nearly completed and Rio came to rest on the kitchen table. Jen looked at Alice who nodded to her, both directing the ends of their tether into Agatha, neither seeming sure of it, but neither knowing what else to do. Lilia gently guided hers to tangle with the rest of them, pink, orange, and yellow fading into purple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the chanting slowed to a stop and Rio was fully bound, her body didn’t move. She was motionless and pale on the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were we too late?” Jen asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha moved to Rio’s head and cradled it in her hands. “No! We’re not too late!” She pressed her forehead to Rio’s and felt along the tether, opening her mind and heart and following it as fast as she could, diving head first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She found herself in a familiar village with a large wooden stake in the middle of it. Small, old buildings dotted the area, but the stake was the focal point. Agatha was immediately on guard, not seeing anything materialized past the buildings, like some kind of theater set. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kicked at a pile of dust on the ground that she was sure used to be a witch. There were several other mounds of very evident advanced decaying bodies in a semi-circle around the stake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm,” Agatha hummed and crossed her arms in front of herself, one hand tilted upward to press a nail into the underside of her chin. “I thought I burned this place to the ground.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did,” Rio answered, leaning against the stake where the first attempted execution of Agatha Harkness took place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at herself and saw that she was dressed in the same way she had been dressed that night. “Why are we here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was playing with her knife, the handle in one fist and the point, pressed into her index finger. She pulled the knife away and saw blood. It seemed to surprise her, but she shook her head. “You followed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted her jaw. “We tethered you again and you didn’t wake up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wrinkled her nose and wiped the blood drop on her index finger on her pants. “I know. The ghosts got me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got you?” Agatha raised her eyebrows. She took a careful step to the side so her eyes could wander in and through the buildings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The prisoners become the wardens,” Rio tilted her head back, resting it on the large stake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked around the pyre that had been meant to be her grave, seeing the scorch marks from the blasts that had been meant to kill her. “What kind of ghosts?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head. She shifted her jaw, “Uh, ones I didn’t want out in the world. I can only watch over so many at a time so maybe… six?” She glanced up at the sky. “You might want to leave though. The last one is always the worst.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You  already banished five ghosts?” Agatha asked. “It’s been two seconds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed one hand up into the air in a gesture of nonchalance, “I’m efficient.” She readjusted her grip on the knife handle and tilted her head as if listening for something incoming, “But seriously, you may want to go. I’ll be out in a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who could be so horrifying-” Agatha started, but was cut off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well,” the voice of her mother preceded her visage. She materialized at the edge of the pyre circle, hands folded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evanora,” Rio warned in a singsong voice, “We’ve had this discussion before.” She used her knife to gesture to the elder Harkness, taking slow, leisurely steps toward her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And here I thought you’d come to your senses and brought her to me,” Evanora gestured to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved to stand between Evanora and Agatha. “She’s a spectator.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora hummed, “Having someone else do her dirty work for her as usual.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough,” Rio barked. She pointed her knife at Evanora. “Let it go and it won’t hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora suddenly reached forward, whipping two white tendrils of energy around Rio’s ankle and wrist. She used the magick to fling Rio away, sending her tumbling through the air and crashing through the front wall of the nearby church. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached her hands out to Agatha. “You can finally make this all right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stuttered, “I, what?” She took a step back, out of her mother’s grasp. The sudden appearance of the first person who had ever hurt her had put her on her heels. She choked out, “What do you want?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you to make it alright,” Evanora paused her advance toward Agatha. “An evil must be scourged from the earth.” She tilted her head upon seeing the tears in Agatha’s eyes. “Do not waste your tears for the wretched woman you have become.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leapt from the church and soared down toward them like a meteor. At the last moment, Evanora looked up, waved both of her hands and deflected Rio to the ground. She landed on a soft indentation of dirt, slowly getting back up to her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t listen to her, Agatha,” Rio clutched her side like being thrown around was actually starting to hurt her. She moved, knife toward Evanora. “She’ll say anything to get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora shot a blast at Rio that Rio deftly dodged, but she threw both of her hands out, breaking the stake in half. She moved her hands like she was throwing a javelin at Rio. It was too big for Rio to get out of the way in time. One end of it slammed into Rio, knocking her back. “I’m trying to have a conversation.” She turned back to Agatha who was arrested in the spot like her feet couldn’t move. “Make this easier than you’ve ever made anything, Agatha.” She reached for her daughter, taking Agatha’s face in her hands. “Let go of the demonic crusade you are carrying out over the world. You are evil and no one will ever love you. Come with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Golden tendrils of magick started to crawl up the tears on Agatha’s face, creeping in crooked patterns toward her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio shoved the heavy stake off of her and found her feet in a whirlpool of deep mud. “Agatha!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No one will miss you,” Evanora hissed, watching her magick start to invade her daughter’s body. “No one loves you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> love you,” Rio called, pushing herself free. She spit blood and ran a hand over her rips to reform them as she moved. She panted. “Nicky loves you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The spell Evanora was putting Agatha under, the one where she used no magick, but the uncaring words of an unworthy mother, broke. Agatha pushed a blast of purple out from herself, pushing her mother and her manipulative magick away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora skidded back, tumbling across the ground. She got up and watched Rio move out of her trap to take her place at Agatha’s side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The love of a feral demon does not make one worthy of life,” Evanora hissed. She looked at Rio. “What sort of love causes so much pain?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes shot over to Rio who looked like she’d just been punched and all the air forced from her lungs. She closed her eyes for a moment and took a step back. It only took a moment for her to rally, but it was at a great cost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora shot another blast at Rio, knocking her backwards. She was heavily injured in ways Agatha had never seen before the past week. Her power was split and inside of this… scene, she was less powerful. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your evil must be cleansed,” Evanora shot another blast at Rio, pushing her farther backwards. “Everything you do or touch or make must be cleansed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at Agatha, a desperate earnesty in her eyes. She spoke aloud, but only to Agatha. “Nicky loved you so much. How could that be evil?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next blast was much larger and meant to be a killing blow to Rio, but Agatha stepped into the beam, intercepting it before it would hit Rio. At the blast, Agatha took a deep breath, locking it into herself and then turning to her mother. She could see her drain start and her mother’s face change in horror. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I may be evil, but you are alone,” Agatha snarled and drained the last of the magick from her mother’s ghost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of a shriveled corpse, there was nothing left when Agatha had absorbed the last of it. Agatha closed her eyes, feeling the volatile energy become tamed inside of her. Then she looked over at Rio and saw she was back in the kitchen of the house she had stolen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was slowly sitting up on the table with the help of the rest of the coven. When she could turn enough, she looked over her shoulder at Agatha, eyebrows raised in question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her, parted lips and partially breathless. She met Rio’s eyes and nodded slowly. She ran her teeth over her bottom lip and nodded again. Then she turned on her heel to exit the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind there was a brief commotion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey whoa!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch out!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then a thud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and saw that Rio was getting up off of the floor and looking around. All eyes moved to Agatha though. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take a step that way,” Lilia pointed away from the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step and Rio was pulled a step toward her by the invisible line between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The tether is a lot shorter now,” Alice dipped down to help Rio stand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic,” Agatha put her hand over her eyes. She pinched the bridge of her nose and refocused. She turned back to the group. “Okay, I got everything on your list.” She waved her hand. “Well, most everything.” She moved to the front door, careful to watch how Rio was pulled toward her and picked up the bag she dropped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You broke the door,” Alice gestured to the gaping hole where the front door was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set the ingredients down in front of Jen. “Oops.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen took the bag and looked inside. “I’ll get started.” She quickly left the room, moving for the study. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia walked up to Rio and patted her cheek. “I’ll keep watch. You get some rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-” Rio started, but Lilia held up her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like it there,” Lilia added, walking into the living room. “It’s peaceful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed and put her hands on her hips. “I’ll get the front door.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio standing next to her in the kitchen. “Perhaps we should… rest.” She gestured to the ceiling. “It’s been a taxing day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded mutely and didn’t start walking upstairs until Agatha did. They figured that they could move freely around the master bedroom without tugging on each other too much. Rio was content to strip down to her underwear and put a sweatshirt on to lie down, but Agatha wanted to bathe to wash off the day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t complain and sat outside of the open bathroom door, her head leaned back on the wall behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had put enough bubble bath in the water to not feel exposed in case Rio needed to go into the bathroom. When she sunk down into the water, she closed her eyes and started replaying the fight with her mother. She was used to her mother saying hurtful things. It was her entire childhood and Agatha was still furious with herself that it worked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t get over how mad she was at her mother for what she said to Rio as well. She stewed on it for a long time and tapped her nails on the side of the tub. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She allowed herself as much processing time as she felt she needed, which was exactly as much time as it took for the water to get cold. Agatha got out of the bath, put her borrowed pajamas back on, and stepped out of the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at the footsteps and Agatha held out her hand to help her up. There was a pause before Rio took her hand and allowed Agatha to assist in pulling her to her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What she didn’t expect was Agatha to pull her into her arms. She cradled the back of Rio’s head and wrapped her other arm around the small of her back. Rio melted into her, wrapping her arms around Agatha and holding on tight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, finding so much peace in Rio’s arms. It was a peace she hadn’t been ready for until her mother attacked them. She could feel a weight being lifted from her shoulders and a warmth spread through her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rocked Rio very minutely and took a deep breath. Then she pulled away knowing she would have to build up to speaking with Rio about what happened. But that was a problem for another day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took Rio’s hand and led her to the bed. She gestured for Rio to get in bed first and then lay down after her, pulling the blankets up over both of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to face Rio in the dark of the room, and stroked the hair away from Rio’s face. “She was wrong about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrow quirked up, like she hadn’t expected Agatha to speak. She took a moment of searching Agatha’s face before she replied, “She’s always been wrong about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled sadly. “Maybe.” She closed her eyes and pulled her hand back to her chest, facing Rio, but not touching her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched Agatha’s face for any sign of pain or tension. She was worried that her mother would have a lasting effect on her, but Agatha’s face seemed peaceful. She smiled faintly as well, closing her eyes and letting herself go.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha had only slept a few hours, but it felt like enough. She truly hadn’t expected Rio to still be there, not only was she still there, Agatha had wormed into her arms while they were sleeping. Her head was on Rio’s shoulder and both of Rio’s arms were holding her gently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had been running away for centuries from the comfort Rio afforded her. Now that she had let herself fall into it, and get caught in the trap, she wasn’t sure she’d ever be able to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt tears in her eyes and this time they weren’t of frustration or fear or heartbreak or grief. It was the warmth of coming home. It was an imperfect home, but it was safety and stillness of mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes and let the tears fall, pushing into Rio’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed with the movement, slowly waking up, but keeping her hold on Agatha. Agatha felt Rio take a deep breath and bring a hand around to stroke the hair away from her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to say something in the moment. She wanted to say something beautiful and meaningful. She wanted to leave all the vitriol behind and move forward. But that wasn’t who she was. So she kept her mouth shut and laid there. In the night her hand had found a sliver of skin under Rio’s sweatshirt and she stroked the small of Rio’s back with her thumb. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s close,” Rio quietly mumbled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t what Agatha had expected for the first words after what felt like the start of a reunion, but they were very much still in the middle of a world-ending scenario. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move. “Do we need to go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not yet,” Rio hadn’t opened her eyes yet. She moved her fingers to the back of Agatha’s head and lightly scratched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s going to happen?” Agatha asked, tilting her head up to see Rio’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled serenely. “I have a plan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned onto her stomach and pushed up so she could fully look at Rio. Rio finally opened her eyes, rolled onto her back and tucked an arm behind her head so she could be face to face with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this,” she paused, “master plan?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio used her free hand to push her fingers into Agatha’s hair and tuck it behind her ear. “Well, big picture,” she ran her thumb over Agtha’s eyebrow. “We kill this bitch and all her revenants.” Then she moved her hand down Agatha’s cheek to run her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip. “Then, I find the motherfucker that messed up the sacred balance. Kill him slowly. Very, very slowly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then, back to business as usual?” Agatha asked, realizing that the end of the plan was a massive let down as far as her future with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept her fingers on Agatha’s cheek. “I don’t know. I think that’s up to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, “Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a sly, knowing streak across Rio’s face and she pushed up, leaned forward and kissed Agatha’s forehead. “It’s time.” Then she swiftly got out of the bed and moved to the closet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s coming!” Lilia yelled from downstairs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was going to lay in bed and force Rio to stay and explain herself, but Lilia’s warning got her up and moving. She went to the open bedroom door and yelled, “How’s that potion coming, Kale?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s still simmering!” she yelled back. “Someone didn’t get everything I asked for.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kicked off her pajama pants and pulled on her own pants, muttering. “Can’t please some people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed Agatha her shirt and dusted off her long, purple coat that had fallen to the ground in her process of getting undressed for a bath the night before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not going to do anything stupid, are you?” Agatha asked, shrugging on her coat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved Agatha to the full length mirror in the room and had her face it. She took the locket Agatha had always kept on her and looped it around Agatha’s neck. She carefully fastened it in place and met Agatha’s eyes over her shoulder. “Most definitely.”</span>

<p>
<span>“When was the last time you drove?!” Jen asked, holding on to anything and everything to keep from bouncing into the door or falling out of her seat into Alice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s my first time!” Rio cackled, leaning forward in her seat with both hands on the wheel. “Can you tell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where the fuck are we?” Alice yelled. She unbuckled her seatbelt and crawled back into the third seat with Agatha. She could see the cloud of revenants following them through the field they were rumbling across. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The last sign I saw said Massachusetts,” Lilia grabbed onto the handle over the window to brace herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did we get here so fast?” Jen yelled over the rumbling of the rocks kicking up and hitting the bottom of the SUV.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia,” Rio glanced in the rearview mirror and said urgently. “Here.” She thrust a small gathering bag in her hand and spoke to her very quickly in a language no one else understood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice saw something flying at them, faster than they were driving and grabbed onto Agatha, pulling her into the floor of the SUV. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia looked gravely at Rio for just a moment before nodding. She leaned to the side against the door of the SUV as the back window shattered. An entire person’s body flew through the back window, over the middle seat and burst through the windshield. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When everyone got brave enough to look up from their places of cover, the SUV was slowing down. Agatha pushed Alice off of herself and crawled forward to the middle seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Rio?” Jen asked, finding the driver’s seat empty as the SUV continued to slow and drive toward a grove of trees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed onto her chest, making the tether visible. She watched it stretched out in a line away from her getting thinner and thinner as it went. It seemed to still be stable and she was thankful she hadn’t also been yanked out of the windshield. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There!” Agatha pointed. In front of the SUV, a figure seemed to be flying very fast, had burst through the SUV and grabbed Rio, pulling her out of the car with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia grabbed the wheel and navigated them as far into a grove of trees in front of them as she could without being able to use the gas. Eventually, they stopped by hitting a tree, barely tapping it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone scrambled out of the SUV in a flurry. “What do we do?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stick to the plan,” Lilia stated, tucking the bag Rio had given her into her coat pocket. “We take care of the revenants. She takes care of the Other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a massive boom, and a spray of dirt and trees flew away from them, like a meteor had hit the ground a few hundred feet in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen hoisted the professional pesticide sprayer tank on her back and picked up the handle. “I hope this sprays really far away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stepped in front of her, summoning her spectral orange shield. “Me too.” She looked up at the cloud of revenants still flying toward them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha summoned her purple into both of her hands, ready to start blasting, but also listening to the fight Rio seemed to be having on the other side of the trees. She knew she was supposed to be on Team Revenant, but she was itching to run after Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incoming!” Alice yelled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen pointed the end of the pesticide sprayer, filled with her corporeal potion up at the approaching cloud. She pulled the trigger, bracing herself for some kind of kickback. A very gentle mist started spraying over them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sputtered, having gotten some in her mouth. “Disgusting. That tastes like old carrots.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want try that again?” Alice asked. “This time with magick?” She threw a blast out at a revenant that pushed the one back, but the rest were still rushing toward them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Jen put her finger on the trigger again and concentrated. She pulled the air around her down and into the liquid holding tank on her back. She pulled the trigger again and the potion started spraying outward like a firehose, creating a protective circle around the three of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The revenants ran right into the circle, the potion landing on them. Where it touched, the smoky spirits started to harden. Feathery outlines of faces and arms got hard and turned to stone. The weight of being corporeal seemed to pull them down toward the ground and slow their flying speed. Agatha and Alice started blasting, beams of orange and purple picking them off one at a time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Jen realized something was wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Three of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Three of them?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked around, continuing the spray of the cloud of revenants. “Where’s Lilia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the grove, somewhere between the rest of the coven fighting revenants and Rio fighting the Other, Lilia followed the small hand drawn map Rio had given her. It was filled with exactly the kind of details a normal, non-green witch would find extraneous. The trees and grass and rocks in the area were drawn in perfect number and shapes, and directions were dependent on that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She eventually came upon what she was supposed to find. There was an indention in the ground, a long oval of rocks protected by a tree that had fallen over it, but not landed on it. Like a moss covered tent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes, said a prayer to the Divine Mother, and extracted the components Rio had given her. She didn’t know who was under all of the rocks, but she prayed that the sigil would work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you tired?” the Other asked, looking at her fingers that had been sharpened to dangerous points. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, the gash on her stomach healing near instantaneously. “I just got here.” She ran a hand through her hair to get it out of her face and shrugged. “I mean, I’m a little bored.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other licked her bottom lip. “Why not let someone else take over? Dominion of the dead deserves a new queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw her head back and laughed. “Queen?” She slid her right foot back to ready for another attack. “You have a massive delusion of what my job is. I’m a glorified courier with a pretty set of keys.” She wagged her knife at the Other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other narrowed her eyes, her focus moving to the knife. “Doesn’t matter,” The Other raised her hands, dripping with a green sap, preparing for the next round of attacks. “The keys are mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio adjusted her grip on the knife. “You’ll have to kill me first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other grinned, canine fangs extending downward. “With pleasure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fighting had died down on one side of her as Lilia finished the sigil she had created with the powders Rio had given her. She finished the incantation when she heard footsteps raking through the leaves behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?!” Agatha bellowed. She tossed a blast directly at Lilia who threw her arms up to block it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were tears in Agatha’s eyes when she advanced on Lilia, ready to abandon all magick and throttle her with her bare hands. “Do you know whose grave that is?” Agatha demanded, having just realized herself a moment ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said it was for you,” Lilia took a step back, but was steadfast in her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha asked, stopping near Lilia, just out of arm's reach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia nodded. “She said you’d understand when it was all over.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over at the grave of her son that she had dug hundreds of years ago. It was mostly intact with a fallen tree protecting it. The rocks had just sunk down a bit into the ground. Now there was a sigil on top of it in colored powders and Lilia’s magick. She looked it over trying to decipher what it was for. “A-a stasis? What does that do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia shook her head. “She didn’t tell me why.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set her jaw and started to move toward the grave, intent on clearing off the powders and the magick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Lilia reached out and put her hand on Agatha’s that had just started to glow with purple. “I think you should trust her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know her,” Agatha dropped the magick and looked at Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you do,” Lilia smiled gently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed and wiped her eyes. She held Lilia’s eyes for a long moment before she heard Rio cackling in the distance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up. There was one person that could answer her questions. She took off, marching in the direction of the fight over the dominion over death, not entirely sure which side she would be joining when she got there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The field Rio and the Other were fighting in was mostly upturned dirt by the time Agatha got there. It looked like the entire place had been bombed for days. The Other ran up a small dirt hill, launched herself off of it and came down in a flurry of sharp finger blades and teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shoulder rolled out of the way, a puff of dirt coming up where the Other landed. The Other had pivoted to leap at Rio, but Agatha saw Rio see her out of the corner of her eye. They held each other’s eyes over the long distance, Agatha questioning and Rio resolute. In an instant before she could dodge out of the way of the aerial assault coming her way, Rio turned her knife outward and got the Other in the stomach as she landed on top of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio abandoned the knife, shouldered her off, and took a step away as the green sap from the Other started pouring out around where the knife was still protruding from the wound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other looked down like they couldn’t believe they’d been stabbed, then their shock faded into a deranged grin. She put both of her hands on the hilt of the knife and pulled it out of herself. Her wound oozed and she wavered but she didn’t seem to care. She was holding the knife like it was everything she’d ever wanted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And her first swipe was at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made the tether corporeal and yanked it, pulling Rio out of range of the blade. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So that’s how you did it,” the Other started floating, rising above the dirt. She set down near Agatha whose hands started glowing purple. The Other smiled serenely and looked at the blade in her hand again. “I’ll make you a deal.” She gestured to Agatha with the tip of it. “I’ll let you live </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> you get your pick of any spirit behind the veil.” She turned her arm to point the blade at what appeared to be a massive rift forming in the sky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wha-” Agatha started. She opened her mouth to speak again, but she couldn’t. “I-” It was a chance. It was a chance with Nicky. A chance to bring him back. She swallowed and looked at Rio who was on one knee from when Agatha had pulled her out of the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded once, keeping her eyes locked on Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was only a moment’s hesitation before Agatha released the tether, Rio fell to the ground, writhing again and screaming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Other started laughing maniacally, every mote of black and green that fell off of Rio was absorbed into her as the briar crown that would occasionally rest on Rio’s head started to form on hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rift in the sky started widening and very suddenly the bottom of it shot to the ground. Agatha could hear Rio screaming in agony. She could see her breaking up and floating away, absorbed by the new Green Witch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she heard him. An echo in her head. “Mama?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Agatha turned from the end of the battle in front of her and ran for the rift. When the ground under her started growing and shifting and decaying, she left her feet and started flying toward it. She could feel him. She used her mind to pull him to the surface. When she arrived at the rift a small, familiar hand reached through the veil and she grabbed it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second she grabbed it, a golden ball shot through the sky away from the rift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The grass and the trees all around were rapidly growing and decaying and dying. Flowers pushed through the dirt and withered nearly immediately. Everything was in a constant flux of life and death. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The hand in Agatha’s hand was gone, but she took off like a bullet, following the mote of gold, back toward the grove where she’d left Lilia. She could see everything around her growing and dying and blooming and decaying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was running in the opposite direction toward the fray, but Agatha paid her no mind. She could feel him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she landed, Lilia was digging in the dirt where the grave was. Everything inside of the sigil she had set was still blooming and growing. Agatha tore at the flowers and the vines, using magic to carefully sculpt away the dirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard him whimper in the dirt and finally reached in to pull him out. He was covered in dirt, but showed no signs of decay. He coughed and sputtered as she grabbed him, holding him close to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re alive,” she sobbed. She felt his arms encircle her as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He wiped his face off on her shoulder. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes and rocked him in her arms. She pulled away to look at his face. His perfect face. She pushed the dirty hair out of his eyes and hugged him again. “You’re okay. I’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything else faded around them. There was shrieking and explosions. There was a darkening sky and then a soft gentle rain started to fall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she had finally remembered there was a world outside of her arms, she looked around wondering if she needed to get Nicky to safety. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But when she looked around, she saw Lilia respectfully taking shelter a distance away under a tree and Jen moving to join her. Agatha looked past her and the rift in the sky was gone. She looked toward where she had left Rio screaming and in agony, but she couldn’t see it through the trees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you crying?” Nicky asked, looking at Agatha’s face. He took her face in his hands, her tears and the rain running between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m happy to see you,” she smiled and pulled him close again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard him inhale sharply a moment later. She looked up to see Alice propping up a very faint looking Rio. Her Death crown was firmly on her head and her knife in her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened?” Agatha stood up straight, keeping her hand on Nicky’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Death broke the rules,” Rio answered with a wry and tired smile. “So there had to be a new one.” She sheathed her knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a moment to process what had just happened. “You let her become Death so she would break the rules and -” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re here!” Nicky called, breaking away from Agatha to run to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let go of Alice and dropped to one knee to intercept him. He hugged her tight around the neck and she closed her eyes, tears leaking out of her bottom lashes. She held him around his back and squeezed him tight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you hurt?” he asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled and pulled him away, holding him at arm’s length to get a good look at him. “Not anymore.” She pulled him back in and kissed his forehead, then released him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He ran back to Agatha, hopping into her arms. “Are we sleeping out here tonight? I’m hungry.”</span>

<span>Months later, Nicky was standing in front of a glass case containing an old stone tablet. He looked at the plaque next to it and narrowed his eyes. “That’s not what it says.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have your Mother and Lilia been teaching you Sumerian?” Agatha asked, standing next to him, looking down at the artifacts housed behind the thick museum glass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky nodded. He looked up at her. “They said it was the last good language.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her hand on his shoulder and walked with him back toward the group. “Lilia isn’t even that old.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The museum docent looked at all of the little kids around her and smiled brightly, “Alright, we’re going to be moving on now to our new exhibit on clothing in the 1930s.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh,” Agatha muttered. “Worst decade for clothes.” When Nicky looked back at her, she put her hands up and mouthed, ‘Sorry.’ She slipped her hands into the pockets of her slacks and looked around the exhibits for anything that might have belonged to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course the only thing that belonged to her came striding her way wearing a gray suit and her hair pinned up in a loose bun. Agatha held her hand out and Rio stepped into it. Agatha pressed her hand to Rio’s back to pull her in for a quick greeting kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio put her hand on the top of Nicky’s head and dipped down to kiss him. He grinned up at her. “I read Sumarian.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned and looked over at Agatha like she got caught doing something she shouldn’t have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but couldn’t help a smile. “You’re both really lucky you’re cute.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen said looks aren’t luck. They’re mostly genetics and the right face wash,” Nicky looked up at both of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen’s not allowed to babysit anymore,” Agatha told Rio over Nicky’s head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Mrs. Harkness,” Nicky’s teacher walked up to them. “You made it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I’d swing by between meetings,” Rio smiled politely and shook her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well I’m glad you could come by,” she smiled as the group moved away. “I’m sure a professional historian such as yourself would have a lot of interesting things to add.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately,” Agatha put her hands on Rio’s arms. “She has to get to another meeting. Next time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, next time,” the teacher smiled. Then she nodded and walked off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you say we blow this popsicle stand and get some corndogs?” Agatha released Rio from her hold and looked at Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have to finish the tour with my class,” Nicky started inching toward the group of children who were running off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” Agatha asked. “This isn’t even the good stuff. Only idiots let their stuff end up in a museum.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded fervently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and watched him keep scooting away. “Fine. We’ll meet you at the gift shop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blew them both kisses and ran off after his class. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This school is a stupid idea,” Agatha turned to Rio and straightened her jacket lapels. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was his idea,” Rio put her hands on Agatha’s waist in the near empty exhibit hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned at Rio. “Well he’s seven and half you so he’d bound to have some bad ideas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and looked down, all of Agatha’s focus on her almost too much. “I almost let the end of the world happen one time…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled Rio a bit closer. “Wanna go make out next to that pitchfork I used to kill that constable in Concord four hundred years ago?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spun away from Agatha and took her hand, pulling her toward the exhibit. “I thought you’d never ask.”</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha walked into her house a few hours after a witch culling, all juiced up and nowhere to blast. But had promised a certain young boy everyone could have dinner together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she opened the door, a wave of sound hit her. She could hear a muffle basketball game on the only TV in the house. Lilia was speaking Italian. Jen was telling Lilia she doesn’t speak Italian. Alice asked, “Rio, do you have any basil?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like on my person?” Rio asked, incredulously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice seemed to pause. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause. “Oh look at that,” Rio seemed surprised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed and loud, tiny footsteps thundered toward the door. Nicky was holding a bundle of light purple sprigs with tiny flowers growing up and down both sides. “Mama!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha intercepted him with a big hug and smelled the flowers. “These are beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom made them,” he smiled up at her. “We’re having spaghetti.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We might be having spaghetti if Lilia stops criticizing me,” Alice called from the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You speak Italian?” Lilia asked, shocked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why wouldn’t I?” Alice asked back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and let Nicky lead her into the kitchen. They had had to get a bigger kitchen table since they decided to stay in the coven house they’d formed in. The tiny tube tv that had killed the previous owner of the house was on the kitchen counter, showing a blurry basketball game to Alice who was stirring sauce. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was sitting at the table, looking at her laptop and Lilia was hovering behind Alice. Rio was sitting at the table with a mug in her hand, her suit jacket tossed on the back of her chair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, someday I’ll come into my house and it’ll be quiet,” Agatha moved to stand next to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it was Rio’s house,” Alice offered, looking up from the basketball game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only legally because she’s the only one of us that has a legitimate job and provable income,” Jen replied, looking up from her laptop, “You know, besides…” She ran her thumb across her throat when Nicky wasn’t looking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They don’t just give these mugs out to anyone,” Rio looked up at Agatha and took a sip from the mug in her hand, showing the front of it that said, </span>
<em>
<span>#1 Daddy</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned over and whispered to Rio. “Don’t make me kill you in front of your son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled and used the proximity to sneak a kiss. “You can’t kill me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll see about that,” Agatha’s threat dissipated with the kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still have my shop,” Lilia replied. “That is provable income.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen blinked and looked at Lilia. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia rolled her eyes. “Not much, but it’s there.” She found Nicky in the chaos of the kitchen. “You want to help set the table?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Nicky bounced over to help Lilia carry plates and silverware to the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took Agatha’s hand and pulled her into her lap. Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s shoulders and rested her head on Rio’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’d it go?” Rio asked casually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As planned,” Agatha watched Nicky walk very slowly with three plates in his arms so she didn’t drop them. When he made it to the table, she sat up and looked at Rio. “How’s your normal job?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I keep forgetting to go,” Rio shrugged. “But they think I’m on an archeological dig or something.” She looked at Nicky and then back at Agatha. “I stashed some Danish king’s stuff in a bear cave a while ago. I’ll go get it next week.” She paused. “Have you thought about the other thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio warningly. “It’s dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll both be there,” Rio replied. “We can all be there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flexed her jaw and looked at Rio. Then she looked at Nicky. She looked back at Rio. “Fine. But if anything happens to him, I get to flay you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes at Rio. “You’re a bad influence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is he going to be a proper witch without knowing how?” Rio asked back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha kissed her quickly and stood up. “Some of us didn’t have proper coven upbringings and didn’t learn to hexenbesen until being chased out of Swansea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hexenbesen?” Alice perked up at the word, stopping her stirring. “Are we doing it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone’s eyes snapped to Agatha and the room was quiet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After dinner,” Agatha announced to the room. “If everyone is up for it, we are going to take Nicky on his first hexenbesen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was an explosion of excitement from the rest of the coven. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s flying?” his eyes got wide after he caught several pieces of several different stories about what they were about to do. He looked to his Mama. “Mama? It’s flying?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t stop a smile at his excitement. She nodded, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He thrusted both of his fists up in the air, “Yes!”</span>
